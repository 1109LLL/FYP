286466,Hotel Pulitzer, It was a little noisy but we were near Las Ramblas intentionally Only minor issue is that doors to room let in hallway noise But it was quiet at night and so we has no trouble sleeping , Staff was amazing Location was also great 
286467,Hotel Pulitzer, Checking in was a nightmare forced to wait after a long exhausting journey for two extra hours in the lobby to get the room I booked a month earlier Still didn t get what I exactly booked at the end Desk staff made me feel that they are doing me a favour getting the room I purchased ready despite the additional waiting time Also when I booked online using booking com the site said good breakfast Nothing of the sort just basic and very limited cold breakfast that costs around 15 euros per person I must mention here though that the hotel has a very nice breakfast area , Central Location airport transport using Aerobus 5 20 euro drops you off within 50 m from hotel terraced bar second to none good room facilities 
286468,Hotel Pulitzer, Strange phone call asking if we threw a glass from our balcony thought it may have been a prank so rang down to reception but turns out it was legitimate Hotel didn t even provide real glass in the room so not sure what that was about but it was quite disruptive , Amazing location right in the centre with shops and restaurants just a stone throw away Tried the restaurant where the food was amazing and the rooftop terrace bar was good fun with a DJ playing some funky house music 
286469,Hotel Pulitzer, Restaurant closed on night of our arrival Not able to use rooftop bar 2 nights of 3 night stay Staff using cupboard next to room all hours very noisy ,No Positive
286470,Hotel Pulitzer, I wish there was a pool , The staff went out of their way to help with any requests The room was lovely and spacious and the bar restaurant roof terrace were really cool and well done A really enjoyable stay 
286471,Hotel Pulitzer, The door to our room firstly we were traveling with a 20 month old little boy and he was able to open the door and leave the room at any time because of how low the handle was , Prior to the trip I was emailing the hotel regarding out stay I would just like to say they answered my emails extremely fast They were able to arrange a hotel transfer When we arrived at the hotel the staff were amazing and helpful I would suggest eating in the gothic quarter and not near the hotel as the food is better 
286472,Hotel Pulitzer, Paying extra for eggs at breakfast after paying 17 for the normal breakfast No desk and chair in the room Minimal noise proofing rather loud Small window looking into an air vent so no natural light Too expensive for what it turns out is a mediocre tourist hotel, Location was great
286473,Hotel Pulitzer, None, Close to Pla a de Catalunya within 1 min walking distance Most local tours and 3 hop on hop off buses station Very convenient The front desk staffs are very helpful and friendly Help us to book a local restaurant that we could not communicate 
286474,Hotel Pulitzer, Beware the bathroom our bath had no handles to lift yourself up and the edges of the bath were quite high Slippery tiles on wall floor take care The coffee system was utterly hopeless You have to queue up to put your cup under a machine to get coffee sometimes up to 4 or 6 people waiting The machine was dirty and dusty on top Very disappointed Why can t they bring a pot of coffee to your table I don t drink coffee caffeine and when you pressed the hot water button on the machine to use a herbal tea bag the spout gave out water with coffee grinds in it so you had to do several times , Location excellent staff helpful
286475,Hotel Pulitzer, The rooms are small we walked into our room to find a cockroach running around The staff moved us to a better room one with a balcony The lift was broken also so it took ages to wait for the other lift the outside garden was out of action as they were doing work so some facilities were not on hand we loved our trip very much but slightly concerned about cockroach if wanted to come back But for the price it was not on point enough , Location was very good staff were also helpful always happy to help Breakfast the roof bar was very good 
286476,Hotel Pulitzer, Breakfast poor for the price No service Get own coffee from machine make your own toast Lighting in room confusing and no reading light , Bed very comfortable Space around wash basin Liked having a little balcony Rooftop terrace a bonus 
286477,Hotel Pulitzer, Breakfast was bad Air con was bad Not good value for what we paid No security card in elevator so anyone can access floors We paid e xtra for a balcony and breakfast and both were disappointing Not an actual balcony For the price I would stay elsewhere , Location good Nice rooftop patio
286478,Hotel Pulitzer, We asked for a bandaid at the front desk the reception clerk suggested we go to the pharmacy Asked the housekeeping cleaning the room for additionalmilk cream for coffee she informed me she would have to ask management Anyway we didn t get any , Breakfast excellent
286479,Hotel Pulitzer, I loved everything Only thing I could have done with is some hot plates at breakfast eggs etc , Everything was really modern and clean but also felt fancy without being overdone It was very classy and an excellent location 
286480,Hotel Pulitzer, The breakfast at EU 16 50 pp for what is only little better than a continenal breakfast is too expensive Eggs were available but at extra charge Also the layout of the breakfast bar was difficult i e try accessing the cereal jars And the post in the centre of the bar made access difficult ,No Positive
286481,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing, We had an amazing time so close to everything staff where so lovely and helpful really enjoyed breakfast beds very nice just loved it and so happy I picked your lovely hotel thanks heaps 
286482,Hotel Pulitzer, The roof terrace while quite nice was hot hot hot The pictures on the website made it look like it had great views over Barcelona but they were really only views of the street next door , The location was terrific very close to the Plaza Catalonya The hotel is in a quiet street with easy access to La Rambla the main tourist street They provided us with a free walking tour as well 
286483,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The overall experience was brilliant We had a long day of travel to get to the hotel and when we arrived we immediately were impressed and happy with the hotel Our stay was relaxing even though we had to be on the move again the next day 
286484,Hotel Pulitzer, The roof terrace was always full so not always available to hotel guests Not really a problem as could have a drink downstairs not to mention a lot of places within walking distance of the hotel , The staff especially on reception were very friendly and helpful The hotel had a relaxed atmosphere but was obviously very efficiently run 
286485,Hotel Pulitzer, Our first night the music from the rooftop bar was a bit loud and we were surprised the music continued to play after midnight Although there were two chairs in the room they weren t great for relaxing nor was there a desk , Excellent location so it was easy to walk to many of the sites and easy to access the metro Also key was that it was on a quieter side street Front desk staff was also excellent friendly welcoming and helpful Hotel was small so it never seemed busy 
286486,Hotel Pulitzer, facilities restaurant roof terrace etc were unavailable to regular guest much of the time because of having been booked for conferance use , Very helpful staff who recommended good local resturants 
286487,Hotel Pulitzer, The layout open central courtyard of the hotel made the rooms noisy at times particularly at night and early morning when staff were moving things around eg supplies into the restaurant Also the bathroom was very small and the layout was somewhat awkward , The breakfast buffet included with our room reservation was great and the rooftop bar was a really nice location for a drink before dinner Staff were very helpful with directions dinner reservations etc Balconies although very small on the rooms were a nice bonus 
286488,Hotel Pulitzer, The breakfast couldn t compare to the small cafe at the end of block next to Starbuck s so why go to the chain It was too expensive for nothing particularly fabulous , First off the hotel room and service was wonderful And we couldn t have asked for a better location It s right off the Plaza de Catalunya so close to everything We opted for a balcony which was tiny but lovely Even though the location was so near the center of everything the street was quiet Americans might find the room small but Europeans won t and it really did have great use of space and with the balcony and large doors it was light and airy The shower was big enough with copious pressure and hot water I liked that there was a water pot for coffee and tea in the room as well as small water bottles daily The staff at the front desk were a font of knowledge and advice with maps and the ability to book us directly themselves saving us time We were able to take advantage of the Vermuts DJ on the patio on a lovely Saturday and we can t recommend the experience enough Great tapas and drinks and some nice background EDM All in all we had the best time and highly recommend this hotel We would definitely stay here again We loved every moment of it 
286489,Hotel Pulitzer, Something a bit bizzare but it ocured on 3 out of 4 nights we stayed there a neighbor ordered dinner with room service and took the dishes out after they were done and put them in the hallway of out floor in the evening It stayed there until the next morning I think there might be a method to take things out of the way quicker Room form is a bit bizzare but in general comfy Not for long in hotel stays great for sleep , Location is great facilities are comfortable 
286490,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Apart from being comfortable centrally located and distinctively looking it really is the youthful international staff that breathes an air of welcoming trust From the receptionists to the bartenders the waiters to the housekeepers interaction was always courteous helpful and fun Thank you for caring 
286491,Hotel Pulitzer, I d booked a room with a double bed but when we arrived they only had a room with twin beds but they gave us a room with a balcony to make up for it , Fantastic location friendly staff lovely roof terrace
286492,Hotel Pulitzer, Our room was very narrow We did not have enough space to open up our suitcases The lighting system was kind of bizarre in the room No need to be this complicated , We had a complimentary bottle of water everyday The breakfast room was spacious and beautiful like the dining room of yr own house The lobby was great We spent some hours there every day The beautiful bouquet of flowers in the lobby was spectacular 
286493,Hotel Pulitzer, We were on the front on the street so at night there was some noise But I m being picky , Everything Amazing service facilities and location Will definitely be coming back
286494,Hotel Pulitzer, Breakfast was too few choices Room rate was bit over priced , Friendly and helpful staffs who tried very hard to explain in details in English They always directed us the easiest ways to our destinations Very humorous 
286495,Hotel Pulitzer, Staff was nice and spoke good English but it was clear they were not well trained and did not know the hotel policies Three incidents with the front desk First when we arrived over Easter weekend we asked if there were any parades going on and when they didn t know they proceeded to make us wait for 5 minutes while they literally Googled the answer in front of us If you don t know something just say it I can google things for myself Second We were told that the roof top terrace closes at 8PM which is kind of silly since dinner in Spain starts around 9 or 10PM The front desk informed us that while the terrace BAR closes at 8PM we could order drinks at the normal hotel bar open at reasonable hours and bring it up to the terrace 24h a day This of course is not true and it took some back and forth with the bartender and the front desk person to clear it up Third We were told our breakfast was included with our stay We ate breakfast 2 of the 3 days it was decent and there was never anyone keeping track of room numbers or any way to get a paper bill The third day as we were checking out we mentioned we d be getting breakfast and the person at the front desk informed us he was going to charge us 16 euro for it I told him that when we checked in they said breakfast was included in the stay and we had been eating there with no problems the other two days and all he said was he wouldn t charge us for the other two days What a nice guy The final thing to fix is that we got a paper of all the hotel amenities and in black white it says gym with indoor pool I m not sure how this gets lost in translation but there is no pool and we got looked at like idiots for asking where the pool was All that being said the accommodations in the hotel were fine But my note to management would be to get all your front desk staff on the same page , Great location good sized bathrooms modern look feel 
286496,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The staff in the hotel were great Lots of helpful advice for my sons who were going to a concert the reason for our brief visit to Barcelona The restaurant staff were also very accommodating when we wanted food both in the little courtyard and later when we ordered room service The rooms were a little small tho perfectly good for me as I was in a single My sons were in a bigger room My room had a balcony overlooking the street but traffic noises weren t too bad at all The bathroom had a shower preferable to a bath I always feel The tiles in the bathroom are gorgeous and take bathroom use to a different level delightful We had breakfast in a restaurant a few steps from the hotel great staff fun vibe good food The public spaces are welcoming and generous with sofas chairs tables aplenty and very comfortable The little patio at the back is sweet and good for coffees or meals Our flight was not til later in the afternoon and the staff were happy to keep our luggage safely tucked away til our departure I m so happy I chose this hotel as it is also right in the heart of everywhere one wants to go in Barcelona 
286497,Hotel Pulitzer, Liked everything , Wonderful location just off the Plaza Catalunia the heartbeat of Barcelona A beautiful modern hotel Near everything including all transportation 
286498,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The Hotel s signature fragrance which is circulated through the air conditioning adds a sophisticated ambience The breakfast offers a high quality wide selection The Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly
286499,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The staff were really helpful and friendly the room was really nice and clean The roof terrace was a great addition to the hotel We found the lounge and bar area a pleasant area and enjoyed evenings there especially the special cocktails We would love to go back It was really handy for the Aerobus from the airport and getting to the Metro the staff advised on the best tickets and offered to book tickets if needed 
286500,Hotel Pulitzer, The shower is over the bath Standing in it for an older person was a high risk It needs a handle to hold on to and a non slip mat or surface to avoid falls , The clean linen 
286501,Hotel Pulitzer, The bathrooms need descaling The black marble shows up lime scale deposits and was evident on the shower floors and basins , Warm reception staff and decent public area Roof top terrace bar would have been nice if it was open to serve drinks perhaps seasonal as there was work going on preparing it 
286502,Hotel Pulitzer, Our room definitely needed some repairs and bathroom door hardly could close , Staff is excellent and it is as close to the center as possible but in a quiet street Breakfast is great and so is the lobby
286503,Hotel Pulitzer, The room was small dirty and old the staff responded to our insatisfaction by giving us a better room but it was not much different The rooftop was not open make sure you check with hotel before booking , Location was fantastic 
286504,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing would definitely go back, Lovely boutique hotel with the most amazing smell when you walk in The staff were very friendly Bar area very comfortable 
286505,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Perfect location close to main attractions We did everything by foot Lots of good restaurants near by The staff is super friendly The breakfast was good rooms are comfy and really in good taste Definitely come back when in Barcelona
286506,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Fantastic location located in a very central location and you can walk to all tourist sights from the hotel Also very close to the airport drop off bus so makes getting to and from the airport easy 
286507,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Absolutely beautiful hotel can t fault it Beautiful rooms and roof top terrace is a special touch Breakfast worth every penny always choose Pulitzer if you re staying in Barcelona perfectly located aswell Until next time 
286508,Hotel Pulitzer, Long thin room was a bit non descript but served a purpose and was clean practical Could have maybe done with an iron but didn t ask reception so not sure if they offer them , Great service and friendly staff The breakfast was more than sufficient with continental and cooked breakfast offered definitely set me up for the Barcelona Half Marathon The bath was also very welcome after the race Staff were also very helpful with recommendations of restaurants 
286509,Hotel Pulitzer, poor choice of breakfast dishes no proper tortilla no jamon iberico this is a MUST for luxury Spanish hotels they had just horrible processed ham no fresh tomato pulp also a must in Spain breakfast staff were indifferent, reception staff helpful friendly
286510,Hotel Pulitzer, I did not have enough time to enjoy it all , I loved the easy access to everything Barcelona offers the best of the old world and the new world With great friendly caring people who take great pride in their city I highly recommend it for shooping culture history and of course great food 
286511,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing, The staff in reception were excellent and incredibly helpful and had some great suggestions for tours and places to visit The location of the hotel was also very central and made it easy to get around 
286512,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Amazing experience Modern and artistic interior friendly and helpful stuff pretty room with wonderful view delicious breakfast and stunning rooftop terrace What s more the bed and pillows could not be more comfortable Location of the hotel is also great right at Plaza Catalunya close to all bars shops and restaurants When I will go to Barcelona I will definitely choose Hotel Pulitzer again 
286513,Hotel Pulitzer, In the street side it is a bit noisy at night, The design and atmosphere in the hotel is very nice causy while modern at the same time and it is very well located
286514,Hotel Pulitzer, With the price they charged on breakfast I would expect at least a freshly brewed coffee instead of a machine one And the quality is very bad Can have more serving staff during breakfast Room is small but comfortable Very noisy during the night for the rooms closer to the staircase , Very clean good location nice smell friendly staff modern decor
286515,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The location is perfect excellent staff at reception very helpful with all our luggage etc beautiful interior design very comfi rooms good quality coffee at the bar nice selection cocktails fresh juices We ll be back again 
286516,Hotel Pulitzer, The weather but not the hotels fault we arrived in January but still had a great time , The location is right in the centre of Barcelona we used the hotel has a base to explore the city and it is ideal for such a holiday The staff were very friendly and helpful 
286517,Hotel Pulitzer, The breakfast is above average in terms of the choices available but they cook for you on demand at no cost I cannot ask for anything from this hotel though , The hotel is just 1 minute walk to Plaza De Catalunya You save a lot of time in mandatory commute and choose to do what you want to do You save easily 1 day every 3 days that you stay in Barcelona if you stay at this hotel The staff is extremely friendly and of help 
286518,Hotel Pulitzer, That we had to go back home , Just returned from a romantic stay in January This hotel is fantastic impossible to fault it Fabulous location 20 steps and your on placa catlunya square and few metres from las ramblas too Hotel staff are incredibly accommodating even left us a slice of birthday cake for my boyfriends birthday and had a room with a great view from the balcony even if it was a little cool temperature wise D Spotless and grand interior decor honestly cannot fault it fabulous romantic weekend away don t hesitate just book it 
286519,Hotel Pulitzer, Refurbishment taking place and the fact you need to go to sister hotel next door if you want breakfast Personally I would not pay 16 for the inconvenience , Exceptional staff Excellent Bath in bathroom This hotel will be nice when it s finished with the refurbishment 
286520,Hotel Pulitzer, Perhaps some heat lamps on the rooftop terrace Also for the terrace to be open for longer and to serve hot drinks , All the staff were very welcoming and provided excellent customer service We were well looked after and thoroughly enjoyed our stay Fantastic location 
286521,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, The whole experience Fantastic location with only 2 min walk to La Rambla It is a cosie intimate hotel with a understated and lovely style Very good room with great art and very comfortable bed and well appointed bathroom 
286522,Hotel Pulitzer, free wifi was great but did drop in and out Also a fair bit of noise from the hallway could be heard in the room of an evening that may be because of the kids running up and down the hall , Great central location with easy access to all the tourist spots 
286523,Hotel Pulitzer, There are some renovation works on some of the floors that create noise and some dust Breakfast is too expensive for what it is There is no gym inside and they offer you not a very interesting rate to go to one of the affiliated gyms , Location is perfect close to main attractions and few steps away from Paseig de Gracia and Las Ramblas The lobby area is very comfortable and nice to have coffee and tea and open almost 24 7 Rooms are quite spacious and generally clean Beds are quite comfortable 
286524,Hotel Pulitzer, Breakfast was exactly I mean exactly the same for all our duration of the stay Room was very small expected bigger rooms based on the photos we see , The location was phenomenal absolutely buzzy area open till very late at night Staff was of great assistance well informed 
286525,Hotel Pulitzer, Anyone who is over 6ft will suffer in the small beds Bathroom is a bit on the dark side Landing carpet is a bit threadbare, The staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel was well positioned for all the sites
286526,Hotel Pulitzer, Low water pressure Breakfast variety dont update Some of the staff know only basic in English so some of the answers were way off, Perfect location Nice breakfast Room are not too big but include all you need
286527,Hotel Pulitzer, Very noisy from private party in outside area at 1am On request through staff the quietened immediately but resumed Couldn t open windows or doors to outside , Lovely room spotless bathroom great bed and shower relaxing ambience in bar area great staff Location perfect 
286528,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Went to Barcelona for a weekend break The location was amazing The hotel itself was quiet and very modern The roof top terrace was a very welcome surprise I would definitely go back and recommend 
286529,Hotel Pulitzer, Rooms were not great A little run down , Location was great but the hotel it self was a little run down of you ask me Was here 5y ago much better then Guess they need to redecorate a bit Roof top bar was and still is amazing
286530,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing, Great location helpful staff we arrived early but they gave us a room since they understand that my baby need a rest flexible and principle centered
286531,Hotel Pulitzer, Would like to hv luggage stand in the room, Location quality of room when compared with hotels in same price range in same locality hype n modern fill
286532,Hotel Pulitzer, Wooden floors meant some noise could be heard from other rooms, Staff friendly and helpful room tastefully furnished and facilities excellent superb value for such a central location 
286533,Hotel Pulitzer, For a person reserving a double room they provided twin beds ridiculous Room very small and missing a small desk at least Poor lighting Complementary water only when checked in , Location is central Reception staff very friendly and helpful 
286534,Hotel Pulitzer, Not clean Old and used furniture needs painting Needs a renewal and its a nice hotel You can hear all kind of noises from other rooms and from the cleaning personel The counter all shabby what else , Location The bar and living room
286535,Hotel Pulitzer, Although days were warm nIghts were cold but the duvet was very thin and there was no extra blanket available , Superb location in quiet street Comfortable exta wide bed but shorter than standard length The bar area was very comfortable and the staff very welcoming Rooftop terrace also very good but only offers service at the weekend in winter 
286536,Hotel Pulitzer, There was no liquid hand washing soap in the bathroom only a miniature size bath soap and the bathroom floor tiles were in need of renovation , Excellent breakfast Very polite helpful staff Bar served the best sangria prepared by Gyuliana Daily room service Central and close to buses shops restaurants shuttle service to airport Reception staff were very helpful with information on local transport and provided us with maps We arrived a couple of hours before check in time prepared to just leave our luggage and return later but Casper managed to get us checked in almost immediately 
286537,Hotel Pulitzer, NO Comment, everything here was brilliant and couldn t fault anything We didn t have breakfast so I am unable to comment on that part But I would stay here again without a doubt and have already recommended to friends 
286538,Hotel Pulitzer, Room was smaller than expected no view I from web site bigger The room facilities Could be better , Staff and overall ambience were excellent Great reception and door staff 
286539,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, We enjoyed the roof top bar and the ground floor garden bar The location was perfect for walking to many sights including the Barcelona Cathedral La Rambla Gaudi buildings 
286540,Hotel Pulitzer, Layout of the room post in the middle of the room tricky at night Poor double glazing Could hear every noise at night despite being on 4th floor Bar was closed on the roof one of the reasons we booked this hotel , Location Bed Inside bar The smell in the entrance 
286541,Hotel Pulitzer, Poor coordination among staff Nothing is lacking but there is nothing particularly outstanding Expected more at 400euros per night , Friendly staff Generous gin and tonic portions 
286542,Hotel Pulitzer, The hotel rate was priced a little high , The hotel staff was fantastic and very helpful The hotel location is perfect The room was wonderful and the decor was modern and quite comfortable 
286543,Hotel Pulitzer, No view , Not the best room location but someone had to have it Great rooftop deck wonderful staff Good food I would definitely stay there again 
286544,Hotel Pulitzer, We stayed there because of the roof terrace It was a dissapointment as it was hugely understaffed resulting in 20 min wait for a drink and sitting surrounded by dirty food plates as tables were not cleared ,No Positive
286545,Hotel Pulitzer, Disappointed that rooftop bar was so crowded so had to resort to ground level bar for my light meal after travelling direct from Australia Had been pining dinner with a view and some fresh air , Breakfast choices were varied and plentiful 
286546,Hotel Pulitzer, not much entertainment in room we were only served once with complementary waters the queen size beds are a bit big for the room perhaps use of softer pillows , location was excellent staff were very helpful the shower was very good very effective room lighting loved the lounge 
286547,Hotel Pulitzer, tiny rooms average breakfast staff ok not over friendly watery cocktails no swimming pool or gym despite pictures on website and then had to pay extra to visit Holmes Place, location
286548,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing really , The location of the hotel was absolutely terrific The rooms were squeaky clean the beds comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful Lovely breakfasts 
286549,Hotel Pulitzer, I think compared with others it was a bit expensive but it deserved that , Its location is great the stuff was helpful and overall I strongly recommend this hotel for all 
286550,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, easy to walk to most of the areas Easy access to metro and airport bus good breakfast and luxuriously comfortable area for sitting and having a drink from the attractive bar 
286551,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, I travelled with my mum who has mobility difficulties The staff couldn t have been kinder and there were no issues with storing the mobility scooter we d hired at the hotel We would definitely stay there again and I would recommend the hotel to friends 
286552,Hotel Pulitzer, The quality of the breakfast was poor compared to other Spanish hotels we have stayed in , The hotel decor and design Also the bed was very comfortable 
286553,Hotel Pulitzer, Roof bar absolutely packed and not enough staff We were told to get in line so decided to go downstairs to the lounge bar , Fantastic location ideal for everything in Barcelona The staff at reception were all very professional and delightful I liked the boutique feel of the hotel 
286554,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Great service staff very friendly spoke excellent English as our Spanish is non existent Loved cocktails at the roof terrace bar Loads of choice at breakfast Great location just of Playa Catalunya Very central 
286555,Hotel Pulitzer, What I didn t like people forgething that u treat them nice like no other tourist trying to give them presents and treat them friendlly but when they received orders not to smile anymore they changed their attitude in front of you , Doesn t a 4 star hotel have to have gym right Because here u had to walk 1km and pay even extra like 15euro feeling guilty if u ever forget the voucher What I loved the attitude of the manager that really knows how to treat the customers that stayed like 2 months in the hotel and telling them that booking com its the most important for them not the customer curious what kind of school she made U should give her a bonus and hire her at booking she is very loyal at everything means money 
286556,Hotel Pulitzer, There are much tourists staying here asking lots of questions about sightseeing etc restaurant bookings And since the reception desk staffs are so friendly they try to help as good as possible Which makes the waiting time for check in and check out to long since both of them are occupied with doing tourist service And they pick up the phone simultaneously A concierge would be advisable or a work procedure that 1 staff is checking guests in and out while the other guy do the tourist information This is a managerial item , Very friendly and welcoming reception staffs room spacious and well sound isolated good aircon Nice breakfast I stay in this hotel since its opening many years ago im always happy 
286557,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Excellent location walking distance to all the main sites and shopping areas in Barcelona The hotel was lovely room and bathroom were spacious and we loved the rooftop bar in the evenings We didn t arrive to check in until after midnight and were greeted by a lovely guy on reception with no issues similarly they were more than happy to look after our bags for the day as we didn t fly out until late I d definitely recommend this hotel if you are visiting 
286558,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, We had a really enjoyable stay at hotel Pulitzer While the hotel is just around the corner from Placa de Catalunya we found the hotel very quiet and relaxing we even had a window open during the night without any noise problems The interior and facilities are excellent and staff very helpful and friendly One person in our group had her birthday during our stay and the staff brought her a really tasty warm brownie The rooftop terrace is a really nice place to have a drink 
286559,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing to critique , Great central location Everything is walking distance Close proximity to metro station for access to beaches and other tourist destinations The rooftop bar was divine Amazing views Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with information 
286560,Hotel Pulitzer, We loved everything Just a little tip to guests who intend to rent the bikes the ones at the hotel don t come with a lock A very kind receptionist employee however informed us that we can reserve bikes with them via a local Bike Shop which gives you a 10 discount So we paid 9EUR per person for 4 hours of exploring the city on bikes with locks , The location is superb A short minute walk to Las Ramblas and Placa de la Catalunya About a 20 25minute drive with the Airport Shuttle from the Airport and the bus stops a 3 minute walk away from the hotel The staff was extremely welcoming and very helpful for us to find our way around The rooftop bar was also great with nice music and cozy atmosphere We had a standard double room which was very spacious and tidy We would definitely come back here again 
286561,Hotel Pulitzer, It was all great , Loved the roof bar and the restaurant Very pleasant hotel and location is superb Would definitely recommend it to anyone whos going for a vacay to Barcelona Also Guillmero at the front desk was very helpful and welcoming Really appreciated that 
286562,Hotel Pulitzer, wifi was intermitting weak the hotel is little bit expensive, The hotel was really good the design of the rooms was nice despite that it looks little bit old the smell of the hotel and reception area is wonderful the hotel has its own perfume that we bought later on The receptionists were super kind and helpful especially Daniel in the morning and the other Daniel on night they were very polite and helpful 
286563,Hotel Pulitzer, The size of the rooms are a bit small , The hotel in nice and the staff are friendly and always helpful The hotel is strategically located in the city center which made very convenient for us to move around 
286564,Hotel Pulitzer, I don t like that an iron and ironing board aren t kept in room Staff very helpful in bringing one up for quick use though , The lobby lounge with bar was a very comfortable place to sit and catch your breath from sightseeing or shopping Loved the roof top bar as well which is used by guests and visitors Great location Staff very friendly and helpful 
286565,Hotel Pulitzer, There Are not so many faciliti es internally no gym etc , I liked the building and the rooms are very spacious and modern The interiors are very well maintained Very nice breakfast 
286566,Hotel Pulitzer, It is a pity that you still have to pay for a visit to a gym if you want to swim e g It was not cheap p p and it actually should be included Though I understand that you ask a small amount but not EUR 14 p p , The room the service the breakfast friendly and very friendly staff 
286567,Hotel Pulitzer, Had a problem with my room when the aircon system leaked but hotel staff quickly attended to our problem and moved us to a new room , Staff was very attentive helpful and courteous Management offered us breakfast for problems caused by leaking aircon Location was good with nearby shopping restaurants and sightseeing 
286568,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Very nice interior style Loved it Roomy accommodation and nice large bathroom Staff very professional and helpful Excellent location very central and right off the main tourist areas from Las Ramblas to high end shopping 
286569,Hotel Pulitzer, The staff were unhelpful terse slow unprofessional I experienced sleepless nights with failing air con and loud noises at all hours through paper thing walls a waitress blowing her nose in the kitchen at breakfast Three times with the final insult wiping it with her hand I had an argument with the assistant manager about my disappointment in the lack of communication from his staff in making a reservation at a restaurant if you can t do it just tell us and we ll make alternate arrangements this went on for three days He stood over me at the front desk saying he thought it was fair that they have changed their advice four times regarding whether we had the booking or not I m not confrontational but he was out of line and beyond unhelpful If you like being looked after when you re in a five star hotel beware , The breakfast is great value for money The interior design is lovely 
286570,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing, Fantastic buffet breakfast great bar upstairs and down Staff efficient and helpful in their advice Walking distance to restaurants shops and the hop on hop off bus and some major attractions
286571,Hotel Pulitzer, The buffet breakfast was disappointing , The staff were extremely helpful The accommodation was excellent The location ideal The Terrace bar a relaxing water hole after a hectic day and before the evening entertainment
286572,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, We liked everything about this hotel Location short walk to Plaza de catalunya 2 minutes walk from metro citytour buses Fnac bookshop restaurants and cafes very central for sightseeing too 10 min walk from cathedral and palau de musica amazing modernist building at least as beautiful as the Sagrada Familia 
286573,Hotel Pulitzer, Floorboards a little creeky, Excellent location plentiful breakfast served with both indoor and outdoor seating Comfortable room with storage for suitcases
286574,Hotel Pulitzer, Breakfast buffet could have made to order eggs and add cappuccino to the coffee machine Rooms need a luggage stand so you don t have to put suitcases on floor , The staff was very friendly and heplful Although the rooms were small the twin beds were extremely comfortable The air conditioning worked great and we slept well Peaceful too Our room faced back courtyard on first floor Breakfast buffet was slightly above average Location is fantastic 2 doors to square All the bus tours start here 
286575,Hotel Pulitzer, Can t think of anything that merits a negative comment, Very helpful and friendly staff Hotel is in an excellent location close to many shops bars and restaurants 
286576,Hotel Pulitzer, Rooms look old and the floor making creaking sound Room amenities and breakfast could have been better , Outstanding location Very convenient peaceful and centrally located All major attractions in the walking distance of the hotel Reception staff very courteous and helpful
286577,Hotel Pulitzer, There was construction next door and nobody informed us about that Noise started about 7 30 am When we asked for a late check out staff was very inflexible and denied even 1 extra hour , Location was great as just outside Plaza Catalunya Room was cozy and nice bed and bathroom 
286578,Hotel Pulitzer, Mini bar in our room was very inefficient Barely cooling anything at all , A wide variety of choices for breakfast Breads were awesome Location can t be better Decent and free Wi Fi Nice room Free you have to tip the guide walking city tours twice a day Kind staff 
286579,Hotel Pulitzer, Roof top bar is open to the public and on wed thur Friday nights they have a dj carnt move in the place and with the bar on the 6 floor and our room on the 3rd floor could still hear the music also can hear people out in the hallway coming and going, Good location friendly staff
286580,Hotel Pulitzer, Showers should be improved im convinced that the water system is pretty old Some staff especially trainees were amazing yet some were not helfpful at all , Amazing location nice modern design comfortable rooms 
286581,Hotel Pulitzer, The air conditioning in the room was not working properly and on the ground floor the terrace was full of smokers that precluded us using it , The hotel was in a prime location with good facilities and excellent staff
286582,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Pulitzer Hotel is a perfect choice for a stay in Barcelona Service is excellent rooms are modern beds are comfortable and surprisingly quiet in the cernter of the city The breakfast is excellent At Pulitzer you are close to all the main tourist attractions and shopping sites Airport bus stop is 100 metres and taxi station at the front of the hotel The walking tours and other tourist tours leave from Plaza Catalunya I warmly recommend this hotel to all who wish a modern and confortable stay in the Center of Barcelona 
286583,Hotel Pulitzer, No outside pool or terrace with sunbeds, Very comfortable rooms Amazing rooftop terrace where you can have food and drinks Great atmosphere in the hotel
286584,Hotel Pulitzer, We had a room facing the street and every morning at 4am the garbage truck would wake us up , The staff were very helpful the location was fantastic and the rooftop bar was lovely 
286585,Hotel Pulitzer, Very poor breakfast small choice coffee and tea self service via a machine No proper desk in the room so was tricky to organize our things Rooms a bit worn out , Very central location very nice modern reception area lovely to sit to have a drink coffee tea Rooms were quite spacious for Europe Perfect for younger travelers 
286586,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Pulitzer is a great find The location is extremely central just 2 minutes across the square from the aerobus stop which makes it easy from the airport It is located on plaza Catalunya at at the top of las ramblas The hotel rooftop bar is one of the best we found in Barcelona with an awesome vibe and many locals coming for drinks The lounge in the lobby area is a great place to relax after a busy day walking The restaurant serves brekfast and lunch which were both great The lunch menu was a set menu for 12 or 15 euros and the food was exceptional Have the melon and mint soup The rooms are modern and spacious by European standards 
286587,Hotel Pulitzer, The roof top bar staff needs to improve a little bit on attention and friendliness, Location breakfast super comfortable bed friendliness of staff at check in counter
286588,Hotel Pulitzer, nothing everything was perfect , amaaazing location all the shops stores close by great restaurants close by too staff was amazing at the hotel and house keeping was excellent 
286589,Hotel Pulitzer, Several things were in need of repair 1 power plug did not work and the toilet flusher was also broken The bed was deemed a queen sized bed but our feet hung off the end of the bed and we are short people The room was very narrow so perhaps the bed was rotated to fit the room , The best feature of this hotel was the location Room was comfortable enough but several things needed repair Breakfast was excellent 
286590,Hotel Pulitzer, No bath if that s important Internet access pretty bad Very slow and often doesn t connect No English TV channel , Great looking hotel nice art all over the place Great location Very friendly helpful staff Big room nice bathroom lovely white bedsheets of good quality This is a very good hotel
286591,Hotel Pulitzer, Allocated room was very small and I upgraded Clerk checking me in should have said it was a small room instead of saying he allocated me a special room Check in clerk was also very slow ,No Positive
286592,Hotel Pulitzer, The lock on our door kept breaking there was a lot of street noise at night, Breakfast was good the terrace bar was a very relaxing place to chill out in the day
286593,Hotel Pulitzer, The bathroom had dark grey tiles that needed a good scrub down the side of the bath There was a build up of soap and lime from the shower that had run down the side so it looked dirty and not pleasant, Great staff location breakfast 
286594,Hotel Pulitzer, A room without a view My window opened on to a wall I could touch by extending my arm and the closed the roof terrace for a private party So many better options at half the price, The staff were polite and friendly as you would expect
286595,Hotel Pulitzer, Minus could use a little handiwork a little shabby around the edges carpet urgently needs to be replaced , Plus central location beautiful lobby nice well decorated clean rooms comfortable beds very nice bathroom delicious international breakfast exceptional rooftop terrace with nice crowd and good food 
286596,Hotel Pulitzer, Price was high over 200 US per night however this may be the norm for Barcelona and central location of this hotel and room was very nice Double bed was two twins pushed together They did not have an electrical converter in the room and wanted to charge 15 US to buy one but after I said that should be included with room for the price we were paying they provided two converters at no extra charge , Fantastic location in the city We could see central plaza from our room lots of restaurants nearby shopping and las Ramblas within walking distance Taxi cab stand was across the street so getting a cab was very easy There was even a large grocery store a block away Nice breakfast was included with our room charge with lots of choices not made to order though Modern lobby bar and very nice roof top bar restaurant much nicer inside than what appears from street presence While we didn t eat at bar on roof top the prices on limited menu looked reasonable Our room was very large Room had lots of art work and two full length mirrors Bathroom was all marble and fancy We had a little balcony and could see the fountain in the plaza from it Front desk staff spoke English 
286597,Hotel Pulitzer, The rooftop bar was closed for renovation , Very nice hotel with polite staff Great location to explore Barcelona Clean rooms The restaurant and the lobby bar have a great menu 
286598,Hotel Pulitzer, Bathroom is a bit dark with peculiar light switches, Very comfy bed Wonderful staff who were willing to help us with every query Great ambiance Excellent cappuccino Comfy lounge area Location
286599,Hotel Pulitzer, Told two different times for late checkout which was very inconvenient , The rooms were big bed was comfortable and the breakfast was very enjoyable Very good location walking distance to everything Roof top bar had real atmosphere 
286600,Hotel Pulitzer, My roon was at 1st floor there are air condition machine out of my window a little bit noise and cannot see view from window , The location of this hotel is amazing it is just beside Catalunia square very near to subway and tour bus and lots nice restaurant nearby and shopping place It is heart of Barcelona so it is very easy to go the visit place Very good 
286601,Hotel Pulitzer, We had a room on the top floor and the music from the roof bar came through to the room but stopped between 10 11pm , The staff were all very friendly and the room was lovely 
286602,Hotel Pulitzer, Garage was difficult to find The entrance at the back off hotel down very narrow as wide as one car one way roads No place to park in front of hotel as on a main road , Right in the centre so no problem to walk to all the magnificent architecture in the old town Lots of good Restaurants nearby La Scala Restaurant stood out fantastic food nice setting and reasonable price 
286603,Hotel Pulitzer, Back rooms are noisy due to air conditioners we had to change the room because of noise the coffee machine in breakfast room is not working the waitress in breakfast room could be more polite It was hard to find the hotel because the name of the hotel is too small to notice, Location of the hotel is great next to catulunya square and metro station Reception is kind and helpful Breakfast is good and rich Clean rooms but small
286604,Hotel Pulitzer, We didn t care for the public areas Bar Lounge cold and impersonal white leather too cold The whole reception area needs attention and redecoration, Accommodation excellent Rooms rather small A second armchair would be good Breakfast excellent what about boiled eggs 
286605,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Everything was really nice starting from people in reception who were very kind and helpful through comfortable bed and tasty breakfast Location is perfect only few steps away from La Rambla and Placa de Catalunya 
286606,Hotel Pulitzer, The lighting in the room its a little dark ish It would be nice if they could provide more complimentary water , The staff are wonderful and helpful This is probably one of my favourite hotels in Barcelona I ve stayed at Casa Fuster nightmare at Majestic Hotel service is not great and some other places in the city too which have not at all impressed me The room we stayed in the lobby and the room service is also great This is definitely a great place to stay at that is not too over priced and you feel like you are getting very good value for your money The hotel is very well connected to the metro in Barcelona and is located close to a number of tourist spots too The taxi from the airport costs about 30 Euros without any bags I wouldn t go in expecting the hotel to be the epitome of luxury it is a very good hotel that I would definitely stay at again when visiting Barcelona The hotel also provides free tours of the old part of Barcelona through a free tours group This is worth going to as it gives you more detailed information of the old city than a number of major tour companies 
286607,Hotel Pulitzer, The carpets in the corridors need cleaning In the breakfast room because there were so many people there the outside door was open and it was freezing ,No Positive
286608,Hotel Pulitzer, The room was on the corner of the building There was a big piller inside which is very disappointing , Very convenient location Staff members were kind and helpful 
286609,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing to mention , Proximity to Aerobus terminal from airport close to public transport walking distance to many sights excellent breakfast included spacious comfortable and clean room and friendly and helpful staff 
286610,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing that I did not like, Excellent location 1 minute from placa Catalunya Breakfast great choice and until 11AM Staff very friendly and helpful with local knowledge Late flight and they looked after our bags for the time after we checked out which meant we could make the most of our day before flying home 
286611,Hotel Pulitzer, it s not intended but just a mistake i think they packed my breakfast as my flight was early morning and i found sandwich with pork ham and we muslims don t eat it , staff was very co operative
286612,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing , Hotel Pulitzer was excellent for my 3 nights stay in barcelona The location was excellent right next to plaza catalunya The service was great very helpful front desk service The whole feel and decor of the hotel was tasteful unpretentious and delightful The room was relatively small but we didnt mind it at all The bed was unforgettably comfortable and the lightings in the room could be adjusted to your liking The air conditioning was also very good as we were there during the winter spring transition the previous few hotels we stayed at still bad their centralised system set in heater mode which were quite uncomfortable Overall great value for money and we would definitely stay there again if we visit barelona again 
286613,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, All the staff were super friendly and could not have been more helpful or more accommodating A great hotel thoroughly recommended We stayed in a room that faced the street the sound proofing was excellent we didn t hear a thing 
286614,Hotel Pulitzer, Liked everything, The staff were very friendly Had a good choice for breakfast Hotel s location could not be better for transport to airport and metro 
286615,Hotel Pulitzer, Our room like a labyrinth and had a long and narrow corridor And unfortunately windows weren t fully closed so there is a little bit noisy environment inside the room , First of all location is the best and of course breakfast too And impossible to forget the friendly and helpful staff 
286616,Hotel Pulitzer, Didn t have a great view and the room was long and narrow but the room was nice and quiet and clean modern and bright had everything we needed for our stay , Beds very comfy staff very friendly from reception to breakfast to bar staff Lovely roof terrace bar Lovely choice of food for breakfast all fresh and very good quality
286617,Hotel Pulitzer, Price of breakfast seemed expensive so did not try it had to pay to access swimming pool in nearby hotel so did not use not enough milk with bedroom tea making facilities always the case in hotels volume of toiletries in bathroom only just adequate for 2 girls But all these things really minor and far out weighed by positive experience , Location friendly reception staff great lounge and bar area and roof top terrace good sound proofing 2 minutes from airport bus stop down a street from pretty main square Nice ambience through out the hotel A relaxing place to return to Good local restaurants and cafes Very comfortable beds lovely towels Armchair in room Room long and thin but not a problem had tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge For a first or second time visitor I would definitely recommend but we did obtain a good deal on price 
286618,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Tea and coffee facilities and complimentary mineral water on arrival The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant at all times We had breakfast included and there was a lot of variety to choose from which was an extra bonus 
286619,Hotel Pulitzer, There was a lot of noise Pipe noises were constantly in the background and doors closing throughout the building was a constant disturbance , Great location and facility
286620,Hotel Pulitzer, A little rough around the edges could do with some fresh paint and furniture Especially in the shower room, Comfortable beds excellent location for busses to the airport and city tours 
286621,Hotel Pulitzer, The hotel unfortunally had a water leak during my stay but the staff handled the problem professionally , Good comfortable hotel with an excellent location 
286622,Hotel Pulitzer, The staff could be a little less cold I feel While this certainly does not apply to everyone there are a select number of staff members at the reception and the bar who were not rude but not quite nice either speaking in an almost sarcastic manner when addressing guests Perhaps it was because of the season or lack of guests but the roof terrace is not open except for weekends , Comfortable modernly designed very clean rooms albeit not much of a view from the windows and relatively spacious Lobby bar and roof terrace were nice places to retreat to in the evening and enjoy a drink although the food was not particularly good Location wise the hotel is in a phenomenal location just off of Pla a Catalunya the very heart of Bar elona with excellent transport links 
286623,Hotel Pulitzer, It could have somehow better indications or bigger sign at the front It was really hard to spot it when comming , Staff were really helpfull and friendly Great place to be 
286624,Hotel Pulitzer, Hot water took so long in the morning but a staff was so helpful and did something about it right away , I liked the location It was in the center but in a side street so it s not so busy right outside the hotel The room was modern and clean Just the right size for a couple Staff was so helpful and friendly We re actually booked already for summer and going back with our kids 
286625,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Bed was very comfortable a fantastic continental breakfast very nice and helpful staff excellent coctails beautiful interiors and a lovely dining room and terrace on the roof I highly recommend this hotel 
286626,Hotel Pulitzer, Small room , Location and friendly staff always eager to help Good breakfast As we arrived in an early flight at check in they let us go to our room earlier than 2PM At check out they also let us store our luggage until late in the afternoon 
286627,Hotel Pulitzer, The hotel might need little renovations here and there but nothing too bad The windows in the room don t shield the noise and cool wind as well from outside but hey you re right in the center of the busy city , Super friendly staff at Bar Front desk breakfast very welcoming Check in with Daniel Perfect location in Barcelona you can visit all sights by foot or bike and have the Aerobus just across the Placa Catalunya Good breakfast and coffee 
286628,Hotel Pulitzer, Small things no door on the bathroom and bad lighting in there , Clean great location better for a couple than a couple of friends sharing a roonm but overall a very nice place
286629,Hotel Pulitzer, The heating system wasn t really heating even when set on max The windows were poorly isolated and very drafty Ended up with a bad cold after 3 nights , Great location right in the center Staff at the reception very helpful and professional Good value for money in January Decent breakfast and affordable room service 
286630,Hotel Pulitzer, Menu very limited in evening Sink was grubby in our room The lighting system in the room was really odd and hard to understand , The staff were amazing Wonderful people Very nice atmosphere in the public areas throughout the hotel 
286631,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Beautiful clean rooms everything modern helpful staff great value for the price located just a few steps from Plaza de Catalunya and the Ramblas I can recommend it 
286632,Hotel Pulitzer, Nothing , Incredible hotel shower amazing bed amazing glutenfree bread at breakfast super located I want to live there Even the shampoo and shower gel were amazing 
286633,Hotel Pulitzer, Larger rooms are with a view of street and can be a little noisy Bar staff weren t quite as friendly as the reception staff this last trip so I only had one drink at the bar during my stay , Since I found this hotel I only stay here when I m in Barcelona Good value Good location good breakfast friendly staff
286634,Hotel Pulitzer, I was asked to pay upon arrival actual payment not credit card pre authorization at least a part of my stay as my overall bill was over 500 EUR This on a fully flexible rate and a reservation made through booking com with an already verified credit card I think it is only fair that this bizarre practice first time it happens to me and I travel a lot is clearly communicated to the guests beforehand It wasn t in my case Water is offered on the first night only Noisy air conditioning Courtesy set truly 3 cheap toiletries Lousy hair drier There is no desk in the room or any surface to work or write We had a quick breakfast cappuccino and croissant at the bar Both were dreadful , Excellent location close to everything Reasonably sized rooms spotlessly clean Really nice d cor Beautiful bar and great G T Comfy bed Value which is the reason why we came back in the first place 
286635,Hotel Pulitzer, The water in the wash basin would not drain The main bar downstairs closed at 12am on a Saturday night There was a lot of dust under the cabinet underneath the wash basin I dropped my make up bag and had to fish some items from underneath it and it was not pleasant as that area obviously hadn t been cleaned in a while , Nice decor bright room city centre location within minutes to the Aerobus stop and Les Rambles 
286636,Hotel Pulitzer, nothing , very kind staff even helping to make a reservation all staff in reception bar restaurant are great room is so good comfortable and warm bathroom is perfect location is so good just 1 min on foot to main street rambles just 0 5 min starbucks if wanted 5 min to good restaurant this hotel very recommended i will stay again after 10 days when i back to barcelona christmas tree and lobby decoration is 5 star level inside hotel always feeling comfortable thank you so much dont think too much just click to order 
286637,Hotel Pulitzer, nothing, Very helpful staff and friendliness was natural The location was excellent for meeting people for business and connect well to the central train station metro airportbus to T1 Rooms were perfect and although in the center of Barcelona it was silent inside the room 
286638,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Perfect location and nice decor Aerobus stop is within 4 min walk just across Placa Catalunya Most of the interesting sites are within walking distance Feel safe in the neighbourhood 
286639,Hotel Pulitzer, Room 414 was a little noisy but I guess that s the downside of a super central location , Modern style young friendly staff 2nd time I ve stayed and will return in January Recommended 
286640,Hotel Pulitzer, The only thing minor is that the floors of the room was wooden which you can hear people in every neighbor rooms while walking with shoes, Perfect Location Great people Very helpful and smiling staff Nice bar to relax with a drink Price was good but it was a temporary promo price I guess 
286641,Hotel Pulitzer, There are quite a few points 1 Don t take a room in the 5th floor coz at least in our case their laundry man drops the washed laundry in the middle of the night and he cannot do it quietly Unless you are someone who s out partying till late you can be expected to be woken up in the middle of the night Call the front desk and their response is I apologize for the inconvenience sir but the man has to do his job 2 You ask for a laundry bag to pack your soiled clothes separately and the response you could get is I have quite a lot of bags in the lobby please carry what you need to pack with you I can provide you with the bag Seriously you expect the customer to walk down with their soiled clothes 3 The rooms are quite small and the electrical fixtures are flimsy 4 We explicitly asked for a room with a double bed and we were given a room with two single beds Not sure which part of my request was not clear to these guys When we asked for an alternate room we were shown one in a corner where if you turn you ll be facing the wall , Well the biggest positive is their location It s at Eixample which is at a stone s throw away from Plaza Catalonya and that means you are at a walking distance from every major place inside the city whether it s the Ramblas or the marina Their breakfast spread was quite decent and the staff managing the cafeteria are very pleasant 
286642,Hotel Pulitzer, Was hoping for a bath as that is what was in the booking but the shower was fine Breakfast was too pricey , Very helpful staff great location and big bed
286643,Hotel Pulitzer, Bathrooms a little tired rooms small, The staff welcoming extremely helpful and pleasant Very satisfactory breakfast Would advise hiring bicycles to see the city to go to beach and all the attractions Hotel very near by cycle shop in Ramblas 
286644,Hotel Pulitzer, MORNING BUFFET MENUS ARE NOT CHANGING EVEN THOUGH IT IS DELICIOUS BUT REPEATS EVERY MORNING I WOULD BE NICE IF THIS HOTEL PREPARES DAILY SPECIAL MENU FOR THE MORNING BUFFET, NICE LOCATION FOR CITY TOUR IN BARCELONA NICE MOOD CLEAN ENVIRONMENT GOOD SERVICES BEST CHOICE FOR HONEYMOON
286645,Hotel Pulitzer, I did not like the location of electrical outlets it was difficult to reach them , The lobby was amazing I was able to work on my computer everyday and complete a lot of work due to the wonderful atmosphere 
286646,Hotel Pulitzer, The room we were in was on the 1st floor and rather noisy The doors slam shut and the bar downstairs is active until around midnight all of which could be heard through our walls , Proximity to Las Ramblas within walking distance 
286647,Hotel Pulitzer, My room was cold First night I told them and anything not change And second n ght I told again They sa d ok well solve but they d d n t solve t And they offer me a blanket , Breakfeast
286648,Hotel Pulitzer, Furniture in the room partially outdated and worn off bathroom tiles could be replaced as some of them are broken , Top location warm and comfortable atmosphere very good bed
286649,Hotel Pulitzer, As we required a double bed which we requested when the booking was made several weeks prior to arrival the only room available was without a view and In fact looked out on a brick wall this made the room very dark even with the lights on our stay was for one night only so this did not matter to much but would not of been happy with this if it had been longer , Staff very friendly from the moment we arrived lovely comfortable bed and another plus was the tea coffee tray 2 free bottles of water Plenty of places to sit and relax the terrace was very nice in the sunshine Excellent location for tapas at lunchtime and evening meals 
286650,Hotel Pulitzer, The room was small and shows a lot of signs of wear and tear This would normally be fine but I wouldn t expect that of a highly rated expensive hotel such as this The WiFi was not very fast This is really unacceptable for such a pricey hotel , Location is excellent and staff is good
286651,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Location breakfast rooms staff cleanliness and wi fi was excellent If you would like to receive an excellent service you should definitely stay here 
286652,Hotel Pulitzer, the rooms are noisy all the rooms are built around the atrium so you could here the noise from the bar plus no sound proofing on the windows and you also could hear well your neighbours, very good location
286653,Hotel Pulitzer, Took a long time to get some coffee in the morning due to a faulty machine and not much of a view from the room despite requesting an upper floor room at the time of booking , Loved the bed worked a treat after all the sightseeing Great location well connected to airport metro station Very close proximity to Las Ramblas The breakfast had a nice variety my partner loved the apple cake 
286654,Hotel Pulitzer, The bedrooms were tired and a little basic I found used cotton swabs on the floor of the bathroom when I arrived , The location was good and the decoration of the hotel reception lounge bar was warm and contemporary 
286655,Hotel Pulitzer, That the rooftop bar was not open as we were slightly out of season But thats our fault , Lovely staff trendy bar amazingly good value lunch Pretty good location too 
286656,Hotel Pulitzer, Restaurant not open in evening , Friendly and helpful staff comfortable bed good sound insulation from street central location ideal for a city break
286657,Hotel Pulitzer, The fact that you had to pay for Internet access and also access to the local gym had to be paid for , Location is ideal for exploring the city Transport links are close Shops and restaurants nearby offer a range of choices 
286658,Hotel Pulitzer, Perhaps because it was the weekend or because there was a festival on or just because it was Barcelona we found this a rather expensive hotel Shower wasn t very user friendly as the shower head wouldn t fix properly and kept falling off , Excellent location few minutes walk from the square where the airport bus terminates Comfortable bed excellent service and brilliant choice at breakfast especially the range of fresh breads and fresh fruit 
286659,Hotel Pulitzer, I liked everything about the hotel, This hotel was recommended to us by a friend and we are so glad we took his advice This hotel was excellent value for money It was in a great location and close to many of the places we wanted to see The staff were friendly and helpful This hotel is definitely one to consider

286662,Hotel Pulitzer, Could have used a clothes iron in the room Otherwise we had everything we needed , Perfect location friendly and helpful staff awesome bar and rooftop terrace Quiet rooms 
286663,Hotel Pulitzer, The rooftop bar was a bit disappointing small with not much of a view but a nice idea , Location is ideal for easy access to public transport shopping and eating out The staff here were wonderful very friendly and the room was clean and comfortable The breakfast which was delivered to our room due to an early flight was amazing Barcelona is a gorgeous city 
286664,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Again we could improvise our lunch on the beautiful roof top terrace The staff is very helpful and easy going We love the design the art the quiet night in the middle of buzzing summer Barcelona 
286665,Hotel Pulitzer,No Negative, Fantastic hotel in great location for exploring barcelona s top attractions Both the downstairs and terrace bars were an oasis away from the crowds and heat Nothing seemed to be a bother would definitely stay there again
