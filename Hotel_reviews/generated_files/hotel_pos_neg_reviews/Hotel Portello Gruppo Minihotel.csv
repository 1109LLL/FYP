475670,Hotel Portello Gruppo Minihotel, This is such a tiny gripe as it really was a great stay but there was no yoghurt in the breakfast buffet which I d have liked Otherwise it was great , This hotel is really reasonably priced with breakfast included It s close to what seems to be some sort of events place like the NEC so perfect for a business trip linked to that but it s also really close to a new metro line so access to central milan takes about 15 mins and is pretty simple to navigate I was at a conference in a hotel on Corso Sempione so we mostly ate in that area It s a 10 minute walk away from the hotel and there are some lovely restaurants around there
