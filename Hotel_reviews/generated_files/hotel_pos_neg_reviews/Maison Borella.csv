268100,Maison Borella, We dined at the hotel s restaurant but there were many mosquitoes maybe due to summer and that the hotel is located next to Naviglio Grande but other than that no complaints, Rooms were nice and clean service was good Overall a good experience and I would confidently say a good choice if you are looking to stay near the Navigli River
268101,Maison Borella, My only complaint was we were put in a room right next to the noisey restaurant next door We were only staying two nights so I didn t complain If I had been staying any longer would I certainly would have , Maison Borella was a lovely boutique hotel in a great location Loved the decor and the gorgeous outdoor area Wandered along the canal after dinner at night and would definatey stay there again 
268102,Maison Borella, We got charged a fee for a taxi that was hailed to pay for the taxi to come to our door The cost for them to get to our hotel was the same cost as it was to drive to the place we needed to go so the fare ended up being double the cost Wish we could have hailed one off the street instead , The bed was super comfy and the location was perfect Only part of the city with the rivers still there Very much like the older city of Rome feel but with many restaurants and just a good comfortable feel 
268103,Maison Borella, We returned to our room and the door had been left open which is a security issue The cleaner had not closed the door properly We told the management There were no cups in the room to make coffee We had to ask for these and then they were supplied willingly Lighting was poor to read by , The room was adequate and the whole place was charming The location could not be better and right outside the door on the Sunday was the monthly antique market Last Sunday of the month All in all a fantastic experience 
268104,Maison Borella, Bathroom door not closing properly jamming on floor, Nice relaxed atmosphere alongside canal in an excellent location to sample a wide array of cafes and restaurants
268105,Maison Borella, Unsure about the location Fantastic with respect to my above remarks However it was a bus ride to the city centre and as we only had a day in Milan was costly in terms of time However if time was not an issue it was an interesting area to be domiciled in , Loved the Hotel Very edgy and liked the extra s such as newspapers available to read Situated in a very lively area and lots of cafe s and restaurants in the vicinity The breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful 
268106,Maison Borella, Be careful in the shower I slipped on the wet tiles and broke my wrist Milan hospital sorted it out for me and it didn t ruin the holiday , hotel was beautiful and in a great location right on the canal with lots of restaurants and bars on your doorstep The room was a good size and bed comfortable The breakfast was lovely with lots of choices 
268107,Maison Borella, Only negative would be the hair dryer other wise everything was perfect , Delightful welcome at the hotel room was clean and a good size The property is beautiful and very authentic Breakfast was really delicious with a big selection of pasturies savoury sweet cakes fruit eggs toast etc 
268108,Maison Borella, Nothing, Amazing stay at Maison Borella All the details of the hotel are excellent best location friendly staff clean rooms charming ambiance unforgettable smell of Jasmine The morning smile of Amadou at the breakfast will make your days 
268109,Maison Borella, The hotel area can be busy crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings with people going to coming from bars , The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful The rooms facilities were modern clean and functioning Breakfast was very good Hotel has a great atmosphere about it Location of the hotel is perfect for enjoying the nightlife dinner drinks in the area Connections to public transport are nearby
268110,Maison Borella, Fresh rolls at breakfast instead of sliced bread would be nice but not a major problem , Stylish hotel in a great location The canals are VERY busy at night full of bars and restaurants and people strolling along It is not a relaxing location but as soon as you step into the hotel it is quiet with great service They serve a good range of aperitif with olives and crisps Not cheap but a real treat Lovely staff 
268111,Maison Borella, Nothing, Brilliant location in a very hip area and close to tram and underground stations to explore more of Milan Lovely airy room overlooking the canal communal areas are very stylish yet homely and it has a lovely restaurant downstairs which exceeded our expectations in terms of quality service decor and ambience A real gem all round would totally recommend for a weekend break 
268112,Maison Borella, At the arrival it was difficult for us to temporary park the car close the hotel as the street is closed for cars But calling the staff they helped us immediately and took the car to the parking nearby , Despite the hotel is located close to many bars and restaurants the room is totally quiet we enjoyed a lot Confortable bed and very clean room All staff were very kind and supported us any time We recommend 
268113,Maison Borella, Everything was terrific , Every single thing about this property was specstacular but what really stood out was how superb their staff was From the beginning they emailed me promptly to confirm my booking and answer my ongoing questions right up to my booking They accommodated us early and even brought a cappuccino while I was waiting the whole 20 minutes for them to turnover our room They cheerfully jumped on any request and we had several acting as though it was their dying wish to serve our every need They were incredibly knowledgeable arranging a last minute tour to the Last Supper giving detailed directions to Lake Como and where best to visit and even telling us exactly where we might find cheese nearby to take home with us I just can t say enough about these incredible staff members 
268114,Maison Borella, We were located in a separate building so always had to walk outside to get to the main hotel , Good location Nice cozy common spaces Breakfast and restaurant are were good too And the room was very large and comfortable 
268115,Maison Borella, That I couldn t stay longer But I will return soon , Everything I would move in and live there if I could Above all it is an oasis of peace and quiet and the staff are all calm and super professional No shouting no noisy cleaners etc But you have the bonus of being right in the cetre of a buzzy area of Milan 
268116,Maison Borella,No Negative, Fantastic boutique hotel in the middle of the buzzing Navigli suburb From the Moment we checked it we felt at home rooms are a great size facing the court yard with all amenities you need for a few days in Milan Nice courtyard lounge area to enjoy a glass of wine or two A very personal hotel with great staff Good spot to walk around and explore Milan for all those who do not mind walking more than 15 min to see the cathedral Dinner at the Bugande restaurant is definitely a must we ate there twice during our 4 day stay Food is fantastic and waiting staff also Carlo was especially attentive and has a great eye for detail Navigli is quite loud with a lot of restaurants and bars really great for the evenings But you hear absolutely nothing while in the rooms or hotel itself It is Very quiet Overall a fantastic little find we will definitely be back 
268117,Maison Borella, The receptionist who welcomed us wasn t very friendly and helpful regarding the question we had regarding places to visit nearby, The romantic atmosphere of the hotel The place is really quiet Staff from breakfast is really nice and very kind 
268118,Maison Borella, i wish the leaves decoration in front of my door could have been has clean as tidy as the other rooms nearby , The style and decoration of the entire hotel makes it warm and welcoming 
268119,Maison Borella, It would have been nice to have an extra blanket and different pillows in the closet , Beautiful renovated typical Milanese building in a perfect location Really good breakfast with fresh cakes croissants fruits and savory choises
268120,Maison Borella, No tea coffee making facilities It was a bit Noisy as we had a room overlooking the canal and the binmen came at 5 30am , There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice The concierge at times was grumpy but the porters were very pleasant as was the lady on the bar is the afternoon we arrived 
268121,Maison Borella,No Negative, The hotel is decorated beautifully the location is awesome being on the best canal with access to the best restaurants in the area Quick access to all of the attractions of Milan as well Staff were lovely and helped with anything you needed Rooms again beautifully decorated and clean The breakfast was awesome 
268122,Maison Borella, View from the room overlooking the courtyard was ok but not good for the amount of light coming into the room as the courtyards is enclosed within 4 walls Breakfast only warm food was scrambled or hard boiled eggs nothing else , Convenient location 
268123,Maison Borella, Bar closing time for guests , Very good location restaurants walks good access to the Metro and the centre The hotel was very good quiet and comfy and there is no road outside so a good night sleep was possible The staff were very helpful and friendly 
268124,Maison Borella,No Negative, Lovely clean modern rooms and hotel in a good location although difficult to drive to with the hire car Staff were very very helpful and breakfast was served till 10 30 which was wonderful
268125,Maison Borella, This hotel is in a pedestrianised zone so if you have a car then you have to phone ahead to let them know you are just around the corner They will then lower the bollard in the road to let you in It costs 25 euro per night for parking So it is better not to have a car basically but they can help you if you do have one , This hotel is in an excellent location in a really vibrant part of Milan and yet it is only 10 minutes on the tram to the Duomo Very helpful staff It has an excellent restaurant and there are plenty of other choices nearby This is a great find The soundproofing is very good in the rooms so you won t hear all the noise outside The rooms in the annexe are even better than the ones in the main hotel so ask to be in the Maison Privee 
268126,Maison Borella,No Negative, We recommend Maison Borella Staff were friendly and helpful The location is great Breakfast is generous and the rooms are fine Maison Borella is a massive improvement on a previous hotel we stayed at in Milan a few years ago and it gave us an improved perspective of the city Our reasonable requests were dealt with efficiently and politely The hotel is really quite lovely and I would have been happy to stay longer The group agreed we would stay here again if we returned to Milan 
268127,Maison Borella, we could only stay for 2 nights , Stayed at the hotel with our baby daughter An excellent experience The hotel is beautiful It is in an excellent location the staff was professional and welcoming The room was large clean and well equipped 
268128,Maison Borella,No Negative, The staff were polite friendly and very helpful In a great location the d cor is beautiful and the courtyard is so picturesque The breakfast was delicious fresh with a good variety Our room was spotless towels were changed every day and with a balcony which over looked the canal made it extra special We had a perfect stay 
268129,Maison Borella, It was difficult to get a comfortable temperature in the room I played around with the air con may be it is just me There 3 different flashing lights in the room which were distracting when trying to sleep WiFi was a little hit and miss , Location is very good close to lots of restaurants and in a lively area Staff were polite and attentive The interior of the communal areas and the courtyard are very nice Room was minimalistic with a good bathroom and shower Breakfast was a standard buffet and nothing special 
268130,Maison Borella, Nothing , Nivigli is the area to be and this is the hotel to stay at What a wonderful place Superb courtyard and restaurant area and the room was wonderful overlooking the canal Staff were amazing Honestly this is a great place in Milan with the vibrant restaurant and bar scene just below and some great shops meant in the old part of Milan 5 stars from me 
268131,Maison Borella, Nothing would highly recommend the hotel , Loved this hotel It has a fantastic location in the Navoligi area Next to some great bars and resturants Refurbished to exceptional standards Breakfast buffet was beautiful had everything we liked Staff very friendly and attentive We has 2 suites in the private annex and we had the right balance of privacy and service 
268132,Maison Borella, Not a single thing , What a wonderful stay at the Maison Borella Hotel in Milan The staff was incredibly helpful in every possible situation The restaurant was top shelf we had an early dinner and loved it and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast buffet each morning Cannot wait to return 
268133,Maison Borella,No Negative, THE STAFF WAS AMAZING SUPER NICE WELCOMING AND ACCOMMODATING THEIR WAS A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THE BOOKING AND THEY TOOK CARE OF IT AND GOT ME NEW ROOM AND DISCOUNTED BOTH ROOMS THE BREAKFAST DELICIOUS I COULDN T GET ENOUGH THEY SCHEDULED A PICKUP TO THE AIRPORT FOR US I RECOMMENDED THIS TO MY NIECE A FEW DAYS LATER AND SHE ALSO LOVED IT 
268134,Maison Borella, Parking located at some distance They have a valet service but if you need your car during your stay it s a bit cumbersome , Great location on the canals of a hip neighborhood Charming rooftop room overlooking patio Loved the exceptional interior design modern and stylish yet still cozy Very clean Staff was friendly 
268135,Maison Borella, All good , The hotel is located right on the canal with lots of restaurant and bar options around We had a courtyard room with a comfy bed and the shower was great A very nice breakfast is served in the downstairs restaurant There is a cozy lounge and courtyard seating as well Really nice to sip a cool drink at the bar overlooking the canal 
268136,Maison Borella, We had an early flight to catch so needed to leave at 8am when breakfast begins at the weekend Therefore we asked the receptionist if we could arrange something to take away or have a little earlier We appreciated this was an exception and were only hoping for maybe a couple of croissants or other breakfast items if the croissants weren t ready coffee and juice We spoke to the receptionist more than once to confirm this and arrange that we would come down at 7 30am and sit in the lounge area to take breakfast rather than in the breakfast room Unfortunately we were greeted with breakfast staff who did not know about these arrangements and told us breakfast was not open a few times After some debate they huffily conceded to fetch us some breakfast items The ridiculous thing was that the breakfast was already laid out like a bountiful banquet of pastries etc and we could see it through the glass doors but they wouldn t let us in there to pick a couple of things Instead we had to awkwardly point through the glass whilst they picked things out They brought us out some drinks but then we had to send them back for milk and they brought us yoghurts without spoons The man was clearly cross about this taking up his time when he was supposed to be setting up breakfast so I don t know why he didn t just let us serve ourselves This was a really stressful start to the day and a disappointing end to the stay at this hotel We were on a tight timescale to leave for the airport so having our time wasted by waiting for someone to bring us things when they weren t prepared was really annoying , We pair were away for a girly weekend and chose this boutique hotel because of the great reviews the look of the place and the location The Navigli area is great really lively at night with people out for the evening passegiata Not rowdy though plenty of people of all ages We were really pleased when the reception staff organised us a table for drinks on the front where we could watch the people go by Good seats on the frontage are hard to find so we felt we d done really well to stay here and take advantage of this Our room was lovely very comfortable twin beds and a spacious bathroom It was quiet in our room even though we were there on a Saturday night The staff on reception were very professional and the porter was a very friendly chap Altogether we were very pleased with our stay until they spoiled it with the experience we had at breakfast time 
268137,Maison Borella, One of the bar staff was a bit rude I think he thought we were not cool enough to be staying in the hotel and had a general air of disdain about him , Lovely location near the canal beautiful decor and generally pleasant service in particular the gentleman on reception in the morning of our stay who made sure we got some breakfast to take away with us 
268138,Maison Borella,No Negative, Room was very nice would have liked two sitting chairs for my wife and me but that s a minor issue Breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful We used the hotel as a jumping off point for day trips in the rented car The staff there was most helpful with their suggested destinations 
268139,Maison Borella, Nothing that I can think of , The staff are very helpful with little things like metro tickets and bigger things like airport transfers very professional yet relaxed Just like the rooms the common areas are really lovely spaces in terms of comfort and design Do not miss the breakfast it s fabulous 
268140,Maison Borella, The lift broke down the day we left but help arrived so no problem , Room size big bed big very comfy Good bathroom lots of windows good aircon Nice breakfast lots of choices Staff in restaurant so friendly Good spot on the canal 20 mins walk into Duomo Lots of cafes bars all along canal Our room was at the back of the building had private entrance to it 
268141,Maison Borella, Nothing, The staff were very friendly The hotel decore is beautiful and funky As the hotel is small it has a very relaxing atmosphere While the hotel is in the heart of Milan s nightlife the internal courtyard means that it is always nice and quiet The restaurant serves excellent food and wine The hotel is close to transport links and is a few minutes by tram from Duomo I cannot praise it enough and we have booked again 
268142,Maison Borella, THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR ROOMS MAKE THEM LOOK MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE ONE WE HAD , ABSOLUTLY DELICIOUS BREAKFASTS AND EVENING MEALS FANTASTIC STAFF WHO WERE SO ATTENTIVE
268143,Maison Borella,No Negative, Delightful breakfast attic room off was huge and charming and location is superb A truly interesting part of Milano that is also convenient to most of the tourist hotspots 
268144,Maison Borella,No Negative, Staff very good poor breakfast sink broken in the bedroom and extractor broken in the bathroom In general not in line with the price even if very nice
268145,Maison Borella,No Negative, Great location along the canal Our room was nice tidy and quite we faced the courtyard Nice helpful and polite staff Probably not the best hotel for business puposes but simply excellent for leisure and couples 
268146,Maison Borella,No Negative, Lovely welcome very quiet in the courtyard and just generally Good location though on business so couldn t quite take advantage of it alone Lovely restaurant in hotel and nice aperitivo on the canal Would go back
268147,Maison Borella,No Negative, Realy good service compare with other Milan hotels Staf take care about our car They bring our car to parking and back clean room good breakfest highly recomened Only dont worry if your navigation would like to drive in pedonale area drive Hotel managament accepted also that Thanks a lot Maison Borella staff 
268148,Maison Borella, Hotel charged us the original booking instead of the modified 25 EUR cheaper The room was small and everything else that you can expect from a 4 , Breakfast was very good
268149,Maison Borella, absolutely nothing, an amazing place in Milano the location cant be better Beside the canal surounded by restaurants bars and small shops The hotel has a very nice style and design and its realy gorgeous 
268150,Maison Borella, None, A fabulous boutique hotel with great interior style warm cozy and so inviting Fabulous room clean and beautiful fragrance throughout the whole hotel Love the cozy romantic warm lounge area to just sit and enjoying my tea and coffee Breakfast is excellent Staff are so friendly helpful and fantastic customer service This is the place I would come back again and again 
268151,Maison Borella, No suggestions I thought the stay was one of my best stays in Milan where I travel often for business , Rooms were outstanding and beautiful Very comfortable bed loved the rooftop room I had The restaurant is also very nice and is itself one of the better choices in the Navigli District Location is one of the better locations in Milan and fun but can get noisy as it tends to be a little more touristy and night life oriented 
268152,Maison Borella,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful always ready to bring us a Cappuccino or a glass of wine The breakfast was included and had a wide selection of different foods This is a boutique hotel with a unique layout that provides a comfortable homey area to sit and relax The location right on the Naviglio Grande Canal is perfect for walking and visiting the many shops and bars On the last Sunday of every month there is a giant antique market along the canal well worth staying at Maison Borella to browse the market 
268153,Maison Borella,No Negative, The welcoming smiles from both reception and from Amadou who took our bags to the room Great to see and feel that it is clearly genuine from staff that enjoy dealing with people 
268154,Maison Borella, The only problem we had was with the 10 ride carnet in itself a very good deal For some reason one of our tickets did not function after the 5th ride and then one has so much trouble to get it in order Otherwise the travel is very inexpensive and convenient in this big city , Good location in Navigli very nice and quiet room reception friendly especially Alessandro who was so helpful good restaurants nearby loved the aperitif in the lounge some great museums of which we really liked Fondazione Prada and Galleria d Italia 
268155,Maison Borella, Was slightly spoilt as even though we had booked twin rooms we had doubles Which isn t great for a bunch of blokes sharing I suspect it was really down to booking com rather than the hotel They did upgrade two of the rooms but couldn t with the other , Nice hotel and great location with loads of choice in restaurants and bars 
268156,Maison Borella,No Negative, Location is Great for a 1 2 night weekend stay Hotel very nice breakfast wonderful and energy directly outside your hotel room is delightfully filled with plenty of restaurant choices and people watching along the canal 
268157,Maison Borella,No Negative, Location is ok but i was totaly disappointed with navigli area the room and toilet were dated at least the toilet should have been renovated very poor breakfast 
268158,Maison Borella, The breakfast could definitely offer, Very nice building The annex to is very nice The room was large room and decorated with a lot of taste The bed was very confortable and everything was very clean 
268159,Maison Borella,No Negative, You are in the most fashionable zone of the city and on Saturday night the balcony overlooks the canal and the streets below are crammed with well dressed crowds Yet your sleep is restful and the canals are placid and empty in the morning What a fun stay 
268160,Maison Borella, We stayed in one of the adjacent rooms which was not as convenient as the main hotel and the views were more limited , The staff were very helpful and the location convenient with easy access to transport restaurants etc The canal provides a welcome backdrop The room and bathroom were well appointed and spacious 
268161,Maison Borella,No Negative, Nice hotel in a very pulsating district of Milano Great place to meet other people have a great drink and dinner in one of the many nice little restaurants
268162,Maison Borella, My only complaint was that we eventually had to leave , Large comfortable room and bathroom with excellent shower Helpful and friendly staff Good continental breakfast selection served until 10 30 Super location with good transport links and a huge variety of cafes bars and restaurants 
268163,Maison Borella,No Negative, Location was convenient to tram trolley underground Hotel is directly on the canal so step out your door for dining bars etc beautiful breakfast buffet each morning with eggs quiche pastries yogurt fruit cheeses meats 
268164,Maison Borella, Free wifi available but the signal didn t reach to our room Not really an issue but it was the only thing I could find fault with , Hotel was lovely and clean the staff were very helpful and the location was excellent I would definitely stay again 
268165,Maison Borella, The breakfast was a little heavy on the sweets and light on the savouries and the temperature of the room couldn t be regulated without the help of the front desk , The layout of the hotel around a small courtyard was charming the staff were very welcoming and helpful and the elegantly appointed room was a delight to return to after a blistering hot day at the Expo 
268166,Maison Borella,No Negative, First of all the staff was very helpful in all aspects and the location for visiting the city was great
