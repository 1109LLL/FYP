381366,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The pool photos are a lie The fumes from the boats when they park next to the hotel caused my husbands asthma to trigger horrendous The pool bar service and food were poor at best The bowl of chips served contains about quarter of a basket of dry chips Very very poor value If we hadn t had to pay on arrival we would have moved hotels This is a hotel for short stays when the boats come in forget it for anything else dinner is non existent the bar has no atmosphere and the upstairs bar was shut for 6 of the 7 nights we were there for private functions So DONT call it a bar Its a function space , The check in and the team downstairs were great breakfast selection was great service was slow Tea an coffee took forever to come One day there were no saucers or teaspoons weird 
381367,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, dinner choice of dishes in the menu of the restaurant a bit limited and kitchen service a bit slow I waited for 70 minutes for my main dish , size and composition of the room fantastic setting of the hotel in the port area great views friendliness of the service good breakfast
381368,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The pool is actually very small and the walk to the beach takes a very very long time , Bed was comfy and room was nice and spacious Bathroom especially was very nice 
381369,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Would have liked some flexibility with check in I was very sick in the lobby but could not check in even 15 minutes early , The bed The pillow I would like to know how to purchase a similar mattress and pillow They were outstanding 
381370,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Calling room service and the reception desk took a few calls to get attention The safe in the room worked intermittently had to call reception a few times to unlock it , The beds and pillows the bathroom and whirlpool bath 
381371,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, free cancellation is 3 days before checking in Routine is one day before Main lobby is not so appealing With children you can not get standard rooms and hotel policy forces you to get premier rooms with higher price in order to get the children in Room service staff mostly are poor in english For ice cubes you have to pay 5 Euros to room service My room mattress was quite old and its surface was bumpy which caused back pain , Location and breakfast
381372,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Breakfast expensive 55 euros for 2 people Roof top Pool area was nothing special almost an afterthought Poolside bar was not open for coffee etc on Monday Accommodation was expensive for the quality, Room was nice bed comfy
381373,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The room was not cleaned before 4 30 on any of the days we were there and that was only after we complained on the first day we had to wait over 2 hour for our luggage to be delivered to the room again only after complaining shame it has the potential for 5 stars but certainly is not and definitely not worth the 300 a night most disappointing,No Positive
381374,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Check in is pathetic this is the 4 th time we have used this hotel because of its location and the check in experience just gets worse This time we arrived at 3pm and finally got our room at 4pm The safe didnt work reception said they would be up to sort it in 5 minutes and 45 minutes later they still hadnt arrived another phone call to get some response The pool area is very tired all the flagstones on the floor move very dangerous The shower head put water everywhere except over you and anything you used in the room like water milk or coffee was not replaced the next day Certainly not 5 star standards , Great location
381375,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Actually it s 4 stars hotel My problems started with this hotel since checking in no slippers in the rooms and bathrobes as well I had to ask them they didn t clean the room next day I had to call them too I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone there are better choices with reasonable prices and better location , Largr rooms 
381376,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, We loved our stay in the hotel from the impressive view of Barcelona from our room we couldn t have had a more perfect view of the whole city and the marina Fantastic to the very friendly accommodating and very helpful staff from the reception to the concierge services that met all our needs Thanks a lot Nuria reception and Judit concierge for making our stay so special Also the breakfast was lovely and very complete We definitely recommend it 
381377,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Very good if viziting the city by car or coming to the conference in world trade center Met a really big que on the reception spend about half an hour in it which happened to me for the fisrt time in my life The lobby bar offers very nice snacks but the service is not very fast The funny thing is that the second day i had my lunch with my friend for free as the waiter told us that they were too slow to serve us A whole lunch in the restaurant for free also happened for me for the first time 
381378,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No conditioner in the bathroom which is poor for a 5 hotel and they tried to add a lot of extras on room service we had never had i e Drinks and food, Good gym equipment
381379,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Mix up with room charges lack of effective taxi service housekeeping efficiency cleanliness of gym room key didn t work every day mix up with room d spite I had a baby didn t rectify baby cot situation immediately,No Positive
381380,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The price fluctuated between sites and that was annoying but full understand the process and contractual commitments with agencies , I have previously stayed at this hotel and liked it so much that I wanted to re experience the recollection of the great stay I brought along 8 friends who all stayed at the hotel and also enjoyed the stay 
381381,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location that is convenient to the cruise port The Rambla and the Hop on Hop off bus The staff and the facilities are superior 
381382,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff Supervisor supporting apprentice during our check in did not greet us at all Not that this hurt our feelings too much but it s quite unusual to experience such a disconnected and non welcoming atmosphere in a hotel where rooms are quite pricey 350 Euros per night , Room Clean Comfy bed Staff Bar staff friendly
381383,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, The room was very spacious loved the private dressing room the balcony was very nice although i expected a direct ocean view but it was partially seen The service was excellent I have seen only few hotels who are really clean and concerned about their cleaning service and this one was one of them The location is really good it was only 5 minutes walking to La Rambla Street I would definitely visit again The in room service breakfast is good and healthy 
381384,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The room was very small and I felt it was more expensive than comparable hotels in the area not worth the value I was not impressed with the health club nor the swimming pool which is more like a box on the roof to have a dip in People up by the poolside were smoking as well and it just wasn t a nice pool to lay out in the sun by , Location is great it is easy to walk to the marina and the shopping mall and restaurants there I went running every morning around the marina and down to the beach and all along the coast The staff at check in and check out were amazingly kind and helpful even though the hotel was pretty full and lines were long for both The buffet breakfast was also amazing with a wide variety of pastries cereals fruit and hot foods The views from the roof over the city are also spectacular especially at sunset 
381385,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We arrived on a early flight when asked at time of booking it was noted that if we could require a room before 3pm unfortunately there was no room available though they did offer us to keep our cases and we could freshen up There was a bit of mix up as when it got to 3 10pm they were still saying a room wasn t available unless we excepted 2 single beds or if we could wait another 1 hour to which I complained then a room was made available , The breakfast catered for all needs ie choice was fantastic all fresh 
381386,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Just an observation this place is not for a romantic vacation it has more of a business type of atmosphere , Crispy clean modern property Quality you can expect from a Eurostars hotel Excellent all around 
381387,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the cruise ships can sometimes block the view from the room window make sure to close your blinds while changing for this reason , beautiful hotel with stunning views and great staff free upgrade and champagne as it was our anniversary would definitely stay again 
381388,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Final price match more than booking price They didn t prepare the room for family and ask for more money for extra bed The final bill in euro had been given to us but they charged CAD directly more from my credit about one week later ,No Positive
381389,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, airconditioning was too cold on the second night so we turned off and opened patio doors and bit of confusion about the room on check in given a double bed for two ladies who asked for singles but this was dealt with after 3pm, location and facilities and it was quiet here and near to the cruise terminal
381390,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No early notification of taxi strike They would say one thing and do another the taxi was 30 euros The hotel car was 88 Euros I will never recommend your hotel Very disappointing , Clean room 
381391,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Late check in Hotel extra full Even that I use booking the entire payment was taken by the hotel 100 in advance , Location Cleanliness Facilities 5stars indeed 
381392,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The prices throughout the hotel bars etc were extortionate We only had one drink in the bar and a couple of juices by the pool because of the price The pool was much smaller than we expected However we did not use it so cannot comment further We booked room only as the charge per person per day for breakfast was high at 22 euros We had tea coffee facilities in the room and bought pastries in the supermarket for breakfast, The room was large especially as we had three adults from the same family sharing the room It was nice to have a separate bathroom shower room and dressing area It gave us all some privacy The air con in the room was very effective and was easy to adjust it was also relatively quiet so did not disturb our sleep It was a great central location and we could walk to most places from the hotel The Hop on Hop off bus stopped right outside We had no problem finding somewhere to eat within walking distance However if you don t can t walk there was always a taxi outside and the regular buses stopped outside as well 
381393,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I lost 100 price cream inside room and staff said that it was not possible somebody had touched it But anyway I checked out without cream So my advice is please take care and put all minimum precious inside safebox ,No Positive
381394,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Was quite shocked how I called room service 8 times until someone picked up the phone Then we called again to request somebody to pick up the dishes after we finished the meal but no one came , Room is spacious 
381395,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, 5 hotel and missed bathrobes in the room strange for such hotel level Bathrobes have been arranged to the room after telephone call to reception Water in shower drained very slow as drain pipes most probably partly clogged, Location is very close to Cruise Terminal as we ve booked hotel for 1 night prior to join Costa Diadema Breakfast is very good with big selection of pastry cold cuts fruits etc
381396,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Cause check in takes so bloody long 3pm is check in bit didn t get into my room till 4 30pm cause they needed more time to clean etc, The room was fantastic 
381397,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Front desk staff weren t helpful at all and not friendly The pool area was small and not much in the way of seating options The front lobby area was extremely hot when we arrived and stayed that way throughout our stay , The view from our room was spectacular The breakfast was wonderful with a wide variety of choices The staff at breakfast were super nice The bed and pillows were super comfy and we enjoyed the whirlpool tub and shower too The hotel is centrally located and we were able to walk to do everything we had planned Bikes are available at the hotel too 
381398,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We booked a family suite that was almost double our friends 2 rooms that they booked It was just two rooms with adjoining front area We were put on the second floor with no view and our friends were put on the seventh floor with a beautiful view Small pool I would ve expected a much bigger but beautiful views and great bartenders Food selection in the eating areas needs to be more kid friendly The room service menu was more family friendly than the restaurants We ended up eating food in the room , The late night bar with the views was amazing of the city and the port The bar staff was excellent The location is close to everything 
381399,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Our room wasn t fully cleaned when we arrived The air conditioning in the lobby was no good For us this was not a 4 1 2 star hotel , The gym bar and the service at the bar was great The swimming pool and the facility there was good 
381400,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff check in and check out process too slow and can not manage anything The swimmingpool is like a bath tube very very small , breakfast is very good
381401,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Booked Romantic package didn t receive Romantic package Deluxe room overlooked a flat roof Booked hotel due to availability of pool however lack of sun beds and or seating made it impossible to use the facility I would probably book a hotel closer to the city had I known this Lack of reception staff meant long delays , Great location Good concierge Good restaurant Great room once issue sorted out with reception Nice pool area and bar Consistent Hot water in bathroom Romantic Package once reception resolved forgetting to give us the package relocated us to a proper suite with a view of the city 
381402,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the service at the front desk is awful instead of being offered a glass of champagne I d prefer a swifter check in and check out swimming pool disappointing so small , large room and bathroom
381403,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The location far from the centre because u r in the port and so so far from the swimming beach i didnt stay 5 minutes in the pool which was so small and disappointing, Nice room nice staff nice view clean
381404,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Noisy cruise ships literally docking and looking into our room each day Air con was too tempremental too hot or way too cold , Staff were lovely professional and attentive Breakfast spread was good Location was great for getting to most places on foot we did a lot of walking Room was a good size and clean 
381405,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, My only complaint with the hotel was the food It was very expensive and not the best We had tapas in the 1st floor bar they were awful We also had room service and the portions were tiny 17E for a Caesar salad and it was the tiniest size I have ever seen much smaller than a starter size I found this salad quite offensive I would come back to the hotel but I would worry about the food I would not eat in the hotel but i always need breakfast in the hotel so this would put me off returning We had room service breakfast and ate in the hotel for breakfast both poor in the restaurant slightly better and very overpriced, The staff were very welcoming and professional They were very helpful too and met all my requests We loved our room and it was kept very clean Fantastic location too 
381406,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Had a Gun boat out side the window playing very loudspeakers music late at night and early in morning for hours dancing drinking at night also keep looking up at our window making rude annoying signs what a nightmare wasted the Hoilday break we had won t go back it s a shame just as well we were out all the time enjoying Barcelona to its full, Bed was nice good breakfast easy to walk to shops Ect clean and staff was nice
381407,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I reported the spar bath in our room did not work and was never fixed , The breakfast choice was first class Staff extremely helpful A fantastic family holiday with amazing views over harbour and sea Location central but very quiet 
381408,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Unfortunately the day we were checking out there was a taxi strike in Barcelona We ended up almost missing our flight trying to figure out how to best get to the airport It surprised me that the hotel did not notify us of this when we were checking out that morning I also found that for a 5 star hotel there was not a lot of 5 star qualities On one day I asked for our room to be cleaned and they must have forgotten on that day I had to ask again when we got back to the hotel late that night as they had also forgotten to do turndown service They also ran out of green tea and a pillow I was after These things are minor but for a 5 star I would expect more , We had a nice view of the marina from our room The bed was extra large and comfortable 
381409,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, The hotel was perfectly located to walk to all the restaurants on the key side and the Rambles was close The staff were very accommodating and friendly I would definitely use this hotel again 
381410,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Pool was small Breakfast was expensive for what you got, Nice location by marina Gym was good for a city hotel Tapas in bar was excellent Rooftop bar was nice in the sun 
381411,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the pool is to small the music blasting from the cheap tinny speakers of the tacky cruise boat Ada moored along side of the hotel was awful in fact unnecessary and rude , From the smile of the first member of staff to greet us the entrance lobby the lifts rooms beds showers towels gym roof top room service breakfast gym to checkout everything is magnificent I will be returning for my third stay very soon
381412,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Food and drinks at the bar were a little expensive Although very close to the shopping mall it is a little far 15 20 minutes from the beach , Hotel was excellent Staff were amazing always very helpful they lent my friend and I each plug adapters when I lost my room key they made me another within minutes on my first night I was desperate to find an Irish bar to watch the boxing one of the gentlemen spent around 15 minutes looking online and drawing on a map various places I could go etc They were always smiling and happy to help Sauna was perfect 
381413,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, I can not say enough about how nice the hotel was We were greeted with champagne or orange juice and everybody was so accommodating They ended up giving us the presidential suite and it was unbelievablely beautiful It made our first night in Europe 
381414,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I ve booked the Premier Room with Balcony 45sqm 484sqft with extra large double bed being convinced tricked by the pictures that a 5 stars hotel on the sea coast in Barcelona can only have great views for a Premier room We got to the hotel at 14 00 First strange thing instead of scanning my credit card they ve made me pay the whole stay in advance Hotel policy they said Ok I ve paid then asked for the card to go upstairs But surprise there s not room yet The hotel was too busy the night before so they re still cleaning the room for us Not great but ok We have to wait at least one hour They ask our phone number to call us when the room is ready In the meantime they offer us a card to get any complementary drink we d like from the hotel bar We get to the bar and ask for an Aperol and a beer Surprise again they can only offer us beer and wine as complementary drinks Finally the bar tender is offering us a small Aperol Hm 5 stars you say Ok An hour and a half passes and we get no call So we show ourselves to the front desk Surprise again the room is ready since half hour but nobody bothered to tell us We go upstairs and there comes the nastiest suprise the room faces the court yard which is surrounded by the Conference Center So we re looking at walls The bed is not double but a twin And not that we cared about the room size the view was what we wanted but the room is nowhere near the 45sqm 484sqft More like 30sqm 323sqft This time we re angry We return to the front desk and we calmly although we shouldn t be calm anymore express our dissatisfaction The first thing the manager tries is to trick me She claims that is a Premier Room And of course she claims that the misleading pictures presented on booking com are not firm offer Now I m angry ,No Positive
381415,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The hotel is located far away from everything at least 20 minutes to decent restaurants and 45 minutes from night life and is horrendously overpriced for what is provided I travelled in mid season mid week and paid 220 Euros I had problems in EuroStars at Valencia too I would not reccomend this Eurostars chain at all The Barcelona Eurostars hotel was okay but for a high priced 5 star hotel there were scratches on the floor lights that didn t work properly and general inattentiveness from staff after check in The pool is very tiny and the sauna is located in the bathroom in the gym A cleaner walked into the room even though we were checking out in 15 minutes at 12pm which demonstrated to be disorganisation The hotel is generally far from everything and the roof bar closes at 11pm The roof bar was one of the main reasons I picked the hotel as they advertise a ambient rooftop bar But there is no ambience at all and staff were not polite on the rooftop bar when I was asking some questions about the area There was one nice staff member who let me take some photos at midnight whilst he cleaned the gym I would have been quite upset if I didn t get these photos Also there is no security whatsoever the lifts are not locked and the hotel is accessible from the outside perimetre I noticed at night there was teens hanging around that clearly shouldn t have been near the facility Save your money DO NOT STAY HERE , Comfortable bed complimentary cocktail 
381416,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Hotel management was not understanding when i requested a refund of the first night as we discovered that there was a strick in Madrid train station which caused us to arrive to Barcelona one day late , Staff was very friendly Nicoles at the reception was so supportive and friendly 
381417,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Hotel desperately need refurbishment Carpets at the public areas look quite old and although staff is cleaning it daily it look like it is dirty Same with floors in the rooms parquet surface has been scratched a lot and regardless if it is clean or not it gives immpresion that it is not clean At the gym would be much appreciated to have a fruit bowl or at least to have fresh juices at the bar there , Staff was very pleasant and professional Service at the dinning room was quite well 
381418,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, To buy water is really expensive Small room, Great location Value for money The staff were really pleasant especially the valet parking that always welcome you with a smile Great view of the port Very comfy pillows
381419,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, A little dissapointed with the cable car tower which was right in front of the hotel No sign of it on the website when I made the booking There was a lack of plug sockets in our room a superior double which was somewhat annoying Not enough tea coffee and no toilet brush in the bathroom , Very comfortable super king bed It was very quiet considering we were alongside a busy port the breakfast was excellent and staff welcoming and friendly 
381420,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, On arrival was upgraded to a lovely suite bed very comfortable room service meal was promptly delivered front desk staff were welcoming and helpful 
381421,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the swimming pool small cold and not in use , Everything else the extras for which you have no category here included brilliant food delightful staff and BEAUTIFUL decor and live piano at the idyllic bar each evening sometimes guitar at breakfast 
381422,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, It s a typical mass production hotel I booked for 6 nights but I left only after 1 night to stay in another 5 star hotel however I had to pay 2 nights due to booking com cancellation policy and I wouldn t mind doing that I stayed in many 5 stars hotels in my life and that can t be one of them starting from the entrance of the hotel is very dull and creepy The room is big that s true and it has a view from the 6th floor which is a very limited over the sea which was blocked by a big vessel that block almost the whole view The commiseration with the reservation team in the hotel was a disaster I had to text them and call them couple of times to assure my stay would be comfortable Before booking they promised my an upgrade to a superior room in the 6th floor and they did so but really the room wasn t clean I saw stains on the glass of the window that can t clean and the bath tub has some black residual stains and I had to clean them hard before getting in the shower has residuals hair from the previous guest The TV wasn t facing the bed so I had to wist my body all the time it wasn t comfortable at all The room wasn t sound proof at all as I was hearing the guest next room turning on very loud music When I informed the hotel and complained they promised me another room in the 8th floor that is smaller but has a better view to the city I appreciated that from their side but I thought if I had to pack I d rather leave to another hotel with a better location The location of the hotel is quite bad as I had to walk 15 minutes to get to the Rambla streat I didn t try the swimming pool neither the breakfast so I can t comment about that I appreciate though some efforts of some individuals in the hotel that tried to make my stay more comfortable , The room was big 
381423,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful the food served for both breakfast in the corner was great the location was brilliant The hotel has great views of the harbour and is approximately a 20minute walk from the beach
381424,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Buffet area too close to tables and chaotic at peak times has to be changed Loud rap music at breakfast definitely no no No night curtains Sticky door lock room 739 also huge pillar blocking fantastic sea view, Cava wine at breakfast Freshest orange juice Attentive and pleasant staff Held luggage delivered to rooms before we got there excellent gesture Room very spacious and bathroom and toilet excellent for space and decor Generous mirrors behind every door
381425,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, A bit too busy and tight breakfast area for a 5 star facility Too few sunbeds on the top floor terrace An inside pool or at least a jacuzzi would have been appreciated , I ve stayed at this hotel several times Great location in Barcelona Good restaurant Views Welcoming staff 
381426,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, Very nice rooms big and clean the bathroom was having bidet which is very important point to me especially in Europe where there is no water supply with the WC usually the staff were amazing very helpful and supportive the hotel location is great close to la Rambla street and to the most of attractions in Barcelona the sightseeing bus station is right front the hotel 10 min walking to the metro station I enjoyed my stay at this hotel 
381427,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The wall is too thin Actually there is only a sliding door separate my room and the neighbor So I can hear everything happening next door , Location is wonderful Friendly stuff Spacious room with nice jacuzzi bathtub
381428,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, you can hear your next room it is very noisy the reception does not look like a 5 star hotel also the left too old the atmosphere of the place is not for a hotel i complained about the noise but the staff told me we always face this problem but the Manger ignore us really I didn t expect this,No Positive

381435,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The hotel was very good apart from a party next door which i have to say the staff dealt with the next day and evicted the occupants We felt slightly disapointed that even with 2 weeks notice they wouldn t alter our booking to 3 nights instead of 4 as we had to come home for our grandson going in hospital for a major operation ,No Positive

381439,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The hotel and furnishings are very worn and damaged andreally need an upgrade The bed was really saggy and you could see the indentation of each side where people have been sleeping It smelt very musty and the basin drains were plugged when I arrived in the room I unplugged them to wash my hands and when I returned a few hours later the whole room smelt like dirty drains Also when I turned on the light in the night there were silverfish moths everywhere and I hope none are now in my suitcase eating my clothes I would stay elsewhere , The staff were lovely and very helpful The city view was amazing I was upgraded two room types on arrival 
381440,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room service personnel were a bit under pressure and in a rush during one of the stormy evenings Coffee and pastries in a room service were a bit overpriced , Very comfortable rooms with amazing views over marina Large bathroom with Jacuzzi was a very pleasant surprise We were welcomed at the reception with a glass of cava Great location walking distance to La Ramblas and Barcelonetta beach

381445,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the only disappointment for us was the fact hat we were unable to use the rooftop terrace We were there as part of a number of trips to celebrate our 50th and 60th Birthdays and would have love to have had champagne on the roof top terrace Unfortunately this was not to be and nothing pre warned us of this Quite disappointing , The Hotel the room 606 the staff all excellent We did not eat in so I could not comment on the food The bar service and atmosphere excellent Comfy Bed clean and quiet room all excellent

381447,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I am struggling to find anything wrong with this hotel , The Hotel was very quiet but so close to the centre of Barcelona we walked to the Ramblas each morning and had breakfast at the Market That was after a perfect nights sleep in such a big bed We had a shower bath and balcony The bus stops and taxis were located a few feet from the Hotel entrance A perfect place to stay in Barcelona

381472,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Main first floor lobby area being renovated meant that the hotel didn t have much to offer in terms of hotel lobby features The Qube lobby bar restaurant outside of 1st floor was ok but disconnected and not well used While in a good location hotel is out of the main city centre where the tourist places are So it was always a long walk or taxi ride to go to the Gothic Quarter or anywhere worth visiting Being a little out of the central area it gives you nice views of the city from over the Marina So overall good but not great , Bed comfort

381491,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The toilet paper roll and the telephone in the toilet touches my knee when you sit on WC When i informed the front desk staff they replied they cannot do anything Secondly the TV in the room is on left side so you have to sleep left side to watch anything , Location near to al rambla street The staff were very helpful

381504,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, not good reception services no lounge restaurant not really inviting Not very efficient in the timing of room cleaning Often in the late afternoon roooms where not cleaned Disappointing the lack of flexibility for late check out in the afternoon unless paying the entire rate of course Not a 5 stars in our view price not worth the quality and not client oriented Would not return for sure it is more a business place for people staying few nights , Nice rooms although view is not as expected Family rooms are actually 2 rooms connected It is allowed only one children in the sofa even if small therefore it is necessary to take two rooms Breakfast quality and service very good Location just ok
381505,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, This hotel was perfect and beyond my expectations Booked the room for our last night in Spain to ease our travel to the BCN early the next morning The harbor location provided easy walking access to the Barri Gotic and Las Ramblas The service was exceptional and took care of our arrangements for the way too early departure the next day The room was drop dead gorgeous and comfortable beyond belief Just what we needed after some demanding travels The pillows were exceptional And you could even contact room service if you preferred a different type never seen that before What put this hotel over the top for us were the service and the view Looking in to Barcelona from the harbor watching the boats and the light change as the sun set Wow Must go to the uber cool lounge and have the signature cocktail and the unique tapas 
381506,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Not as convenient to city attractions as it is to the port but we were there for a cruise embarkation , Beautiful and quiet hotel located in the harbor near the cruise ship dock Therefore its location was very convenient for us The view was nice and our room was gorgeous The staff in the bar dining area were very pleasant and the view from the rooftop bar was spectacular 
381507,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The hotel s hot tub was out of order which was not mentioned and a bit misleading The pool is a lot smaller than pictured and had a large chunk of wood broken off one side with nails exposed Long wait for checking in despite many staff Also the hallways reek of smoke that spills into the room even after requesting a non smoking facility The location is a bit out of the way not very near many attractions Absolutely worst paella ever at hotel restaurant and extremely slow service , The room was spacious and had a nice view Free welcome drink

381510,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, When we use the bathtub hydro massage there were some small black larvae that came out of the system tubes The Hotel management changed our room to one with a better view and offered us a bottle of wine but that was not enough to forget that the maintenance is not done The price was very high for our expectations Some staff where very friendly others not ,No Positive
381511,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I really didn t like this hotel which ironically was the most expensive one We got relocated here so didn t choose it specifically It is a business hotel and not for leisure The dark wood is quite depressing and the rooms are a nice size but dark and not very welcoming It wasn t in the marina and the roof terrace was not very inviting Also its not good if you feel claustrophobic ,No Positive
381512,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The bed was too soft There were no boxes of tissues Very unbecoming of 5 stars hotel The location is a very long walk to the super market or restaurants The hotel was not generous in giving laundry bags tooth brushes and paste Our request for early check in was totally ignored till I had to insist on checking in as stipulatated 3pm because they could not get room ready even after my internet request stated clearly we had travelled 13 hours flight and were tired I was sick after this 13 hours flight and despite my request this hotel just cannot make 1 room earlier Quite ridiculous , Breakfast was good Restaurant staff were good 
381513,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We had a few issues with the shower and water pressure although the hotel had a major leak in the lobby which could have been the reason behind excessively hot water one night followed by a loss of water pressure and no hot water the following day Came right though , We were given a large room with separate lounge area overlooking the Port It was lovely and within easy walking distance to the Gothic quarter of Barcelona 
381514,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I d used to have a room mini bar refilled daily in a 5 hotels that was not the same in Grand Marina Twice for 5 day stay there were some techniical problems with the cold water in the bath including the one i was taking a shower while ingeneers fixingthe problem noone informed it was going to happen And having a birthday within the stay no sign of any congrats card from teh hotel management 9even after informingthem about the day of birthday not that i needed the card but too strange for a 5 management reputation, a wonderful location with nice views both for the city and the sea
381515,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Bar and restaurant was uninteresting and the noise in the corridors particularly the maids in the morning from 7am was awful Room was small and the tv did not work, Reception staff were excellent other than directing us to a bar that was not open at that time Location is perfect amazing view from my room
381516,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We were due to leave the hotel between 0800 and 08 30 But we were unable to have a shower or use toilet facilities due to the water in the hotel being cut off We had to find this out for ourselves but had no solution offered to us by the hotel , The location The breakfast and the staff

381521,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff are not the helpful and they lack for profissionalisim It charges as a modern hotel while it look old but not ancient You have to tip in way to get the service Not always you sill find the staff at the concierge Breakfast isnt delicious, The location mainly the balcony
381522,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Rooftop pool is only a dipping pool Photos make it look much bigger The paving slabs on the rooftop are all very loose so you have to be careful when walking particularly older people Very easy to trip up Do not get booked into room 309 you will be able to swim around the bathroom it s an old shower that sprays water everywhere quite dangerous on a marble floor when you have to step in and out of a bathtub Deluxe Rooms with single beds have separate shower area much better Tea coffee doesn t get replaced after the first day if you ve used it Food and drink is very expensive , Great location for proximity to Las Ramblas and the Marina Tour buses leave from about a minute walk from door of hotel Beautiful setting with beautiful views if you are lucky to get a room with a view Very comfortable bed Taxis available outside all the time unless of course its raining 
381523,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Poorly staff receiption A smartalic doorman who is not funny Understaffed breakfast crew Roof top is in shambles loose tiles broken tiles trip hazards needs a renovation and cleaning This is where the views and their photos are taken from a farce Bar service is extremely slow Rooms on 8th floor so dark with all lights on you can not read , Welcome drink of your choice Breakfast was descent 
381524,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I would have liked better lighting in the room but this is a problem with most hotel rooms We were disappointed not to be able to get a drink from the roof top bar until the evening , Our room was spacious the bed very large and comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space and shelving for the time we were there The staff were all very efficient and friendly The tour buses stopped a few minutes from the hotel and taxis were readily available To walk to the Rambles area took us about 10 minutes so everything is very accessible We also liked that we could walk around the corner for breakfast of coffee and pastry at very little cost so didn t need to pay hotel prices for this 
381525,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The aircon on the rooms were too hot and if we changed the control a green light shone on the bed all night we asked for help but nothing happened and I couldn t ge them to understand Also the English of the Front desk need to be improved by some staff and housekeeping it is no good if you cant explain the problem , Loved the breakfast and the proxsimity of the hotel the staff were very helpful those that understood English
381526,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, keycard failed to work 4 times but porter was quick in rectifying the problem safe had similar problem hairdryer permanently plugged in in bathroom and no extraction for shower steam water as liquid or steam and electricity dont mix unsafe no turndown or evening change of towels except on request which in a 5star should be routine pool area poor several loose flagstones were a hazard, bed was very comfortable room spacious no sea view available despite pre request lounge area very comfortable
381527,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I couldn t fault anything staff went out of their way to be helpful, I had to travel alone as my husband couldn t go I was so glad I chose the Grand Marina initially for location but I wasn t disappointed I was even adopted by a lovely Irish American family who took me to the cruise ship the next day The Grand Marina was a fantastic start to my adventure Everything went very smoothly and very impressed by the ship sailing past my window 
381528,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The floor we were on smelled of cigarette smoke and the floor of our balcony was stained possibly where cigarettes has been stubbed out We are non smokers and wished we had asked for non smoking room , Really welcoming staff and very helpful

381531,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, This Hotel claims a 5 star rating In my opinion it is not Rooftop terrace was dissapointing with broken flooring and broken loungers around the pool area Wifi on the rooftop terrace also very poor Staffing levels were also inadequate around the pool and bar area during the day time I would not recommend this property to another traveller Stay in the City centre as the location is not great in my opinion , We booked a family suite and the rooms were of a excellent size The bathrooms too were very spacious and nicely appointed However despite having a terrace there was bizzarly no furniture on the terrace Maid service was excellent each morning 
381532,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staffs were unfriendly and very rude Facility was old and not clean Price was expensive and did not described the quality Be carful before choosing of this hotel I will never come there again, Only location 
381533,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Not having a view and not a walking distance to attractions Its a part of WTC 4 bldgs in a square shape hotel should be moved to one of the bldgs overlooking the sea , Spacious rooms and balconies
381534,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No continental breakfast Only 5 facial tissues in a packet in the baths Very irritating Cheap toilet paper Service fee for ice delivered to room Location is dicey having to use the roundabout entrance at the WTC This roundabout and the lights are very difficult to figure out and the roundabout is dangerous to negotiate We got stopped by police for running a red light to the hotel entrance at the WTC because the light was so high up over our car and on the side of the road that we didn t even know it was there Driving in Barcelona is pretty awful anyway so the hotel could make it easier to get to the hotel with much better directions , The Tapas menu is terrible It s pretentious and tasteless and expensive The Club Sandwich was terrific The dinner choices are also pretentious and a bit of a mystery Facial tissues in bathroom daily allotment 5 facial tissues pre packaged For the cost of the room this is ridiculous Staff was helpful and attentive They could use some more staff to take care of luggage for guests The entrance reception area outside the front of the hotel was the best Those guys know what they are doing and do it well The food could be greatly improved and it would be nice to go to breakfast and be able to ORDER a continental breakfast rather than pay a huge buffet fee for 75 of the food you re not going to eat Why can t anyone get a cup of coffee in a paper cup to take to the room That s a rip off if you only want a continental breakfast The room showers are the best We had a key door opening problem which was finally fixed after the staff changed the door handle 
381535,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The pool area was smaller than we expected but this didn t spoil our trip Whilst the room was lovely it was not actually the room we booked and having waited until 3pm we were then told it was still not ready and offered the alternative which we took By then we were exhausted from travelling so decided to take what was offered however it really was a lovely room just not what we booked , The room was fantastic with a separate hall way and the bath and shower rooms were also separate We also had a nice balcony with a view of the hotel restaurant and a a partial sea view The pool area though smaller than expected was lovely and clean lots of sunbeds and a great view of the port The restaurant was good value for breakfast with lots of options Our son loved the daily free sweets in reception We booked the hotel as we were going on a Disney Cruise from the adjacent port and its location is absolutely fab Very close to the Ramblas and marina lots of bars restaurants etc 
381536,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Found some of the staff quite rude apart from the reception manager Christopher who was excellent , Breakfast choice and quality was excellent Rooms were big and comfortable pillows were amazing Views from floor 8 were great and in a good location 
381537,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Extremely bad hotel stuff We should go to their neighbor W hotel 100 meters away immediately Hotel OLD and USED Furniture in the room scratched Floor even more Management also FAILED to train stuff No will do attitude exists We tried to take a taxi from hotel drive in The reception guy run on us screaming NOOOO this is the taxi I ordered for my client What is your favorite horror movie Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina in Barcelona To say goodbye they charged us twice , Unfortunately nothing 
381538,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Early check in for those just getting off international flights would have been nice but wasn t possible Because of the wait more comfortable main lobby seating would have helped , Best buffet breakfast Had everything possible Presented well Friendly staff 
381539,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No exceptions to any early check in before 3 pm We had to wait from 8 a m off boarded from cruise ship until 3 pm before they would issue a room Claimed no rooms available Must be issues with their house cleaning staff and no hospitality to cruise clientele Many guests were treated this way which is unfortunate especially for the price they charge Restaurant services limited and not friendly All of this occurred with our first stay before the cruise as well so this seems to be consistent level of service They were actually 40 minutes late in getting us a room upon 1st check in This was frustrating since we travel a lot and this is not the norm for most hotels , Room was excellent Room Service good Concierge services were excellent and accommodating Luggage services were managed well front greeters 
381540,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room service absolutely awful every order over six days was wrong or not exactly what we asked for most of the food was disgusting and poorly presented plus absolutely extortionate prices for the quality Was told we would get a refund for the food we couldn t eat or returned because of the quality but found the amount taken off our bill was taken off my credit card as a separate payment ,No Positive
381541,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Waited 2 hrs to check in although I came at 4 pm seems it is a problem on daily bases as I see people waiting in the lobby for their rooms everyday I think the reception is understaffed and can t handle the busy season Hotel lobby is very small and not impressive , Location Modern rooms Breakfast is average Good room service Good Wifi speed 
381542,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The rules of the hotel are so complicated and the rules of the check out its way too early and can t extend your check out time even if we want to pay for it, I like the place so much it s so comfortable
381543,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, The location was the best thing in the hotel nothing else was interesting especially that we thought we would receive a perfect service We asked for a nife and a plate in a night and the room service requested for 5 that s an example By the way the room was charged 290

381546,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We had booked a family suite which should have been two interconnecting rooms each with its own lounge and dining area We d chosen this as we have three children 5 and Nader and wanted to put the kids to bed so we could have dinner and watch a film Not sure why but they made an error with our booking and squeezed us all into one room and charge us the same rate , The hotel was in a great location and was a really lovely hotel 
381547,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Seemed under managed Staff were not very invested in making customers happy They seemed confused and unhappy most of the time Priced as a business hotel it gets some of the basics wrong for example it took 20 minutes to get a cup of coffee at breakfast both days Rooms are well designed but have significant maintenance issues knobs missing etc so it feels like new build even when it isn t I think there is a need for improved management not least at the front desk and in the restaurant Barcelona has a lot of options and this place isn t earning its money Oh and the pool is really a large bathtub so don t believe the pictures on the website Definately not a venue for a family vacation Also considerable evidence of how to say it hooking up of a professional nature Basically this hotel would be a better fit in Eastern Europe than one of the world s greatest cities , Location
381548,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Security Concept was Not Good to much Strange People and so many Bagage in Rezeption without any Metal Detektors Breakfast very smal Place and The staff except The reception was very Moody, The Location The Roof Bar The Bed comfort The Price Service value was ok

381580,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, some of the staffs not responding to customers They asked me to pay all money upfront which was not mentioned before , the localtion was good and the breakfast and the east of commute between places
381581,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Cruise ships are embarking daily next to the Hotel and keep their engines running Apart from the noise also the exhaust gasses forced us to leave the bar and swimming pool on the 8 floor several times during our stay , Very nice and cheap breakfast and lunchbar next to the hotel on the WTC plaza Also a very nice shopping mall and good restaurants at walking distance in the port vell 
381582,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Hotel suitable for Business purposes but not for vacation Breakfast area veeeery noisy quiet spots only outside but only a few tables available Breakfast buffet is only ok but the same every day , Good location near La Rambla and Maremagnum
381583,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Although I booked one superior room for 2 adults and one kid and paid in advance when I got there I was told they are fully booked and I need to pay 120 day for an extra bed for my kid Also kids above 2 years are considered adults and charged 27 5 day for breakfast They were barely cleaning the room once per day no toiletries at all I was charged 25 day for car parking although nowere was mentioned and nobody told me The huge swimming pool in the photos is the size of a jacuzzi Buffet for breakfast is very poor staffs in the hotel not well trained and undriendly I have no idea how this hotel got 5 stars in reality the services are of a 3 stars hotel ,No Positive
381584,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, A bit pricey no connected rooms for families only family suites Breakfast buffet is OK but can use more flavors , Friendly staff good location and clean spacious rooms
381585,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room service slightly slow and restaurant manager should not be in his job He is the opposite of everyone in the hotel and believes he is superior to his customers and employees Such a shame , Perfect service friendly and efficient Wonderful pool and poolside staff Awesome check in process 
381586,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, Upgraded on arrival Staff were so polite Beds were very comfortable Bathrooms amazing shower and bath with jaccuzi One of the best hotels I ve stayed in Definitely recommending and will be coming again
381587,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The pictures of the size of the pool on the website are very misleading Heard many a guest commenting as we did about how small it actually was , Stayed in a junior suite and was pleasantly surprised at the size and layout of the room The bed was enormous and the standard of cleanliness in the whole hotel was excellent 
381588,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The Whirl pool bath was cheap with gaps in the grout the room service food was plain the wifi was pretty slow and the gym was small without much equipment I expected more The checking in was so bad everyday there were people waiting in the lobby with bags , The pillow Menu was nice 
381589,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Recptionists are rude we did not get next doors rooms we arrived at 3 pm but our rooms were not ready then we got one room when I called to check if the other room is ready she told me yes come to take the key instead of sending the key this is not 5 stars hotel service , Great location clean rooms nice lobby porters are friendly 
381590,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Swimming Pool is much smaller than photos indicate major talking point with guests Price of food is ridiculous at the hotel there is a daytime restaurant in the WTC at a fraction of the cost really nice Go there instead , Rooftop area and great views
381591,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Their restaurant was expensive and absolutely terrible A fish restaurant in Barcelona at that price should be amazing and was just garbage Spent 200 for upset stomach and pretty sue some of the seafood was questionable and dated Staff was nice but we were only customers and still they couldn t keep up , Room was a suite but faced the port and parking lot but had balcony so was ok
381592,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, At almost 400US a night there was no breakfast included in that price nor was parking included It s really hard to give hotels top notch ratings when they refuse to even include the basics The pool was a slightly oversized hot tub actually in Sweden we ve enjoyed a hot tub larger than their pool There is an adorable boutique hotel in the middle of the city that has a way nicer pool but a rooftop that isn t even 1 5 the size of this place wish we were still there It starts with an O if you re interested and serves some of the best tapas in town Cocktails here started at 12Euros We went to some really nice restaurants and their cocktails weren t even 1 2 that price so I m not sure what you re paying for because it certainly wasn t the ambiance Other patrons were of questionable character There were American frat boys old Russian men with child brides or escorts and a guy with gang terrorist themed tattoos all over his body Multiple locations in the building guests were extremely loud and up until 6am one night and another group was up until 3am the next night keep in mind we were here during the middle of the week Somewhere else people were smoking pot which filled our room with the smell Needless to say we didn t get much rest Our room was never made up until well after 4 30pm We would go out all day come back for a break or to use the pool and without fail they would knock on our door sometime between 4 30 5 30 to clean our room so we would leave again to accommodate their late cleaning schedule Plus when you take a shower the water gets all over the bathroom floor and make sure your curtains are closed if you have a courtyard side room or all the office workers in the building that make up the open square will get quite the show Better off sticking with the Travelodge or ilk if you re going to stay at a chain hotel , The rooms were a decent size It was a bit out of the way if you want to get to the beaches but within walking distance of La Rambla and the hop on hop off bus routes The lounging area on top of the hotel was huge with plenty of lounge seating for about 30 guests plus a bar with additional seating The downstairs staff was really great and helpful in all matters when it came to printing things off restaurant recommendations and things to do around the city 
381593,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Having paid for a room with a balcony and river view We did not get Instead they upgraded to a junior suite with a view of the adjoining office blocks I was less than impressed after having travelled over 6000miles and wondered the streets of Barcelona from 10am until 3pm before we could access a room ,No Positive
381594,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, i wouldn t change a thing , the breakfast buffet was spectactular staff was warm and always smiling had a great view of the water a great view from the rooftop gym and sauna were a major plus it was quite the luxury experience 
381595,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, Fab hotel with attentive and impeccably mannered staff throughout Food is great and no dearer than any like 5 star hotel Some have complained that it took time for their order to arrive well sorry quality takes time you re on holiday so chill and grab a beer whilst your waiting Our room was super with lovely views of the harbour and multi million pound yachts The most expensive yacht in the world Katara moored right outside our room it was memorising Room lovely and quiet as double glazed and adequately air conditioned Turning down service if you want it and you can even change your pillows to another deluxe set if you like a positive not a negative Had a television in the room but never watched it as I was on holiday and was either on the roof terrace by the pool drinking Pi a colada or in the town port having a great time And when in the room it was spacious with all you needed bath robes dryer nice shampoos toothpaste and brush shaver and foam Well stocked mini bar And tea and coffee facilities Had a great steam iron too so I looked impeccably smart when going out and there was a mega comfy bed to sink into at the end of the day Enjoy and remember you are on holiday P S La Rambla is a short walk away 
381596,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Restaurants fairly expensive vs the service you get tend to be waiting sometime Not very attentive appear to be short of staff Ferries arriving late evening through night are disturbing as droning humming of engines woke us up as these dock close to the hotel Some small niggles such as ironing board provided was broken the iron was the cheapest they could buy The beverages provided in the room such as tea coffee were very limited considering how much we were paying for the room per night 600 surely could put a few more out per day Wished pillow selection was available in the room rather than having to call someone to change them WiFi was playing up couldn t always connect Only 1 TV in the room would have liked to have seen another in the bedroom area why not one in the bathroom area as well The balcony sliding door didn t lock , Luxury suite had good view of some of the harbour city Good sized rooms with a spacious bathroom Bed was very large with fairly comfortable mattress Staff we had dealings with were polite curtious 
381597,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The seagulls were loud But I guess that s out of their control Haha , Beautiful suite totally equipped with everything we needed Delicious room service and all in all a wonderful quick stay 
381598,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Maybe 4 star would be more realistic It s nice but nothing outstanding, The bed was extremely comfortable and the a c was great Nice rooftop terrace with a bar but it s overpriced
381599,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Good size hotel room with a very comfortable bed The bathroom was huge If you are looking for a quiet location near the port this is the place Within walking distance to Las Ramblas 
381600,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, booked the executive room w balcony which only provided space to stand in the 2 5 wide area it didn t have any normal balcony amenities for seating only allowed for sliding door to open for ventilation but no other purpose for the balcony , great location for seeing Barcelona easy access to transportation right out the front entrance great location on marina with great restaurants and tour sites a short walk away nice rooftop pool sun deck bar area for fabulous views of the marina and city 
381601,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Outside siting area on the 1st floor is beautiful should have decent food menu overpriced and small portions of appetizers Needs better happening atmosphere great location but not fun to hang out Definitely needs music Especially when there were games going on you should have a bar tender outside maybe even a complimentary finger food from the hotel , Beautiful location great sized clean rooms friendly staff 
381602,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Some Junior Front of House staff that lacked experience but they were all helpful and happy , Stayed for a week All facilities were excellent The location is one of the best in Barcelona stunning views particularly looking back from the peninsula can see the entire city and coast very close to the port and 15 minutes walk from San Sebastian beach La Rambla very close if that s your thing Most staff were top notch and presented great service Going back in September 16 so can t be bad Location Location Location 
381603,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Considering the fantastic location out room had a tiny window that looked out over the air conditioning units even though I requested a sea view room, Fantastic location
381604,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I got the greatest room in the hotel room 715 but the glasses were to dirty and didn t let us to see the amazing view we have They told us there is a company which came once a week but it will be great if for the weekends the glasses can be clean , The hotel was really nice and the people in front desk was very kind I left the hotel on Monday and I need to come back for a few ours on Friday to Barcelona and they let me to left my bags in the hotel in the meantime for my next fly An amazing details from them
381605,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The walls are thin so I could hear my very loud neighbors The bathroom would ve been great if the shower head was fixed and the water temperature was easier to set it jumped from icy to fiery in an instant My view wasn t nice either ,No Positive
381606,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The variety in breakfast was not adequate We stayed at Kaktus Plaza in Calella and found atleast 100 varieties in breakfast Items in breakfast too limited and neither had choices of fresh juices , Rooms very comfortable Room temperatures very well maintained 
381607,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, The views from the roof bar on the 8th floor were amazing both day and night The staff were very friendly and very helpful We would definitely consider staying here again 
381608,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Indifferent personnel not helpful Not a good welcome No city information given upon arrival The shower panel was too small the whole bathroom got wet after a shower Too expensive for the service Facilities are not good enough for a five star hotel , Good sized room and bed 
381609,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, we wanted a good view and we got view to the other sides of the building instead the bathroom had jacuzzi but it wasn t good the water always drained the swimming pool is too small , the location is ok the crew was generous 
381610,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The swimming pool was really small only for a dip not for swimming Not enough of deck chair on the roof we didn t manage to get any deck chair to rest and enjoy the view for our entire stay I personally feel that the security at this hotel is too loose anyone can just walk in and out the hotel and enjoy the facilities No scanning of room card required for the use of lift to get to all level no staff at roof level s counter no identity required to use the facilities of the hotel Feel unsafe and there is one early morning around 7am someone knocked on the door without identifying themselves and I was too scared to open the door as not sure who is out there it can be anyone Bathtub was not very clean with blackish discoloration hence I dare not to use at all , We got a room with sea view which was very nice room was spacious and clean Staffs were friendly and helpful Short walk to la lambla and the beach we walked to beach everyday 
381611,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room without view Shower did make incredible noise No iron avaiable Only 2 towels Room not clean The Staff lost my suitcase and no one felt responsible I found it by chance amongst other luggage outside locked room , Closeness to center and harbor
381612,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, This is a 3 Star hotel hiding under the heading of 5 stars The staff from the minute we checked in were not very helpful at all despite reading on Trip Advisor that they were happy joyful and helpful at all times We were supposedly given an upgrade at check in but I doubt very much that we were At breakfast time on the first morning the waiteress took my plate before even finishing my food then the subsequent days the waiters had to be asked to clear the plates When we ordered drinks in the bar they took forever to be served Bathroom toiletries were none existent unless you asked reception for them to be supplied To say the place has a swimming pool what a joke it was more like the size of a kids paddling pool In conclusion I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone When you check into a 5 star hotel you expect to get the 5 star treatment this hotel falls well short of that , The hotel was centrally located
381613,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room Service never mentioned that the chocolate tort we had was orange flavored as well I dislike orange very much , The room was perfect The view was perfect The bar was perfect 
381614,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I chose a suite because the picture showed a large balcony It turned out that while there was a balcony it did not have furniture to sit outside , The service from the staff at the front desk and the lobby bar was excellent 
381615,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Bathroom amenities shampoo soap etc were somewhat funky Teeny bar of soap and no washcloths , Very modern 5 star The breakfast buffet not included with my Booking com reservation was absolutely incredible but expensive Beautiful view from my room and especially the rooftop 
381616,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The room service was quite pricey and so was the stuff in the mini bar , The staff were outstanding Could nt do enough for you so helpful and spoke very clear English The hotel and rooms are spotless and always refilling things that have been used The pillows were absolutely amazing probably the best we have ever slept on Location is good only 10 minutes taxi ride to Port Olympic where all the restaurants and night life is and only 10 minutes to the beach both are in walking distance about 20 mins 
381617,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, food and cocktails have gone down hill unfortunately I would rate 10 10 but hotel is let down massively by below average food and drinks for a 5 star hotel you would expect a much higher standard of food drinks cocktails are poor champagne cocktails served with flat cava a lot of the food was obviously cooked earlier in the day , the superior room is phenomenal it s like living in your own apartment bathroom is excellent beds are super comfortable staff very helpful Location is great for las ramblas and gothic district beach is a 15 minute walk taxi queue right outside the hotel and never have to wait for a taxi free hotel slippers free wifi 
381618,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Only a room service could be a bit faster but other than that all Perfection, Everything We had a room on 7th floor with Best views over all city 
381619,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Bit pricey for what you get Was a bit of a trek when walking to the beach but there is a taxi rank outside which helps , Staff were nice and we re always helpful Clean Nice view of the marina Pool area was well kept Very close to las rambla and a shopping centre across the marina if you wanted to eat out of the hotel 
381620,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The staff were untrained often could not answer simple location questions also the hotel seemed to lack facilities only bar food not restaurant, Location
381621,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The cold water in the bathroom had a reoccurring problem in room 543 , The staff were all great Breakfast was a little expensive but had plenty of choice The room was big and comfortable 
381622,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Very expensive car service to collect you from airport was quoted over E100 whereas normal taxi between E30 35, The staff were very friendly and warm the breakfast was very good good bar on 8th floor very good location
381623,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, How did this hotel get a 5 star rating It is a very tired hotel with very strange service in that the customer is always wrong Tea and coffee making facilities 2 teabags two sachets of coffee and two sugars 2 powdered milk and two stirring sticks Not a teaspoon in sight They tried to charge for ice in a glass Breakfast at 25 per person was a rather tepid affair They wouldn t know how to make a cup of tea if they tried To say we wont be using this hotel again would be too soon This was supposed to be a special birthday 5 days in Barcelona for my husband It was more like staying at Fawlty Towers When we couldn t get into our room we were asked did we really want to go in No of course not we love camping out in the corridor , Some of the staff were helpful
381624,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Too dark in bathroom due to location of spotlights Minor , Huge bed Extra comfy Staff very attentive and the whole place spotless We chose harbour view and it was fascinating to watch the cruise ships but they are very close and can be noisy early on as they arrive in the night That didn t detract from the experience though Location is a flat 6 7 min walk to ramblas but there are constant taxi outside Olympic port shopping and marina and beach also walkable Barcelonetta beach approx 15 20 walk but it s all sea front M Very lovely stay would highly recommend
381625,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We had requested a high floor room with ocean view but on arrival the Hotel was near capacity and whilst we were offered an upgrade on 3rd floor we declined as was a smoking room The only room in our category left was on the 2nd floor which was close to a conference room being used in the day and we could slightly hear music drifting up from the bar so not exactly ideal Service at times a little slow in the bar , Ambience quality of the hotel areas fabulous interior of room Breakfast choice was superb and staff were polite and most welcoming Allowed us an additional hr over normal check out time even though the Hotel was fully booked and the President of Spain was checking in with tight security due to a demonstration 
381626,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Was a little disappointed by the size of the pool more appropriate for children and was usually only used by children The roof top lounge was restricted on one day for a private function which was a shame , The staff were fantastic really helpful and friendly They remembered us and always had time to have a chat and find out what we liked gave appropriate advice re places to eat visit etc
381627,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No balcony which is disappointing for a 5 star hotel Very limited restaurant menu Breakfast area only had 2x2 slice toasters Loose paving slabs on roof terrace , Great views from our room looking towards the cruise liners and watching the ferry s docking and unloading cars and lorries nearby from our room Very comfortable beds Staff were excellent Quiet location Generally a good hotel but could be a little better for a five star 
381628,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Toiletries were woeful no brand shower gel 2in1 shampoo conditioner A shower cap separate shampoo and conditioner small toothpaste would have been useful and on par with other hotels Long life milk would have been preferred instead of dreadful powdered coffee creamer , The room was spacious clean and well furnished Staff were very attentive and friendly Room service food was very good albeit a little pricey 
381629,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Breakfast a complete joke Cold Tea Coffee Toasters not working Only 2available Not enough staff to cater for amount of people dining Not good for a 5 star hotel , Bed comfy room spacious and very nice 
381630,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Location is little far away from the beach cable car and plaza de catalonia Around 5 7 minutes walk to reach La Rambla , Staff were helpful room was great First floor was awesome 
381631,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff were not welcoming and showed no interest Design of bathroom poor the shower did not align with the screen and water just ended up on the floor , Location and view of marina
381632,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff was not that friendly and not very helpful when asked something Breakfast was much too expenisve for the service provided Very crowded and chaotic atmosphere in the restaurant Not enough staff for check out Long wait , Comfortable clean and spacious rooms Very new beautiful and modern hotel Good location and lovely beds 
381633,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Outlook to the rear was strile because it was office complex not an issue for me but leisure travellers may not be as happy with outlook, Location to Las Ramblas 5 min walk
381634,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Not a lot to dislike it s a great hotel that goes out of its way to look after you I d definately recommend this hotel to friends and family, Hotel in great location quite central and close to the beach pleasant hard working and attentive staff made our 3day stay lovely Nice pool area on 8th floor with great views across the city and med watching the cruise ships and ferries come in to the harbour 
381635,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The food from room service was not great and expensive better eat out No view from bedroom of sea despite what picture showed me was main point of choosing hotel Concierge was helpful but needs to be better informed and to inform clients better Bathrooms did not have enough soaps and towels for a couple TV was only in Spanish No English channels expect news, The location is great View from the rooftop pool is amazing Taxi station right outside was very convenient Layout of the rooms was nice and the beds comfortable The massage we ordered was great and very well priced 
381636,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, complimentary water in room for whole of stay not just first night stated a free cocktail on card given to us but were told the cocktails were notincluded and could have a beer or cava no bathrobes in bathroom, beds and pillows very comfortable breakfast menu great view from room wonderful staff very helpful
381637,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I paid for 3 of us to stay and room was only set up for 2 each day I had to request something extra cup extra water even on arrival a extra bed wasn t set up I had to request this also Complimentary cocktail drink was even a set drink we couldn t choose our own, Location was fantastic
381638,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Being told at check out that they have got the bill wrong and you have to pay nearly 80 euros more they should have let me know as soon as they found out they had made a mistake as this could have caused me an embarrassment if I could not pay when leaving and this could have happened as unfortunately had my wallet pick pocket, Location Gym the bar area was very nice the outside seating area look great but weather stopped us going out there
381639,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Fantastic Customer Service Nice upgrade to a suite when we arrived Most comfortable beds and very quiet Lovely pre cruise stay 5 minute taxi to cruise port Wonderful breakfast choice and check out not until midday Would definitely recommend 
381640,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Stuff were really rude receptions and room service need training on how to deal with clients Lack of bathroom essentials , The hotel in an area near to La Rambla
381641,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Enough tea bags and coffee also water in the room , Not enough coffee tea bags Also rather mean on the water bottle on arrival only which is shame for the price Staff very helpful and grand piano good but needs tuning Breakfast too expensive for my liking 
381642,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Just another 3 4 star hotel with a 5 star price tag on everything The food portions in the restaurant are small and not a lot of options Tried it once on my 5 day stay but took a taxi to town thereafter and tried a different restaurant every day Cheaper if you include the return taxi fee The pictures on the web are misleading as only 10 of the rooms has seaview, Friendly and helpful staff good location
381643,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Way too little in the way of bathroom products Smallest soaps I ve ever seen and way insufficient shower gel since that was the only option Breakfast was also great but possibly a bit overpriced Many of the other diners had a rate that included it for free , Great spacious clean rooms with a king size bed Wonderful staff at front desk and concierge Julia and Sra Navarro were both spectacular Gym was amazing but we were too busy sightseeing to use it 
381644,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff are not friendly Rooms are not equipped with basic items Restaurant is not offering many options Concierge is not very helpful , Location was ok
381645,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Service lacks Staff was of a little help It clearly doesn t feels as a 5 stars More like a great 3 Still it s priced as 5 , All essentials were just perfect spacious rooms fantastic location comfortable bed 
381646,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, They didn t renew the shampoo nor body shampoo No kit for sewing No touristic flyers or maps for the city in the room The restaurant is very small for such a big Hotel , Stuff very kind and helpfull excellent view from the room 
381647,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The breakfast buffet was 25 Euros per person oh what a selection though Finding someplace else to eat breakfast meant a long walk or a Taxi ride Asked for a 3 30 am wakeup call that we never got the morning we left , The staff was friendly and helpful and offered a few tips for getting around the city The hotel was conveniently located near bus stops Our room overlooked the harbor The room was spacious as was the bathroom which had a jetted tub 
381648,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, Everything was great and the hotel is recommended Christopher at the front desk was very welcoming and helpful after facing a small issue with the room he offered full support and an upgrade to a higher category with the greatest views to the city 
381649,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing worth mentioning , The hotel being situated on a no through road which makes the area scooter free and very quiet at night unlike in the city Also great for Cruise ship and Ferry watching but close to the town 
381650,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Problems with the safe in room 403 Cups not replaced with clean ones Lack of toiletries unless requested eg body lotion Room 403 was in need of some sprucing up Breakfast was expensive , Very helpful and efficient staff Minor concerns were dealt with quickly and courteously Room was upgraded 
381651,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Limited gluten free option at breakfast and the hotel restaurant opened very late in the evening and was overpriced for the food it offered , We stayed for five days at the Eurostar Marina hotel in Barcelona and enjoyed every minute from the lovely breakfast to the little nice touches such as chocolates when they turned down our bed Thoughtful staff made us feel very welcome Thank you to all 
381652,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Would not stay here again for a leisure trip the late discount seemed appealing but the 5 Star prices for everything reduced our usage of the facilities e g 5 Euros for a minibar coke ok if I was on a business trip and costs were covered that would be fine or ok for the very well off I suppose The TV had very limited English channels and you can only watch so much news I know that this opinion is subjective however I am reviewing on the basis of a leisure trip with an older child and they look for a lot of food and drink and TV I once asked if we could take drinks from the bar to the room and got a negative response suggesting that we should order from the room as there was a service charge so again not really an ideal environment if trying to relax on holiday very business orientated All that aside the only thing that was an actual fault was that the air conditioning could not be controlled in the room There was a control panel but it did not matter what I tried it did not adjust the A C I even switched it off and it did not affect anything a bit noisy draugthy and cold at night and too warm during the day I remember seeing a previous review mention this and I just thought it would be a unique problem When I tried to adjust it a lock key symbol started flashing so I can only assume the room A C is centrally controlled and that the control panels were for use at some point in the past , Very clean well furnished nice bathroom and helpful pleasant staffing View of port and cruise ships fantastic but cover up before you open your curtains in the morning ships arrive quietly 10 minute walk to some key tourist areas Las Ramblas and Gothic Qtr and Metro so easy to get places 
381653,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Patio doors do not lock so wedged chair table and bin for security Complimentary water on first day only then nothing I should have booked three single days not one three day break Unbelievable really , Good breakfast but very expensive
381654,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Poor service particularly in the bar Had to ask 3 times for a bottle of water one evening The staff seem to be rushing around and everything seemed uncoordinated Offered a complimentary cocktail but after a meal and several drinks at the bar and restaurant they took the money off the cheaper glasses of cava we had not the cocktails Waited ages for the food to arrive Only offer complimentary bottles of water in the room on the first night Really not impressed with our overall experience here and will not be returning ,No Positive
381655,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No tissue boxes No bath ropes We have to call if we need a soop It should be already there , Near to marine shopping mall and la rambla Staff are amazing
381656,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The room was disappointing for the price Lights weren t working in the bathroom so we showered in the dark rang reception to ask for them to be changed and I was on hold for over 15 mins before the call was answered Said they would be changed but this didn t happen The Jacuzzi bath didn t work and there was no shower curtain so the bathroom would be soaked in 4 mins Luckily house keeping were good and came up and mopped the floor after every shower NB just ask reception on your way out don t bother phoning All the facilities Gym etc were closed over the weekend we stayed and there was no advance warning very disappointing , The location of the hotel was great for the weekend The front of house staff were very friendly and helpful 
381657,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The shower handle was hanging and i called the reception like 3 times and the fourth call i asked for the manager and finally they respond after 45 mins and it works I went the bar to order drinks took me like 30 mins setting there and nobody even take care to come and ask what do you want Went to the reception and asked for the manager to call me at the room After talking to the manager the drinks came to my room in 10 mins free of charge , Sofia at the reception was the main helpful person at this hotel to me She checked me in when i was there earlier than the usual since i arrived like 10 am at the morning She helped me in lot s of information where to go and what to do The location is amazing i paid like 20 euro extra to take the room with the marina view and it worth it I tried one dinner at the hotel and one breakfast at the room both are delicious Near by to the rambla and the main things in Barcelona I highly recommend this place 
381658,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, only had one night there so didn t get to use all the facilities , Upgrade to deluxe room friendly and helpful staff all round Near cruise terminal and bottom of La Rambla Also very near to HOHO bus stop 
381659,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, It is a decent 5 star big size hotel but it has nothing special The staff is ok but does not connect with you There are too many guests and everything is rather un personal The foyer and the bar leave a cold impression The breakfast in the morning is a disaster Food is good but you have to first stand 15 to 20 mins in the queue before you get a table as they simply don t have the space for all their guests This is a luxury Hotel without a soul and you don t feel special Good enough for business but not for leisure We did not like it , Rooms are very comfortable luxury and well equiped All facilities are available and bathroom is nice 
381660,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Slow bar service even when empty, Great beds great location 2nd stay here our friends had some very noisy neighbors partying until 4am they where moved to a jnrsuite straight away Any small problems were delt with quickly
381661,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Very clean the room size is big compared to Europe standards staff is very helpful and polite so many options for the breakfast and the hotel area is very nice and relaxing 
381662,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Very slow during checking and check out Small queue for breakfast Not enough staff during breakfast you should wait for coffee , Very good location in the centre of city Beautiful view you can see whole Barselona Good breakfast 
381663,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Hotel was in a fantastic location The staff were friendly and couldn t do enough for us Our room was amazing with a view over the marina We will definitely go back
381664,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I have gone to this hotel a number of times and i have come to the conclusion that through Booking com you get an infieria service in this hotel I always seem to get the worse rooms and only in this hotel I always use Booking com and I have never had a problem in all the other Hotels I have been Maybe booking com should check this out ,No Positive
381665,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The pool was out of order And the only one was or is the small one on the roof For such a big and wonderful hotel a pool of a reasonable size and avalible is a must One of the reasons I booked , Everybody was very helpful the hotel was great with big selection at breakfast and very clean and comfortable 
381666,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, A minor maintenance issue of tiles on the balcony needed attention and our luggage was initially slow to arrive due to a mix up Neither of these were major issues in comparison to the excellence of the hotel and its staff , Staff members were fabulous welcoming friendly and helpful The hotel s location is excellent for either relaxing or sightseeing and balcony rooms have a wonderful view of the city and marina Taxis are always plentiful and metro access is a fairly short walk away Our room was extremely well appointed well serviced and the unusual touch of initially presenting toiletries in a gift bag was interesting A generous breakfast offered plenty of choice and there was even a small candy buffet operating all day We would definitely return 
381667,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, usually in hotels we receive two bottles of water daily for coffee but here they give it to you only once in your stay but its not big deal , the hospitality of the staff the amazing view 10 to 15 mints by walking to the city center the Marina the breakfast good Wi Fi and the of course the help advices we got from the staff about the places we should visit 
381668,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I was not able to get a refund for the last night that I had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances I felt the hotel was being too rigid in their policy decision of no refunds , View was incredible 
381669,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The only slight concern is that whilst the hotel has a lovely setting and almost idyllic location it is about 10 15 minutes stroll to Las Ramblas and about 20 mins to the Gothic Quarter and El Born Just something to consider if you re not able to walk too far Not a problem for us though and of course you can use the Metro and there s also a taxi line outside , The staff were so attentive and polite The suite we had was enormous and so comfortable The piano bar was excellent We d like to thank Snr Sasha in the Piano bar for his smile and impeccable service The breakfast was very well stocked and organised Everything was perfect for our 20th wedding anniversary We definitely recommend this hotel 
381670,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Very good hotel however bath did leak a little and the ironing board was awful sounds small but when you want to iron your white shirt for dinner , Great location in the harbour and close to Ramblas for dinner drinks in the evening We were able to buy fresh fruit from a local market and eat it on the roof overlooking Barcelona which was fantastic 
381671,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, If there were alot of restaurants and shopping store next to the hotel Parking is too expensive need to be reconsidered for fare value especially for descending for example a week, Mostly everything
381672,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, they took the time to read my DOB and sent some cake and cava to the room it was a nice touch , they where very attentive the attention to details was as I expected 
381673,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The distance from city centre Shower flooded the bathroom every time used Complained to staff and were told this was a design fault and nothing could be done It was slippery when I it out of shower quite dangerous , Breakfast good
381674,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Gym is not really a gym No free weights dumbells only go up to 22 kgs there s no bench press squat machine etc a couple machines that s it There s a real gym a short 10 minute walk located on the right side of Las Ramblas The food is average at best some dishes such as the lamb shoulder is inedible The breakfast buffet is sub par the scrambled eggs are horrible defitely out of a box Most of the meals on the room service I tried them all are all below average the portion you get for 30 00 euro will not fill you up , Location of the hotel is great the rooms are nice 
381675,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Towels could do with an upgrade in quality but minor negative comment , Arrived as a single business traveller was offered an upgrade to a suite at no extra cost Staff were excellent and very co operative Good QA of cleaning services Gym was well equipped and quiet off peak visit Food good standard Very good value for money 
381676,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, maybe one detail or another on the cleaning side The cleaning wasn t perfect, The room was fantastic and modern With tea facilities and a great view Room 447
381677,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Coffee tea making could improve with more tea coffee bags and liquid milk Servicing of room was twice very late 5pm and on one occasion only toilet done bed not made Only prices of everything up to 5 star rating , Bed comfortable Good size room 
381678,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Iron wasn t best of quality but no worries I enjoyed everything else, Staff were very helpful and polite taxi was always instantly delivered service was amazing
381679,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No pool or rooftop services or heaters for the bar outside areas for smokers and others Had to go outside to get to the Spa Morning Breakfast Teabags are rubbish and when combined with flask hot water not boiling water the result is a disappointment , Great location amazing doormen team with a friendly greeting night and day Super comfy bed but need a firm pillow option 
381680,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Beautiful hotel by the marina with excellent staff and amenities Lovely and very comfortable room with a fantastic view over the water The location price and service are outstanding

381682,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, There wasn t a thing I didn t like, Excellent location attentive staff and very good room service Needed a dr during the visit and the staff were kind to arrange for him to be available in just half an hour
381683,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Temperature of the room difficult to regulate Requests on the phone were not taken care of right away Overall was good but it did not quite feel like a 5 , Friendly staff Great location Amazing breakfast Beautiful roof terrace
381684,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Required to pay in full on arrival While the hotel in this case did deliver what we paid for if you are disappointed or want to leave sooner than your booking there is no refund , Beautiful room view Very comfy bed Staff always pleasant 
381685,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nit picking here Sauna could be a bigger shared one maybe and heated pool would of been the icing on an already great cake but didnt bother us still a 10, Liked everything about this hotel great location Hop on Hop off bus stops right outside hotel We arrived at hotel in a taxi and taxi man tried to charge us an extra 20 euro but the concierge helped us translate and made sure we werent ripped off Hotel food was excellent service was excellent any needs we rang up about robes iron etc Were quickly sent up to us We highly reccommend this hotel view from room was great
381686,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staffs don t smile except Gerald Very expensive hotel Breakfast was 27 eur but suddenly jumped to 35 eur My partner father passed away so had to cancel his room for last 2 nights but hotel did not help at all and charged me full Pool closed in winter, Location Room size ok
381687,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, a bit far from the main street and stores if elder accompanied 15 min walk , Nice facility nice service Welcome drink are nice Rooms are really nice also big and wide enough and clean facility provided are all satisfied 
381688,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Bath tub Jacuzzi didn t work Other than that everyting was perfect, Friendly staff Very helpful Easy to find Great location Fantastic breakfast options

381690,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I didn t get a sea view room although I asked for it while booking I asked for a late check out at 2pm and they refused although it wasn t my first time in the hotel , Everything
381691,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Asked for a double bed but got two singles put together had to sleep on seperate sides as they kept sliding apart , Room was very modern and was cleaned every day with fresh towels and bedding 
381692,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, We stayed for 4 days in January 2016 The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and comfortable There was nothing I could fault about the hotel or staff Would definitely recommend this hotel The food in the hotel restaurant was well presented and good quality A short walk for the centre made this hotel an ideal location

381697,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I didn t like the bed was over used and not renewed the shower was rusty and doesn t match a high standard hotel there was no lotion or even beauty kit and when I requested for q tips cotton there was none the other disaster was at breakfast in the morning I have never been in a hotel where I have to stand in a que waiting to be seated And the worst yet to come with servants who where very occupied that they forgot to serve anything we request I won t forget a servant who took the cheese from my plate by his hand to clear the plate and put my partner s plate on it and this same servant got us the tea without spoons or plates for 2 times I felt ashamed in front of my partner because I picked this hotel with confidence that it would be the perfect one since I ve been there couple of years ago and was impressed but not anymore , I liked the location of the hotel since it s near everything around in Barcelona and it is my second time in this hotel but wasn t as expected 
381698,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Only think I would say is the roof top bar wasn t open in December Which I was looking forward to but didn t ruin our stay what so ever , Amazing hotel location staff food we will most definitely be returning
381699,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, There was a pillow menu apparently but it was so obtuse as to be unclear and unhelpful to a tired traveler Would have liked a simple card that said firmer pillow available upon request , Very helpful friendly staff with great can do attitude

381710,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Parking and breakfast rather expensive I must also note that upon my return home I realized that I had forgotten in the room a gift that I had bought The hotel that I called to check if they had found anything replied negatively It is a pity because I am sure that I had forgotten the gift in the room , Everything It must be my 6th time in a couple of years that I go to this hotel As good as the first time 
381711,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Our length of stay Sadly only one day, Everything Will totally blow you away the minute you open yr door Fantastic value for money just wish we could have stayed longer 
381712,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the staff lacks customer care I checked out a day before l should have and they didn t even ask me if l had enjoyed ma stay like the way other hotels do or if there was any reason why l had checked out earlier I also think it s such a boring place hotel , Ma room was good and clean The shower and the bathtub was fantanstic

381718,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, My view wants that good and I asked for good view in the middle of the view there is T l ph rique column While I checked out from the hotel I surprised they put under my name that I use the bar for example I drinked 2 water and 2 vodka and 2 wine Which is completely wrong I didn t even touch the mini bar and the refrigerator how did they put all of these under my name This is part of cheating they removed those from the bill but even though how did they put it under my name, Internet speed Location Stuff Cleanliness
381719,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, With such a great location they should have at least one restaurant bar with a view The rooftop bar was not open even though it was 24 c Drinking water in the rooms would be nice , Great location We had nice views Our teenage boys made use of the gym We also used the hotel s electric bicycles to gad around Barcelona Great fun My teenage son celebrated his birthday the restaurant staff made it special without making him cringe Thank you

381721,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Large and had a business corporate feel rather than leisure Staff uninterested poor service food over priced and disappointing Failed to deliver my room service breakfast on my birthday v disappointing, Started well nice reception and welcome drink location and nice rooms
381722,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Lack of in room Nespresso Machine Tea Coffee items meagre , Boutique Rooms location near Cruise Terminal Stop 5 on City Hop on Hop off tour large rooms with large beds 
381723,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We reached at 23 00 and after the checkin door cards were given and we were sent to the city Suites without any staff member We were with 2 babies of 4 months and 15 months and the cards did not work We had to go down and they gave other cards which also didn t work Then the third time new cards were made which opened the doors All this took more then 30 minutes standing with babies sleeping in the hands in a dark passage with the bulb not working in front of our so called 2 joined city suites and we using our phone light to see the door After the check out we came to know that the hotel charged us 2 extra bills of more then 1730 out of which after contacting them one was returned and the hotel refused to accept to return the other extra bill charged on our credit card without authority It took 5 days of serious arguments with the hotel management and ultimately they accepted their fault and returned the extra bill The carpet in the passage was having dirt marks in front of almost all the doors , The hotel is at a very prime location Very near to Maremagnum and adjacent to the port with nice view 
381724,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We found the front desk staff not friendly and not so helpful they smile to pretend they are being nice they need to improve very much on that It leaves a bad taste feeling that people in Barcelona are not friendly , We had a good vacation and the hotel was close enough to what we needed 
381725,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Check in and check out times are too rigorously controlled We arrived at 6 30am but their policy was that no one got into a room before 3 00pm With a strictly controlled check out time 11 00am Surely some rooms would have been ready before 3 00pm, The views from the pool area are amazing
381726,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Expensive insofar that the rate of over 300 per night did not include breakfast and you had to pay for everything including water Not what I would expect from a 5 hotel There was also fumes coming into our room from the Cruise ships that were berthed to the right of the hotel , Location cleanliness and size of room
381727,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Needed fresh milk for tea in the morning called for room service which was quick , Fantastic hotel really friendly Staff and happy staff breakfast was brilliant with cava Port view was fantastic 
381728,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, always long waiting times at reception or on phone trying to contact front desk Not enough bathroom articles provided in room although you could call up Not a 5 GL std I would rate it 4 , Location nice rooms
381729,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, many digital TV channels did not work no signal or broadcast interruption broken kettle replaced two requests to clean the room were taken over the phone but not done, the view location the bed cocktails at the bar
381730,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, It took and hour to be served a lunchtime expensive sandwich , Would have been ideal post cruise destination if our cruise ship had been moored immediately outside instead of 2km away just the luck of the draw some cruise boats did moor immediately outside 
381731,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Overpriced room It just doesn t feel worth 425 The bathroom didn t even have body lotion cotton pads or q tips The furniture was also a bit uninspiring for a 5 star hotel Phone to the front desk didn t work, Size of room good quality bed sheets Relatively quiet slept well 
381732,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Drinks and food were so incredibly expensive hardly anyone used the facilities so the bars and restaurants were pretty much empty which was a shame given the lovely surroundings , Fabulous comfortable room with really unusual view through really large panoramic windows watching ships dock next to you Nice roof top area Usual hotel thing of having to crawl under the TV to plug the kettle in on the floor but that s most hotels 
381733,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, A 5 star rating No We thought we would treat ourselves by booking into a 5 star We have stayed in 3 4 star hotels much better than this Well over priced bad service went to restrauant twice waited waited still didnt get served noisey area we even had to wash cups we used in the room as they were left unwashed even waited quite a while to check out we wish really we had gone to the hotel we stayed in Barcelona last time , Nothing
381734,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, 1 our GPS could not find the address I understand this is common It would be very helpful to have on the hotel website the closest intersection street normal GPSs recognise to assist in location 2 price is up there we paid about 1000 Euro for 4 nites with no breakfast plus 25 euro per day for parking , 1 very helpful staff They were happy to speak to our car hire company about an issue we had 2 good location It is a10 minute walk to La Rambla the main tourist strip but we enjoyed that Other attractions are a bit of a walk which we don t mind or you can use the underground about 10 minutes away 3 great terrace on the top level which gives you a wonderful view of Barcelona 4 parking on site is a real advantage
381735,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, I had stayed at this hotel for 4 5 years ago you can not definitively call it for 5 star hotel now but it was for 5 yrs ago They do not even provide you with drinking water after first day You have to ask for bath staffs , Location
381736,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Happy with everything as the response to minor technical issue with the safe was immediate resolution, The location and views of Barcelona and marina were stunning the staff friendly and helpful and
381737,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Room size beds were amazing Lovely view from window of our room Quiet location Roof top pool although small had wonderful views a lovely bar
381738,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The staff was extremely unfriendly Snobbish I travel all over the world and stay in 5 star hotels all over This was unbelievable The staff was rude and strange Would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone ,No Positive
381739,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Adevertise with free airport shuttle No airport shuttle false advertisement When i checked in the genglrman told it included breakfast Next day i went fir breakfast and they told me the breakfast was not included Sad to say the information employees provide you is wrong , It s a nice hotel location is good I did liked the early check in 
381740,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The style of hotel waiting on reception to check in or ask a question can take an hour they need to put small help desks I asked for a king bed they gave me room with double bed put next to each other that moves every now and then when I took room it was not cleaned well you call 5000 for assistance it can ring for 30 min no reply and there is no other number the phone of the room keeps cutting as it needs to be changed cord not functioning 5 star hotel still uses wood spoons for coffee For a 5 star hotel needs some work , Location is very convenient staff are very helpful 
381741,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, noise wooden floor It makes cracking noises Bad lighting of the room Breakfast below average Balconey tight City view boring , Quite and safe hotel
381742,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The coffee served at breakfast was awful When I asked for one from the machine they did not seem to hear me There was a lot of noise from the outside some musical performance fireworks etc and the loud sound came through to the room long into the night no sound insulation it was impossible to sleep , The room was nice with a little balcony The chairs in the room were not comfortable but the bed was good We had good weather and there were plenty of outdoor spaces in the bar pool and restaurant to sit out which was excellent 
381743,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, eighth floor pool is very small View is obstructed at pool area Very busy port area at night with large cruise ships coming in and out right in front of hotel , Modern amenities comfortable large room with balcony fantastic view of Barcelona easy access to Las Ramblas and the waterfront area Great dining options at hotel Good air conditioning Nice bathroom with walk in rain shower
381744,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Location to cruise port and town plus the tourist buses stop at the hotel We were also able to store our luggage for a few hours when we returned from our week cruise 
381745,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The hotel amenities such as variety of restaurants and upstairs patio weren t what I expected This is definitely a hotel you sleep in and go elsewhere for everything else Also the cruise ships dock right next to the hotel so you can see them and they can see you from your windows , The rooms were very big and comfortable with a spectacular view The staff was very helpful friendly an excellent location if you want to be within walking distance to Las Ramblas street 
381746,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The coast comparing to the service I received changing what you reserved in the last minute and ask 4 more money to give u your reservation the stander level of your staff is very low because they have no athourty every thing needs immediate solution they said this what the mangment told us if you need exampl be in touch with me, The size of the room
381747,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Cost of the room as there was a convention on the weekend we were there and they bumped the price up to over 660 Euros for one night which is definately not worth that sort of money in fact the four nights of our extended stay was bumped up and was not worth that sort of money so try and book through booking com if you can as they will get you the best price, Location and quality of the hotel rooms and facilities the staff were proffessional especially Gerrard who greeted us on our arrival he was so informative friendly and a great assett to the hotel and the experience The bed was massive and really comfortable and had a pillow menu we had a large balcony overlooking the harbour and saw the cruise ships coming in and out of the bay the bath was a whirpoll and the shower was brillient with technology at a touch and the different colours came on and the redder it was the hotter and then ambre for warm etc This was a flag ship room with an i phone that you used to open the curtains give you different mood lighting and music options plus on the alarm part you could set it up to wake you up under the sea or in the jungle as two projectors hang from the ceiling and the whole wall lights up as if you were under water and all the fish swimming around with the sounds of the sea also the bed rocked you awake the i phone also worked the bed to gently rock you or other movements to relax you it was quite something and a great experience the breakfast was fantastic and plenty to choose from a massive choice even bucks fizz and a lovely terrace to sit out on if a table was available we also got complimentry drink on arrival I could go on can I just say I would highly recommend this hotel if you ever visit Barcelona
381748,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, We had a beautiful suite champagne chocolate strawberries and free breakfast for less than the cost of a standard room at another hotel There was plenty of storage space 
381749,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Breakfast very expensive Many alternative options within 5 minutes walk , Spacious quiet room Great views from balcony Not too hot September weather a mixed bag 
381750,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing , Excellent hotel with excellent location Staff was extremely friendly and helpful The room was beautiful clean and the rooftop view was beautiful 
381751,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Very noisy with ferry traffic at night Location ok but not great Kettle had soap in Over priced everything Poor swimming pool , The bed was very comfortable 
381752,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, We had an inter leading door to our room PAPER THIN WOODEN WALL and it sounded like our neighbors were in our room VERY LOUD and they were laughing and talking till 3am in the morning This is fine for families but not if you don t know the people in the room next door Absolutely shocking for a 5 star hotel ,No Positive
381753,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The cava was 10 Euros a glass Just a bit of a rip off At least it s free at breakfast , The staff were very friendly and helpful right from check in on The situation was good and felt safe Cannot always be said about the other parts of Barcelona 
381754,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Even though the hotel located nearby the sea no good sea view rooms the junior suite we had was dark not enough lighting we asked for king size bed we had two single bed attached to each other , great location next to the mall and 10 minutes walking to Rambla street quite 
381755,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Everything was really great room breakfast and facilities Excellent front desk staff 24 7 Location is far enough away from city centre to be relaxing but only a short walk to be there Driving to hotel could not be easier and parking was great 
381756,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Nothing, We loved the balcony overlooking the City the staff were excellent and helpful Gerrard and his colleague looked after us it was our honeymoon and they made it special The pillows were so comfortable and bed Spacious Overall excellent hotel 
381757,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The only problem we had was shutting the door to our room Yes the door being tight was the closest thing we could find to a negative comment , Wonderful property and staff Everyone we interacted with was as accommodating as possible 
381758,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room are only at the front There is NO real seaview Non descript Hotel tucked into the WTC Very small swimming Pool on roof top 10 meters by 4 meters BUT my biggest complaint is the ABSURD pricing for breakfast and for drinks Totally insane to pay 27 euros per person for breakfast Drinks too fresh orange juice 6 euro Gin tonic 14 euro If a hotel has to destinguiish itself by pouring drinks from a bottle at these prices Manegement please take action this has nothing to do with being exclusive this is nuts , Best location you can find in Barcelona 5 min walking from the centre 10 min walk to Marina Nice rooms excellent personnel Fantastic valet service always enthousiastic Marvelous bar terras at the rooftop view 
381759,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, NOTHING, Super amazing staff friendly lovely Concierge service is very helpful Deluxe rooms are so big with port view Breakfast is delicious Location is fantastic Wifi service is fast
381760,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The wifi was shockingly bad and unreliable Replacement of bathroom supplies was nonsensical and haphazard I was never quite sure if I d get shampoo shower gel or hand soap or nothing Minibar never got replenished Inconsistent service on the roof top bar The pool is small 10x5 meters , The location facilities and staff were very good The gym was well equipped and the terrace was appointed with a pool 2 bars and lounge chairs The room was spacious and well equipped the bed comfortable and the room clean 
381761,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The Family Suite was not family friendly not connected on the inside as it was when we stayed there 13 years ago The outer door to the suite would not lock the room was a bit worn breakfast was not included in the high price the pool was small and there was no hotel shuttle or transportation to the main attractions given that the hotel is a bit out of the way , The staff was nice 
381762,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, No balcony in a superior room Pool area on roof very small, Good location away from hustle and bustle but easy access to city centre Convenient for taxis
381763,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Staff at times were not keen to help Often pointing you to a colleague instead of them just passing on the message One day was overcast so they did not open the pool bar despite a number of us still using pool and being 25degrees Another time we went for an evening cocktail at roof bar and sat on chairs that provided an ideal view the waitress asked us to move to a seat without view as there was no table at our particular chairs despite others having why did she not just get a table solve Not 5 service, Clean hotel good location for La Ramblas tourist bus etc really comfy bed and complimentary water in room each day Great position to see boats coming in and out of harbour
381764,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL,No Negative, Extremely helpful staff who seemed to be under pressure from a lot of rude guests Location is excellent for exploring barcelona I would defiantly stay there again 
381765,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, 1 We had to leave one day early and asked to apply that day to a return stay four days later The staff and management declined to consider that solution stating that it was the hotel policy Cost to us 365 Euros 2 We booked for 3 2 adults and a 12 y o child The hotel provided us an appropriate roll away bed for the 12 year old but charged us for her breakfasts claiming we only had a reservation for 2 plus a baby Cost to us 36 Euros ,No Positive
381766,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, breakfast is too expensive Maximum prices of 20 euro for breakfast should be reasonable Also the prices in the restaurant In general good hotel but prices are too high According to my opinion with other 5 star hotels , location is good
381767,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Bad service in room cleaning 2 days out of 5 no bath cleaning Our room has a view in town and boat for Mallorca left port every night at 23 30 noisy Rather expensive not value for money hotel , The hotel is located in the heart of the port It has a great nice location for starting your day around Barcelona Plenty of space in rooms Excellent personnel to assist you in anything Nice roof bar with beautiful view of the city especially at night Many buses urban and local are 50m away and also boat for Mallorca Ibiza Whatever you need just tell the personnel and it is done Even tickets for Barcelona FC Strong WiFi everywhere in the room 
381768,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The room service needs improvement limited items on the menu When you order hot soup and the pour it in front of you for a nice presentation the waiter should remember to bring a soup spoon by the time he returned the soup was cold Also having only 2 comlplimentary bottles of water for the entire stay in a suite is just plain poor , Overall a good hotel next to the cruise terminal with decent facilties good gym helpful staff
381769,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Using Jacuzzi in batb the water sprayed therefore shower screen could do with being bigger, Location quietness view of marina cleanliness and comfort of hotel friendliness of staff Definitely be returning 5 
381770,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, the gym is opened to the pool so the gym area is hot and humid a closed area with air conditions would be a better idea , I booked the classic room and when I arrived I was upgraded to a suite with private terrace for one night and for the next night I was also upgraded to another suite Very spacious fully equipped and luxurious suitable for couple or family with children I couldn t use it all since I m travelling solo The hotel has a small gym 24 h with showers swimming pool restaurants and it is located at the marina only 20 mins walk to the famous Rambla Street The staff members were beyond friendly when I checked out at noon I had to pray so they offered me the restaurant area to do my prayer they were suspicious at first for security reasons but it s understandable I would recommend this hotel for longer stays specially the value of money 
381771,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Room lakes many small items that makes difference such as no tissues in any room just small pocklet No enough electric outlets we had to use kettle from wc no arabic tv channels no cloth hangers to dry,No Positive
381772,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Our phone in our room didn t work There was a party going on in the room next to us that kept us up We were Unable to call downstairs to do anything about it Also didn t like that it was obvious the beds were two singles pushed together instead of a king queen bed That was uncomfortable for a couple to sleep together , Breakfast was super expensive But it was fantastic and convenient 
381773,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The Wifi was not very good apart and the tea and coffee in the room was not replenished daily but a call to room service and they were more than happy to bring some up to our room , The hotel was lovely the facilities were great and the food was fantastic The staff were very helpful and rooms were cleaned daily Overall I think this hotel ticks all the boxes and we enjoyed our stay here hopefully will be returning again soon 
381774,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The cocktails were pricey and the rooftop pool area was very small There were a few little maintenance issues like the sliding door to the balcony the safe was unpredictable and the door keys stopped working several times , Pretty much everything Rooms comfort quality the views breakfast friendliness and helpfulness of staff Watching the ships coming in every evening 
381775,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Not good cost performance especially for small kids Pool is very very small and very limited open 10am 6pm Near the sea but we can t see the ocean except the bar on the roof top balcony , The staff is kind and professional

381779,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, They did not concedrer the spical requests that I made through booking and they say the do not reply to these and booking should do that So they did not provide me with rooms as per my requests which made my first night a very bad one Breakfast is the worst I never sow long waiting lines and cues like I have seen even though the food is not good at all You have to pay for every thing even when I have requested a spoon to feed my child they charged me, I liked the size of thr rooms Location was good for us because very close to cruise port Beds are good You can store your extra lauguges at their sores when you go on a cruise
381780,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Lack of coordination among reception and reservation staff Had some complications with extending my stay and needed to communicate to 3 different ppl about extending checkout time, Location is great

381788,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, Breakfast staff poor service especially the ladies the gentleman provided exellent service The ladies in the breakfast team are pulling the team down You had to ask for coffee all the time, First floor staff excellent we thought the first floor Bar was runn by a different company Julie was very good pre booked all what we needed in advance The 8th floor pool Bar exellent
381789,Eurostars Grand Marina Hotel GL, The bar and the swimming pool open at 10am to 10pm But most guests would leave to visit the museum a t about 9 30 And dinner in Barcelona usually ends at 10pm So we cannot enjoy the facilities If the pool opens at 8 that wud be perfect ,No Positive
