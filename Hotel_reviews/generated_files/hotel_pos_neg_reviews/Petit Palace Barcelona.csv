432668,Petit Palace Barcelona, We would like ice accessible and coffee hot water available early and late, We were very happy the staff was good The hallway leading to the elevator is a bit scary
432669,Petit Palace Barcelona, Breakfast buffet was good but perhaps more choices will be appreciated Also I hope that with the remodelation going on they choose ligther brighter decoration versus the dark style it currently has , Location comfortable beds
432670,Petit Palace Barcelona, It s expensive for the facilities on offer and no breakfast included 783 for 3 nights in June was over a weekend but Barcelona isn t a cheap city when it comes to hotels Rooms much smaller than impression from site the family room was very small with just 3 of us the top bunk very high and right under the air con vent The adult bed was a double not a queen or king more like a large single with one side up against glass wall of bathroom which wasn t very private Corridors very dark and hot and can be a bit noisey no bar area onsite to sit and chill Car parking close by but expensive at 25 per day but if staying more than 2 days comes down in price That said would consider it again because of location close to restaurants we like but probably not with kids , It s location is great gorgeous bakery next door and a really good cafe with delish menu open long hours Staff friendly 
432671,Petit Palace Barcelona, Amenities in the room were bad no body cream and very low quality The room did not have kettle to make a thee or coffee Even thought at the loby it is a coffe machine free of charge it is always nice to have a coffe at bed The hair dryer was too old and almost broken I think the room needs an up grade soon , Location was fantastic the room we choose it was big enough for my family of 4 Very confortable bed S per clean also 
432672,Petit Palace Barcelona, The 3rd shower setting at the bottom the jets literally spray at such an angle that it showers the entire wall and causes flooding The glass panel to the shower isn t long enough to protect the water It was quite a disaster The beds could be improved they are quite stiff , The breakfast is great fresh food big selection 
432673,Petit Palace Barcelona, The bathroom sink smelled like rotten sewage This was our only complaint about the hotel The rooms are not sound proofed at all so expect to hear your annoying neighbor allowing his screaming child to wail in the hallway not an exaggeration The sound is more muted if both parties are in their rooms with the doors closed , The room was very spacious and comfortable The beds were nice The location of this place is perfect for exploring Barcelona on foot 
432674,Petit Palace Barcelona, We were first given a room that had worn seats wallpapers that had clear water damage We changed to another room where the bathroom door did not close The hotel is apparently going under renovations , One of the best central locations in Barcelona May be an alternative for a family trip need a double bed a bunk bed in the same room 
432675,Petit Palace Barcelona, I was disappointed with the room I think it used to be a storage room that was converted to a hotel room This was not a room as advertised There may be some 4 star rooms in the hotel but this wasn t one of them I asked to change rooms but was told there was nothing available I have sent a photo of our view , Location excellent Friendly staff Excellent breakfast 
432676,Petit Palace Barcelona, We arrived around 8pm and had to ring several times to gain entry Staff member was unfriendly and unhelpful the lobby area was gloomy We had booked to return for a further 4 nights but cancelled and booked the Ambit a few doors down where we had stayed last year Similar value but a much better choice , Location great
432677,Petit Palace Barcelona, Our room looks like it was a small conference room converted to a hotel room There was a projector on the ceiling Beds not that comfortable Bathroom shower area is clogged water drains out slowly , For us location is important because we like to walk going to major attractions The hotel is in a very good location and many cafes bakeries and convenience stores nearby Getting taxis is also not a problem Rooms are spacious Complimentary coffee and water served at the lobby 
432678,Petit Palace Barcelona, Rooms I guess are overpriced , Stayed for a night Comfortable rooms and great locations Breakfast had a lotta variety and really yum Friendly staff and really helpful Main market is just few meters away 
432679,Petit Palace Barcelona, Only one comfortable chair in the bedroom It would be better to replace the table and upright chairs which we didn t need with a second armchair , Excellent location Good selection at the breakfast buffet 
432680,Petit Palace Barcelona, The only complaints we can think of was the bathroom was a bit awkward with the toilet and roll dispenser at odd placements making it difficult to sit comfortable The bed was also a bit uncomfortable with two mattresses brought together that easily slipped apart , Our stay in Petit Palace was short but wonderful The staff were incredibly helpful every step of the way even in matters not concerning the hotel When we first arrived they were quick to help us navigate the parking zones and led us to a convenient parking spot right in front of the hotel Even after we had checked out we were able to use their common areas to help us prepare for the next leg of our journey and again they were there to lend a helping hand The room was very spacious and the view from the balcony was fantastic Easy walk to Sagrada Familia Las Ramblas and approximately a 25 minute walk from the gothic quarter 
432681,Petit Palace Barcelona, 1 No guardrail on top bunk 2 Room not ready when we arrrived 3 noise from adjacent school 4 Unpleasant smell from bathroom sink 5 Odd layout meant one had to limbo dance between the bed and the TV to get in or out of room several bruised shoulders and heads 6 Tantalising terrace couldn t be accessed as doors jammed shut by furniture, Good location Spacious clean bathroom with big bath Comfy king size bed
432682,Petit Palace Barcelona, Arrived at 10 30 was told to come back at 12 as room not ready to be told room checkin is 3 which is fair enough but don t get us to come back at 12 Room was cleaned late each day 5ish Room was dusty, Location Comfy bed Friendly staff Helpful staff Sweets on reception
432683,Petit Palace Barcelona, Room had windows facing other rooms across courtyard so we could never open the shades Room was ok layout not great and shower always sprayed water all over bathroom , Location to local attractions
432684,Petit Palace Barcelona, The hotel looks as if it s a 2 star hotel The drains smell There wasn t any pair of slippers in the room Towels and Bathroom tools were old , It was like 5 minutes away from passeig de Garcia Acceptable wi fi coverage Helpful staff 
432685,Petit Palace Barcelona, As there was three ladies in one room there was a lack of mirrors only one in the bathroom The rooms were a little cold with the air con turned off no duvets available , Location was great hotel near enough the centre of all tourist attractions by foot or short taxi ride away Every one of the Staff was very helpful and went out of their way to help us cannot fault the good customer service We didn t have breakfast as there was a great cafe next door 
432686,Petit Palace Barcelona, The double bed is small the pillows are not comfy and also the bed has sharp edges and both me and my partner finished with bruises on our legs, breakfast and location
432687,Petit Palace Barcelona, The 2nd morning the staff let everything run out at the breakfast buffet There were no glasses no juices no hot food no bread for nearly 30 minutes It caused a delay in our day , I loved the breakfast on the first morning The staff had everything filled at all times There was a beautiful variety of food Bread meat potatoes cheese juices coffee cereal fruit All wonderful 
432688,Petit Palace Barcelona, There was no bar We believed this to be a 4 star hotel but it was more of a Travelodge However there was a bar right next door which was pleasant and served food until late , Accommodation was clean and functional Good choice of breakfast served between 7 30 and 10 30 am Bed was comfortable 
432689,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, Breakfast was fab fresh and plentiful and it changed daily The rooms were lovely and clean and serviced every day with fresh toiletries and the staff were lovely friendly and happy to help We would definately stay there again 
432690,Petit Palace Barcelona, we came tired after a long trip from Vietnam and had a lot of heavy luggages but there s no bellboy service in the hotel so we had to take the luggages ourselves to the rooms despite of the hotel s 4 star category Maybe that could be better next time thank you ,No Positive
432691,Petit Palace Barcelona, the place looked clean however in our it was dusty on the headboards and on the floors it was bearable so i did not complain anymore we had breakfast at the hotel only 1 time as we did not really like the selection but overall we were happy with the stay, i liked the location of the hotel and the staff were very nice 
432692,Petit Palace Barcelona, No coffee tea maker in the room The airconditioner is a little bit noisy , The design of the hotel is very modern The free bike rental is great I tried it and it s really great to see the city by bike The 2 staffs one lady and one guy served me at front desk are really nice and patient The hotel is very close to the city Convenient Room is clean and it s very warm during winter time Wifi is super fast 
432693,Petit Palace Barcelona, Need to sack the entire cleaning crew Upon arrival we had to move rooms because the first one was infested with aunts Second morning They threw the pillows on the bed so they were all over and it was all wrinkly Didn t leave us with any hand towels Maybe they were on strike or something and it was a way of complaining Either way not our problem so they get a negative mark on their cleaning standards , Receptionist team was outstanding and made us feel like at home Very nice people professional and resolutive 
432694,Petit Palace Barcelona, No coffee maker in room and the one located in the lobby was open only after the pay breakfast service was over Good thing coffee place was literally next door Spartan room accommodations no conditioner one bar of soap Slow wifi Cracked bathroom tiles , Excellent location quiet comfortable rooms friendly multilingual staff good price Staff brought in a crib for our two year old at no extra cost 
432695,Petit Palace Barcelona, No tea or coffee making facility in room No tea or coffee making facility before 11am in lounge other than in restaurant at breakfast Drain smell in bathroom and bath plug not working Bath tap difficult to access and operates shower before bath , Location excellent Breakfast buffet good Staff helpful 
432696,Petit Palace Barcelona, Room was not clean properly everyday After complaining in 2 days there was a little improvement Some receptionists can be improved in communication when dealing with guest , Excellent location 
432697,Petit Palace Barcelona, Hotel felt like it needed a touch of TLC our room was not the cleanest and it needed a refresh badly If our room had of been better would recommend , Location was great very close to Passage de Gracia with lots of local amenities the staff were friendly and helpful 
432698,Petit Palace Barcelona, Kept catching my leg on the corner of the bed which is quite sharp gone home with a couple of bruises Disappointed that there wasn t a bath but every thing else was excellent Also would have liked another mirror in the bedroom when doing my hair , The toiletries replenished daily and boiling hot lovely shower Good idea with the shoe shine kit
432699,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, Clean rooms plenty of food choices served at breakfast even towards end of service Great location Staff happy to hold luggage securely pre and post check in out 
432700,Petit Palace Barcelona, Mirror in room other than just bathroom would have been nice, Lovely hotel just needs a bit of TLC extra mirror in room and the shower door needed attention location perfect
432701,Petit Palace Barcelona, Not really clean Wifi slow inconsistent Room size pretty small Personnel is rather different from very careful and helpful to absolutely formal, Breakfast is better than expected
432702,Petit Palace Barcelona, One bathroom for 5 of us Only a curtain sheer between the 2 rooms so really one big room only and terrible view Thank God for great staff who make this place worthwhile Location is a 10 10 Even a supermarket nearby to get some snacks for the kids Loads of pastry shops and restaurants at your doorstep to the hotel, The staff were very accomodating Facilities were basic but location awsome Could walk to la ramblas barri gottic and plaza Catalunya Staff were so helpful in booking tours if needed The staff really make it worthwhile because the actual hotel needs a little revamping 
432703,Petit Palace Barcelona, Room was very small Room wasn t very clean Staff clears the fridge everyday and removed unopened soft drinks if that is what you re going to do you need to inform us, Location was fantastic and good to have a family room
432704,Petit Palace Barcelona, Nothing, Location Pleasant professional staff Modern clean facilities Tasteful decor Air conditioning Sound insulation from traffic Complimentary coffee and water
432705,Petit Palace Barcelona, No thing I loved your hotel and your city and i hope to come back again Thanks, Location and your staff so kindly and your hotel also very cleaning Thank you so much And I hope to come back again to my hotel Thank
432706,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, Great hotel central location Staff was very helpful and friendly We stayed in a family room with a double bed and a sofa bed and the room was huge We stayed for one night only but we loved it We did not have breakfast included but we had no problems finding a breakfast place close by In fact there was a nice caf right outside the hotel we did not try it 
432707,Petit Palace Barcelona, the hotel is presented and sold as a 4 star Hotel and this is not the case it is more a 2 star hotel examples the room size which is under 3 meters wide and with a double bed is very small at the reception they said yes Its a small room Noise when you are waiting for the lift on the 3rd floor you can hear what people are saying and doing in their rooms its near as though there are no doors so a girl on the phone another time a guy having fun in the room the same apply s when you walk in the corridor This is not good for the person in the room or the person who is in the corridor there is one lift and its lost round the back that also seems to be half working the lights are bit disco and it creaks So when you take the stairs because the lift is less available it takes you down an old fashion stairs then a glass dead end But also the halls upstairs and downstairs do not seem that clean sat at the desk in the room I am not tall but the TV is right above your head is no more than 3 or 4 cm from your head but this makes sense with the size of the room were else are you going to put it there is nowhere the bed is on rollers so when i came back to the room after it had been cleaned the side table has kind of disappeared I have never seen this in a hotel before serve yourself drinks down stairs 4mb internet access you are in a town that has fast access pay for it this all is understandable and makes sense if it sold as 2 star hotel but it is not the case it was sold as a 4 star Room 311 4 nights paid but we only slept one night we moved to another hotel, Your staff are happy and helpful where they can be at check in and at check out The entrance is very appealing the bed was clean
432708,Petit Palace Barcelona, There were no fitness or spa facilities available , The location of the hotel is great it being in the city center and a few minutes away from the main squares and streets The shops and cafeterias nearby are lovely The staff were very friendly despite us arriving earlier than at the designated check in time they tried their utmost to get us accommodated early The breakfast was varied and delicious There is also the opportunity to rent the bikes for free 
432709,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, We were a large group with multiple families The staff was very accommodating and went out of their way to help us from the moment we arrived They took care of all of our requests and gave us good recommendations The location was excellent and the accommodations were great Geeat hotel for large families 
432710,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, Great staff very welcoming and extremely helpful at all times The location was perfect less than a 5 min walk t the main shopping area and about 10 mins to La Ramba Lovely restaurants near including one next door The rooms are very spacious and very comfortable Free wifi and acres to a laptop in reception was a real bonus great spot 
432711,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, Great wi fi Coffee machine in foyer only fixed last day we were there Staff very helpful including booking car for us Good location for many things 
432712,Petit Palace Barcelona, normally a hotel has no problem booking u transfers or even just cabs about town but this was not possible here for some reason , Hotel was great great location
432713,Petit Palace Barcelona, The hallways were very dark It was hard to see where you were going and they were painting the walls with very strong paint and uncomfortable smells The shower tub was broken and the jets would go off in the middle of the night The front desk staff could have been more friendly Didn t feel like they wanted to help ,No Positive
432714,Petit Palace Barcelona, The shower was very complicated to use and it splashes all over the bathroom, Location is excellent just 1 block away from Paseo de Gracia and close to Plaza Catalunya Small rooms but really comfy and nice view from the room balcony
432715,Petit Palace Barcelona, Rooms were clean but cleaning of the corridors could be better , superb buffet breakfast superb adjacent restaurants Very helpful staff Superb shower but it needs a review as it causes a wet floor
432716,Petit Palace Barcelona, 3rd person bed was low quality camper bed room was officially listed as good for 3 adults But i would not want to sleep on that , great staff Good location Family room convenient 
432717,Petit Palace Barcelona, There is a school close to the hotel it makes some noise, The hotel has a prime location and the staff were so cooperative and also the breakfast was great

432719,Petit Palace Barcelona, The hotel did not provide me with the room requested on my first night but as soon as I requested to be changed the hotel immediately did so , Great location clean room and hotel the staff are what make this hotel an excellent place Fantastic overall TOM member of staff who did our check in was fantastic 
432720,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed in a Petit Palace in Madrid and Barcelona and have become big fans of this brand of lodging Petite Palace Barcelona is a great hotel Friendly staff Nice location We were a family of 8 two rooms and used Petit Palace as a Springboard to see Barcelona Easy to walk to the train or downtown sites Great breakfast We would definitely return 
432721,Petit Palace Barcelona, Nothing all good, Spacious room Beds very comfortable Staff very good and helpful Nothing was too much trouble Breakfast ok Location excellent 
432722,Petit Palace Barcelona, The staff was not very welcoming during check in and one staff member seemed somehow rude when he was pointing out that we had an extra 6 year old child that will need to be charged for , The hotel location family room setup and breakfast were all good and satisfying
432723,Petit Palace Barcelona, You can tell there was an intention and effort to make the room look elegant and all in all it worked Still I have a few observations I cannot help since I also work in this field I would rethink the lighting concept though For my taste there was either too little or too much light and not so many options in between Especially in the bathroom where either all light are on or none It would have been nice to have a relaxing bath with soft lights The build in hidden light behind the bed is a nice idea when you are in bed it works great but once you are standing it is quite blinding Although the room was clean there were a few black spots in some corners of the bathtub not so bad but also not so attractive , I traveled with my baby girl alone and it was very comfortable Spacious room and bathroom Baby safe Although you can hear the noise of the street it is really not too loud 
432724,Petit Palace Barcelona,No Negative, The hotel is located in 10 minutes walking distance to the shopping street Passeig de Gracia The breakfast variety is very good Rooms are spacious and clean Staff is very friendly and helpful
432725,Petit Palace Barcelona, The traffic noise can be a little loud maybe something you have to accept if you stay in a city , The loacation walking distance to a lot of places you would like to visit in Barcelona
432726,Petit Palace Barcelona, It was a little noisy from the street but this is the con of the great location and you simply can t get rid of the noise if you want to stay in the center of the city , Welcome fruit vase and bottles of water was a good surprise as well as small but pleasant gifts for all of our three children Location is great you can reach half of interesting places in 10 minutes 
432727,Petit Palace Barcelona, Our room was at the back of the building which overlooked a school sports area the noise was terrible After the children stopped playing the adults started which continued until 11pm shouting and whistles blowing We had breakfast at the hotel unfortunately the tables were left dirty there were no glasses or milk or cups so very disappointed in view of price 15 euros per person , Good location the room was ok sheets and towels were clean 
432728,Petit Palace Barcelona, There s no facilities but not an issue as most of the time we were out of the hotel , The hotel was good we stayed in the family room 4 nights with cozy and pleasant atmosphere It was very comfortable The staffs were very helpful and accommodating They made my son s B day special by putting greeting cards stuff toy and lollies in our room while we were away it was a pleasant surprised for my 3 yr old son when he saw What I like about this property is the location It is centrally located to most places There s a pharmacy next door supermarket surrounded with restaurants and few steps away to taxi stand If your concern is the accessibility to the main areas then I highly recommend this hotel The premises is also safe and secured 
432729,Petit Palace Barcelona, Pictures will look a lot better than the actual environment Room was really small and musty Window view was directly to the neighbor room with 2 meter distance Generally there smell of mold and humidity in the most of the areas , Location to city center Breakfast was ok

432733,Petit Palace Barcelona, The wall to wall carpet was old and dirty it was a room with a window facing an aeraway so you can never tell what the weather is like slippers and hair conditioner are not provided One night the lights went off The lobby is very simple with some worn out furniture which is not really welcoming , The location is very central the staff at the reception are friendly and helpful the bathroom is spacious and quite modern
