283504,The Capital, Room was not quite as luxurious as I was expecting but perfectly acceptable , Bar sitting areas etc very comfortable and relaxing Attentive staff who kindly let us into our room early as we were suffering from jet lag It was unexpected and very much appreciated Enjoyed a really good and quiet breakfast in the Metro next door Brilliant location for Harrods 
283505,The Capital, See above, Quiet relaxed setting Nice attention to detail and staff very attentative but room average for the money and a little disappointed with lumpy hard bed and sour milk in fridge Noisy tea maker which only dribbled boiling water really a coffee maker We upgraded our room and paid a lot more for very little Had thought english breakfast was included but subsequently found it was only continental although they included in the upgrade 
283506,The Capital, I have stayed here for many years and in the past thebreakfast was worth the pricey price tag but now it was not One egg and toast for 35 american too much , Beautiful hotel at the door steps of Harrods Luxurious bedding real air conditioning delightful
283507,The Capital, Outlaw s the starred restaurant in the hotel was a disappointment The food was on point but the service was so rushed that we did not enjoy our 55 minute in and out dinner Don t know what the rush was about The restaurant was not busy Much better places close to the hotel , The best bed of our whole 17 day stay in Britain All staff were courteous smiling and helpful Breakfast at the Capital was always excellent I ll be back 
283508,The Capital,No Negative, Outlaws Restaurant is small and cosy Very good food Excellent breakfast with superb service Good service in the bar A small intimate hotel with a very good atmosphere Within 100yds of Harrods and 200yds of Harvey Nichols Very friendly 
283509,The Capital, The bathroom was so small that I burned my leg on the towel heater twice The room was so small that there was hardly room for the bed and one armchair It was very awkward trying to move around the luggage on the racks in the room , Outlaws restaurant
283510,The Capital, Location very nosy with people talking in the middle of the night and early morning garbage pick up Would ask for a room on opposite of building , Bed was super comfy and room nicely decorated and clean Great location if you like shopping Right next to Harrods and many other upscale boutiques 
283511,The Capital, The bathtub was a bit short the heater noisy tv sound crap and the bed too firm for my liking I was shown where the light switchs are lol, Everyone was so nice and I like the decor I came in before check in time and was upgraded so I don t wait and left after checkout time and they didn t say anything 
283512,The Capital, Nothing we didn t like , The hotel is first class with excellent amenities and friendly efficient staff We were made to feel special and very welcome The car park is a great bonus too 
283513,The Capital, Dull boring interior badly fitted soft furnishings lessens the experience slow to get a drink in the bar pre Christmas Eve only three people at the bar and two staff which is unusual its usually very busy with sharper service very noisy clearing up in Outlaws Restaraunt scrubbing tables etc before 10pm at this point we hadnt ordered dessert dissapointing for Michelin star Rest The rest manager who was charming asked the kitchen team to stop and they did but started up 15 mins later food was ok but not as good as it has been in the past we would nt go back the next time we stay in the hotel we love staying at The Capital but came away this time feeling that it has lost its edge o , The staff are always very friendly fabulous concierge and parking service great location
283514,The Capital, Breakfast staff When you arrive for breakfast you feel you entered a different hotel Nervous anxious vey uptight You feel like you are intruding I tried to speak to the head of the restaurant to ask if I could sit in the bar area because I had Museum tickets and could not take long He abruptly answered something totally irrelevant to my need and took off dismissing me I waited for him and caught him face to face and told him all wanted was to sit at the bar Answer Oh I didn t understand you Solution Never returned for breakfast had room service which was perfect , Everything Exceptional attention to detail in all areas The front desk staff and concierge went out of their way to please and help in every way Room service was impeccable quick and brought all extras you might need Doormen were excellent and very efficient in getting a taxi for us every time we needed one Comfortable room bathroom with a great closet Bed and pillows were delicious and cozy Outlaws Restaurant was great On premises the 1 Michelin has great food and service Not to be missed Location right at the footsteps of Harrods Harvey Nichols and all the Knightsbridge shopping area 
283515,The Capital, We never figured out how to switch off the heated towel rail so it was on throughout our stay This meant we had to sit diagonally on the loo to avoid burning ourselves , Excellent service
283516,The Capital, No hotel lobby which was not a big issue Only one elevator in the hotel but honestly it never made me wait for more than a minute Comfort of the bed needs to be improved, Great location Professional friendly staff Their hotel s resturant have one of a kind Chef 
283517,The Capital, Quite a wait for breakfast and morning coffee, Lovely comfy bed and pillows We ate in the hotel restaurant Outlaws absolutely beautiful food with very good service Lovely breakfast
283518,The Capital, A little cold in the restaurant Though in their defence the weather had changed significantly just within the last day I did make this point and immediately it was dealt with But still it felt cool after half an hour Perhaps it could have been where I was sat near the window I asked about the fire in reception It is never lit Apparently I was told the remote control had broken I stayed over a year or two back and it wasn t lit then , The staff made you feel welcome 
283519,The Capital, I might have missed it when I booked but we had to ask for tea and coffee facility for the room , friendly bar and a good breakfast very central to where we wanted to go Extremely friendly staff and thank for the teddy bear for our grandson

283522,The Capital, Nothing we loved our stay here , Wonderful staff with a thoughtful gesture from Alice on reception Room was beautiful Very quiet for a central London hotel had a great night s sleep Excellent location Well worth the expense for a special treat 
283523,The Capital, Nothing , The Capitol offers a level of friendly service we have quite frankly not experienced before even at hotels costing much more The staff are just the best The standard of food also is excellent and overall great value for money 
283524,The Capital,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming and always smiling I have stayed in so many hotels and I ve never stayed anywhere where every single member of staff are so willing to accommodate Nothing was too much trouble Just footsteps from Knightsbridge tube station and Harrods The bed was extremely comfortable too slept so well despite currently being big and pregnant You won t regret booking this hotel lovely little personal touches fantastic staff and perfect location 
283525,The Capital, The rooms are on the smaller side , I would recommend the hotel to anyone planning on shopping in London as the Hotel is walking distance from Harrods You can actually see Harrods from the entrance of the hotel

283529,The Capital, 1 Very noisy the store center for cleaning rooms is just next to our rooms whenever they want to get something from the rooms we can hear even opening closing doors so frequently in the early morning 2 The heating system for twoels cannot be switched off the toilet seat is just close to it u can easily burn ur legs with it while setting on toilet seat we asked the staff they said that it cannot be switched of 3 I asked for iron ironing board the iron is very cheap quality 4 The blow dryer is also very cheap whenever u use it for 5 min it will swich off till it cool down re start again 5 No coffee or tea tray in the room 6 The walls are not isolated I can hear the next room noise whenever they swich off or on lights whenever they use the toilet or the shower I can also hear their phone ringing 7 Keys are old fashioned no card or electronic system for doors I can send you pictures for documentation , The location it is clean
