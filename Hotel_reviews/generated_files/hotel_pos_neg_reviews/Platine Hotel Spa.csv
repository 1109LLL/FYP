99375,Platine Hotel Spa, No coffee tea service in the room Clear glass door to bath provided no privacy Breakfast with the room would hav better justified the cost of the room Other hotels with similar cost and location did provide breakfast , About 20 min Walk to Eiffel Tower Very close to many types of restaurants 
99376,Platine Hotel Spa, Would of preferred a little more option for breakfast being a vegetarian otherwise can not fault it I think the spa services were a little of the expensive side so I did not try their services , The whole experience was very nice easy access to get around the staff were very helpful with the facilities the local area and generally any queries we had Very pleasant stay 
99377,Platine Hotel Spa, Got a call after we left saying we had consumed some of the mini bar which wasn t the case The chap on the phone was reasonable but it did leave a cloud over our visit , Great location in the centre of Paris at a great price You can walk everywhere 
99378,Platine Hotel Spa, No iron provided over the 19 hours of my stay Despite asking 4 times for one the answer from the receptionist was I can not break into a room and take the iron from another customer The should have a policy for usage in place rather than 10 customers hogging the irons even when not in use , The room was funky
99379,Platine Hotel Spa, Someone was using the jacuzzi above us it was past midnight that time we can hear the sound of jacuzzi , The bed is comfortable staff were all friendly helpful I will definitely stay here again will recommend it to our friends 
99380,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Away from city crowds charming little hotel with metro station nearby so everything can be reached easily and fast Big shopping center is next door with all the shops you might need Some local restaurants and bistros are open till 2 a m Hotel itself is clean air condition is working perfectly staff Selim co is friendly and helpful 
99381,Platine Hotel Spa, Would of like the hotel to have it s own bar , Bed was very comfy The staff was very friendly and helpful Very close to Metro station and nice walking distance to Eiffel tower 
99382,Platine Hotel Spa, The parking to cars is expensive But it is a good option to visit paris , The hotel is VERY nice Not close to some special place but with the metro very very close Easy to call taxi or uber The rooms are very clean and with good deco Sauna and hammam quite nice To park the car they have a special place but ask where is it before go I would come back I would recomended to couples Singles and friends vacations
99383,Platine Hotel Spa, Nothing , Loved the decor of the hotel and the Fifties Monroe theme Loved the lift that played old style movies First time I ve stayed in a room with a mini bar which was an added bonus Staff are very friendly and helpful when giving directions I have wanted to stay at this hotel for a while and it exceeded my expectations 
99384,Platine Hotel Spa, Breakfast should be included in room rate for what you get, The bed was comfiest I have been on and I travel a lot Super quirky rooms albeit a little small but for location this is to be expected 
99385,Platine Hotel Spa, Upgraded for free instead of having to pay 50 extra per night , Superior room originally booked was of a poor standard I had to pay 50 per night for an upgrade My fianc was not impressed 
99386,Platine Hotel Spa, A couple of our lights in the bathroom weren t working and the towel heater wouldn t turn on But still awesome place , Comfortable beds Excellent shower Awesome smelling hotel as soon as you walk in 
99387,Platine Hotel Spa, Rooms are little small Breakfast is a bit pricey, Loved the room and the big round bed was excellent lovely luxury shower And the help yourself bar big thumps up
99388,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, This hotel is in a great location 15 20 mins walk to the Eiffle tower The metro is also 2 minutes walk If you turn the block you are on to a main busy road full of shops Cafes grocery shopping everything is found near this hotel Just amazing Recommend for all 
99389,Platine Hotel Spa, The air con doesn t seem to be working it s quite stuffy when the windows are closed There s construction going on right next to the hotel and the curtains for the bathroom do not cover the windows fully , Great location Near Shopping areas and restaurants 
99390,Platine Hotel Spa, The other guests upstairs but this was not at fault of the hotel , Quirky Hotel very comfortable and clean only issue was what had been booked which was booking com error not hotel and was rectified on arrival please note when booking com say soundproof rooms this means quiet recommend the round bed it s huge 
99391,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Guest oriented hotel with movie theme Not too big hotel room nicely decorated clean very comfortable bed wi fi great friendly staff Location wise 2 metro stations are just a few minutes away all interesting points in Paris easy accessible from hotel big shopping center just a stone s thrown away Eiffel tower at walking distance easy accessible from airport RER B metro safe and nice location with pastry shops bakeries and restaurants nearby 
99392,Platine Hotel Spa, Our room was so small The bath was horrible Glass door You can see everything and hear everything Relly un personal It the room was no space for an unpacking case So we live two days in case No cattle for made our on a cup of tea or coffee we really miss , The hotel has so amazing position Nothing is so far You can walk every where With very comfortable bed 
99393,Platine Hotel Spa, Nothing really comes to mind I mean I stay here even when I have free place to stay elsewhere Maybe a bit cheaper , 1 Location location location for where I needed to be 2 I m used to this area 3 quiet non touristy area 4 not too hard to get here from CDG via the RER train 
99394,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, We had a great time Location was perfect breakfast was delicious very clean rooms and staff was very helpful We had an issue with our flight and Allan helped us even call the airline get a new train reservation and so on They really go beyond 
99395,Platine Hotel Spa, We thought that the breakfast selection could be improved The eggs and sausages tasted like they ve been reheated a few times and there was very little fresh produce on offer a handful of fruits and a bowl of wrinkly cherry tomatoes They charge 15 euros per person for breakfast and for this amount it is probably better to head to a caf to kickstart the day Also we were almost charged separately for the breakfast which was in fact already included in our room reservation , Excellent location almost next door to the Beaugrenelle shopping centre The Eiffel Tower is visible from the surrounding streets and is about 25 30 minutes away on foot The rooms are small like most other hotel rooms in Paris but we were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room with a very spacious balcony many thanks for that All in all quite good 
99396,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Really cool hotel with a good location in a nice neighborhood Nice touch with the whole Monroe theme and the round super sized bed Perfect hotel for a lovely romantic getaway to the City of Light 
99397,Platine Hotel Spa, The reception staff is good and nice but I lost stuff when I lived in there I think hotel manager should focus on this issue , The location is good and it s near to Eiffel tower 
99398,Platine Hotel Spa, couldn t be any better, Beautiful stylish rooms very friendly staff different type of bread on each table in a basket very like french bread for breakfast I ll definitely go back when I am in Paris 
99399,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Very nice hotel and excellent location The staff is extremely friendly and they went an extra mile They helped us booking cab and even tickets for the next journey Regards 
99400,Platine Hotel Spa, There was no enough mirror with good lighting, The room is clean and the decoration the hotel was close to seine river and your Eiffel and great shopping mall The area was quite but great 
99401,Platine Hotel Spa, No swimming pool the Internet access was too hard they were fixing a problem for the connection but I accessed during night so it was fine not big problem and they fixed now I think , The room was so wonderful and the location is amazing the receptionists were very helpful thank you so much for all
99402,Platine Hotel Spa, They kept knocking on our door for maid service even though we had a do not disturb sign up Other than that one of the coolest and nicest places I have ever stayed in , They were very helpful and so nice It was very centrally located and I would recommend getting an uber wherever you go but walking along the Seine towards the Eiffel Tower was definitely worth it It s also located next to this big mall where you can get a lot of shopping done 
99403,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Marilyn Monroe theme the shower was roomy and the lights were brill in the shower The staff was amazing and friendly and couldn t do enough for us 
99404,Platine Hotel Spa, Room was quite small , We have a free cell phone with unlimited data plan which was provided from the hotel It was awesome I don t have a roaming data plan coming from the US so this free phone helps me a whole lot Just using the city mapper app alone has saved me a whole lot of headache The location is great It is opposite to a shopping mall and wlkable distance to the Eiffel Tower It is close to Charles Michel subway station 
99405,Platine Hotel Spa, Breakfast was expensive so we opted for a wonderful patisserie down the block The elevator was super slow Very minor things We want to go back to this hotel , The shower was the greatest shower we ve ever had The location was fantastic and the room was quiet The staff was helpful and friendly I requested extra pillows and received them 
99406,Platine Hotel Spa, Breakfast food was not the greatest considering the price Hotel seems a bit pricy overall all things considered I would probably look for someplace a bit less expensive next time , Hotel is close to Metro and Roland Garros tennis It is modern and the staff are friendly My room and bath were tiny but what isn t in Paris Breakfast in the hotel was convenient but expensive Good news digests for guests to read 
99407,Platine Hotel Spa, Nothing really, I Love the DNA of the property and the fact that it is small and very tailor made in their client approach The design and the MM Theme I like a lot and the stories are told throughout the property
99408,Platine Hotel Spa, lift was operating very slow Had to wait 10 12 minutes during the rush hours but that happened only twice A bit expensive but i guess Paris is like that, Staff was very helpful Bed very comfy

99413,Platine Hotel Spa, No English channels on TV no tea and coffee facilities in room tiny toilet cubicle expensive charge 5 extra euros for ordering room service after 10pm making a sandwich 22 euros at least even at 1 minute past 10 , Bed was very comfy and spacious Retro decor 
99414,Platine Hotel Spa,No Negative, Fun Quirky hotel rooms are comfortable and quite modern There is a good selection for breakfast Situated in a good shopping area close to the Sienne and a 10minute walk to the Eiffel tower Close to the metro The staff are lovely and very helpful 
99415,Platine Hotel Spa, Could do with some more space in the smaller rooms but themed rooms in Paris are often not too generous in terms of space The decor is great but some parts of the rooms feel a bit tired worn so it s perhaps time for some redecoration, Staff were all great seemed genuinely friendly and were always smiling Lounge was very stylish Location was convenient
99416,Platine Hotel Spa, Room is very small as most of Paris hotel rooms , The location very close to the Eiffel Tower Everything within close proximity of the hotel such as Monoprix and the metro within 2 minute walk
99417,Platine Hotel Spa, No, Despite being in the 15th district the Hotel is in a secluded part and totally que et at night I loved it that I was able to open the door to the balcony The professional swimming pool next door at the Keller piscine of 50m was outstanding
99418,Platine Hotel Spa, What sounded like a jacuzzi tub in another room kept us up most of the night one night as it was turned on and off all night, Very trendy decor comfortable
99419,Platine Hotel Spa, smell like newly constructed in bath room cleaning lady didn t Chang sheet of bed after our 6th night stay Once they did not provide new shower cap shampoo slipper after they thraw the used one very narrow room and toilette perhaps it s in Paris, Very friendly and helpful reciption especially the young gentleman when we check in very good location near metro good restraunt ATM supermarket locate in a safe area so you don t need to stay at hotel from 8 00PM modern design with comfortable bed
99420,Platine Hotel Spa, The room assigned was very small plus a great disadvantage in the room I stayed the toilette and shower room is divided by a glass door so there is no privacy for guest sharing room The bed is to soft or needs renewal , The front desk staff is great nice district close to the exhibition complex 
99421,Platine Hotel Spa, Typical Parisian small room and especially bathroom The bathroom had no natural light so the door was glass which means zero soundproofing Not very romantic , Pleasant hotel in nice area very friendly staff We enjoyed the sauna even though to call it spa is a tiny bit exaggerated WiFi worked well bed was comfortable
