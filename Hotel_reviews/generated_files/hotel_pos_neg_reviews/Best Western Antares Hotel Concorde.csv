495707,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Number 1 problem was the attitude of one of the staff members This guy was kissing up the customers with a smile but talked very rudely to his colleagues especially to a cleaner Additionally it was funny that the staff was running during the breakfast and colliding with each other , Room was exceptionally large like having a living room of your own Hotel was clean modern and stylish Metro station Turro good restaurant New Friday and grocery store Carrefour were located nearby 100 300 meters Everything worked well 
495708,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The bathroom there was a hole above the shower which made the bathroom unfinished, Very spacious room Near from a supermarket and the public transport
495709,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The quality of central air conditioning wasn t good irrespective of temperature set the cooling did not seem effective at all We booked a triple room but what we were provided was really a double room with extra bed sofa cum bed Also the location does not offer any great view from the room just the road and buildings all around , Good location just 150 mts from metro station Turro from where Duomo is 7 stops away The property is located next to big departmental store Carrefour Its also quite close to the Milano Centrale main railway station of Milan less than 10 mins drive by taxi The hotel staff were nice Breakfast spread was good and there were some toys for children to play with in the dining area that kept them engaged during the breakfast Best part was that they provided Handy an Android smartphone specially designed for hotel guests that gave us free calls internet maps tour offers etc that we could carry out of the hotel This was a pleasant surprise for us and was quite useful 
495710,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Air conditioning was not working Room got up to 28 6DegC in the evening It was also very dirty under the air conditioning unit Seemed to just blow air , Good breakfast and located close to Metro and Shops 
495711,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The location was a bit too far out of the city although very convenient for the Metro , The room was a good size for the family The room was clean and tidy with good facilities Good proximity to the Metro and the supermarket 
495712,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Booking com offered breakfast at 5 each but hotel wanted 8 In the end we didn t eat breakfast at the hotel Hotel didn t respond to email , Hotel is very nice Also useful to have a supermarket next door 
495713,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Both the breakfast and the dinner needs improvement For the breakfast they need to focus on quality But for the dinner it is both quality and the quantity they should improve We had a half board booking and the dinner was served in very small quantities I suggest to eat somewhere else Also the room temperature is controlled centrally thus you cannot adjust it based on your needs , Good location next to the metro station Turro Nice and helpfull reception Clean and comfortable rooms and beds 
495714,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights First night was with a group as a bus tour with Gartours the second night we booked additionaly Best Western in Milan was the best through the whole tour Location is very convenient It is located 3 min walking from subway station on direct line from all famous attractions Comfortable nice bedding good size of the room with spacious walk in closet good breakfast Compare to all other hotels in Rome Florence and Venus provided by our tour operator that one was a nice surprise
495715,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Nothing to write here we got everything we expected , Excellent location polite and helpful staff good quality of both service room service till 23 30 at very very reasonable prices and accommodations spacious room clean bathroom Plenty of places to have a quick bite breakfast Red subway line is 2 minutes away from the hotel so that s a major plus 
495716,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, It seems that there was a problem with the booking I would have expected that the people at the reception would try to solve this problem but they just said that there were no rooms available I had to convince them to give me a solution On top of that they were not friendly as of they were making me a favor , Very clean comfortable bed
495717,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, There is a lack of lighting in a room to dark in my point of view To drive in out of the garage would test your driver skill to limit especially if you drive a big car , Staff was very kind and helpful Best Western is a brand that keep a certain level of quality 
495718,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The cleanliness is not at its best spiders on the wall some dust around the window area We arrived late for dinner 21 30 restaurant closes at 22 00 the portions were quite small and rare cooked steak tuna compared to the dinner from the next day , Close to the Turro Metro Station which links directly to the city center Comfy bed The rooms are spatious and equipped with everything you need Wi Fi works well Price Service for a double room with demipension is great Breakfast is quite rich and at dinner you can eat some tasty italian food if you arrive in time 
495719,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The ladies at lobby on arrival were very kind that can t say about young man the day we had to leave I had a problem with battery of my car unfortunately this was Sunday not much help from hotel I had to find myself a shop to by a cable an search for someone with a car to start the engine Don t go with a car to this hotel 20 euro per day for a parking with very narrow entry and no elevator to hotel ,No Positive
495720,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, walking little beat far away from central station but with taxi pretty close 11euro , Me and my friend stayed here 1night the room was very nice clean confortable bed
495721,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The shower had no holding place for shampoo and the garage is not directly linked by an elevator take care if you have a not high car Anyway not real problem , Clean and warm 
495722,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Liked everything for the price, Everything was perfect Very near the metro nice cafes and restaurants just steps away A large departmental store just next to the hotel Decent neighbourhood and very friendly staff The restaurant serves good food Breakfast is wholesome Will choose the same hotel if I were to visit Milan again 
495723,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The restaurant is closed at the weekend Didn t know this until we returned to get out bags and have lunch before traveling home A shame The room temperature was wayy too hot Couldn t work adjust the aircon heater , Perfect location 5 mins from Turro Metro station We were able to leave our cases there before checking in and after check out On the Red M1 line so fantastic access to the Duomo 
495724,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Quite noisy room the window didn t close perfectly with the room facing main street and poor wall soundproof unfortunately we had a very noisy group staying near us in the last night at the hotel , Very good placement near metro station 15 min up to Duomo metro Station Carefour market 24h open near hotel Very good WiFi 
495725,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, lousy breakfast cold scrambled eggs orange juice containing more water than juice , Close to metro stration Old style hotel well kept Nice and helpful staff 
495726,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Hotel Parking area a little difficult but there is on street parking available in the immediate area need to buy parking vouchers from Metro Station The cooling system AC was not operational so there was no way to adjust the individual temperature inside the room except by opening the window Central heating was on full , Good size family room comfortable Sofa bed and decent bathroom Bedroom decor a little dated but bathrooms modern and well equipped Easy access to Metro which runs straight into the Duomo 
495727,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, nothing , location close to the metro and supermarket next door breakfast was good and staff were very good will stay again this was our third staying at this hotel 
495728,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde,No Negative, We had a great time in the hotel it takes approximately 15 minutes to go to the city centre Duomo with the subway It s a quite area where with not that many restaurants around but there is a big supermarkt exactly next to the hotel The staff was very friendly and the hotel was looking great We will definitely come back to this hotel if we visit again 
495729,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Seems silly but theres no plug next to the bed to charge your phone while laying down, The room was so confortable and the hotel is in a quiet neiborghood with a 24h supermarket next door Metro station 50m away 
495730,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, 0 communication with the hotel we sent many questions through booking and direct e mail but NO ONE answered We asked if we could pay cash when we get there we inquired about the amount of money that was withdrawn Now 8 DAYS LATER the amount they took is still reserved and nobody is answering the staff s attitude gave us a wrong room the view we had a perfect view of a concrete wall see attached photos the breakfast the only edible things were the croissants the tomatoes were old the omelette was not done the thin walls we could hear everything that was going on in the other rooms , The only thing that made our stay worth it was the fact that a subway station was nearby 
495731,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Besides that everything was disappointing unpleasant greeting upon arrival they met our request for a warmer room with arrogance etc About the food I ve had better breakfast in 3 stars by far Limited variety cheap assortment of meat poor coffee and overall the impression of cheapness altogether Not to mention serving the exact same thing each day Dinner in the restaurant was a bit better the waiters were nice and respectful The food though one night was horrible one night was pretty good , The highlight of the trip was the cleanliness Nothing to complain about that everything very clean and the housekeepers tidied every day and left everything in perfect order 
495732,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The breakfast especially on the Friday was posibly the worst food I ve have every had the misfortune to experience most of it had Been there all week salad type but the scrambled egg sausages were to say the least discusting the smell of the eggs were unbelievable at first I thought it was me so I put egg bacon sausages tinned tomatoes which I like normally the smell was not good and when I took mouthful of the egg it came straight back out I won t go any further but needless to say if I can smell the food is off how can the waiting staff not On my experience room only very clean and comfortable eat out , God location friendly staff clean modern facilities 
495733,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde,No Negative, Close to the Metro line which helped a lot Our intention was to visit the Duomo in Milan and found leaving the Car in the Garage saved us money on parking fees 
495734,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde,No Negative, Modern entirely convenient friendly hotel with very helpful staff great breakfasts and wonderful dinners so coming in late in the evening there is no need to bother where to find a place to eat Additional benefits are given to the nearby 24 7 supermarket where it is possible to find anything needed and at any time 
495735,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Parking was difficult not sutable for cars over 1 8m height we solved on the street The dinner service not buffet service was a little slow for our kids 1 5 hour , Comfortable large romantic room 2 adults 2 kids thereof 1 in an own crab breakfast was perfect public transport is close Turro We mainly suggest it for couples 
495736,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Stayed in 2 different rooms as we had a tour in between our stay Bathrooms varied some not so good in areas but good in others Had a toilet that whistled as you walked in and raised it s lid Very weird , Large rooms and king size beds 
495737,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The air conditioner was working ok but not so great and sometimes we felt it wasn t enough for us Also a fan would have solved the issue but it wasn t available at the time we asked , Comfy beds being sofa bed or actual single bed Large room and always cleaned up to perfection It is also a quiet area to just chill The metro underground is in walking distance from the hotel 
495738,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Maid was a bit inconsistent one day she would turn the bed down the next take the throw off altogether we only had 2 cups for hot drinks although there were 3 of us one day out of the 5 the cups weren t cleaned and the tea and coffee was not refreshed and the 2 English channels on the TV didn t work All small issues that didn t spoil our stay , Size of the room was first class shower was hot and powerful air con worked a treat without drafts Good food in the restaurant although it was a bit pricy
495739,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Bathroom was in need of some TLC Perfectly functional and clean but the floor was full of cracks and in places the flooring had come away which didn t reflect the 4 stars Not a reason to put you off the hotel though , Staff were absolutely fabulous Metro stop was very close Parking was easy Great sized room for 4 with really comfy beds 
495740,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, I have nothing to complain about Very nice place to stay , The personell was very helpful Both for parking luggage handling and good suggestions for restaurants in the area Large rooms with great beds Nice stay 
495741,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The air conditioning was very noisy We had to wait to the room because the door was repaired , The room was very nice and big The bed was comfortable The metro station of the Line 1 was nearby 
495742,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The room was a little bit cold although we were there on July, Large and very comfortable room breakfast was fine with a nice variety could have more 
495743,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde,No Negative, Fully staffed hotel at a good price a little off the beaten path of the hotels near the Stazione Centrale but with easy access to the Metro and with cafes and a couple of nice local restaurants nearby as well as a full grocery next to the hotel for water and supplies Comfortable rooms and a nice bar downstairs 
495744,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Nothing, Everything metro is near room is quite big also bathroom Restaurant on the first floor is very good the staff on the desk are really helpful 
495745,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Breakfast was the worse I have tried in Europe ever They tried to sell it for 10 euro and I found it was 4 euro on booking com but even this was a rip off Everything was dirty and coffee machine was discusting They need to redo this from scratch because the memory was enough to ruin our experience of the hotel which really is impressive upon arrival Best Western hmm mm They should audit their chains also upon paying things didn t add up They use a calculator to make price and I was questioning price and she had to recalculate I m still not sure the previous authorisation to come off was correct and will likely have to contact my bank after to ensure I was not overcharged We shall see once back home I don t know why this is a 4 star Now We stay in a 3 star next to sans siro that has everything this hotel does and more Hmm mm , 24 7 shop next door 10 mins to centre on metro and 6 euro 2 people return Room was big 
495746,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The staff was not a four star pretty incompetent and neither kind at all The parking lot was indecent we ve never seen something like that definetly not a four star Unbelievably narrow very dangerous for a sport car steering system and suspensions and they even charge for it Definetly the worst best western hotel we ve been in Europe , Location was good near the city centre 
495747,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Would have liked a business centre but the reception was more than helpful in printing what I needed , Very Comfortable bed Great breakfast Close to the Metro Decently priced for a 4 star 
495748,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, During my 4 nights stay several valuables goods were stolen from the room Security is zero in this hotel The staff support was also near zero they behaved almost like a neutral 3rd party simple observer taking no responsibility I could talk with a manager about 3 days after the facts and all I got were promises but no progress feedback till now I appealed to Best Western hotel chain customer care service but with same little results so far So that a stay supposed to cost me 500 EUR was finally 1500 could have stayed in a much better and safe hotel for less So be aware and think twice when you choose to stay in that hotel ,No Positive
495749,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Wifi signal drops many times during our stay in the end room staff should smile more often , High quality room close to Metro the room look and feel exclusive big breakfast
495750,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The hotel cancelled our reservation without informing us the staff did not take responsibility for this and even blamed us very poor service from a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
495751,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, nothing great expected more for a 4 star Best Western in Milan Staff needs to be more effective in Room cleaning atleast my room wasn t cleaned properly, All basic 4 star facilities available Close to metro
495752,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, They charged from my visa card 581 92 when I checked in and they charged again 631 20 and they told me that the previous amount was only blocked when I contacted my bank they told me both amount has been deducted So the total amount which has been stolen by the hotel is 1213 12 Wifi is not working all the time I got smaller room instead of what I booked and paid for Towels smells so bad ,No Positive
495753,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, In April they don t allow you to use the air conditioning The street noise was very loud with the window open Either way we a bit uncomfortable sleeping , It was only a block to the metro stop
495754,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The internet connection wifi all the time it s not working There is 6 charges for each time you order something like water or something else excluding the water price The towels smells so bad My booking was a room which is 26m but i got a room similar to a grave And i got a room with 2 beds and my booking was 1 king size bed but they told me its not available , Good location great stuff 
495755,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The heating did not work March 26 27 , Huge selection for breakfast good location on the metro line Really helpful staff It s a pretty good BW Hotel as the BW standard 
495756,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The shower was super small All the amenities that were supposed to be there were not The city fees were not included like booking com said they were The front desk was not aware of our reservation nor the price of our stay until we showed them the reservation on booking com , The bed was comfy and the size of the room was good 
495757,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Shower was very small but fine for a short trip Was disappointed I had to pay same price for children breakfast as adult My children are 1 and 4, Breakfast was lovely nice big room for 2 adults and 2 children
495758,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The WiFi signal is very weak in the rooms Very bad for who needs to work with , Very comfortable hotel noiseless I mean the rooms not on the main street and very close to the metro station M1 line stop TURRO Bykes for free for the guests

495760,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, We were locked in the parking garage with no means of attacting attention We were given a smoking room when a non smoking room had been requested Our room was very hot and a request for the temperature to be reduced went unanswered , Closeness to metro stations Good breakfast 
495761,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, There was not any complimentary coffee only tea, The space in our room very comfortable for four people The underground nearby The supermarket near the hotel open every day 24 hours 
495762,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Unfortunately the place was not air conditioned which would be a problem during the middle of summer we were lucky we had temperet weather as the window is required to be shut due to street noise , Nice comfortable room big enough for the 4 adults 
495763,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, Booking com web site page indicated availability of shuttle service to from Malpensa airport but that was not available No big deal an inexpensive bus ride 2 transfer metro ride got us there just fine , This was a very nice hotel to stay in for our family of 4 It is located outside of the central Milan area but that is mitigated by a short and convenient metro ride with at most 1 transfer The hotel is located adjacent to a bike path and provides bikes to rent an intriguing alternative way to see Milan that we unfortunately were not able to take advantage of 
495764,Best Western Antares Hotel Concorde, The Staff seemed a bit rude and I felt like I was a bother to them to ask any questions Not at all warming , I loved the location spacious room and the convenience to a parking garage
