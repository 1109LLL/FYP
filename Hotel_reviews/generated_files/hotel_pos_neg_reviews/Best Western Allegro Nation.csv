151416,Best Western Allegro Nation, issues with WiFi average quality of the room considering it s a 4 star hotel weird hotel policy asking guests to leave keys to their room every time they leave the hotel, fairly good price friendly staff
151417,Best Western Allegro Nation, The WIFI was out for 3 days Had to pay for breakfast , Staff was nice Location close to Picpus metro Lots of cafe restaurants close Room was comfortable and quiet area 
151418,Best Western Allegro Nation, Clogged sinks damp smell hair drier didnt work in both rooms we rented eggs uncooked everyday cleaning pushcarts most of day in front of our rooms Not deserving of 4 stars Will never recommend this hotel,No Positive
151419,Best Western Allegro Nation, The personnel was pretty stiff at the beginning but afterwards the attitude softened , Good positioning for the purpose of the trip comfortable bed nice breakfast with enough things to choose from 
151420,Best Western Allegro Nation, My room smelled like cigarettes I had to sleep with the window open and then I got a cold I could hear people walking around upstairs from 1pm until 2am Honestly I think someone was just walking around back and forth all day ,No Positive
151421,Best Western Allegro Nation, Room was quite small Away from tourist places and metro closes about 00 00, There is metro within 5 mins walk that brings you where you likely want to go
151422,Best Western Allegro Nation, The bathroom is too small There s carpet flooring in the bedroom Not the same level of helpfulness from the reception staff the first gentleman we met was very helpful and caring the following two quite careless and annoyed when we asked for information If you have a bigger car you cannot use the hotel car park , Breakfast was nice with good quality fresh baked goods The room was clean and quiet The location was good only a short walk from Porte de Vincennes M1 line which takes you to the centre of Paris very quickly 10 15 mins and without having to change trains 
151423,Best Western Allegro Nation, Only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is that the breakfast was aweful Not worth 13 euro go somewhere else , Great location metro just around the corner good choice of restaurants in the area and a very nice area to stay Hotel staff are extremely helpful and will do anything for you Room was clean and tidy and modern WIFI was excellent Would stay here again 
151424,Best Western Allegro Nation, Would have liked bigger pillows on the bed and some English breakfast tea both in the room and at breakfast , Very comfortable king size bed nice bathroom and location was good for Metro Breakfast was plentiful and constantly being replenished The staff couldn t have been any more helpful and they were all charming I would recommend this hotel for visitors who want to be just outside of Paris central We found the hotel quiet and relaxing 
151425,Best Western Allegro Nation, We were unpleasantly refused to do the early check in although we were really to pay more and we arrived at 11h in the morning which marked the very poor service quality The communication with the hotel was really unpleasant The receptionist was not at all attentive And we have to wait for hours sitting in the hall after 13 hours flight La qualit de service tait tr s mauvaise Le r ceptionniste n tait pas du tout attentif On nous a refus brutalement d tre enregistr s un peu plus t t alors m me qu on tait pr ts payer plus On est arriv 11h du matin On a d attendre plusieurs heures dans le hall apr s un vol de 13h Bref a a t une exp rience vraiment d sagr able ,No Positive
151426,Best Western Allegro Nation, Me and my girl are both 1 80 Didn t know French people or so small we were both taller than our beds we both had to sleep with bent legs quite annoying Also the rest of the hotel room was just really small and the pictures which you can find on the internet are just misleading I will never book a room in this hotel again unfortunately , A parking area under the hotel acces via a car elevator Kinda cool that was the coolest part of our stay actually
151427,Best Western Allegro Nation, We arrived in Paris on October 4 2015 in the late afternoon and checked into our hotel We asked where the hotel parking was situated and were told that there were only a few parking spots and they were only for small cars and therefore were not able to park our SUV We were totally misguided since the advertising showed that parking was included and size of vehicle was not specified The hotel clerk told us to park a few blocks from the hotel We proceeded to go to our room We found the carpet to be absolutely filthy We requested another room After showing us the third room it was even worse We were told that the carpet had faded Also the walls had water damage Best Western should be informed of this situation since their reputation is at stake Please refer to the pictures of the hotel room We obviously did not want to stay there however the clerk said that we were going to be charged for the four nights We immediately called Bookings Customer Service They informed us that we would only be charged for one night Because it was so late we didn t have time to look for another hotel so we stayed at the Best Western Needless to say we had a sleepless night We checked out the next morning We were charged for that night Bookings suggested a few other hotels and we chose Pullman which was rated as a four star This is truly a four start hotel and we were very satisfied The Best Western was also rated as a four star The question is who is rating this hotel In our opinion it should have been a two star We were extremely disappointed with this Best Western especially since we had just come from a Best Western in Amboise Loire Valley We were satisfied with it We are requesting a refund Euros for the one night at Best Western Allegro due to our dissatisfaction with the cleanliness and inconvenience We were so uncomfortable and did not sleep that night Thank you for your consideration Regards Milos Jojic,No Positive
151428,Best Western Allegro Nation, The room was really noisy The walls are paper thin so one can hear everything from the rooms next door for instance one night I could hear someone snoring There is also a dance studio right behind the hotel Loud music was played daily until 10 30 pm I could also hear the teacher s instructions Finally whenever someone showers one can hear the pipes really loudly The solution I turned on the heater to muffle the exterior sounds even though it was not cold at all in Paris One particularly warm evening I turned the heater on for white noise but kept the window open as unfortunately the heater did not double as ac , Incredibly clean rooms very kind helpful staff Breakfast was delicious better than some restaurants Bed was comfortable and the room was spacious
