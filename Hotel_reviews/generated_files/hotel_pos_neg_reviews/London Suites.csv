117112,London Suites, V small room small bed no window noisy fridge needs repairing or replacing , Very powerful shower Handy location for start of Prudential Ride London 
117113,London Suites, Sound proof wasn t amazing We could hear people outside But it wasn t bad enough to ruin the stay , The d cor of the room Really modern and cosy 
117114,London Suites, very noisy road traffic even with the window closed lack of air conditioning no glasses provided, very close to Stepney Green tube station zone 2 comfortable bed mattress studio size
117115,London Suites, Incredibly hot room Very very very noisy location above a Turkish Restaurant on a busy road Mattress very hard making for a very poor nights sleep, Relatively clean Secure entry to building and each individual room 
117116,London Suites, The stairs are a tad bit steep which could be tricky getting large luggage up and down also there are no lifts so totally not wheelchair or pram friendly They have some nice looking blinds however they don t completely blackout the light luckily I sleep through whatever light so I was fine , Such a good location for getting into central London Took us about 20 min to get into the city and there s a underground station plus local buses just across the road from the hotel I liked that the room was very clean and tidy Also the shower was larger and powerful than I thought it would be 
117117,London Suites, The room 1 is TINY and two people can barely squeeze themselves into it I would call it a Halfsingle room not a suite The noise from the street is awful No a c so to be able to breathe you would have to open the window don t forget to take earpads with you otherwise sleepless night is secured , Great location steps from District H C line zone 2 
117118,London Suites, Our room was on the front so quite noisy but to be expected being in such a lively area Code to get in room was e mailed after we had left home so didn t get it until we found wifi connection , Very clean and good location opposite tube station Good choice of bars restaurants and cafes nearby Once we found e mail with door codes check in was easy 
117119,London Suites, only a facial towel was available outside the window the air conditioning from the side restaurant was interrupting all night, excellent availability proximity of shops iron refrigerator hair dryer
117120,London Suites, check in did not work properly no contact person at the property did not get an invoice yet even though I contacted the property multiple times and asked about it,No Positive
117121,London Suites, Bathroom sink too small No tea bags milk given Only 2 sugar sachet and 2 biscuits were present in the room 1 knife and 1 fork not sufficient for 2 people The reception hours are from 10 A M to 5 P M So if you need anything before and after this hour it becomes difficult No elevators only narrow steps so not ideal if you are with big luggage , Good for its proximity from Stepney green underground station Small yet self sustained room Bed was cozy Room was clean I arrived at midnight and checked out early and the apt management ensured all were pretty comfortable even without the presence of any staff Iron board with iron hair dryer shampoo and conditioner given The room has a microwave refrigerator and electric kettle 
117122,London Suites, Despite a check in time of 2pm being given we finally got into our room at 4pm This was after it taking 40 minutes to find the hotel Looked like a office building No bath towels only hand towels Told big towels finished what does that mean 2 of us to share 3 hand towels after a shower on the hottest day of the year is not good No air con just a desk fan that was tiny Hair dryer broken Could not leave the window open to get air due to sirens all night This place should not be a hotel and to charge 95 00 for the privilege is a joke Not a happy customer, Bed was really comforable
117123,London Suites, A bath towel short and didn t have a spare Patrons banging doors Upon arrival there was no clear instruction as to how to enter the property Had to call number on door staff member couldn t be bothered coming down until we were unable to open the door So many mistakes by staff member upon our arrival booking in time was 14 00 hours we had go a walk until our room was ready at 14 50 hours Took us twice to wrong room Rooms work on codes had to ask twice for code Disappointing , Spotless Comfortable bed 
117124,London Suites,No Negative, Compact but had everything you needed Well thought out and put together accommodation Great location just across from tube station Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely stay there again

117128,London Suites, The staff were unavailable Had to wait for host to let us into the room This was the case for the next guests who arrived as well as well who I bumped into and assured would be seen to in due course , Close to the canal network very nice walks Good eating all around 
117129,London Suites, Location seemed quite rough sirens from police cars every few minutes and very noisy until early hours of the morning The bed was very hard and uncomfortable too , Microwave and fridge in the room useful
117130,London Suites, The room was absolutely dirty even the walls The microwave had fungi inside and the cover bed had burns cigar Last floor without internet signal Noisy neightborhood and nobody never at the reception , Very close to the underground
117131,London Suites, The noise isolation of the room isn t very good Given the fact that the building is located on a busy street it s quite loud Also it s not possible to make the room really dark , Connection to public transport is excellent 
117132,London Suites, The room is in very bad area terrible place to be in the night We were scared walking after dark as streets are full of those people you try avoid Food not even one english or any kind of normal food All around its Turkish or Iraqi restaurants Its not close to centre so better find other place , The room was good size and very close to Subway station literally across the street

117137,London Suites, The room was dusty The street where the hotel entrance was smelt horrible , Perfect location right in the opposite of tube station The mattress was of great quality 
117138,London Suites, Noisy due to being right on a busy road Bed was uncomfortable main issue was the pillows were too flat and only 1 each , Lovely bright room nicely decorated clean and fresh and ideal location right opposite the tube station Amazing value for money
117139,London Suites, The fridge made a very high pitch noise which kept me awake in hindsight I m sure I could have unplugged it The sink was very small and the shelf above made it hard to use for washing my face , Easy to access great location really clean modern 
117140,London Suites, Although the flat has a microwave and a small fridge there is no place to wash the dishes There was no room cleaning service , The place was literally in front of the Stepney Green underground station so it was really easy to go anywhere There are restaurants bars some fast food places and even a supermarket so you can buy almost anything you need right there Communication with the staff was great even when there is no physical receiption they are always available to answer your emails or phone calls which is really great Our flight got really delayed and they were always helpful 
117141,London Suites, Previous guests toiletries and food in the fridge had not been cleared Dirty under bed The entrance to the hotel is kind of hidden off the main road Very very noisy street through the night with no proper blinds so very bright Difficulty getting a taxi as it s a suburb Intermittent barely there WiFi in the room Impossible staircase to manoeuvre with luggage Definitely not suitable for a business traveller Facility not manned so no help available Cleaner barely speaks English, Lots of restaurants predominantly Indian around Comfortable warm double bed Opposite tube station and bus station
117142,London Suites, Nothing , The location as it was great for getting around as the underground is across the road also there is many pubs and restaurants so we were spolit for choice 
117143,London Suites, I asked for quietly situated room when booking i was given room on main mile end road which was v noisy I did not get any sleep also the blinds did not block the light from the main road which is well lit Friendly staff who spoke better english more helpful i e remote control did not work for the lights and I just got a no when asked if they could replace this there was no bedside lamp and non was offered so had to turn out the lights on the wall and go to bed Floor was in need of a good clean and rugs needed hoovering I was put off by long hairs in bed when duvet pulled back although the sheets did smell clean Hairs on cushion on bed Code for free wifi did not work Hard bed , Local to Queen Mary s University Good shower 
117144,London Suites, WiFi still an issue, Stayed here a few times now Great place very easy to check in and out no reception for me this is ok but take it into consideration excellent value for nothing 
117145,London Suites, The room was not clean when we arrived We needed to ask for big towels new bedsheets and Toilet paper There was no Toilet paper when we arrived Small Entrance and Stairway Do not take big Suitcases with you The room Bathroom and Bed were small For one Person maybe OK but for 2 to small The Room was really noisy Hospital cars pass every few minutes You almost hear everything from outside , Underground supermarket and some Restaurants really close Fast travel to the center of London with the Underground

117147,London Suites,No Negative, Easy to get to 15 minutes from London Bridge and literally across the road from Stepney Green tube Purpose built clean rooms with ensuite rooms as shown in the pictures on the site Microwave in rooms with crockery and cutlery which makes eating easy with supermarkets close by Stayed 3 times with further visits already booked 
117148,London Suites, The Wifi was a little weird 3 different networks with 3 different passwords and non of it worked I used the free Wifi from the restaurant below in the end , Excellent value for money given the location perfect for a local overnight stay relatively high standards Hosts were absent but they did check if all OK and the set up if very efficient all done online and via text though so take this into consideration for me it was ideal 
117149,London Suites, The room could do with a bedside lamp , The room is basic but perfectly clean and comfortable The staff were really helpful card was originally declined for the last room available and they were great at helping to sort it out 
117150,London Suites, WIFI wasn t working at all and the staff did not do anything about it I asked them to let me know whether they would be able to fix it and the lady I spoke to said she would speak with the manager and let me know but I have not received any answers after that It was really annoying as I was supposed to work which I obviously couldn t I understand technical issues happen but I d expect the staff to fix it or at least try to fix it , Very clean and cozy 
117151,London Suites, The WiFi was unusable We practically did not have any internet connection in our room Can be noisy Soundproofing is almost inexistent , Very close to the metro station Clean room with new furniture and equipment 
117152,London Suites, Pillows a little too flat for me but otherwise fantastic , Nice clean room with small kitchen facilities and a nice ensuite The tube wasn t running fully when we stayed so we had a short walk from Mile End Lots of amenities outside the suites too The colour changing light in the room was awesome

117154,London Suites, Room facing inner courtyard with window next to extractor fan from ground floor restaurant Noisy throughout the night and very strong food smell , Convenient location Recently refurbished rooms 
117155,London Suites, Noise on top floor from heating machines or other equipments that sometimes made eve the floor vibrate Lack of dark protection for window Black out to keep dark during day , The proximity to underground cleanliness and private bathroom 
117156,London Suites, The rooms are either on first or second floor which is a bit inconvenient when you have big travel bags cases , The room is well equipped with necessary items and the location very convenient because of the tube Stepney underground and bus station just across the roads 
117157,London Suites, The blinds They need to be thicker as they let in all the light But that is being really picky , Perfect location right opposite the tube station The Lady in reception was so friendly and really helpful she went above and beyond her job

117162,London Suites, Very noisy even with window closed Lots of emergency vehicles travel with siren on that road and very poor soundproofing No AC so if it s too warm either the heat or the noise will keep you up Wifi signal was very poor and internet link itself was too congested there was no QoS or bandwidth shaping so one user hogged all the bandwidth Trash was not removed in 3 days I guess you need to ask explicitly for maintenance No reading light , Close to subway Has a small fridge 
117163,London Suites, Wifi Signal was very poor Lots of stairs No elevator No aircondition Noise , Location Opposite underground Clean room Value for money Helpful staff

117165,London Suites, To their credit they made an effort to make the place hospitable to guests but without truly seeing the room from the guest s point of view Some of the issues included there were some pretty blinds in the window which did nothing to block out the blinding street lamp outside that was aimed directly over the head of the bed The sink was too flat against the wall and had a shelf over it Thus I had to very awkwardly brush my teeth over the sink because there was no space to properly do this and hit my head on the shelf several times because of this Also there is a very bright fluorescent light in the room but if you want to read in the evening then there is no lamp or less harsh light suitable for reading unless if you wanted to use the street lamp which shone directly into the bedroom Location was quite okay except for the fact that the room was located over quite possibly one of the busiest streets in the night in London There were non stop motorists which I could get over but there were also non stop emergency services driving past flashing lights siren sounds etc and that went on through the night , It was close to the underground a large number of shops and restaurants and the location at which I needed to be 
117166,London Suites, There were only two pillows on the bed which made sleeping a little uncomfortable but after a long day this didn t matter As the room was next to a main road it was a little bit noisy however this could be expected being in a city , In a good location with the closest tube across the road As it came with a microwave and fridge it meant we could save a couple of pounds by having tea in and not eating out The bed was comfortable The bathroom was a good size and the room was spacious 
117167,London Suites, Just you need to sort out the problem, All the night was motor noise coming in the room from the bottom of the hotel or bhind the hotel We coudnt sleep al the night
