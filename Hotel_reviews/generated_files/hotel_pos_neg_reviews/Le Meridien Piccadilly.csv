104199,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Staff and location,No Positive
104200,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Advertised as parking and there is no parking advertised as having a jacuzzi and no jacuzzi Whilst having a very expensive massage was told the music was not working Very disappointed, The bed was comfy and location very good
104201,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Check in was terrible we were early it took half hour to check in rooms were not ready understandable but when we came back it took just as long The room was cold no heat so a heater with one coaster missing was provided Bathtub is not user friendly for seniors We were on the 3rd floor and had to go down a flight of stairs and the railing on the left was not useable Breakfast was not included with the room other hotels we stayed breakfast the carpet was thin and the floor creaked with every step , The location was good They helped to provide transportation to airport 
104202,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Slow check in and check out Unhelpful reception staff Tired looking dark and in need of decorating Lack of useful information i e times and location of breakfast suite Dining area particularly on the second day of our stay was very cold Definitely not 4 5 star , Food was as expected Concierge were helpful
104203,Le Meridien Piccadilly, There were not enough electrical sockets in the room I had to get on my hands and knees to reach the only available one which was in the back of the wardrobe I found this very difficult as I am 80years of age and find it a problem getting up and down from the floor ,No Positive
104204,Le Meridien Piccadilly, room size and view not so good for the price you pay room facilities such a water not available only at a cost bar and restaurant service charge expensive specially for the price you pay already to stay at the hotel Our stay was pleasant , Staff and location were perfect 
104205,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The queue at breakfast was ridiculous and I stood waiting for a seat 15mins whilst watching staff doing selfies I left and went elsewhere , Gregory the Polish man at the guest liason suite was fabulously professional Beds were ultra comfortable 
104206,Le Meridien Piccadilly, I had to wait about 3 hours for my room the be changed as the one we was given was awful with the worst creaky floorboards I ve ever heard also very dated, The breakfast was really nice in a lovely room with a good choice of the buffet
104207,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The room was old No slippers in the room porter brought it after I had asked for it , The hotel is ideally located at Piccadilly street The bed was really good 
104208,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We need to leave at 7 on monday but there wasn t t breakfast so early We ordered breakfast to the room and it was poor english breakfast we paid as a breakfast buffet , Location was excellent and staff were very nice Room was nice but only very small window in the corner so room was very dark and the wasn t t enough light 
104209,Le Meridien Piccadilly, cleaning in rooms could have been better for this high class hotel smell in the bar was not the best in the room 7th floor the smell could have been also better would be nice to have it everywhere the same as in lobby, had a nice room bed was great location couldn t be better service was so nice loved the smell in the lobby
104210,Le Meridien Piccadilly, There s nothing that i didn t like about Just that the Men s shower and locker room facilities could have more been up keeping , I like the the newly refurbishment of the rooms Liking the view facing the city of London loving the centric location just behind regents street and walking distance to the heart and central of London Of course not forgetting the warm welcome from the concierge and reception Staffs were very polite friendly and allowing me to do my late check without charging an extra fee up until 1 to 2pm I m loving it and will come back again whenever i m visiting London This place is definitely worth every penny that money well spent compared to other 5 stars hotels which will make you pay 2 to 3 times the price of this 
104211,Le Meridien Piccadilly, I specifically chose this hotel for the presence of a jacuzzi in its wellness centre as my partner loves it and it would have been a surprise for her to celebrate our anniversary Unfortunately I only found out that the Jacuzzi was out of order when we entered the wellness centre Their website is totally misleading as it still shows a video with people enjoying the Jacuzzi Currently there is a partition wall between the Jacuzzi area and the rest of the swimming pool We have been told by the staff working in the spa that the jacuzzi has been shut more than one year ago Certainly they could have removed changed the video on their website or could have just advised of the disruption Disappointing not something you d expect from such a renowned hotel chain , The great location the presence of a 24hour gym and no 2 squash courts 
104212,Le Meridien Piccadilly,No Negative, Loved the room it had a lot of space very confortable bed and a fantastic view The staff let us check in earlier than agreed and gave us extra time at check out as well
104213,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Terrible English breakfast but good continental Burnt toasted sandwich from room service occasional bad smell wafting around the pool side , Comfort location nice pool 
104214,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We were told we had an upgrade as it was my wife s 60th birthday which was great the problem was that because the guest already in the room was a platinum member he had a late check out at four pm this meant that from twelve midday we had to wait for our room until five pm and we had a meal booked prior to a theatre show at five thirty so we had a bit of a rush , lovely hotel pure luxury
104215,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The staff and food in club house is terrible food is poor and left over Everyday food is the same and really poor in quality and quantity Staff hardly smile first thing they ask is your room number but not hello or good evening I dont feel welcome when i come to club lounge even i paid for it Pool is freezing and close at 8 only good thing is location and not value for money at all,No Positive
104216,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Stay would ve been excellent if not for the fact that fire alarm rang at 6am in the morning which woke us up too early was out til 12AM the previous night Got nervous only to be told it was a mistake Staff very apologetic over the phone though , breakfast buffet was superb 
104217,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Our room wasn t ready when we got there at 4pm At 5pm it still wasn t ready so my husband did his thing and we got a smaller room immediately there were 3 of us for 3 days so it was a little tight That was the start of a 3 week trip unfortunate after a 12 hour day of traveling ,No Positive
104218,Le Meridien Piccadilly, too many stars for such an old hotel rooms are dark creaky parquet old furniture too much money for this hotel except the location does not deserve 5 stars Very disappointing,No Positive
104219,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We arrived the hotel at the 3 30 pm and our room wasn t ready till after 5 pm We finally checked in after hours of waiting and very slow and poor service The club room is meant to be occupied by a family of 3 and we are here to stay for 8 nights The closet space in the room is ridiculous not even fitting for a single room Our clothes and belongings are scattered everywhere around the room for the lack of storage or closet availability The only closet available in the room is literally 1 5 meters wide with no drawers or shelves Our clothes are all in our luggage for the next 8 nights In addition to the fact that the closet is taken by the safe and the mini bar Service at the hotel is very slow and almost non existent Room was not prepared with enough towels in the bathroom and of course we had to wait hours for extra towels to be sent to the room There is no space whatsoever for our suitcases and as I mentioned we are a family staying together for 8 nights with a bunch of suitcases The pressure of the water in the shower is very week Employees at the front desk are not cooperative in any way to try and help solve our problem The quality of the room and service is far from what we expected to see at a 5 star hotel in the center of London We looked into checking out but unfortunately it is the holiday season and all hotels around are fully booked We are extremely dissatisfied with a very gloomy lifeless windowless very small club room in addition to very poor and far from 5 star quality service whether by employees at the reception housekeeping or the concierge Even after we finally got the room last night we had to wait for our luggage for an hour and we only got them when I went searching for them and was told they didn t know my room number to send the luggage up I hope you take my criticism to the hotel management as soon as possible , The location
104220,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Swimming pool have cold water but hamam was the best, 1 I like that in tv I have 2 important Russian channel and can look news 2 Food 3 Clean We was 10 days but don t have many time enjoy this perfect hotel Thank u so much Spasibo
104221,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Not comfortable no Arabic TV Channels the bathroom was not good The furnitures was old It is very expensive compared to its level , The staff was friendly only
104222,Le Meridien Piccadilly, the rooms are old and not as per pics the 5 start rating is overrated and i will never stay there again the toilets are like 2 stars and i waisted my money paying for a suite and only got 2 chairs and a bed , location
104223,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Room is small for 4 adults Breakfast buffet has poor selection and takes the staff ages to re fill Wifi signal is really bad in room dining is tasteless Deposit amount is ridiculous Very expensive for the quality offered squeaky floors very annoying furniture outdated Beware of hidden charges in your bill Would not rate this hotel as a five star however i would consider staying in this hotel again just for the location and the amazing staff, Staff are very friendly and helpful Free Wifi Location is the best Speedy check out
104224,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The first room we were given had a very tired bathroom the bath had practically no enamel However after complaining we were moved to a nicer room fairly quickly One aspect I was very unhappy about is the period of time and the amount you held on my debit card The cost of my room booking was 630 but you held 820 which was only released today two days after checking out because I phoned your accounts and complained apparently you normally hold this money for up to a week Maybe you assume everyone staying with you is very wealthy however this was a special occasion which I had saved up for so to hold 820 of my cash prior to Christmas has caused me a few issues over the past couple of days , Warm welcome and noticing it was my wife s birthday when we checked in including complimentary bubbles and cakes delivered to room 
104225,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Maybe for the price it could have breakfast Included, Best thing about this hotel is the location However it is also very smart and clean and the room was really quiet 
104226,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The included breakfast was dreadful No cereal bowls No bread No bacon No hash browns Cold tea Restaurant only about 20 occupied at the time at 09 00 hours Sunday , Lovely room
104227,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Hotel needs refurbishment it is not a 5 star Also for EUR515 per night I did not expect to get charged GBP3 00 to print three 3 A4 sheets of paper No slippers in the room rooms need refurbishing to 5 star standards Not value for money , Location is excellent
104228,Le Meridien Piccadilly, There was no hot water coming out the shower head anyhow there was also almost no water coming out of the shower head and hence this could be seen as additional plus minus Quite dirty room especially the bathroom was definetly not properly cleaned up The trash wasn t even empty Very used furniture shower and air condition You come into the room and literally bump into the bed because everything is so small and I haven t even stayed in the lowest rate room My colleague didn t had a desk in his room same category Concierge wasn t able to get a table in a restaurant near to them We went out to king s street and tried on our own what worked after 3 tries, Excellent breakfast providing everything from healthy to classical English breakfast Friendly and well trained stuff Very good bed
104229,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Only stayed one night so didn t really use the facilities Only negative was having credit card charged with 100 at registration in case of any extras used Obviously to be returned if not applicable but have never had to do this in a hotel before , Bed very comfortable with good quality sheets and pillows Staff very friendly and helpful Location excellent for the venue we wanted Well sound proofed room at comfortable temperature 
104230,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Guy on reception ask if we were there for special occasion I replied yes my husbands birthday he rang and spoke to some one to say what room we were in but nothing happened Not that we were bothered really we enjoyed our stay , Comfy bed clean room nice and cosy
104231,Le Meridien Piccadilly, a muddle over the pre booking of breakfast included and no realistic idea of costing of food on menu, loved all the fresh fruit Enjoyed the light and spacious breakfast parlour 
104232,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Pool rather chilly Cocktail ordered was very average and when we advised we were taking it to the room the barman asked to pour it in to a different glass as they were short of cocktail glasses the glasses used to serve my spirits were well past their best Now I like drinking in nice places and price is not an issue if the surroundings and service warrant it Unfortunately this hotel simply did not warrant it Prices were as expected though due to location However maybe someone could buy some new glasses for the bar We didn t eat at the hotel as I am a night owl and had no intention of getting up that early , Great location
104233,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The room was not a 5 star quality The carpet was coming away and lumpy at the bathroom door It was not sound proofed could hear the next room talking at night And our room was over looking the dining room which I thought was a little odd , Comfy bed Staff were pleasant 
104234,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Our bathroom was fine but not deluxe and since my husband is tall the shower in the bath arrangement was not perfect , The hotel is in a really great location in the heart of central London which is perfect for site seeing and shopping Efficient and friendly staff who catered to our request for a quiet room Good breakfast too 
104235,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Mix up with breakfast charge but they didn t charge in the end so all good Also poor choice of TV channels , Room and bed was very very comfortable Staff were brilliant very helpful 
104236,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Employees are not professional The front desk guy gave me the wrong room key and the second key he gave me didnt work at the gym and he didn t fix the key until I left Also I requested a two beds room in advance but they gave me a one bed room Then they changed it for me but the one without a window ,No Positive
104237,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Cost was high But you get what you pay for in the middle of london , Staff were just so nice Got complimentary wash kit as lost my bag before arrival booking com messed up my room initially but the hotel sorted it out when I arrived 
104238,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Felt a bit disorganised at times Very busy hotel and very large When we booked we were told there was parking but when we got there we were told there was no parking so had to go and find somewhere ourselves in the centre of London , Gave us an upgrade for free as our room wasn t ready 
104239,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We had an emergency as our daughter developed a high grade fever and the hotel staff were completely useless inhumane rude and completely un understanding to delay the booking for two days although booking com approved it from their own rooms Will never consider booking in this hotel that lacks any common sense They were just happy taking our 240 for nothing Terrible experience and highly unrecommended The Duty Manager called David would not even bother answering our calls He even had the audacity to suggest that we find someone to stay with our kid so we don t lose our booking as if we were going to leave a 4 year old on their own but a 4 year old with high grade fever would not want anyone but their mum Then they asked for a doctors note if they had any common sense they would understand you do not take a kid to a GP until 3rd day of fever and imagine getting the Doctors note just for a Hotel booking Just a complete and utter horrible experience ,No Positive
104240,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Tired room Filthy windows and frames Second part windows wouldn t close Very poor for a 5 star It s really a 3 star with 4 star prices , Bed
104241,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Poor room quality and dated fittings decor room not clean as you would expect for pricey hotel extra deposit not mentioned in booking or conditions very very poor, Easy to find
104242,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We called for room service at 10 55 and no answer We spoke to reception who told us to the try again which we did but by now it was past 11pm and the night menu was only the available Good stitch up we felt The room was tiny and tatty and had seen better days many moon ago The bathroom was so small grubby and the shower curtain was ripped The air con blew straight on to the bed The air volume control did not worth so I had too get up 3 times during the night to turn on and off We asked if this was a deluxe room as booked which apparently it was Hate to think what the other rooms were like Anyway if this is how Booking com rate their hotels one needs to be more careful in the future , THE Club Sandwich was OK
104243,Le Meridien Piccadilly, didnt like the buffet breakfast I went early but it wasn t very warm and the bacon tasted as though it had been sitting there for hours and was so tough The buffet selection was great but the hot food really let it down,No Positive
104244,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Poky room corner of corridor on stairs creaky floorboards no hot water in afternoon evening for showers and sporadic aircon Overall a disappointing experience by comparison to previous experience there b4 Xmas 2015, Location
104245,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The hotel have charged my credit card by extra 300 pounds as a security deposit I do not like the idea nobody does so Moreover i was promised to have them returned via 7 10 working day and till today after almost a month of my return i haven t get them back yet , Location is great heart of London and besides a subway Spacious room and this is not a typical option in Europe 
104246,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We had drinks on the terrace and the staff were not attentive I gave a 10 tip not realizing there was a 12 5 gratuity in small at the bottom of our bill which I thought was bad so I walked away having paid a 19 tip on an 85 bill So that did not make me happy at all, Good location
104247,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Everything else definitely not a 5 star low 4 star at best We even spotted that the hotel furniture was from IKEA for god sake , Location was Excellant 
104248,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The floor in our bedroom is from wood and bit noisy but since we are mostly going out so it is ok , Location is very closed to city center The staff front men is very helpful

104311,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The altitude of your reception staff , Staff at the repection a lady was very aggressive non coperative Indians are very pleasantly discriminated and we felt the same even in Paris I guess that s the over all culture at Le meridian Would never visit any of your properties world wide 
104312,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The room was a little tired carpet and sofa sad looking and it wasn t available until about 4pm , The facilities and situation are perfect Staff very helpful 
104313,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The hotel completely ignored our special request for a twin room despite the fact that we had requested that they let us know if they couldn t provide it We had to wait several hours on arrival for a room that matched our requirements No apologies Just said they had no record of the request which still shows on the Booking com website Plumbing very old fashioned and tiles severely cracked in bathroom , The bedroom was a reasonable size and had good facilities 
104314,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Our room was quite dark and gloomy even with all the lights on There were no slippers in the room we had to phone for them The fridge wouldn t open and even after someone came and got it open it didn t work therefore we had no cold drinks in the room , Staff were very helpful

104347,Le Meridien Piccadilly, Cold and very basic room with a bathroom just big enough to accommodate one person I would compare the room with a Budget Hotel in desperate need of refurbishment It raises the question whether you get the poor rooms if you book through booking com , Location

104374,Le Meridien Piccadilly, The room floor was so squeaky When one of us wake up at night to go to bathroom We all wake up because of the squeaking noise For the money they charge they should fix the wood floors not just cover them with the carpet Also the breakfast was very expensive compared to what it includes 36 per person is ridiculous Do not buy the room with the breakfast you have better and cheaper choices outside the hotel , The location is excellent The metro is half a block away Walking distance from piccadilly circuse Trafalgar square and Big Ben The room is large and pleasant The staff is friendly

104377,Le Meridien Piccadilly, We identified a leak in the bathroom very early on the Sunday morning which severely interrupted our stay and meant for an earlier wakening than we wanted The leak was due to an overflowing toilet in the room above and also to building works ongoing there This was a great pity since we had been looking forward to the stay my wife s birthday for some time , Swimming pool excellent Location very good as we were at the theatre each evening
