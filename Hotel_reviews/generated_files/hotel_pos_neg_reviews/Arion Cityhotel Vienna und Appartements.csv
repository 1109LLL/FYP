343460,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, The location was a bit far off from the city center Also the bus that is supposed to take you into city center only comes roughly once every hour so it is a bit of a hassle if you miss one you either have to waste an hour waiting or take a cab , The staff was very friendly and helpful The restaurant had some good food Our room was upgraded upon arrival and was great 
343461,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, There is no refrigerator in the room It is hard to get there by public transport , The birds are singing just before your window Linen and towels are good 
343462,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, Incompetent stuff they did a double cover for the payment Allthough one payment was done the second one is still covering the double cost and I still don t have access to my money in my bank account The room has also a small kitchenette and 10 empty closets but don t think you will be able to use it there is nothing in the room not even a glass to drink some water The breakfast is very poor for a 4 stars hotel for the price that you pay you don t have that many things chooses from , A big room with a lot of space A good price quality ratio for a room in Vienna 
343463,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, Misinformation about bus connections and infrequency of buses Many staff were surly When I asked for a snack around 9 30 the bar tender said the food was finished and to order a takeaway from reception they stated they had 24x7 food where was the restaurant Stingy with small things e g 1 pillow no butter for bread at breakfast , Not much at all Overall experience coloured my impression of Vienna and I would NOT return here 
343464,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, The breakfast was too expensive 12 euros There was no cold milk The drawback of the location is that it is about 35 mins away from the city centre but the tram network closest stop Tesarekplatz is trust worthy frequency is 4 6 mins in the morning and afternoon , The room was really large and clean The staff was friendly and helpful The hotel is located on the SW corner of a wonderful large park Erholungsgebiet Wienerberg and many rooms have a view of the park The breakfast was rich and of high quality I loved the chocolate cake I would definetely choose it again 
343465,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, Nothing to dislike location is not central but then the rates are so reasonable one simply cannot complain We had a car so location didn t bother us but for others this could be a hindrance , Clean very comfortable and spacious rooms parking was sufficient staff are nice and helpful

343468,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, Quite far from the city center The entrance from the underground parking to the hotel area was a bit weird clear directions are needed And although it is understandable that not all guests opt for the breakfast menu it was very annoying to have been asked twice about my room number and if I payed for the breakfast , OK place There was nothing special about it really The break fast was ok The rooms were nice and comfy clean as well 
343469,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, This hotel is damn so far from the city center Believe me that it takes almost one hour to go to the city center You have to catch the bus number 360 which comes just per 3 times per one hour and goes directly to Karlsplatz Or you have to wait for the bus 16A to go to the metro station Am Sch pfwerk station at line U6 This is the nearest metro station which is 1 8 km far from the hotel If you are in business trip and if you have to go to the work every morning just stay away from here The staff is not so polite They are just doing their job and that s all The rooms are not so clean Actually the room was cleaned every day but it is not perfect just ordinary done job There is not a market in almost 2 km radius of the hotel There is just a little market inside the fuel farm close to the hotel and it is an expensive one because you know that these markets in the fuel stations are always expensive , The room and the facility meets the description in the web page Double room was big enough There was a refrigerator and a small kitchen in the room The area of the hotel is silent and peaceful and there is a huge park with a lake inside it near to the hotel It is a pleasant place to stay if you want just for walking and biking and etc

343543,Arion Cityhotel Vienna und Appartements, The services provided by the hotel staff need serious improvement When we arrived our room was prepared for only one person although we booked a double room The reception guy gave us one more set of sheets and we had to make one bed ourselves The second day when we arrived in the evening we saw that our room wasn t cleaned garbage was not removed and towels were not changed The reception sent the cleaning lady to fix the situation but our bad impression was already formed , Nice and large rooms although simple new furniture clean and quiet Free parking but not enough places The hotel also has a few parking places in a garage at 7 euro day Good value for money except for the services
