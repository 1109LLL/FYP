403425,The Rookery, No elevator The neighborhood is a bit shabby Toilet uncomfortable Separate hot and cold water tabs are not practical , The decor and ambiance Staff are wonderful 
403426,The Rookery, Breakfast could be included in the price and the street gets a bit noisy very early in the morning from the delivery trucks at the nearby market , A nice traditionally designed hotel with an aura of authenticity Very cool place 
403427,The Rookery, Staff on check in unhelpful was made to feel like a bit of an inconvenience I had requested late check out an hour later and they did not acknowledge this when I questioned I was given a blunt No and that they don t do late check outs Rest of the staff and on check out was very polite and helpful , Rooms were beautiful as was the bath tub Comfy Beds great location and most of the staff very happy helpful and accommodating 
403428,The Rookery, The only note I have is it would be great if the staff were more welcoming at reception and helped guests with their luggage at the door Otherwise no complaints at all , The location is great the beds are amazing and the hotel done up in perfect taste It s so peaceful No noise no disturbance 
403429,The Rookery, Small thing but the pressure in the shower was very poor in my room, Extremely friendly staff made me a delicious pot of coffee and home made short bread biscuits FOC because I checked in early from my flight excellent Wifi And super for advice on locations and printing things
403430,The Rookery, The breakfast can be served downstairs in the living areas on request Previously this was set up for breakfast making it better Lighting in room was a bit dark common problem for hotels , Rookery is centrally located for St Pauls and the middle of the city within half hour walk of Westminster and of Tower Building is old giving a sense of being in older London with modern insertions like the shower Staff are attentive and provide no cost services such as printing documents Need to be alert to some stairs with the staff helping with bags 
403431,The Rookery,No Negative, We stayed at the Rookery to celebrate our wedding anniversary and couldn t have hoped for a more perfect stay Thanks in particular to the friendly and helpful staff for making our visit extra special Loved the feeling of being in an oasis in the heart of London Amazing room great breakfast honesty bar and of course the quirky period features for which the hotel is well known Definitely hope to stay here again 
403432,The Rookery,No Negative, Very comfortable quiet rooms I ended up working quite a bit in the room but was comfortable and could enjoy the surrounding neighborhood by opening the windows The staff was very accomodating and helpful Thanks 
403433,The Rookery, The bath tub was nice but not good for taking a shower, It is building with quite a bit of history Furniture was nice Lively neighborhood nice to walk around lots of good places to eat and drink
403434,The Rookery,No Negative, We had an absolutely fabulous time it s a little bit of heaven in the centre of London My 15 year son and myself had a very short 2 day break we enjoyed coming into the charming lounge with it s well stocked honesty bar it was a lovely way relax after a busy day in London walking for miles We loved our stay at the roockery
403435,The Rookery, Staff not particularly friendly Got woken up on more than one occasion by a door slamming outside our room they could do with dampeners is some sound proofing , Great location Great decor 
403436,The Rookery,No Negative, Although small our room was lovely and had all the necessaries The air conditioning worked beautifully which was great as London was warm The hotel is filled with wonderful antique furniture and paintings The staff is very friendly and accommodating There are great restaurants very close to the hotel We had a wonderful time 
403437,The Rookery,No Negative, The staff was really nice the breakfast was very good and the housekeeper cleaned the room very well We absolutely loved this hotel and will definitely book a room there again 
403438,The Rookery, No iron ironing board coffee facilities in the room but not necessarily missed There was noise in the street at night so if you re a light sleeper ask for a rear room , The hotel gives you the feel of being Lord and Lady of the Manor This is a very special place so English and its not often you get the feeling that all the staff treat it as home and take extra care with the details If you want run of the mill square box boring hotel this is not for you but if you want romance history sumptuous furnishings and a feeling that you have been transported to another era but with all the modern convenience then this is perfect This hotel is one of the very few I have been in where I felt I had an experience not just a stay 
403439,The Rookery, There was a function on outside the room which was very loud unfortunately Also the bar was closed for an event which meant we couldn t enjoy that A shame as it had a lot of potential but ultimately paid a lot of a comfortable bed , Nice decoration and the bed was very comfortable
403440,The Rookery, shower curtain was a little close so couldn t step out of the water, garden patio was great room felt special staff was very attentive This has a unique feel loved the story of the property and it wasn t a chain hotel Close to variety of restaurants cafes and train Easy to hail a taxi nearby 
403441,The Rookery, Wish they had a breakfast room where you could have a cooked breakfast and breakfast should be included at this high price , Gorgeous hotel so unique
403442,The Rookery, 1 It was unbearably hot in the room I was put in Nathaniel Butt and the window was open when I got in there so I assumed given that I couldn t find an AC dial and the hostess hadn t mentioned it that there was no way of adjusting the temperature This made it very difficult to sleep I was told the next day that the staff could adjust the temperature that should be made clear on arrival 2 Due to the window being open and this being an area surrounded by shops and restaurants a lot of deliveries were being taken nearby in the night that were very noisy Again this made it very difficult to sleep There were also roadworks taking place directly below my window I understand that this is not the hotel s responsibility but it would have been better if they hadn t put me or any other guest in this room while the works are going on 3 the lack of a shower while the bath was lovely it made it inefficient in terms of getting ready for work early in the morning and made a hot room even hotter Overall really disappointing for the very high price point , The staff were very nice and polite throughout 
403443,The Rookery, Rather hot at the top of the house and would prefer a walk in shower We ate breakfast out as the room was not really suitable to have breakfast in , It felt like you were staying with friends in a beautiful home Good sitting areas 
403444,The Rookery, Nobody significant Ambiance was a little dark and masculine A few bunches of flowers around the building in addition to the one in reception would have added to the charm , The room had a Dickensian feel to it as expected The staff were helpful Lounge areas available and similarly styled 
403445,The Rookery, Nothing Don t change It offers a different experience , Cool low key relaxed atmosphere and different from the modernised purpose built hotels in London Great location 
403446,The Rookery, A bit more lighting in the rooms would be nice they re very dark , Absolutely lovely and helpful staff Excellent mint tea and biscuits lovely sitting area and such unique decor Excellent location with lots of London s best restaurants nearby and all the best sights and neighbourhoods only a short walk taxi bus away I only stay here when I m in London 
403447,The Rookery, All perfect , The Rookery was GORGEOUS just perfect As a disabled visitor there was a plastic chair in the walk in shower for me Luxurious bed Witty and comforting decor Spectacular Great location 
403448,The Rookery, No lift but Dickens didn t have em either , Just fabulous unique London experience like a Dickensian house in STYLE overlaid with the best 21st of cleanliness luxury charm and courtesy Obvs costly but you get what you pay for plus comfiest bed in the world 
403449,The Rookery, Appreciated the decor and design wished my room had had a standing shower , A stylish hideaway in a perfect location great service and thoughtful design A real find
403450,The Rookery, Our room overlooked Cowcross St which meant we got noise from nearby market in very early hours followed by noise of refuse collection This happened 2 nights in succession with very little sleep We got a quieter room afterent that , Great position wonderful period property well equipped rooms very helpful staff 
403451,The Rookery, Max only 2 people in a room, The room was lovely it was very comforting and I had booked the hotel room for my birthday night and it was a very great stay 
403452,The Rookery, honesty bar only had prosecco by the bottle please add small mini bottles for customers to buy we left and went to a bar nearby because of this so they missed out on extra cash, Some much character in this place was really cosy and the bedroom was huge and the bed comfy
403453,The Rookery, Freestanding Bathtub I prefer shower Poor lighting Missed one or two more electric outlet for my laptop near the desk One comfortable chair for reading Tv would also have been great , Atmosphere Spacy room and bathroom Breakfast Close to Farrington station and tube
403454,The Rookery, I was expecting a breakfast at a 4 for 259 pounds per night 4 floors hotel but no elevator, good location nice staff nice ground floor common area with meeting rooms
403455,The Rookery, The booking website messed up the booking leaving two adults and a 7 year old with one small double bed Being NYE they were fully booked and did all they could but resulted in me spending the night on a duvet on the floor This was the fault of booking com not the hotel , The staff were excellent and the hotel was beautiful Full of character 
403456,The Rookery,No Negative, The whole experience was absolute luxury The staff were professional and expressed themselves in a high manor The facilities were incredible The room size was fit for a queen with furnishings to match 
403457,The Rookery, The stairs can be a little bit overwhelming especially when you have luggage if you have any mobility issues do let the staff know in advance as they were very helpful , Loved the room we had at the top of the stairs with a great view out over the street Fantastic selection in the mini bar and best bathroom ever that bath is amazing Loved the honesty bar too a perfect spot to relax at the end of the day in front of the fireplace with a book and g t from the bar And the hotel cat 
403458,The Rookery, Being an older building the facilities are quite limited including breakfast and room service The breakfast in room is a nice idea however the quality and value for money could be imrpoved There is no elevator in the hotel meaning you need to climb some stairs but the staff helps with your luggage , Staying here is like a time travel The hotel has an amazing unique charm beautifully decorated and very nice location The staff is helpful I stayed in a single room with a bath tube i requested it The room is quite spacious much larger and comfortable than other places I have stayed The bath tube was beatiful and I loved it but might be a least preferred option for people who prefer to shower 
403459,The Rookery,No Negative, Stayed in the Rookery a number of times and never disappointed Excellent location gorgeous rooms and bathrooms and helpful and understanding staff Will be coming back 
403460,The Rookery, The staff we rent overly polite we were told to leave the lounge area because the manager was having a meeting in there even though reception told us to wait there for our taxi The receptionist didn t recognise us even though she had checked us in 2 hours earlier Not much food choice either , Hotel was quirky a little different from most London hotels
403461,The Rookery,No Negative, I loved that it felt like a home inside it was so quiet and very lovely touches throughout to make it cozy I loved the beautiful selection of books 
403462,The Rookery, I prefer having a shower option in my rum rather than only a bathtub , Staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming They even helped me to give my wife a birthday party in the conservatory 
403463,The Rookery,No Negative, Excellent little hotel full of character and charm Our room Joseph Smith was delightful the bed and linen were very comfortable and the room was huge for london This will be our go to hotel in london 30 secs from farringdon tube and over ground Plenty of restaurants around Staff were excellent 
403464,The Rookery, My only suggestion would maybe to have a couple of board games in one of the communal rooms But that s just a personal thing We did think the breakfast was really overpriced for what it was Other than that our stay was faultless , Really unusual and quirky hotel Very cosy and comfortable Impeccably clean Staff were really friendly and accommodating Great location too 
403465,The Rookery, More towel hanging space only one rail for 4 towels Small room and not much space Would have liked more breakfast options Fire door banged throughout the night as people arrived and left , Comfortable bed and spotlessly clean 
403466,The Rookery, I like a stand up shower instead of a tub The tub was nice and big but hitting the road in the morning requires a shower for me That is just personal preference , The old world charm and accouterments were outstanding The Rookery felt like being in a home away from home Very casual and relaxed but elegant and refined I really enjoyed discovering this place but enjoyed staying there even more 
403467,The Rookery,No Negative, We spent our wedding night at the Rookery the service was unbelievale They looked after us so well didn t return one request down The room was so gorgeous we spent some of our morning just admiring the little details and really enjoyed the charismatic bath tub We had a lovely time chatting to the ladies at the reception while we had cat time with the hotel cat Lady Grey We will go back for our anniversaries to the most beautiful place we have seen in london loved it 
403468,The Rookery,No Negative, A beautiful charming hotel One of the most comfortable and pleasant experiences I have had in a hotel The superb bath was deep and roll top And the bed was incredibly comfortable The customer service was excellent especially from Michael I will be returning 
403469,The Rookery, would have liked a bath in ensuite but mostly wanted complimentary water The room was stuffy and I need to drink a lot of water during the night , bed was very comfy
403470,The Rookery, Only downside was the lack of shower cabin you can shower in the bathtube though which is however quite understandable given the bathroom was also 18th century styled , Great athmosphere with original 18th century furniture All the 30 rooms are different and mine was definitely comfortable very comfy plaster bed and very causy This is quite an exceptional out of the ordinary hotel Great location surrounded by cobble stone street full of restaurants and bars The staff was great too nice welcoming and knowledgeable about the history of the hotel and the characters highlighted throughout the hotel each rooms have a local historic character s name 
403471,The Rookery,No Negative, In a world of faceless corporate sameness in hotels this is a jewel Individual styling comfortable and a real feeling that the staff were there to make your stay better 
403472,The Rookery, Toiletries in room lacking or small Mini soap bar my husband is not a body wash guy and no extras like cotton balls Would expect more for a quality hotel , The staff are very attentive and so willing to help or answer a question Makes you feel very comfortable and secure away from home Having living room for a comfortable sit and honor bar is nice after a long day out and about 
403473,The Rookery, Had to pay for bottled water no tea making facilities in the room no dining room to eat breakfast at a proper table, Location comfy bed no sound of generator in the room lovely decor
403474,The Rookery, Unfortunately my request for an early check in was not passed onto the hotel by Booking com and there wasn t a room ready for us on arrival As a result we had to get changed for a wedding we were attending in a toilet which wasn t ideal , The room was excellent location amazing and the staff were very attentive 
403475,The Rookery, Having the choice of bath or shower rather than the booking being pot luck Beautiful as the free standing bath was I much prefer a shower For the overall cost of a night s stay the breakfast might have been included , Wonderful ambience very stylish extremely pleasant and efficient staff and a great location pubs and restaurants in abundance 
403476,The Rookery, Lots of noise from the street with deliveries and people shouting We requested a quiet room due to this being a business trip we need a good nights sleep , Very friendly staff and spotless clean room 
403477,The Rookery, That I couldn t stay longer , Gorgeous rooms with old world charm Welcoming and friendly staff Breakfast is delivered to room only and was a lovely treat 
403478,The Rookery, A shower in the room I used the shower in the bath and water spilled everywhere Didn t stop my enjoyment of the facilities or the hotel , Room was great breakfast was amazing and I had the muesli and fruit Staff were very accommodating friendly and fun 
403479,The Rookery, Nothing to improve on , We stayed in the Rook s Nest which was quirky and fun The bathroom is integrated into the bedroom very romantic The double storey room is very spacious and well appointed The hotel staff and facilities are excellent The room service meals were of very good quality and the breakfast al fresco is a lovely touch Farringdon Station and tube stop 5 minutes walk down the road make for very convenient travel options There are also a number of really good eating establishments in the immediate vicinity Interesting historical snippets pertaining to the area are to found around the common areas in the hotel 
403480,The Rookery, No elevator just stairs can be an issue for some, Great bed wonderful historic atmosphere super nice and helpful staff excellent location near Smithfield Market
403481,The Rookery, There was no shower other than a hand held in the bath but the bathroom had character and a shower would have been out of place , A hotel in London that had a distinctly country feel to it Much better than the standard London hotels Breakfast was very good 
403482,The Rookery, Very poor check in charged over 500 on two different cards one of which I m still waiting to have returned to add insult to injury I was then over charged over 100 on checking out again I am still waiting to have this returned This seriously limited what we were able to do on our weekend break Very poor from a hotel we were expecting exceptional service from We would not stay here again ,No Positive
403483,The Rookery, Very few extra toiletries esp for women seems to focus more on men s need No cotton wool no moisturiser etc, Extra comfortable bed breakfast was excellent 
403484,The Rookery, Night club Fusion next to hotel meant there was noise people leaving though the night which was a shame Not the best night s sleep , Location and facility were great 
403485,The Rookery, Not much wrong minor downside was the very early noise from Smithfield market 3am However this was because we slept with windows open rather than use the perfectly adequate air con With windows shut it is quiet and the location to smithfields and the rest of the hotel far outweighed any disadvantages , Beautiful room excellent location great staff Loved it and will go back If nice weather the breakfast in the little secret garden would be lovely 
403486,The Rookery,No Negative, Room was classy and stylish with a brilliant and memorable bathroom Nice big windows letting in plenty of light Bed was huge and extremely comfortable 
403487,The Rookery, There is a bit of an overspill from the wine bars and they can be a little noisy , Superbly welcoming staff a unique location Couldn t be happier 
403488,The Rookery,No Negative, A once again excellent stay at the Rookery It s a beautiful property in the heart of Clerkenwell a particularly interesting and untouristy part of Central London just adjacent to The City Staff are super friendly professional and conscientious In spite of the nearby club life I find it to be a quiet and restful aerie from the hubbub of London Breakfast is not included though there is food available to order to your room or the charming lounge but this is not an issue for me especially with so many excellent food choices nearby 
403489,The Rookery,No Negative, Old English quaintness feels is very unsual and style of room made one feel cosseted Note it is slightly on a nondrivable side street which can confuse taxis access Calm atmosphere and charming beyond words 
403490,The Rookery, Bit noisy on Friday night in room overlooking Cowcross Street , Comfy bed Furnishings and decor Individuality Historical reference for the area Smithfield 
403491,The Rookery,No Negative, Atmospheric and charming Loved the history Lovely bar and lounge and charming garden Rooms simple but comfortable Staff were welcoming and friendly 
403492,The Rookery, It was extremely expensive I understand you have to pay more for luxury so I can t complain but the price was 3 times more expensive than anywhere else I ve stayed in the UK , Service outstanding The staff were 100 amazing attentive and dealt with our requests with the upmost professionalism and efficiency The hotel itself was gorgeous wonderful location and such a fantastic building with so much history Food and drinks 
403493,The Rookery, The complimentary bathroom shampoo etc appear to have been used before which was not pleasant The bathroom could also use more shelves or a cabinet just to make unpacking a little more convenient Other than that everything was top notch at this hotel , The bed was really comfortable and the sheets were excellent quality leaving with you with a luxurious nights sleep The decor and the finish cleanliness were top rate And the staff were so pleasant and helpful we could not fault them one bit Breakfast was great value for London and to have it served to our room was simply delightful 
403494,The Rookery, There were some small service issues I had made requests that weren t followed up on immediately, A beautiful building in a great location the d cor is excellent 
403495,The Rookery, The breakfast charge was ridiculous but there is no local alternative except the chain bakery, Very individual genuine attempt to respect the history of the building and the area The staff were lovely friendly and helpful especially the Dutch lady 
403496,The Rookery, Room was on the third floor which was difficult for me Lots of noise emptying bins in early hours No kitchen was a decided disadvantage , Lovely building and very historic Close to St Paul s where I was going 
403497,The Rookery, No one got back to me when I had a query about the TV set , The ambience is country house hotel The service was generally good The room was quiet by London standards The bed was very comfortable with good quality linen 
403498,The Rookery, The room was dark The shower was awful water all over the floor with a horrible cloth shower curtain that stuck to you so uncomfortable The bed was tiny for 2 people , Staff Ambience
403499,The Rookery, Nothing, I loved the old books in the room the winding staircase and just the overall feel of the place Definitely the only place I will stay in London from now on 
403500,The Rookery, The double bed was too small for my husband and I With hindsight I should have ordered a twin bedded room , The honesty bar and decor The night manager the Victorian bath the bed linen The ambiance was that of a private club rather than a hotel Although there were three brides spending there first night here you would never have known apart from the flurry of bridal gown and the odd kilt 
403501,The Rookery,No Negative, We loved the Rookery Our room was a split level with the bathroom downstairs the hotel s bar area was a cute living room and we were on the doorstep of some great restaurants and pubs
403502,The Rookery,No Negative, The night manager was outstanding Our much delayed flight and consequent late arrival left us shattered The warm greeting immediately deleted the previous 24 hours of airports Happily recommend this hotel 
403503,The Rookery, The shower is not a shower it is a traditional bath tub with a handle spray Its very messy in the bathroom after a shower , Service was great and friendly but not overbearing Hotel was cosy and the Honest Bar was fantastic 
403504,The Rookery,No Negative, Staff were so super friendly and we asked for early check in which they accommodated which made all the difference for us Our room was so comfortable and beautiful we were so happy 
403505,The Rookery, I had telephoned prior to our visit to organise for a bottle of bubbles to be put in our room but this had not been done when we arrived however the staff were incredibly apologetic and rectified this straight away offering us the bottle on the house , We really enjoyed our stay at Rookery for our wedding night The staff were incredibly friendly and polite Our room was beautiful and luxurious 
403506,The Rookery, Bathroom with shower in tub You couldn t prevent water spill Handwashing with warm water not possible since 2 outlets one hot one cold on one and other side of sink My girlfriend say not user friendly , We enjoyed stay in room Staff very friendly and helpful Organized a musical visit for us Rooms suite have nice old fashioned furniture and very good bed Feel like old traditional English flair 
403507,The Rookery, That the bathroom window was overlooked by a nearby office but alright with blind down of course, The Ambiance was perfect and the breakfast in bed a real treat
403508,The Rookery,No Negative, Excellent hotel fantastic staff Rooms are fantastic as I travel for work a lot I am used to getting stock in lifeless and soul destroying square boxes with this is so far from that it is untrue A fantastic escape in london great value excellent staff Can t comment on the food as we ate out Location is excellent and if you are driving there is parking 3 mins walk away at Smithfield market 
403509,The Rookery, Room was quite hot Opening the window made it noisy , Great character building in a perfect location Easy access to underground and great restaurants and bars Good facilities Loved all the antique furniture Cute hotel cat 
403510,The Rookery,No Negative, The bed was incredibly comfortable beautifully decorated with an old England charm and the large roll top bath was brilliant Staff was very friendly helpful 
403511,The Rookery, The bathroom looks great but t s not very practical though Lions feet bathtub with a shower head you have to hold while showering and with no shower curtain it gets pretty wet everywhere But I guess the English might be more into taking baths instead so then you re good I guess , Tons of charm It s like how you would think a nice cozy old school small London hotel should be like but rarely is It s not cheap but good value for money The location and the neighborhood is great Central but a bit more quiet with a local feel and good quality restaurants and pubs right around the corner St John being one of them just a minute away 
403512,The Rookery, Just wish it was a bit less expensive so I could stay more often , Location is fantastic overseas visitors should love this old London Beautiful hotel excellent staff And a cat 
403513,The Rookery,No Negative, Built in 1764 and the rooms are loaded with antiques There is a library an honesty bar a sitting room all very cozy It s also one block from the subway line and train line that takes you directly to Gatwick airport Located in an area with lots of history and restaurants 
403514,The Rookery,No Negative, Old fashioned luxury Like staying in a country house hotel in the middle of London Great though sometimes shocking history well documented and shared by the staff 
403515,The Rookery, Would have liked to entertain my daughter at breakfast but this was only served in the room and space was not available Sadly had breakfast in another location , Loved the querkiness the ambience the comfort and most of all the relative peace and quiet for a London hotel The staff were so so lovely and nothing was too much trouble I especially liked the complimentary tea tray with leaf tea and bone chine cups and saucers A real treat Hopefully we will return 
403516,The Rookery, Separate faucet for hot and cold water and low water pressure is kind of inconvenient but seems to be a common problem in London , Staff was amazing Beautiful room authentic furniture comfortable bed well heated conveniently located near Farrington metro station 
403517,The Rookery, I was very surprised that there were no bath oils bubbles etc Just some rather sub slandered liquid soap shampoo A shame , Lovely staff Lovely house cat Lovely room 
403518,The Rookery, No complaints from me , I love the atmosphere and the history of the place It s classic and still well appointed The staff are all friendly and excellent The location is perfect as a central point for exploring London 
403519,The Rookery,No Negative, Very friendly staff Old English Townhouse hotel with antique furniture very cosy all in best condition not kitsch at all but very decent Excellently located with Farringdon and Barbican stations nearby lot of restaurants and the Barbican cultural Center
403520,The Rookery, Soundproofing I was woken up several times in the early hours by my neighbours activities the male staff were very condescending which made me as a solo traveller very uncomfortable the shower was not terribly practical easily flooding the bathroom and taking up so much space that breathing was a bit of a challenge The TV did not work at all , The hotel was gorgeous in a great location right next to the tube station in an area that is both quiet and lively enough Loved the decor of the place my room was suitably quirky and it was great to be able to have meals in my room The hamper on arrival of food was a highlight too 
403521,The Rookery, The only downside to the Rookery is the location you have to want to be in this area as it can feel a bit deserted at night and has a fairly limited range of restaurants and pubs , The rooms and common rooms in this hotel are fantastic some are a bit small for the price but all are wonderfully appointed and have fabulous bathrooms which always makes me happy Nice mini bars and lovely simple room service trays 
403522,The Rookery,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay between Christmas and New Year 2015 Arrived early and they accommodated us immediately and when we asked to change rooms so that we had a bath they moved our bags for us Very comfortable bed 
403523,The Rookery, My only slight grumble is that there was no tea coffee tray in the room This lead to a confusion as we were ordering tea and coffee direct with reception and having it delivered to the conservatory which had an additional charge The staff sorted this all out once we realised our mistake and a tea tray was delivered to the room but I think it should have been there as standard initially This really did not detract from our stay though and I will certainly be returning to the hotel, The staff were exceptionally polite and friendly throughout our stay Nothing was too much trouble for them The location was also excellent and the atmosphere within the hotel was superb After the hustle and bustle of London we always came back into a relaxing environment with plenty of places to sit and de stress from the day
403524,The Rookery, Its a little pricey but hey you get what you pay for , Felt like going back in time to the 19 00s without lacking in modern necessitys Amazing place go see it 
403525,The Rookery,No Negative, The Rookery is a wonderful little nest from the 18th Century ideally located in Islington few steps away from the Farringdon metro station Every detail makes you feel like home you just have to imagine that you live in another century Comfy warm even the lobby and the drawing room create this little castle atmosphere Rooms and bathrooms are ones amongst the coziest I ever been You can not miss the opportunity of visiting The Rookery 
403526,The Rookery, Net curtains especially that my window was facing an office No tea coffee making facilities in the room TV seriously needs updating Loud location near a nightclub revellers screaming until early hours Bed was on the smallish side Nowhere to put washbag in the bathroom the ledge was way too narrow , Lovely staff
403527,The Rookery, Perhaps a bit more attention could be given to keeping the lounge bar restocked and tidied A quibble really when one considers the overall excellence of the place and its staff , Staff were charming welcoming and super friendly the facilities are gorgeous and in my new favorite location in London Surely Clerkenwell is the food prime food area of London as well as historically fascinating It s also decidedly more local than much of central London The Rookery is terrific 
403528,The Rookery,No Negative, The place was beautiful clean and comfortable with amazing beds The staff were great welcoming and friendly but still efficient and delivering great service All the other guests we spoke with said the same thing it s a wonderful place to stay where you feel like a house guest and not just a hotel resident
403529,The Rookery, Booked by someone else for us and there was a bit of hassle Rather than just taking a payment or payment information from the Booker there was a wee bit of paperwork involved , Beautiful suite Great amount of space Excellent location 
403530,The Rookery, I liked everything I had even liaised with staff before arrival and they were great with all my requests , Stayed for our wedding night Superb hotel No other hotel in London like it quaint luxury and even comes with a house cat
403531,The Rookery, You must use the key drop and get ringed in to the hotel every time you enter so not much privacy if you require that , Comfortable charming quiet relaxing and friendly hotel Great neighborhood good food close to tube yet walking distance to attractions and theatre The housekeeping service is outstanding as everything gets changed every day 
403532,The Rookery, Noisy on the street side of the hotel I was woken at 5am by people coming out of the night club just around the corner Bedroom in superior room was much smaller than expected Antique bed in superior room was small and not really comfy for us as a tall couple my partners feet were hanging out of bed and he s 6ft 1in, Friendly staff beautiful decor location good for travel into central london and Farringdon itself is a great place to go out
403533,The Rookery, Our room Joseph Smith was a little dark but very private and beautifully finished Odd to have a beautiful private bath in the lower level of our room but we survived and kept the light on at night , It was a special unique well maintained and historic property The staff were amazing We loved the little sitting rooms and the afternoon treat of a slice of cake Great access to underground and nearby bars and La Forcheta for breakfast 
403534,The Rookery, I thought that the room was bigger, I liked the staff they were really friendly and I also liked the atmosphere it was very cosy and the bed was very comfortable I will definitely come again 
403535,The Rookery,No Negative, Charming characterful hotel in Central London location The staff kindly upgraded me to a suite it was only a pity that I was not there long enough to make the most of it 
403536,The Rookery, quite hot and no good means of getting fresh air in the hallways and rooms, Victorian style over dressed luxury rooms give it a nice Royal experience
403537,The Rookery, Hotel is fine drinking on the weekend in the local pubs and all over the sreet is quite astounding So noisy and dirty streets in the morning But it is an area in transition so maybe that will change in time Our room was not on the main street and so noise didn t bother , Interesting area lots of places to eat not chains Very close underground line Property has a lot of charm We loved the Simon Mitchell room with the peaked ceiling No elevator so 3 flights of stairs made for unexpected exercise Staff is friendly and helpful Pocket garden is lovely space REN amenities are great The breakfast just didn t appeal to us this time although it is very good and fresh Four choices and can be served in your room or downstairs in the lounge or the garden But it is very easy to get food elsewhere 
403538,The Rookery, Poor TV reception If only it matched the warmth of the staff , Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating when there was an issue with the TV although I think the addition of new TVs has brought about some connectivity issues They also went out of their way to try and resolve the issue and compensate for the experience

403541,The Rookery, The classic bathroom with freestanding bath was beautiful and luxurious However in a hurry showering with a hand held albeit brass shower head wasn t the most practical But I m really splitting hairs here , It s a beautiful classic London hotel in an amazing part of town and the staff and service were exactly what you d want in such a place It felt like the kind of establishment that could be a front for an old English secret service Loved it
