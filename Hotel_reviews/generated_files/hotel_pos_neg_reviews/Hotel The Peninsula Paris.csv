81062,Hotel The Peninsula Paris, When we first checked in we asked the receptionist if breakfast was included or not she said definitely not and it will cost you per person and then when we checked out we were surprised that breakfast was actually included in both rooms And they charged us for it I missed few things of my stuff i felt someone is definitely going in our room when we re not there and playing with our stuff and take whatever one day i found a cloth next to my cosmetics and the cloth was very wet and dirty Never saw something like that And they told us the snack bar is for free and when i checked it out it was all used by the previous guests They didnt bother to get us new snacks And they floors under the dresser were so dirty and one day i found oneof my things under the table i knew the clening lady man wasn t so good at all A lot of mistakes, Spacious royal great location classy
