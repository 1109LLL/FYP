119249,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, This hotel was way too pricey for what it offered Plus we felt as though the staff was all about the business transaction When we arrived after an overnight flight they immediately sat us down at a table preauthorized our credit card for the entire stay plus an enormous security deposit of 1 000 pounds Then they asked if we wanted breakfast 100 pounds for four and that was after the discounted rate for paying at the desk as opposed to at the restaurant We knew this was ridiculous but we were all exhausted and hungry Plus while the staff certainly was generally pleasant it often seemed like we were the first people to ever ask them to do anything service wise We really wanted to like the place but it simply didn t live up to the cost , This hotel is chic and for Europe the room was a good size It s on a pretty quiet residential side street yet it s very easy to get to some major attractions and shopping The nice thing is you don t feel like you are in the thick of things 
119250,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Was difficult to meet the manager wanted to complaining about the AC they couldnt do anything to solve it on our first 2 nights however they upgraded us the rest of our stay to a Junior Suite were the AC was working properly , The acces to the private garden behind the hotel
119251,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and eager to help in any way possible The room are beautiful but could use a bit more room of unpacking such a dresser or slightly larger closet great food would come back to stay 
119252,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Air conditioners work in their own very sofisticated way We didn t succeed in understanding each other No Russian TV programmes , Very friendly staff beautiful rooms perfect choice of meals for breakfast 
119253,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Nothing all was perfect, I enjoyed my staying eveything was just perfect staff location interior design and atmosphere was amazing definitely I am going back 
119254,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, Noise from the corridor in the morning is quite disturbing But this just happened once , Staff are very friendly and the hotel is a hidden gem in the thriving district 
119255,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The hotel is definitely my favorite in London Extremely welcoming and knowledgeable staff Overall feel of the hotel was great It was easy to feel at home 
119256,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, We didn t get a turn down service However I m not sure whether our room was on do not disturb or not though so it may not have been the hotels fault Also the breakfast was a tad pricey but it was very yummy Italian inspired which was great and we got it brought to the room at no extra cost They even managed to accommodate my husband s request of scrambled eggs which weren t on the menu , They went over and above to make the weekend special for example they left birthday messages and a complimentary little cake for my husband as it was his birthday They also upgraded up for free to a junior suite The bathroom was amazing it had 2 shower heads that work independently to allow a couple to show together yet apart no arguing over the temperature It had a glass door which turned it into a kind of steam room which was fab They had a good knowledge of the local areas included nice local pubs The location was PERFECT for exploring the surrounding area with really close transport links into different areas of London It was really quiet despite being just one road back from the main strip so we were really pleased with the privacy A great stay from start to finish 
119257,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, I wish the hotel restaurant and bar provides service for their in house guests after 11 pm also if they can make use of the garden area for the guests , the interior is amazing I found out that it is the same Italian designer of blakes hotel the location is amazing plus the comfort 
119258,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, It might be nice to ensure the whole bathroom floor was heated Near the window the floor was cold , Discretion quiet interior design staff and location 
119259,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, It is a pity that there is no free bottle of water or a boiling machine provided in the room Feel so thirsty in the morning as I need to drink water when I woke up That is the only one disadvantage , It s the first time I m writing review for the hotel as this hotel is very wonderful The staffs are so warm and polite All of them and all the time Love them so much We came back hotel late and wanted to order some food although the restaurant of hotel was close the staff helped us to order the food and brought the delivery to our room They are so sweet The hotel and the room were very beautiful as well 
119260,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, What an amazing experience The room was so beautiful and clean The food was very good But most amazing were all the staff members of this hotel So kind and helpful We really enjoyed our stay to the max Coming back again for sure Thanks to everyone of the Franklin hotel Suzan
119261,The Franklin Hotel Starhotels Collezione, There could be a quite bit more lighting a dressing table with a mirror in the room and plug points near by would help getting dressed and they should convert the bath tubs into walk in rain showers A tea and coffee machine or a kettle in the room would be good , Lovely hotel very welcoming staff who went out of their way to assist with every request I was upgraded to a Junior Suite as I had a long stay The breakfast was very good and again the staff were lovely and welcoming
