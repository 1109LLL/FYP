334961,Hotel Vienna, The double bed has 2 separate mattresses instead of one big It is a little noisy at night , Very nice and clean hotel There is cafe machine in the room and one per visit free coffee and tea The hotel is just few minutes away from the Prater so we were able to go there every evening The stuff is very friendly and helpful I defiantly recommend this hotel if you want to visit Vienna for holiday 
334962,Hotel Vienna, The worst service and personel ever Totally worthless quality I m used to international travels and I have never experienced so bad bad bad and unwilling personel Not service minded at all Unpleasant It was difficult to sleep since doors to the room seem to let all the sounds in you could as well leave it open Plus seems to be some funky guests and neighbors tried to leave open windows but then I got to listen to some sex noises instead Just pitiful And why would they keep your room clean or fill in coffee capsules And do not expect to get a bit earlier check in even if you re sick or pregnant or whatever they will not offer you that extra hour of hospitality of extra care Plain no No to everything Totally wortless I seldom provide feedback regarding my stays but this place was so exceptionally bad so it s important that other people avoid it , Absolut worthless 
334963,Hotel Vienna, No air cinditioning system in the hotel so our room was so hot in july We couldn t check the other room but our view was totally awful Opposite our window was the kitchen where early morning the staff were making the breakfast with a big noise So we woke up 7 o clock and coudn t sleep well because of it , The staff was very kind and helpful the room was clear and comfortable We could leave the car easily on the street but working days you have to pay for it The brekfast was perfect 
334964,Hotel Vienna, The doors have springs and nobody seems to care about the noise they make when they are slammed Quite annoying in the morning No A C in July only a desk fan , I liked the room the staff was very helpful Very good breakfast 5 mins walk to Praterstern metro 
334965,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Dear booking team would say about reception manager 50 60 years man in glasses who greeted us in the street and promptly gave us the keys from rooms in 2 minutes after our arrival Then he well served us in the bar we were pleasantly surprised Recommend this hotel to all travelers 
334966,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, There was a garage where we could put our bicycles While there was only one person at the reception he handled everything as well as possible He even gave me a free glass of champagne because he noticed it was my birthday He called the restaurant where we had a reservation to let them know we were late and he called us a taxi The place was clean spacious and well appointed It has an old world charm with modern amenities We thought this was an exceptional value and would happily stay there again 
334967,Hotel Vienna, The old lady in reception was not helpfull any question she was giving a bad look I asked for the key to the safe as there was a minir problem with safe in the room and she said i dont have it while it was behinde her just next to her computer as like an hour later the nice gentleman handed the keys from there asked for directions from her she said i dont know she didnt offer any welcome drink at all i needed to talk to a manager regarding my booking as i booked a room with a bath tub but she gave us a normal room and when i asked why she said i dont know and i said i need to talk to the manager she said he went for hunting and will not be here till monday afternoon i said call him she said i cant reach him to be honest she should not work in reception Once i came back to hotel and my room was not lucked there is not a card lock system s still old fashion keys i asked her she said its imposible Tea and coffe in the room was only for first day the rest of you stay you need to buy it Pillows were too soft like a layer of paper sheets u need to fold it few times to make it like a normal small plane pillows , Great access to the metro good location the gentelman in reception which i cant remember his name but i guess his name started with W was very nice and helpfull with all the requirements bed was really comfortable Room was spacious Ive been compensated for the problem with my room with breakfast which was fair and thank again to the gentelmen in reception 
334968,Hotel Vienna, Rooms were too hot and no air conditioner There was some conflict about the welcome drink Letter was kept on room mentioning items kept on table is kept for free A wine bottle was kept along with coffee and tea bags but at the end i was charged for the small wine bottle which i consumed , Had a wide range of variety in breakfast with different fruits 
334969,Hotel Vienna, Internet was patchy at best Also didn t appreciate the single teabag coffee and milk Whilst an nespresso capsule is nice I d have preferred more coffee and tea and milk without having to pay 0 50 per serving ,No Positive
334970,Hotel Vienna, Wifi is slow room is warm because no air conditioner in summer time A small fan is provided but not really helpful Receiption can be more proactive , The location is good
334971,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Well halls and reception look a bit used but the luxury room was just perfect Didn t really get the idea behind infra spa shower hot shower itself do the same in my opinion but bath was great Really enjoyed the stay We even met the owner who offered free champange and water when we came back at night 
334972,Hotel Vienna, i arrived at the hotel in the evening I was the only person at reception and was not acknowledged by the receptionist who was too busy tending to some papers She knew I was there but left me waiting that s fine I know people are busy sometimes but an acknowledgement to say she would be with me in a moment would have been appreciated Once I was acknowledged and asked for my check in details I did not feel like I was made welcome at all not even a smile if anything I felt like I had done something wrong by even being in the hotel in the first place such was the sour look on the face of the receptionist Having been to my room I tried to use the safe but could not unlock it On the way out of the hotel I asked the same receptionist if someone could take a look at the safe for me as I could not open it Again I received a sour look and some muttering I didn t understand as I do not speak Austrian I told her not to worry about it and I will ask the night porter upon my return who I would like to add was a delight and very nice man what I am used to in hotels the complete opposite of the person I am complaining about Maybe she was having a bad day who knows still unacceptable as this is the hospitality industry and I have paid good money for this experience ,No Positive
334973,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Everything was awesome It was quite comfortable you feel like you are at home Another great thing is that you can watch several channels in different languages and also can follow the recent news I can stay here next time again Definitely recommended 
334974,Hotel Vienna, Even a 5 hotel is more flexible with early late check ins Old worn key instead of card Interior design of room staircase corridors is bit out of fashioned elevator is extremely slow and small Very dirty coffee cup glasses in room Price even with huge discount was not in balance with the got service , Comfortable bed breakfast is fine Coffee machine in room 
334975,Hotel Vienna, Internet connection in my room was very poor couldn t get the coffee machine to work and they left only one coffee in the room and they repeated that up to one coffee is free was there for two days and didn t like this part There funny thing was that there was beer in fridge but no opener or any cutlery or plates in the room , It was close to train station and 39 min walk to city center young lady at reception was helpful and welcoming 
334976,Hotel Vienna, No AirCondition Breakfast if you arrive 20 min before 10 you finad some empty plate should be recharge till 10 just if you book in Discount could be value for momey you pay a little noisy room in street side during weekend night , Goog Location 1 min to Supermarket 3 min to central metro and train Station Good and Friendly Staff Internet work well
334977,Hotel Vienna, Only one coffee per person per stay in the room thereafter you have to pay I found that the staff although they tried to be helpful had no clue with regards to tourist information , Lovely comfortable hotel staff friendly nice bar but prices expensive 
334978,Hotel Vienna, The room was too warm even for winter and with no obvious way of controlling it , The shower was amazing but messy The bed was very comfortable The hotel is in a good location for quickly getting into the city 
334979,Hotel Vienna, The heat in the bedroom was not enough in the evening and we could not increase the temperature manually Wi fi signal was practically inexistant in the room , The location of the hotel is close to the underground station The design of the hotel is classy and this touch is much appreciable compared to standardized hotels chains 
334980,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very nice accomodation with very kind receptionists The rooms were awsome and the stay was enjoyable I recommand this location to everyone who wants to visit Vienna and stay at 10 15 mins from center 
334981,Hotel Vienna, Hotel Vienna is overall supposed to be Viennese semi luxury but actually it is totally outdated with some 90 s updates which makes it even worst in terms of deco style and appearance The corridors are with heavy old carpets and smell although there is no smoking looks like no one follows the rules even the staff Only 1 small lift for cutest and staff which is slow and smells all the time The rooms are not as spacious as it looks on the photos advertised they have used the usual advertisements tricks The coffe and Tea advertised as complimentary are just one off after that if you whant to have every day you need to pay for it There is a coffeemaker and a kettle too The mini bar is totally overpriced The cleaning services are daily but if you whant your bedding and towering change you need to ask for it The heating is very hot you need to adgest it yourself or ask receptionist they are no guides for it There are no wardrobes but more like a small box with few hangers 1 chair and 1 small stool in luxury double room which we had The bathroom has no air conditioner and the baths are outdated with shower facing the wrong way The hairdryer is from the 80 s and makes such a nose that is scary to use The rooms are with thin wals and you can prakticly hear everything in your naibour rooms if you are lucky and get a room next to the flying stewards you will get lots of different noises all night long TV is smal and programs only local not even an international news channels Internet if working most of the time but kind of slow practically not for business use We spend 10 days over Christmas and New Year and expected a bit more from the food menu since it was a festive season unfortunately the breakfast was the same and overpriced and lunch diner was not worth it , Good Location 10 min to the train station and central metro tram busses airport connection Hotel Vienna is old and rooms are spacious with big windows and proper heating sistem The Old staff is very welcoming and informative generally friendly 
334982,Hotel Vienna, 1 glass toilet It s fully crazy and stupid solution 2 4 star hotel has no bacon on breakfast 3 4 star hotel has no slippers and bathrobes 4 the price is very high without background for it , It s close to Metro and Railway Station to go to airport Fine Prater Park is close too 
334983,Hotel Vienna, Breakfast was a disappointment Breakfast staff were very rude and unprofessional The hotel doesn t feel like a 4 star You have to take your own luggage up to your room and bring it down , The front desk staff is friendly The hotel room was clean but definitely not a 4 star standard The location is good 
334984,Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Good location close to metro tram lines and suburb trains The shower is one reason to book this hotel again The bed in the single room has a good size Value for money 45 single room on a Saturdy in Christmas season was just fantastic 
334985,Hotel Vienna, Beds were not made daily although towels were changed cups etc was cleaned Hotel was in a quiet back street which did appear daunting at first , The room was realy nice Junior suite Very large spacious Breakfast was more than adequate Staff very friendly Very close to train station 2 30 each adult direct to the airport 5 minute walk to the prater Not once did we feel threatened by the area 
334986,Hotel Vienna, Low wifi connection in the evening , Hotel is found 5mins away by walk from the Prater and in a quiet area All staff were nice and helpful Nice room good breakfast Lovely stay 
334987,Hotel Vienna, In our room everything was fully functionable but in our friends room the heating system was broken and though we inform the receptionist nothing was done in this matter Therefore the temperature in that room was pretty low , The bed is very comfortable Pretty near from the city center 
334988,Hotel Vienna, The dolls outside our room in the corridor were slightly creepy , Very luxurious room for the price nice breakfast buffet good access to public transport 
334989,Hotel Vienna, Tea and coffee facilities in room were quite expensive 1 euro per teabag or nespresso capsule However this was avoided by taking our own tea and coffee , The staff were very friendly and helpful The location was very good just 5 min walk to the underground which takes you to the centre of Vienna in about 10 mins Found a couple of nice place to eat withing walking distance of the hotel Room was very comfortable seating area in the junior suite meant that we had somewhere to relax after a long day being tourists Bathroom and shower were immaculately clean Didn t use the breakfast facilities or the bar area so can t comment on them 
334990,Hotel Vienna, Nothing , Good size room that had recently been refurbished Reception staff friendly and helpful Close to the train station and an easy walk into the city 
334991,Hotel Vienna, No airco, Very friendly staff very friedly Good quality value Location is good with the metro downtown easily but also bars and restaurants next door
334992,Hotel Vienna, After requesting some simple changes to the room we were denied until the next morning which I personally didn t think was on There was no A C either , Room was spacious with a balcony after having to change rooms bed was comfy and the shower was awesome 
334993,Hotel Vienna, The breakfast buffet could have been a bit more comprehensive , The hotel was good value for money Rooms were very modern clean and comfortable All staff were very helpful Ideal location for the Prater amusement park and the famous Giant Ferris Wheel Riesenrad Short walk to the Praterstern train station for direct connection to from the airport train S7 For the innere Stadt where all the action is take train U1 from Praterstern or U2 from Taborstrasse which is also a short walk from the hotel Alternatively simply walk to the innere Stadt over the Danube Canal as it s not too far away 
334994,Hotel Vienna, it was beginning of September and the weather was warm there were no cooling system So we needed to open the window by opening the window it was noises and voices from outside and specially noises from the other rooms who were watching TV or talking up to late at night and they also have opened their windows also whenever our neighbors go to toilet or even open the tap we could here everything loud and clear any way it was warm from one hand and noisy from another hand , Staff were very polite and really try to help
334995,Hotel Vienna, There is no air condition and no ventilation system in the bathroom or in room , Breakfast staff cleanliness and location is great It was quiet and the room was looking nice 
334996,Hotel Vienna, No air condition in the rooms and our room was extremely hot during the day The rooms towards the street are a lot hotter than the rooms towards the backyard , Breakfast was good although there were no bacon to the scrambled eggs Very nice and helpful staff One staff member in particular was very service minded and helped us a lot Like for instance lending out silverware since we some evenings were unable to go to a restaurant due to our baby boy 
334997,Hotel Vienna, Four star hotel can not have dirty walls black marks from shoes and balls a lot and also edges on towels were in tatters I don t expect such a things in 2star hotel Also I was unwell first night and therefore we requested to change bedding we hanged sign on the door but they just did general tidy up job and no bedding change, Breakfast was amazing i like the idea of my little one getting his own kids plate bowl and mug Also staff on reception was great helpful everybody spoke good English
334998,Hotel Vienna, It was very hot and stuffy in the room fans were working very loud Unpleasant receptionists looks like go away and don t disturb me , Good location
334999,Hotel Vienna, It doesn t look as impressive as some of the pictures and there is no air conditioning only bedside fans It could do with a refurb as it is very old fashioned , It was close the centre using the tube 
335000,Hotel Vienna, We stayed 6 nights in Hotel Vienna While the hotel was non smoking the hallways were definitively imbibed with thick tobacco smell It was hot and there was no air conditioning Street was pretty noisy especially during the night and early morning The big let down for us was the staff s handling of our reservation for a bus trip to Salzburg which they recommended BTW We were told that everything was taken care of but the shuttle never came to pick us up from the hotel We were left in the cold to wait for the shuttle at 6 45 AM By 7 20 AM we gave up and went back inside The person at the desk was clueless We debugged with them later to find out that the staff we spoke with initially left a message for next staff to ask us for payment and complete the reservation which never happened and we were never told ahead of the supposed trip It was the last full day of our stay in Vienna and we did not have time and means to make alternative plans for visiting Salzburg So we missed it , Breakfast was a pretty good value Location was 15 20 minute walk from historical district 
335001,Hotel Vienna, There is no air conditioning just one small fan for the room and the heat was stifling This is my only criticism of the hotel, Rooms were beautifully presented and very modern Furnishings and decor were very modern and reflected a beautiful sense of taste that had gone in to updating the rooms 
335002,Hotel Vienna, Buyer beware Misrepresented advertising pictures of another hotel used for this one NO A C Non smoking hotel that stinks like smoke Uncaring staff Think twice before you book ,No Positive
335003,Hotel Vienna, The coverlet is not clearn No air condition in the room The worst is that the waitor in the receiption is too arrogant When we checked out he did not want to provide the receipt of payment We may feel that he is used to do that for many times ,No Positive
335004,Hotel Vienna, The reception staff were grumpy not at all welcoming and not particularly helpful The housekeeping and dining room staff were lovely Having a glass door to the bathroom does not provide privacy when using the toilet a bit strange , The room was clean and the bed very comfortable
335005,Hotel Vienna, The staff in this hotel was horrible i felt not be welcomed I will never to go back this hotel again They didn t clearly say the breakfast need extra charge and i felt be cheated This hotel is not value for 4 stars i felt shamed about it ,No Positive
335006,Hotel Vienna, I had a single room which was not good at all It was very warm no air conditioning It was very noisy I had a room in front of the street and I could hear the cars and people talking When you are trying to sleep you are laying with your head next to the shower which is a glass cage You can hear the ventilation system of the bathroom the entire night It was a high zoom sound In sum this was not a 4 star room at all You can find better for your money ,No Positive
335007,Hotel Vienna, No air condition poor ventilation Room was very noisy Sound traveled up the stairwell from the reception to our room We were charged 30 euro for a 10 min phone call to a local Viennese number which is outrageous , Nice bed good shower and good breakfast Walking distance to centre and major train station 
335008,Hotel Vienna, Street noise like to have a window open but it was too loud late at night , Staff excellent especially Wurn Location is great to rail station and quick trip from airport Good local restaurants 
335009,Hotel Vienna, A bit small room not corresponding with beautiful pictures however still good , 10 mins walk from the city centre easy parking in front of the hotel free of charge during the weekend friendly staff 
335010,Hotel Vienna, Location A glass transparent door between the bedroom and the toilet which gives no privacy Both you can see what s going on in the bathroom from the bedroom and opposit , Pretty new furnished rooms 
335011,Hotel Vienna, The bathroom and shower concelt is quite strange if you travel as a couple or family bc theur walls are trabsparent so no privacy , Nice quiet hotel adjacent to praterstern so it is very easily accessible which is very nice The hotel is decorated beautifully like a museum Nice atmosphere 
335012,Hotel Vienna, Unfortunately on entering our room we found several used glasses and empty bottles from the previous occupants Waste bins in the room was not always emptied daily so the cleaner could have been better , Modern hotel which was close to a U Bahn station so it was very easy to travel into the centre of Vienna about three stops Very helpful staff particularly the lovely lady in the breakfast room Breakfast was plentiful and as expected 
335013,Hotel Vienna, It s not my first stay in this hotel but chances are it is the last one I always liked this hotel because it s close from the metro station and you can reach the center in 15 mins and rooms are big and nicely designed However this time all of three rooms we got terribly smelled like cigarettes staff started to open doors with their keys without knocking and break in more than one hour before checkout not really comfortable moment also because bathroom walls are transparent Lady from the reception called one room and yelled at the guest to check out and a bit later she realized that that guest has a booking for another period and called to apologize Quality of this hotel dropped down and nothing but a bottle of sparkling wine on the breakfast table reminds of 4 star rating anymore , 5 min walk from metro station 
335014,Hotel Vienna, Unfortunately the breakfast was very dissapointing It was definitely not worth 10 There was hardly any choice The vegetables were dry and the fruit salad was from the tin , The room was very nice with modern furniture and a very comfortable bed It was also very spacious and the shower and bathroom were amazing 
335015,Hotel Vienna, looks a little bit old, It s very clean and the price value is very good for a 4 hotel Parking available and free for the weekend very nice personnel
335016,Hotel Vienna, The description mentioned parking facilities but both we and any other guests who we overheard while they were checking in were told that their own parking garage was full awkward considering there wasn t anyone else at breakfast we usually take very long breakfasts and their solution was to leave the car in a deserted tank station nearby The receptionists demanded 30 EUR for leaving the card in the former tank station which doesn t have any lighting btw but after explaining that we were only checked in for roughly 14 hours checked in at 8 00 o clock left at 9 30 morning the next day he agreed that we d pay 15 EUR only Here s the caveat the parking costs still 15 00 EUR per day weren t added to the invoice and we didn t receive any receipt for it either because a friend of the hotel is in charge of the ex tank station s facility The entire Eastern European like completely illegal fiscally speaking approach left us with a very unpleasant opinion about the hotel s staff Considering we explicitly asked for parking when we made the reservation I d expect something less out of the ordinary , The hotel is clean quiet and has a decent breakfast The location is right between two metro stations underground ways not longer than a 7 8 minute walk to either of them so getting almost anywhere in Vienna is easy Staff was kind enough though to ask us if we need any lift to the airport Strange considering they knew we arrived there by car but still 
335017,Hotel Vienna, Very weak WiFi signal it almost doesn t work 15 EUR for parking which is located on gas station There is no restaurant A little bit too expensive hotel with this facilities ,No Positive
335018,Hotel Vienna, We had a really rough time here sleeping due to the continuous smell of smoking in the hotel This is a non smoking hotel but apparently when we raised the issue we were told the owner was the only one that could smoke here It meant that one if us couldn t sleep as had asthma and was anxious for an asthma attack due to the heavy smell We were coughing and spluttering at one point and were glad to be out of the hotel most of the day We did raise the issue and later there was a air freshener added to the bathroom but this made no difference Also on our trip we asked for hot water and a cup to take some medicine and were told this isn t what you expect from a 4 star hotel This is behaviour more for a youth hostel This was deemed very impolite and personal Some of the staff were very nice but evening staff on a couple of occasions were abrupt and rude , Nice rooms Comfortable Was a nice distance from the underground station Couple of mins walk Nice not to be in central as much quieter Good breakfast and decent price 
335019,Hotel Vienna, The bed foams in the double room we stayed in were not too comforting The beddings were only changed once for the period of 5 days we were in That s not too good of a 4 star hotel , The hotel rooms were adequately equipped with superb and the state of the art facilities the staff were very receptive prompt to request and very respectful and helpful They made our stay and first time experience in Vienna a memorable one 
335020,Hotel Vienna, No english tv channels breakfast could have been more diverse , Clean room modern bathroom blondie and night shift receptionists were kind Breakfast quality was ok 
335021,Hotel Vienna, No air conditioning small garbage cans and mediocre dusting and vacuuming , Service service and more service at the reception The employees went out of the way to help us in every way possible It is also a short five minute walk to the metro which was a benefit for us as it forced us to do some exercise lol 
335022,Hotel Vienna, The Prater subway and train station area is a magnet for homeless people drug addicts and all sort of dubious people The bathroom does not have a door it s just a glass slider and it makes it less comfortable than what you would expect The hotel does not have an AC unit and all the TV channels are in German I would expect to have at least 1 in english for tourists to enjoy Breakfast is fairly poor but the restaurant looks nice , Restaurant looks nice people at the reception were friendly and helpful 
335023,Hotel Vienna, NO AIRCONDITIONING VERY HOT OUTSIDE NOISE NO TEA MAKING IRONING FACILITY IN ROOM TOILET BATH INSIDE BED ROOM UNCOMFORTABLE BED PILLOWS NO ENGLISH CHANNEL ON TV, LOCATION NEAR PARASTERN METRO CLEANLINESS OF ROOM VERY GOOD QUALITY BATH TOILET HELPFUL STAFF
335024,Hotel Vienna, I wouldn t have rated this as a four star hotel The bathroom in a twin bedroon was all glass which was a bit awkward between friends The nearest station Pratastern felt unsafe to walk back from at night as a female as there are constant congregations of groups of men drinking alcohol outside of it My friend was followed by a drunk man whilst walking back alone in the afternoon who only stopped when she walked into a nearby hotel to ask for help , Good hotel Clean rooms and the reception staff were friendly and very helpful Easy and quick to get into the centre of Vienna 
335025,Hotel Vienna, No air con which made the room very stuffy and hard to sleep Not the nicest area to walk around Noisy people next door Staff not overly welcoming , Location was good for railway station Prater amusement park 10min walk Wifi very fast Breakfast buffet all you can eat Bed very comfortable and strong shower 
335026,Hotel Vienna, More than 40 years old hotel The cleaning service were suck The sheets and pillows are smelly No AC Every day the same breakfast No business center 1 bad PC only , Staff were ok most of the time not that friendly though Free internet when it works 
335027,Hotel Vienna, The staff is horrible I needed a parking place I ve asked for one when I booked the room I never got feedback and when I ve got there they told me they don t have one The lady was even irritated that she had to do several tasks in parallel including answer me where I could park I had to park in a station nearby As you look around this hotel is located near Prater But if you go for a walk you will see that it s not that pleasant location nor did it look very safe to me Moreover when I came later for check in I arrived earlier then expected I had again to wait to see the stuff finish their stories with other guests and sending away a guest who was complaining for the smell in room What I would also add is the fact that it has no air conditioning and at 38 degrees outside during day I felt that lack during Otherwise the hotel is ok but the stuff is a nightmare ,No Positive
335028,Hotel Vienna, Vienna was in the middle of a heatwave when we arrived and this hotel doesn t have air conditioning so it was very hot and stuffy We ended up going somewhere else even though we d already paid for our stay here because we were very uncomfortable The room also wasn t particularly clean Really this is an old fashioned cheap hotel that s been partially modernised in order to fulfill the minimum requirements to be able to call itself a four star hotel but it still feels like an old fashioned cheap hotel , The staff were nice
