341799,Senator Hotel Vienna, A c not working I couldn t sleep for two nights Didn t repair despite my requests At check out I was told that they know they have a c problems on the 6 th floor They didn t care to provide a room change , Nice nearby
341800,Senator Hotel Vienna, Rooms are too hot we been traveling in the car for 12 hours so we were looking forward to come to hotel and have a good rest but we actually got more tired and exhausted so we felt like it was waist of money I did say that hotel has air con but rooms where so hot that we couldn t sleep all night Very very disappointed specially when it s rated 4 star as well ,No Positive
341801,Senator Hotel Vienna, Firstly we specifically mentioned in our reservation that we would be arriving early between 7 9 AM as we were taking an overnight train from Prague to Vienna When we arrived they told us rather rudely that they had no place for us until 3 in the afternoon I showed them the email correspondence I d had prior to arriving and still the dismissed me By time I came back I had been awake more than 30 hours without sleep DESPITE being promised a room considering our circumstances before coming The room was clean but the pillows had zero stuffing in them and the beds are hard The air conditioning may as well not be there as it s so weak and the wifi didn t reach our room on the third floor Overall I wouldn t recommend Senator Hotel Vienna you can absolutely find better accommodation even closer to the city centre than this miserable place , It s close to the tram line into the city centre 
341802,Senator Hotel Vienna, Air conditioning didn t work We tried two different rooms At full blast the room was 77 F 25 c and very humid We chose this hotel only because they promised air conditioning so we were very disappointed Open wifi worked fine but could be a problem easier for hackers Hotel has lots of tour bus guests not a problem for us but lobby and elevators are congested in early morning and afternoon Nice stairs though , We got the room at a huge discount that made it affordable Because they had run out of rooms with two beds they gave us a corner room with three beds and large windows It s an American style hotel with large rooms an elevator clean and comfortable Easy access to center metro train stations with Tram 43 less than a block away Close to several supermarkets and a laundromat Excellent cheap restaurant just across from the tram stop lots more within a few blocks Neighborhood felt safe and clean 
341803,Senator Hotel Vienna, The breakfast it s really expensive and there are only a few options to choose from Internet it s really slow so you better relay on mobile data The window was really dirty on the outside probably never cleaned , This hotel is relative close to city center and Schonbrunn about 20 minutes with a bike We arrived by card and we parked the card in the street nearby it was not hard to find a spot and after that we travel with Vienna city bike and there was a bike station on the other side of the street 2 minutes walk There is Lidl supermarket on ground floor 
341804,Senator Hotel Vienna, AC is centralised and not really worked well It was noisy and when we set it to 5 celsius started to cool down the air so finally it did their job Smoking area is only front of the hotel on the street no garden or balkony Parking is a little bit tricky At the weekend it is allowed to parking in this area for free and for evenings as well but daytime you have to pay therefore better if you get the private parking option in the hotel however it is not possible to reserve it and till 12 00 am you have to leave the garage , Location is fine with tram 43 you can reach easily Schottentor appr 5 stops 12 minutes and basically there is the Freyung area and the Rathaus From there with tram D or 1 all of the sightseeing points are reachable within the city but also not far if you like to walk At weekend nights after midnight Metro can be used and walk 3 4 tram stops or take the nightbus for a short ride Only few steps away bakery just next door a Lidl supermarket and in 5 mins distance a small Shopping Center can be found with more shops and small buffet restaurants and there is a Burger King as well Staff is superb Special thanks to Goran and Ana from the reception I had issue with the parking so the staffed solved it and helped me parking in the garage No matter what is your request they solve it Not only the reception but the cleaning staff was super friendly too We were really satisfied Bed was really comfy the room was quite and cleaned every day 2 elevator big not scary perfect 
341805,Senator Hotel Vienna, I didn t face any issues that would write here Overall it was a pleasent stay , The staff is very helpfull The hotel is relatively new rooms are wide and clean Bathroom is comfortable All rooms are equipped with AC safebox and hair dryer I stayed 4 nights and were able to find free spot car parking on inner roads in neighbourhood 1 3min walk Breakfast is 14 50EUR and not bad However there is a turkish restaurant in 3mins walkin distance that has open buffet breakfast every day from 08 00 12 00 for 7 90EUR No reason to overpay at the hotel Although hotel s district is not touristic and not very close to city center it is easy to reach by tram in 15 20mins 
341806,Senator Hotel Vienna, Wi Fi , The room was clean and modern poor Wi Fi though good aircon Very nice stuff OK location 43 next to the hotel tram takes you to the city center Closest subway is Alser station Lidl supermarket just in a few steps Good experience after all 
341807,Senator Hotel Vienna, One room was OK the other one not so I have never seen so dirty window used chair towel holder falling down Squealing bed Breakfast is OK food not so tasty eggs are not really eggs ham is not really ham , Location is perfect Tram stop in front of the hotel direct line to the center 10 min Free parking in streets around the hotel from friday afternoon till monday morning Good value for the money 
341808,Senator Hotel Vienna, The staff was not friendly i did not even see a smile except in my check out there was a new guy who was actually welcoming and friendly I woke up with bugs bites in the second night I do not know if it was from their bedsheet but most probably yes Not even breakfast included for that price and it is 4 stars hotel , The air conditioning only 
341809,Senator Hotel Vienna, The pillows are terrible like not having one The airconditioner was a little bit noisy , The hotel is in a good location with the tram to the city centre just outside It is a 10 minute tram ride The rooms are just what you need as you don t spend time in them except for sleeping and they are quiet Having a kettle in the room would have been a plus but not to be You can buy breakfast at the hotel but there are eating places nearby We chose the latter option and had breakfast at the bakery across the road There is also a small bar in the foyer for drinks after a busy day of sightseeing Staff were very helpful with directions where to buy transport pass etc There were tour buses using this hotel but you didn t notice the extra people only when the busload arrived for check in Would recommend 
341810,Senator Hotel Vienna, The rooms are very basic and felt it was not a 4 star hotel Towels had holes in them windows filthy and all my requests for the room were ignored I wouldn t stay here again nor would I recommend it to anyone, Thought the cleanliness of the hotel was very good and location further than we thought but it was very easy to use the public transport to get to where we wanted to be
341811,Senator Hotel Vienna, I think it s more of a 3 star than 4 star hotel if you are really looking for a 4 star service Parking space is limited and expensive Fortunately you can park in the street 300m from hotel , Clean and comfortable Overall we are satisfied 
341812,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Satisfied our expectations in Vienna Really like the superstore right next door very convenient Tramway is also very convenient right out the door 
341813,Senator Hotel Vienna, Breakfast wasn t great Coffee was bitter from standing too long in thermos , Location is good value for money is ok Take a garden side room Quieter if u want to open the windows
341814,Senator Hotel Vienna, 1 No kettle in the room for making tea in the morning 2 Toilet pan not cleaned every day, 1 convenient to tram 2 clean towels every day 3 large showwer and toilet
341815,Senator Hotel Vienna, Only issue was that wifi was spotty in my room I would often get disconnected In the lobby it worked great though, The hotel is great I would definitely stay here again 
341816,Senator Hotel Vienna, Parking was a little too costly and too tight There is not public parking therefore forced to pay the charges , location was good easy to get to city centre 
341817,Senator Hotel Vienna, It s a rather long tram ride to the city centre but you do not have to change People were talking loudly on the corridor in the early morning but that is not really the fault of the hotel , The room was very clean and modern looking The breakfast was nice and plentiful Public transport and shops are within a 2 minute walk Staff was always very friendly and helpful 24 hour reception 
341818,Senator Hotel Vienna, Two beds instead of double one But it s a common thing for Austria , Free Macs at reception the ability to print tickets surf etc Scales to measure the weight or the luggage are also a plus 
341819,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very good low cost hotel Not really central location but very close to the tram and the public transport tram U bahn just works at a reasonalble price You could however easily walk the distance as well If you go to Vienna the primary purpose of the hotel is to have a place to stay because you are gonna spend the whoile day exploring the city And this hotel fits the purpose perfectly
341820,Senator Hotel Vienna, 1 Location is far from the centre and from the airport 2 Beds were small 3 There was no tea coffee facilities in the room and breakfast was not included 4 I have booked for 6 nights and I found this accommodation was not good for us and when I asked the reception to stay only 3 nights they refused and then I asked if possible move us to another room with a double bed next day or after they said all the rooms are full 5 If you close the window room becomes hot and if you open widow then you get noise from street and trams 6 Shower hose was lose so you have to hold by hand We told reception to fix it but nothing been done,No Positive
341821,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, We stayed a single night only but would anytime return for a longer stay Everything went smoothly personal was polite room equipment very nice I especially appreciated the possiblity of checking in anytime the entire day and night and the check out till 12 00 The neighbourhood might raise slight doubts on the actual quality of the accomodation but there is definitely no reason for that 
341822,Senator Hotel Vienna, I would have enjoyed a water heater tea coffee in the room , Staff very nice and helpful Rooms are clean and friendly although not very big but ok overall Center of the city is 15 min by tram and has a good schedule even on public holidays A small fridge is also available in the room good to keep the Sachertorte 
341823,Senator Hotel Vienna, It was a four star but they didn t provide me the electric water kettle They didn t provide breakfast in the room price , Room service was good 
341824,Senator Hotel Vienna, soft materass on sofa bed poor rest after a day of work I am a solo traveler but I paid for my room more than 700 dollars for three days I deserved better treat I read positive reviews of the place so assume the hotel has better accommodations than the one I was given , quiet
341825,Senator Hotel Vienna, Price for breakfast 13 euros , I liked airy commodious room and freindly staff Lovely bar in the lobby And the price is very favorable But I think the price for breakfast is too high 13 euros But you can choose not to have it It is near Stadthalle and I chose it because I went to a show there I liked that taxi came in two minutes after the lady called it from reception desk 
341826,Senator Hotel Vienna, Bar area quite small Very busy one night so we tested a local bar which was 5 minutes away, Very modern shower facilities Reasonable mix at buffet breakfast Two minutes walk to tram into city which then took 10 minutes 
341827,Senator Hotel Vienna, The shower was very hard to work with very messy Breakfast was pricey , We liked the bar and lobby area Had a lot of specials The staff was very helpful Cleaning staff was very good 
341828,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The hotel managers were really really nice and the location of the hotel just rocks It was easy to move around any where There are lots of good restaurants right in front of the hotel 
341829,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The staff especially the lady receptionist was very helpful and informative Access to public transport provided convenience Bags were kept safe with good precaution using a labeling system 
341830,Senator Hotel Vienna, 1 Regarding parking option my oppinion is to put also as facility the local parking option 2 Regarding staff a little disapointed was not so proactiv they didn t offer us information regarding facilities of the Hotel, Clean best buy and great location
341831,Senator Hotel Vienna, Mess in the garage you get one spot but someone is always on yours if you move car No minibar in room Payment uppon check in not on check out , Nice breakfast Clean room Close to center 
341832,Senator Hotel Vienna, There were no coffee maker or Electric Kettle in the room , Quite area 200 walking distance to tram Supermarket next to the property and lots of restaurants in the around hotel 
341833,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Kind and helpful staff Hotel is close to tram station Lidl store and excellent Turkish restoran which is surprisingly cheap for the Vienna standards 10 10
341834,Senator Hotel Vienna, The cleaners should at least speak English so they can communicate with people from different countries, The room was big enough and very clean so were the toilet as well
341835,Senator Hotel Vienna, this time was the bathroom not in good conditions shower was not done proper maintenance fall apart big crack in the sink, very good as always modern look nice people professional service 
341836,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, We spent three nights at the Senator Hotel The staff was very welcoming and helpful Our room was comfortable and clean There are lot of shops an restaurants nearby and the ride to the city center takes just a few minutes with tram We highly recommend it 
341837,Senator Hotel Vienna, Although we booked double room with king size bed they put us 3 single beds We asked for this at the reception and they told us we provide you what we have available and also their answer was its ok put them together Not so comfortable and the pillows the same Also not so close to the city center you need to take tram and metro as well The location of the hotel not the safest , It was clean and opposite the tram station It has lidl next to it
341838,Senator Hotel Vienna, The public transport directions on the website could be clearer tram 9 from Westbahnhof does not actually stop at Rosensteingasse , Family accommodation spacious

341841,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Great value for money All good and clean There s a supermarket next door The Hotel is three tram stops away from the Ubahn The trip to center will take you half an hour all in all 
341842,Senator Hotel Vienna, For a 40euro room 20 euro parking is too much Breakfast was poor No smoking area except the main door Rooms aren t as big as they look in pictures Towels need to be change Internet only for email and mobile use Couldn t load any youtube or facebook video on laptop 5 10 sec to open google on laptop , Staff talking english and 1000 friendly Location good with shops around markets and fast foods transportation Very clean hotel No noise from outside even on rooms with street view 
341843,Senator Hotel Vienna, Nothing from 4 star hotels Very modest and ordinary No room service until afternoon of 2nd day We always used public transport to go somewhere everything is far away on foot , Breakfast is good has wide range 
341844,Senator Hotel Vienna, Wifi not so fast The area of the hotel is empty of activities you have to go to the center of the city for decent restaurants bars and other leisure activities , The room was clean and beautiful The location has great connection to the center of Vienna There is a Lidl just next to the hotel entrance The luggage room was pretty convenient as well 
341845,Senator Hotel Vienna, The hotel was a bit away from the center of Wien however if travelling by tram it is only 5 7 minutes , The hotel was just wonderful It exceeded all our expectations not to mention value for the money A full 10 out of 10 Will definitely book again here 
341846,Senator Hotel Vienna, Smelly room quality control dirty walls City was too rough streetnames are positioned badly orientation for tourists its a tough one, Color of bed The garden view The castle picture water pressure good Good structured city Tic toc like a clock Pro drivers beautiful lady cop
341847,Senator Hotel Vienna, Noisy room because of poor sound insulation of the windows Tram comes quite often but still a bit far from center Expensive parking Wi Fi sometimes not working or difficult to connect More likely a fair 3 stars hotel , Very kind and helpful staff Good cleanliness Acceptable breakfast 
341848,Senator Hotel Vienna, The car parking is a little expensive but i suppose that s to be expected in Vienna , Location is good to visit Vienna the tram stop into the centre is a couple of moments away on the main road the staff were very welcoming friendly and helpful at all times The room was comfortable clean even if the beds were a little firm for our taste There are lots of shops restaurants in the vicinity 
341849,Senator Hotel Vienna, Wifi didn t work in our room all the time The hotel has ranked too high It was basic 3 star hotel not worth of 4 stars , Location and price were good It was easy to go to centrum by tram number 43 Breakfast was ok Familyroom was ok too there were real beds to everyone Lidl was very near it was downstars 
341850,Senator Hotel Vienna, The hotel does not have a parking it has a garage but it is full all the time and even if you ask in the reservation for one still not receive it In addition I left my car at 3 km distance in a public parking and when I left I brought the car in front of the hotel for 5 minutes until I got in the room after the storage and when I returned I had in window a 36 euros amend for parking This hotel is a 4 stars hotel but I do not give him more than 3 , The location of the hotel is very good 10 minutes by tram to the center and the tram station is nearticulat the hotel The hotel staff is ok the rooms are clean and quiet even if you sit on the street sidef Next to the hotel is a Lidl supermarket 
341851,Senator Hotel Vienna, I am very dissapointed about the staff and their behavior when I pointed that they made big mistakes when they charge me the whole amount for the entire stay on the day before and then took again the first night on the day of our arrival We paid in cash but still had a lot of trouble to get our money back And we were not the only customers treated in this way Maybe because we are Romanians We came in your country to spend money that we earn in our country we didn t come like others to ask you something for free I ve been in Austria so many times and I had the best experiences I hope this was just a singular case ,No Positive
341852,Senator Hotel Vienna, If you turn on the heat the air becomes low in humidity so you need to open a window to let fresh air inside, Awesome breakfast nice staff clean room every day without asking not far away from the town center 
341853,Senator Hotel Vienna, Expensive car parking 20 00 euros for day Internet point at the entrance 2 computers available from guests to surf the net were very slow and printing was not working , Sixst floor was very silent excellent breakfast and confortable bed 
341854,Senator Hotel Vienna, The gutter smell in the bathroom should have been fixed before arrival of new guests , Comfortable hotel friendly people clean 15 mins out of center but good connections by bus and tram Worth the distance for good comfort and good price 
341855,Senator Hotel Vienna, It s not a 4 star hotel It s a modest 3 star that could be renovated , Location is good as in 10 minutes you are in the centre of Vienna Staff was very friendly 
341856,Senator Hotel Vienna, Bathroom very basic bed too soft sagging in the middle nothing around to see and not much to go for dinner unless you take the tram to the center, Breakfast ok handy to take the tram nice looking room 
341857,Senator Hotel Vienna, Location a bit far from the city centre and no direct connection by metro train Expensive parking Crowded breakfast buffet room Very few places nearby to eat, Comfortable clean rooms Well maintained
341858,Senator Hotel Vienna, better lighting in the room would be preferred and no hot water kettle in the room Fridge wasnt too effective However staff were good enough to always provide us with hot drinking water when required , good location Close to a grocery shop and tram service to the city
341859,Senator Hotel Vienna, The hotel was a tram metro journey to the city centre so not the best location Also the hotel were pretty understanding about my mistake in booking the incorrect date and did change it but at a very costly price Our two night stay was very expensive before they added on this price so I was very disappointed I d like to add that the hotel in Prague changed the date without any further cost , A comfortable room
341860,Senator Hotel Vienna, Couple of drawbacks there is no restaurants nearby There are some fastfood facilities some small pubs and Kebabs but close to none decent food places So don t expect to eat there in the evening There is shortage of wall sockets I had to disconnect lamps to charge my electronics , The room and shower were fairly big There were 2 beds in our room One is small child bed and other was just enormous Breakfast was nice but simple Supermarket just next door to hotel Overall it was lovely hotel To get to the center you just need to get out of the hotel and take tram 43a 
341861,Senator Hotel Vienna, Was asking for earlier check in but were ignored Staff is useless and not welcoming at the front desk and completely unhelpful in non trivial situations Expect to wait tons of time Early morning you get waked by constant room service knocks always put DND tag and nearby cars , Comfy room beds and facilities 30 mins walk to the center or 5 mins ride on tram a bit long but ok Good value for price and short stays 
341862,Senator Hotel Vienna, Breakfast not too much choices and also restaurant small and crowded , Receiving personnel very nice Very clean Easy commute to the touristic attractions 
341863,Senator Hotel Vienna, The bathroom could do with an overhaul mould all over the grouting in the shower House keeping could be improved especially in the bathroom Triple room was a bit cramped Not in the nicest part of town but easy enough to get to and we felt safe , Front desk staff were very helpful and friendly Late noon check out very convenient Close to trams and buses to take you nearly anywhere in Vienna Lots of eateries nearby next door to Lidl for anything else Overall good value for money 
341864,Senator Hotel Vienna, Nothing, Location is great specially for those who have cars free parking around the hotel Variety of restaurants within steps from the hotels Helpful cooperative staff Clean rooms
341865,Senator Hotel Vienna, Lot of traffic noise tram Until 01 00 AM you have to keep the windows closed at night or use ear plugs We had a room at the front perhaps rear side is less noisy , Frontdesk emp Very helpfull Excellent breakfast buffet Tram stops at 1 min walk from hotel
341866,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Everything is perfect Especially the staff is very helpful There are maps available for you to pick up at receptionist you just need to ask where you would want to go and they will show you the shortest ways by nearby bus tram 
341867,Senator Hotel Vienna, I wondered how people said that good reviews on this hotel and seems it got an award from Booking The breakfast was pretty bad Not much varieties the room was small the bathroom was very basic This is for sure a 3 stars hotel I was in Vienna before many times this hotel is absolutely not a 4 stars hotel So pay your money for a 3starr hotel and save the money for better things , The hotel is Ok and clean 
341868,Senator Hotel Vienna, We experienced problem with the wifi connection in our room, Although the area is not central the transport connections are really good so all sites of interest become easily accesible
341869,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Indeed a decent and wonderful budget hotel The tram stop is very close and from there you ll get to downtown in around 15 mins I believe this is one of the best options you can get for this amount of money in Vienna The money spent is well worth it This was our second time around and again no disappointment 
341870,Senator Hotel Vienna, bathroom in our room was quite smelly probably because of a bad shower drain, nice rooms with good furnishings good city hotel wont disappoint clean
341871,Senator Hotel Vienna, The closest Subway station is far so if you stay downtown late at night in the w e transportation back will be a struggle During the day it s ok Something to have in mind because in Vienna subway works whole night Friday and Saturday night , The staff the reception is extra friendly and willing to help with any questions 
341872,Senator Hotel Vienna, Nothing worse to mention, Seconf d time in this wonderful hotel We took a quadrulupe room that was spacious and smartly designed Beds and sofa bed were comfortable Using tram 43 makes transportation easy and the location becomes very central Rich breakfast full of nice choices We used the luggage room to store our heavy bags Staff is very helpful and cheerful LIDL supermarket is in the ground floor of the same building 
341873,Senator Hotel Vienna, Price is a bit high Parking price is high, Very Clean Comfortable Big room Good and comfortable bed pillows Parking Silent rooms Free WiFi Air Conditioner
341874,Senator Hotel Vienna, This hotel is really a place for low budget package tour groups Service is almost non existent Rooms are clean but comforts are minimal Cheap pillows No toiletries small thin towels , I really don t like anything about this hotel I do not recommend it and I wouldn t stay here again I don t understand why it has such a high Booking com rating 
341875,Senator Hotel Vienna, Air conditioning did not work the first 2 nights It was uncomfortable and since we have allergies that is an important thing for us , Hotel had a great breakfast Staff was helpful and friendly Location was not in downtown which is good but very close 15 min on a tram and you are in he middle of everything Nice safe neighborhood

341879,Senator Hotel Vienna, Temperature in the room cannot be controlled it was too hot on a sunny day the first spring day in Vienna No tea coffee making facilities in the room , Staff and personal assistance Functional room 
341880,Senator Hotel Vienna, Because we haven t had iron in the room and when we ask we got it but not the iron board Without that was a bit challenging to iron my shirts , The staff were great

341882,Senator Hotel Vienna, It was a bit annoying when the housekeepers were knocking at the door at 8 30 unless you had the do not disturb sign hanging on the outside , The room was cosy 
341883,Senator Hotel Vienna, Breakfast could ve been better staff and food weren t particularly nice Wish there was either subtitles with TV channels or a few Englush speaking channels That would ve made my stay just perfect , Comfortable bed and clean front desk very helpful and friendly Gave us recommendations for restaurants helped me with how to get to places etc 
341884,Senator Hotel Vienna, Didn t notice anything, With the amount I paid for my room for breakfast to be included with a lot of food in there and the free computer access down steers 
341885,Senator Hotel Vienna, The breakfast could of ended a bit later P, The staff were INCREDIBLY helpful It definitely made me want to come back The location is really good In 15 minutes you re downtown by TRAM Schonbrunn is also easy to access as is the Westbahnhoff Also very good breakfast Good job Senator hotel staff

341888,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, All employees are very friendly and helpfull as I arrived check in was done very professional and I got all information for my stay It was great to stay and I am looking forward to stay again 
341889,Senator Hotel Vienna, location is too far If you are with car then you need to pay for parking 18 Euro pls 2 30 each way per person for tram if family of 5 then it is costly 41 Euro per day If it is couple then, the rest was nice
341890,Senator Hotel Vienna, Too narrow parking space , Exactly as advertised Clean room professional service helpful staff Although a bit away from city center tram station with direct route is some 50 m away so it s perfect 
341891,Senator Hotel Vienna, without any bad experience i just fell like parking is a little bit to expesive but you can find around the hotel even in front of the building saturday and sunday , staff was verry nice room was really clean close to the tram staiton
341892,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The staff at the reception was very very helpful and courteous The hotel management was very kind to accept my date change at last moment Hotel is clean comfortable easily accessible and has good breakfast in all value for money 
341893,Senator Hotel Vienna, Parking at 18 per night is very steep for the property A bit out of the way for all attractions although there is a tram stop in front of the hotel , Vienna is an expensive city to visit For theprice the hotel facilities wi fi and breakfast was good 
341894,Senator Hotel Vienna, The room was quite small for a four member family It would be better to choose two double rooms , Clean hotel Very good breakfast Very close to the tram line Easy access to the city center 
341895,Senator Hotel Vienna, Laundry was prohibitively expensive Breakfast not included but available at 14 Better priced cafes in walking distance , The room was very clean and comfortable The room was very good value for money 
341896,Senator Hotel Vienna, Sometimes in the restaurant at breakfast staff was slow and we had to wait for a long time for them to respond in some things we asked them kindly , I must place a great recommendation and great CUDOS to hotel reception staff Very nice very kind very helpfull The best reception staff i have ever encountered The breakfast was also good 
341897,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Its based in Hernals and its modern clean convenient for 43 and 9 tram easy to get to the University and Schottentor and Ring Strasse Helpful staff allowed me a late check out at no extra cost Good breakfasts Room was spacious and clean great bed My second visit before my third Popular with Austrian visitors
341898,Senator Hotel Vienna, The attitude of the new staff is somehow different comparing to the period when we were 9 times guests at the Senator hotel This doesn t mean stuff is rude impolite or anything similar they are mostly OK but it s not the same like it was We asked with a smile before we came as well as when we arrived is it possible that for our 10th stay we get one night of free parking but the reply was very short we don t have free parking it costs 18EUR No problem we parked our car on the street outside the time limited parking zone 10 12 minutes by foot from the hotel There are no slippers in the room like it was earlier also no small bottles of shampoo for hair and shower gel and body lotion there were 3 small bottles earlier now there is one regular sized body hair shampoo gel Wi Fi in our room was mostly slow weak especially in the evening These are small details not very much important but it effects our complete average score so we give 7 9 instead of 9 0 we gave in the previous years anyway 7 9 shows we consider this hotel as very good , This was our 10th stay at the Senator hotel but the first one after the management and stuff were changed This is still very good hotel but now we would estimate it as 7 9 instead of 9 0 we have in some earlier reviews 2010 2013 Good location easy to go to the center by tram good breakfast clean room kind man at the reception Mr Goran 
341899,Senator Hotel Vienna, Parking for 18 day Small breakfast room hotel was full and I had no place to sit down for breakfast at all I had to ask someone If they wouldn t mind sitting next to them Very uncomfortable Noisy street, Nice 4 Hotel
341900,Senator Hotel Vienna, Overpriced It looks nice but the service at the reception was bad the windows were locked their wifi is unprotected and their inside parking was full so we had to park on the street , The breackfast was good to be honest 
341901,Senator Hotel Vienna, Everything, Two of our traveling companions had their rooms canceled due to a tour bus that was willing to pay more The desk clerk said you can use the computer to find someplace else and turned his back Those with rooms regretted it for the dirt and run down nature of the hotel 
341902,Senator Hotel Vienna, We would have liked to have been able to use the wifi Unfortunately we couldn t connect Also it would have been nice to have had some drawers for our clothes , The location of the hotel was within walking distance of our son s apartment making it the perfect place for us to stay 
341903,Senator Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The staff was very helpful There was issue with one of the beds in the room we were given After we informed them about this problem they gave us another room 
341904,Senator Hotel Vienna, It s the 21th century around and Austria is a developed country the internet speed could be much better In the evening when everyone gets online the connection was virtually nonexistent Also the locality isn t the best some scary Oriental stuff around Please note that the hotel is about 30 min walk from the city center so you should definitely take a tram , The hotel was clean the staff was friendly and supportive everything was nearly perfect 
341905,Senator Hotel Vienna, I booked a double bed as we are in couple but they didn t take it in account and gave us two simple bed , location is fine facilities are cleaned and breakfast is great
341906,Senator Hotel Vienna, small rooms internet doesn t work at nights the location is not a good place in Vienna, Clean close to the Tram station which goes to the city center
341907,Senator Hotel Vienna, the breakfast was not worth the money at all it s 13 90 a head and you could buy a much better breakfast in vienna for that price , amazing value for money the rooms are so fresh and cool and we only paid 43 50 a night there s a tram station on the doorstep of the hotel that takes you right into a main area the staff are also very friendly and approachable 
341908,Senator Hotel Vienna, Wi Fi connection is really bad It s a good hotel but I would not consider it a 4 star hotel 64 euros for three people was ok but they charged us 115 euros for the second day and I don t think it s worth it , Close to city center There is a tram stop in front of the hotel Supermarket really close 
341909,Senator Hotel Vienna, Housekeeper entered the room directly above us at 8am By mistake from the parking we entered a door that we now assume that was not publicly available and receptionist without even say anything slammed the door and locked it , Good looking hotel 
341910,Senator Hotel Vienna, the room for 3 adults too small and i have made by mistake two reservations for the same room and people and nobody from the hotel gived me a call to ask me if its on purpose or i really want to make two exactly same reservations They waited for me to arrive in the hotel and booked me price for cancelled reserv I think there are much more better hotels in wien at the same price Amedia hotel is the best , Not bad but not 4 stars hotel for sure 
341911,Senator Hotel Vienna, The staff was rude and unhelpful at all There were some major problems with the Wi Fi and the bed although is soft it is unconfortable since they don t provide any double beds , It was pretty clean 
341912,Senator Hotel Vienna, the wifi was a little slow but I was still able to book places and print the reservation sheets downstairs, Great location right on tram line 43 and the aircon was welcoming after a hot walking filled day on our feet There is also a lidel supermarket right next door and atm and bakery are also really close awesome stay well worth the good price
341913,Senator Hotel Vienna, It was my first time eating powder eggs scrumbled powder eggs don t try chose another restaurant , Rooms OK cleanness on satisfactory level as well as hotel crew Wifi hmmmm existing In general hotel is a good option for one night good public connection with city center but when You wake up run away from a breakfast 
341914,Senator Hotel Vienna, Wi Fi works good only at reception on 4th stage it doesnt work abolutely It s a little bit sad because sometimes you need free internet access in your room to find something usefull for your travel , Trams to center is near towels changed each day supermarket at next building to hotel hair dryer at room Good service at all
