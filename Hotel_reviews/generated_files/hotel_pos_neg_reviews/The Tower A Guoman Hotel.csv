457625,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room I paid for a room with a bridge view but this was a limited view The room was quite small and the window was tiny We were right in the corner and our window looked right into the next room which was occupied , The location of the hotel is really good as you have plenty of tourist attractions around and some very nice restaurants 
457626,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Longer dispute necessary to get the prce previously confirmed by booking com Personnel was not very eager or responsiv to solve the problem except for the one person who did it finally We booked two rooms in one single booking well in advance but anyway the hotel was not able even to put the two rooms on the same floor not to say close together , Hotel was clean all services available you can expect from a hotel of this size very good breakfast buffet with fresh made omlettes Spectacular view to the bridge from our room 
457627,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Not getting what I was told on check in I would get, I have stayed here before and have been very happy this time round on checking in I was told having requested a room overlooking the river I would be getting this but didn t and the room I was given this time smaller than previous visits
457628,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bathroom basic Room very warm even with fan on and windows open Iron in room very small Room small , Bed comfy Location excellent Friendly staff 
457629,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel was very busy and consequently the wait for lifts and check in out was longer than we expected , location of the property was excellent for our needs views were spectacular and rooms very comfortable We didn t eat in the hotel apart from breakfast so couldn t give an opinion about the quality of the food 
457630,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel timings for Sunday breakfast were misleading We arrived a few minutes before the latest advertised time only to find the buffet being cleared away The staff were very helpful in sorting out the issue but it made the whole experience less enjoyable and very rushed Maybe the advertised timings should be reviewed , Great location with lovely views of St Katherine s Dock Plenty of eating choices nearby and a short walk to underground station Room was comfortable and staff were proactive in sorting out issues 
457631,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Asked them to arrange flowers and champagne in room the answer was that they would add a note to our booking After check in went to the reception and asked what happen Even sent an email to ask what happen to the wished service The answer was that they apologized and would arrange something Sunday instead We where out most of the day and came back to room at midnight Still nothing was arranged ,No Positive
457632,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I wanted to buy extra items thorough the hotel email system Prosecco and chocolates Maybe an extra night in the hotel The staff who replied to the email were most unhelpful and just kept referring me back to the hotel She was the hotel , Comfy bed Really comfy bed 
457633,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Poor facilities in room No mini bar very basic toiletries not even a shower cap Air conditioning didn t work and couldn t be controlled Service appalling in all areas very under staffed Staff did their best Full of tour parties ,No Positive
457634,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bathroom mirror could not see in it all foggy which I thought it needed cleaning but it did not rub off also the bath had a few holes in it and tap was not that good so bathroom really could do with a make over, Bed was comfy view was amazing
457635,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing worth mentioning , Great location for most amenities on both north south bank Tube bus or river bus all within a 5 min walk Very good choice of cafes restaurants and bars around the marina 
457636,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was so hot I couldn t sleep Also we paid when we got there then the next day checking out they tried to charge us again saying we only authorised the card last night we need to take the money now even though the money had already been taken , It was very clean and had a lovely view of the dock The room was large with all the facilities you would need 
457637,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Just seemed like a normal hotel with no real omph and no real pullback as to why we would stay again full of people who wanted to know everyone s business and parking is terrible Bedrooms are compact but comfortable again first come first serve for the best views the air con didn t really seem to work was very poor so had to open windows for air Bar is next to venue rooms so we had 2 weddings so was fairly noisey and then it kicked off outside excellent base for adventures and sightseeing can t fault that , It was very close to all attractions like tower bridge Tower of London and all restaurants at butlers wharf
457638,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I didn t find anything that I didn t like, The staff in the executive lounge we re very attentive It was a wonderful break away and I would recommend the hotel to anyone 
457639,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing in particular , Great location next to Tower Bridge and The Tower of London We paid a little extra and had a room with fantastic views of Tower Bridge and The Thames 
457640,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, It was all fine and we really appreciated the vouchers for London attractions , Super room and bathroom Great breakfast Fantastic location and views of the Thames and Tower Bridge 
457641,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location with views over the Thames and Tower Bridge So much going on there and easy to walk to the South Bank etc along the river walkway St Katherine s Dock just behind with many bars and restaurants and Shad Thames just across the bridge Vibrant hotel where nothing was too much trouble for the staff Breakfast varied with fresh omelettes eggs etc prepared if you required 
457642,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was tiny even though it was an Executive room The view which is why I booked the room was mainly of a brick wall with a view of the river and the far end of Butlers Wharf The Nespresso machine in the room was dirty so I didn t even attempt to use it For breakfast in the room the sausages were sour mushooms were water drenched bacon overcooked and too hard to cut with a knife and the scrambled eggs were solid and you also needed a knife to cut them into bite size pieces The local roads have had new restrictions added so the hotel access road is used to turn around by drivers who block the access exit from the property as a result my taxi took 25 minutes to get me to my destination 5 minutes after my meeting had started , The bed was large with a lot of pillows cushions and the room service waiter was pleasant 
457643,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Executive room and Club lounge were a waste of money Staff didn t top up the food and service at breakfast was dreadful no food then no plates no cups and took over 10 minutes to wait for each thing that was missing In the evening the staff were more concerned at welcoming back a couple who were not even staying in the hotel but had come up to see if staff that they knew were there they were not and everyone else was ignored , Comfy beds nice coffee
457644,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The check In as we arrived for our check I in at 3pm and got told our room wouldn t be ready in till 4pm Then moved us rooms and we still got bridge view but not what I was expecting with fans below the window spoilt the view And the manageress trying to charge for breakfast when prepaid, The bed was comfy The staff were good The bridge view outside close to all amenities I would stay their again As we loved being so central and comfy
457645,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room wasn t cleaned serviced following the first night Room was a little small but adequate Room was overlooked by other rooms in the adjacent wing so curtains had to be closed at times for privacy , Comfortable Beds and clean room and bathroom Complimentary bottles of water Good view of the Thames Butlers Wharf
457646,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The meal in the Brasserie was not good at all We both decided to have what is advertised as FRESH Cod Fillet What arrived was awful frozen fish and after we told the staff we were told that yes the fish is frozen sir For fact we could have purchased a box of 6 Frozen Cod Fillets at Waitrose for about 3 50 and not paid a total of 27 90 for two When we complained were offered a free cup coffee with the meal In addition to this very poor food we were most annoyed at having the staff moving and laying up tables for breakfast around us all the time were were eating Very poor food and very poor service from a hotel off this class ,No Positive
457647,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room far too small literally no room for two trolleys Too expensive for what it was Upgrades available but at 50 pounds night minimum far too much , Wifi worked fine
457648,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Elevators are old and slow and always one out of service The suite club house at 5th floor snacks were poor The staff looked exhausted and over worked but seems keeping a positive attidude to satisfy the guests despite the demands , Breakfast host supervisor was a professional and the food was excellent we were a party of 4 staying on same hotel and always helped us find a table with a view The location near Tower bridge and marina with many restaurants and cafes The staff was friendly 
457649,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, THE LONDON WEATHER WAS AN UNSEASONABLE HEATWAVE AT 32 C BUT HUGELY HUMID THE ROOMS WERE NOT AIR CONDITIONED AND WE HAD TO REQUEST A PORTABLE FAN FOR THE LOCATION OF THIS HOTEL AND THE MONEY PAID WE ARE NOT PLANNING TO RETURN THE PROPERTY IS NOW VERY TIRED AND REQUIRES A HUGE FACELIFT A GREAT PITY FOR SUCH AN EXCELLENT LOCATION , NOT MUCH 
457650,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in was a complete joke Paid extra for a bridge view only to be obscured by a massive tree it either wants trimming or completely cutting down Won t be staying here again You get better service and value at a premier inn , Not a lot Isn t a 4 star hotel 
457651,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Toiletries not complete no toothbrush toothpaste More ideal if there is a mini fridge in the room I can hear next doors conversation , Staff very accommodating friendly Location excellent 
457652,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There was no one to help us out with the bags we had to stay 30 min in line to check in staff was so not cool place is over rated ow and ya the ace don t Evan work it was so hot all night the room was so small and no place to pot ur bag at all the hotel is overrated in the price for such a small room and old furniture, The location is the only thing great about this place 
457653,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel is a little tired Bed was comfortable but room has seen better days Never seen such an antiquated hairdryer Lifts broken and guests had to use staff staircase Very busy at breakfast food was cold and limited We were unhappy with standard of our room and asked for a manager to call us They did not make contact at all which is disappointing for a hotel in this price bracket However the location is fantastic , Great location and comfortable bed however room small and difficult to control temperature in room 
457654,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, reception staff need to definitely be more fluent in English the reception area is busy and noisy and it needs to be clearer , the view of the bridge is one of the best views in the world we were on 10th floor 
457655,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, I didn t end up staying but did have a training course here the room was nice the staff were helpful and friendly the hotel was clean and the food lovely location is beautiful as well by river with the view of the bridge 
457656,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, the double bed is a bit small and too soft, the location is super good and the window view is the best for tower bridge because of that I can stay at the room for a whole day
457657,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Two of the lifts weren t working and we had to wait over 10 min for one to get downstairs with our luggage and finally just used the service lift because our taxi was waiting and we had to get to the airport We walked down the stairs for breakfast as the wait was so long but couldn t do that with our luggage The air conditioning wasn t working though thankfully they brought us a fan , The room was clean and comfortable though small and the view fantastic The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was very good 
457658,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only thing we bothered about was that to climb stairs from car park to reception The room was small but this is London most rooms are small , The breakfast was excellent Our windows on the Themes close to Tower Bridge 
457659,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Long queue for check in unhelpful since I was late Very slow lifts also again slightly frustrating Also rather odd at breakfast not included in my room and was it a fuss to get it booked to my room bill The room card wasn t enough I had to show my key implication I suppose that I d wandered in and possibly found someone s room card then I was presented with a bill and when I asked again if it could be put on the room I was queried as to if I had enough credit on the room quite a security fuss over 10 maybe I look like a random breakfast thief something I will reflect on Otherwise the staff were very pleasant and breakfast was the usual standard stuff , Great location and I had wonderful views over Catherine s Dock also great views over Tower Bridge the other side immaculate room presentation and generally nice staff I really liked it and think I will book again Thank you for the iron and tea in the comfortable room with plenty of storage and oodles of fast flowing hot water 
457660,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, One of our guests did not have a room and had to sleep on the sofa in reception although I had a booking confirmation from booking com this had not been forwarded to the hotel I was made to look a fool very disappointed will not be using this hotel again ,No Positive
457661,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Smallest room ever at this hotel and highest price ever Not a good outcome Probably book another way on next stay , Great lOcation and car parking Hotel is fine and it s staff are helpful 
457662,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful view of tower bridge Go downstairs and eat drink and or sit by the Themes Staff were very accommodating and friendly Bed was comfortable And they provide washcloths A bonus when traveling nowadays We paid 160 pounds same price we paid for another London hotel without the location or comfort 
457663,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in seemed abit slow despite not being very many guests waiting , Provided a window view of the Tower Bridge which was lovely Room was small but well appointed and wouldn t have any complaints about condition or noise Wifi also ran pretty well by UK standards 
457664,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Having to check out We ordered two things from the brasserie drinks and entrees Both they got wrong , THE VIEW OMG I thought the view of the bridge would mean I wold see a brick or a square inch NOPE I saw the whole thing I almost didn t leave my room as the view was SPECTACULAR Upon check in we were greeted by a porter who took our heavy luggage We then had it delivered to our room The apples at the desk were a welcome relief to our hunger from travelling all day and not stopping for food Which we immediately went searching for once I stopped crying at the view from our room We did a reccy around the Tower of London and walked the Tower bridge Came back to have a meal at the brasserie The room was nothing special and could do with a facelift but the linen was crisp and the towels plush 
457665,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Old Hotel and rooms stuck in the 80s needs refurbishment Terrible Iron and Board Worst Burger in town , Location at the Themes and view at Tower Bridge 
457666,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We had breakfast in our room The scrambled eggs were cold and the mushrooms were greasy and inedible The croissant could have been warm , The room was roomy comfortable fluffy towels Comfortable bed 
457667,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The tea coffee facilities should be on a tray and on view the dresser rather than packed away in a drawer Other than that everything was great , Excellent river view from our room and hotel is in a fabulous location close to St Katherine s Dock which has a great vibe 
457668,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room is quite dated and dim There was no fridge there used to be in the room but was nailed and no mini bar is available now We are not sure how to switch on the heater and we told the reception We have been told they will send someone up but no one showed up for 2 days that we stayed , The room is clean Bed extra comfy and location is good just 1 2 minutes walk to tower bridge and 8 minutes walk to the tower hill underground station View from our room of the river and near landmarks was special 
457669,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, All the outlets in the room were dead and it took them an hour to relocate us Not a thank you or discount for the new room or drink coupon was offered When we checked out the reception felt really bad and discounted our room 20 GBP ,No Positive
457670,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The staff open exterior windows during room cleaning and do not close them My room location at a corner of the building attracted multiple mosquitoes and bugs resulting in multiple bug bites over night after trying to squash as many of the bugs as possible The public elevators malfunction many times with exterior and interior doors not opening together on the third floor , Location location location 
457671,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Communications problems between departments Billing Being referred to as a booking com customer, Fantastic location food in bistro very good and great value Suite okay but needs updated bathroom small Had a few problems with reception and billing took the manager 5 days to contact me and i am still not happy so i wont be staying at this hotel again Coffee machine in club lounge did not work the four days of my stay I was in a suite and my Brother and Sister inlaw in an executive double with it being very hot weather i was told by reception only suite s have good air con so i upgraded them to a suite 
457672,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Location is brilliant restaurants at street level close to St Katherine s Docks with pubs and restaurants walking distance to everything food drink Tower Bridge views close to London Tower underground and other sightseeing areas 
457673,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Website says the bar is open until 2 00am but actually closes at 1 00am We only returned just before midnight having been to a concert at Wembley so would have welcomed more time , Friendly receptionist and whilst waiting in the queue somebody else spoke to us and apologised for the wait
457674,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We ve been coming to The Tower Hotel for 30 years whenever in London It is still a great location but over the years it has very gradually become less special though in their defense the prices have remained very competitive On arrival we upgraded to an executive room which was really no bigger with twin beds that were rather narrow for adults not particularly executive at all Furnishings were rather large and left very little space to walk around bed We would have been just as well staying with a standard room and saved the extra cost , Location
457675,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, I liked that reception allowed 2 hours extra for check out allowing my elderly mother to pack at her own pace I liked that I was able to leave luggage Loved the view Beds very comfy 
457676,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The rooms could do with modernising slightly however it does bring some character , The views are amazing and all the staff were extremely helpful A beautiful place to stay 
457677,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Our room was the size of a box Waited ages at reception to sign in No air conditioning in room Was in reception area , Beautiful location on the water 
457678,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Its in dire need of a refurbishment its too old now the AC struggled and had no effect the mini bar was no longer in the cupboard the shower was appalling the room was tiny For what you and they charge its terrible that its probably hasn t been refurbished in atleast 40 years , Location and views are great 
457679,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was very small no fridge and small selection of teas and coffees Main problem was that the aircon couldn t cope with the very hot weather slept with the curtains open and the windows as far as they would open , Get location fantastic view of the Thames and Tower Bridge from the bedroom
457680,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There was air con and the room temperature was 30C But the worst was that they didn t do anything to help me They didn t even offer me to change room so that I could have a window or something to make the situation better I should have WiFi but I forgot to ask about and nobody reminded me of it while in all other hotels I have stayed up to now they all inform you about things like that , The bed was good and the view is great from the room
457681,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No aircon Beware on a hot day it won t be pleasant it s 2017 notwhat you expect Overall hotel is looking tired and past its heyday Views are awesome but the outside facade is hideous how did they get it past planning even in 1960s and the inside a bit weary Needs a refurb, Awesome location
457682,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We had asked for a specific river view when we booked and the request was ignored This lead to protracted debate on check in and the offer and refusal of a new room We ended up with a none river view room not good , Location
457683,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, ORANGE JUICE WASN T ORANGE JUICE THEY KEPT ADDING APPLE JUICE TO IT IT WATERED THE ORANGE FLAVOUR I WANTED ORANGE JUICE NOT A MIX OF JUICES, LOVELY ROOM VERY CLEAN BED VERY FIRM COMFY
457684,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, rooms are compact staff messed up on checkout charging someone elses room to my card then rather than writing it off to my account wanted another card Sure they credited it back to my card the next day but good job I have a large credit line not impressed staff did their best and were helpful but very disorganised, location is great
457685,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We arrived at 1 30 pm complete all the paperwork and came back at 6pm to collect the keys During theses few hours my paperwork and booking was lost and it had to be done again The room was ridiculous hot The air conditioning was extremely ineffective and the windows barely opened an inch The light switch was temperamental There was no telephone in our room so we had to go to reception to order room service and instead of taking our order and ringing it through the receptionist passed us the phone from behind reception We paid 70 for 2 chicken fillet burgers and a bottle of wine Quite frankly i be had better burgers from fast food establishments they were rancid We went to the brasserie were we waited 25 minutes for table service after which time we got fed up of waiting and had to go to the bar to ask to be served ,No Positive
457686,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing I was completely happy with everything , Fabulous view Easy to get to on the bus from Euston station Very pleasant friendly receptionist Breakfast was an extra 12 00 each but we were seated in a very nice quiet cool part of the breakfast room and there was a good choice of hot and cold breakfast foods Bed was very comfortable and best of all we could open the windows and because it was on the river side of the property it was quiet overnight Excellent choice of eateries nearby for dinner 
457687,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nearest station a bit far compared to other places but this is not really a problem , Beautiful views of Tower Bridge and excellent location Central and right near St Katherine s docks
457688,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location in the shadow of Tower Bridge The room was compact but adequate We didn t eat at the hotel as St Katherine Docks is just around the corner with a wide selection of restaurants 
457689,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The restaurant menu was quite boring and staff not attentive The coffee served after the meal supposedly a cappuccino was bitter and undrinkable Service at breakfast was indifferent I had to send back my tea which was stewed On reflection there are an amazing number of eateries close by Issue with staff training no one has given them a sense of service and care over the way things are done , The location and layout of the hotel was excellent although it took a little time to register 
457690,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bathroom is tired chipped tiles shower difficult to work and regulating the heat Furniture also tired and seen better days , The staff were amazing Very helpful and polite couldn t fault them apart from one gentleman at the concierge They are the jewel in the crown Room service prompt and helpful Very comfortable bed Cleanliness in room Good food well cooked and well presented for room service and brasserie 
457691,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Its a solid three stars It s not four stars Rooms are a little tatty decor old no fridge no mini bar safe didn t work , Staff were all pleasant and helpful Excellent views great location 
457692,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We felt the rooms themselves were smaller than an adequate amount of space for two individuals , Upon arrival we received a very warm welcome We arrived before our expected check in time although the room was already cleaned and ready for us to move into Cleaning staff were very prompt and friendly and provided many shower commodities The hotel was modern with good air conditioning facilites 
457693,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Air con didn t appear to be working , The location is terrific Nearest tube is only a short walk away View from our room of the river and near landmarks was special Staff were very courteous Having left a personal item in the room on leaving it was returned to me in the mail shortly afterwards very efficient 
457694,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Restaurant not opened for lunch Tried to get drink at bar but staff ignored me for a while and when eventually placed an order was told that beer I chose was off Went elsewhere , Location and general comfort of room very good 
457695,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Fresh from the moment you walk through to reception room was lovely and excellent staff It was a lovely hot day and spent the afternoon at the outside bar , Our 2nd visit absolutely loved our time and the staff was excellent in the aftermath of the awful events at London bridge 
457696,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The mushy peas as served with fish chips in the Brasserie restaurant should be avoided fish chips themselves were very good , We were persuaded to upgrade to a Club room it was a great decision for the room extras that came with the Club room The room itself on 11th floor was a good size very comfortable with a superb view of Tower Bridge the Thames south London All the staff were very helpful efficient courteous The location between Tower Bridge St Katherine s Dock has to be one of the nicest in London very convenient for the City of London Highly recommended both for business leisure stays 
457697,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Large and particularly comfortable bed in a spacious room with fantastic views out across the river and very quiet too Super friendly staff who made us very welcome we mentioned in passing that it was my husband s birthday when checking in and returning to our room after our evening out discovered that Ruben on reception had sent chocolates and a bottle of wine by way of celebration An extremely thoughtful gesture that was much appreciated 
457698,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Usual issue with room keys not working on first attempt get similar problems with other hotels Lights were a little difficult to fathom There is a master switch which I missed Would still highly recommend , Central hotel well signposted My room had wonderful views Nothing not to like Would highly recommend Staff super helpful 
457699,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, View from the room was amazing I was dropped off by taxi and it s a little confusing to get to because the taxi needed to drive through a barrier small road leading up to the hotel Location is perfect Room was well decorated 
457700,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Reception staff could have been a little more friemdly, The team on the restaurant for breakfast were amazing Helpful and courteous and nothing was too much trouble
457701,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Probably the hottest weekend in London and the air conditioning was non existent no control knob button to turn on fan blew hot air instead of cold This was in two different rooms our party was staying in floor 3 and 10 so I suppose a global issue for the hotel ,No Positive
457702,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A C not working in room although the machinery working for rest of hotel gave a constant noise through the night so it was not as peaceful as we would have liked or as cool No mini bar A second arm chair in the room would have been good or two same style chairs that would have enabled a room service meal for two have been comfortably enjoyed , Comfortable room and quite spacious Great view of Tower Bridge as booked Proximity to the Tower Pier for the River Bus which was the key to our trip to the Chelsea Flower Show Efficient and friendly reception staff 
457703,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Staff was back peddling on their word given to us, Hotel was nice Upset we had to be relocated to another lesser standard of a hotel due to the fact they didn t have our reservations listed for booking nights
457704,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was very small barely room for 2 of us to maneouvre around We managed to get on street parking otherwise it would have cost 20 pounds per day Amenities in bathroom very limited This could be a fantastic hotel but it just looks a little tired Staff at check in couldn t seem t, Amazing view very comfortable bed Great location Good shower 
457705,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, When I booked room I paid premium for tower bridge view The room had a massive tree blocking the view I also explained I booked this as a treat for my sister who had brain surgery and asked for champagne in the room on checkin there was none I did not complain at the time as I did not want to cause my sister any upset , The location was perfect
457706,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was very small There wasn t a single drawer in the room There was a chair that was far too big for the size of the room We found the room acceptable because the view was so good We had a breakfast in the Brasserie which was very nice but we didn t care for not having our own teapot We had a further breakfast on the gallery another day the food was good but it felt all rushed , The view was beautiful the best that we could have 
457707,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, It took more time than it should to check out We waited about 15 20 minutes in line to get to the desk Once there it was quick I think one more staff person would have facilitated things , I booked a room with a view of Tower Bridge and man the view did not disappoint The room was everything advertised and more The room faced the river and the bridge lit at night was breath taking The room was very clean and comfortable but that view really carried the day 
457708,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing, The service was first class from the minute we checked in I was delighted with the suite which was overlooking St Katherine s Dock The room was luxurious with all mod cons We will definitely come back to this hotel and recommend it to friends 
457709,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Although we upgraded from the last time we stayed the room was smaller with not such a good view of tower bridge , The upgrade facilities were very good eating breakfast and snacks in a private room was excellent 
457710,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room very small We were offered an upgrade for 6 00 extra Why not just upgrade people anyway We were on the 10th Floor Really hot and no air conditioning wouldnt like to be there in the summer it was unbearable Called for Room Service but was too late for hot chocolate does say 24 hour room service , Location Brilliant Bar lovely 
457711,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Air conditioning on room didn t appear to be working To warm at nights, Huge but homely hotel great location very friendly staff Top class all round facilities Highly recommended
457712,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Way too warm in places esp our room The air con just an old vent lightly blew out tepid air and we had to open the windows and get a fan I hate to think Whst it s like on a hot summer s night Very uncomfortable night s sleep because of this , Location was great the view of Tower Bridge the river and London was amazing the staff were super friendly and helpful and the ambience of the hotel was relaxed 
457713,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We were on the 10th floor and the rooms and the floor itself where boiling The fan system didnt work and the windows only opened very slightly so really didnt get any sleep it was very uncomfortable , Lovely staff great bar for a few evening drinks 
457714,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was tiny Double bed pushed right up againt the wall so couldnt get out of bed one side Had to climb across waking my husband Not good at all very dissapointed actually , Bright and clean great location
457715,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Shower rail was rusty some painwork looked like it could do with a re paint Rooms a little on the small side but perfect for short stays The view location more than made up for this , The view was spectacular the hotel was in a perfect location

457717,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, They did not have or could not find my booking information I had to sign onto Booking com to find it and a confirmation number in order to get a room Total check in time took 45 minutes, Beds nice room room upgrade to a view of the marina
457718,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room is quite dated the ironing board does not stand on its own so had to hold it to be able to iron our clothes There was no fridge there used to be in the room but was nailed and no mini bar is available now would have been nice to have cold drinking water without requesting for ice from room service The room was very warm too and the aircon does not work either We were only staying for one night and checked in late so no point to have our room changed , Bed and linens are very comfortable we got a bigger room than was booked and the room is very clean The hotel offers a really good night sleep albeit it is on the warmer side The location of the hotel offers great views in your room and from the breakfast table too of the Tower Bridge It is also near the Tower Hill tube station and cheap parking NCP Minories Car Park at weekends Staff are very friendly from the receptionists to the concierge 
457719,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in was slow and frustrating We arrived before our rooms we booked 2 were ready which was not a problem but the check in guy took our details anyway to speed up check in when we came back at the correct time When we came back they said we did not have a reservation No lift from the car park to reception Reception area a bit dated and needs decoration In one of our rooms the TV did not work and in spite of several phone calls nobody ever came to sort it In the other room the TV picture was terrible The outside of the building could be more attractive and would benefit from a good scrub , The location was perfect Car park easy to find and parking spaces a good size for an underground hotel car park Room excellent and comfortable Access to Executive Club lounge was a welcome bonus and free parking much appreciated Would stay again The girl supervisor in the club lounge at breakfast on the Sunday morning was extremely cheerful and helpful she is a credit to the hotel

457732,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast was rather busy lots of queuing involved , We stayed in quite a small room however the view of Tower Bridge more than compensated for its compact size 
457733,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Honestly the carpets weren t clean and the bathroom did have a few hairs The staff downstairs weren t helpful with booking a taxi and we had to wait 30minutes And our taxi was given to someone else , I asked for a river view and actually got one which was amazing at night And we got to the hotel 3 hours before check in and was able to go to the room 
457734,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, cleaning is not enough full of dust at room unfortunately and have seen a little insect at the bathroom sink last day the room was just against the staff room so that every five min their door was opened closed was a little disturbing, the view from the rooms wonderful 
457735,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, On a very hot day there was no air conditioning in our room For safety reasons the windows don t open fully to allow fresh air in , The Tower Hotel holds great family memories for me The location was perfect for my visit

457737,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Everything was brilliant plenty of choices for breakfast and in the restaurant Excellent views Staff were extremely helpful and friendly I would definitely recommend this hotel 
457738,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bed in the room should be other way around so you can look out at the view from the bed Not happy that our safe was broken and out of use Bathroom was scruffy and could do with a little more attention Should arrange time slots for breakfast to make queuing less and mad rush for breakfast, View was amazing and location Bed was really clean and comfy 
457739,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, I loved the location of the hotel right on the water front The staff was excellent food wonderful and the room was clean fluffy towels and comfortable beds I would go back to the same hotel 
457740,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Expensive breakfast , We upgraded our room for an extra 20 to have a view of Tower Bridge worth every penny Friendly staff who seem to speak many languages Great location 5 minute walk to the nearest tube station and then straight onto the circle line Able to leave baggage with concierge 
457741,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There was something nasty on the wall of our bedroom when we checked in we mentioned this to Reception and Housekeeping went straight to the room and cleaned it this was our only minor let down , The location is fabulous we had a view of St Katherine s Dock that was amazing We went out to the Theatre so did not eat in the Hotel but had drinks in the Brasserie and later in the Hotel Bar and the staff were very attentive and polite a great Hotel just wish we were there for longer 
457742,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Some of the rooms could do with modernising however this is purely cosmetic The room was really clean comfortable and functional , Great value for money and a brilliant location for exploring London 
457743,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Trying to get service from the waiters outside at The Brasserie was difficult , Firstly Jennifer checked us in and was so warm welcoming and very helpful Totally delighted with the view from our room overlooking Tower Bridge 
457744,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing Excellent location and comfortable hotel , Love the view of tower bridge and surrounding skyline especially at night well worth paying the extra for the view 
457745,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The location was excellent our view of Tower Bridge The Shard and The River Thames from our room was amazing day and night So along with a comfy bed we couldn t ask for anymore All the communal areas in the hotel were very clean and welcoming and the outside eateries were just perfect with a great selection of food and drink We ate Tapas at The Terrace in front of The Bridge and stayed all day The staff were all very polite and well mannered so all in all it was a great place to stay 
457746,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, In comparison to other local hotels at a similar or lower price the rooms are antiquated It seems you pay for the view which admittedly is stunning if your a re fortunate to get a room overlooking Tower Bridge Air conditioning is antiquated and not working heating only in both of the rooms I have recently stayed in Had to turn it off and open the windows Power sockets are limited Only one at the desk in both the rooms I have stayed in the other is on the wall under the window In the first room the socket was positioned so low to the desk that the moulded plug could not be inserted Poor show Unable to get receipt at checkout as my email address was stored as booking com even after I corrected it at check in as requested However if you use the express checkout and put your email address on the envelope you DO get a receipt Why , Location and ability to open windows If you get a room on the Tower Bridge side the view especially at night is stunning see photo from room Good breakfast at a reasonable price Basic no frills good food at a reasonable price in La Brasserie restaurant 
457747,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Night stand only in one side of the bed cannot think of anything else, Wonderful location with a stunning view of the Thames and Tower Bridge Convenient for public transportation tiny room a little bit aged but well kept 
457748,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Small room very hard to get to sleep because of noise from lifts and other guests Asked for the minibar to be refilled once in 4 days and it never happened as they were too busy , Club Lounge is very nice
457749,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I liked room eventually after like ng wait due to being told I had not booked room, Upgraded as told I had cancelled booking when I had not I was deeply distressed and did not enjoy London visit due to this
457750,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had upgraded to an executive room but room was very small Couldn t swing a cat in the bathroom and a big person would have found it difficult to sit on the toilet Room lighting was a mess with poor switch control , Inclusive free access to the in room drinks fridge was a nice touch Executive Lounge also provided a good continental breakfast and evening snacks
457751,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No receipt given at check in Room rather small even for one person and shabby Bathroom had very rusty and dirty sanitary ware Rooms definitely need a bit of TLC, Staff were excellent very welcoming View of the river and bridge from my room was outstanding Bed very comfy
457752,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, It would be nice if parking slots could be reserved as first come first served adds a little pressure after a long drive if the 80 slots are taken but on my visit mid March there was plenty of parking , Parking underneath the hotel was great given train problems Very friendly staff Club upgrade worthwhile and very nice cooked breakfast Always wanted to stay here terrific view of Tower Bridge Cannot fault this hotel or the people there 
457753,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel is showing its age especially in the bedrooms but this is more than made up for by the views A shame there is no lift to and from the carpark just a steep staircase to reception , the car parking beneath the hotel made an overnight stay much less strssful than using public transport The location next to the Tower and wonderful view from our room Excellent and very well priced breakfast Courteous and friendly staff 
457754,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Didn t have our booking when we arrived not sure if that there fault or booking com but wasn t happy with the delay , Good location for what we wanted set along the river Thames next to the Tower of London Nice bar that stays open late quite room bed comfortable parking which is handy however over priced

457759,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Satff during breakfast was not so polite Breakfast needs improvement no peanut butter available and when we asked we received the answer that no we don t have this here , Nice view and convenient location near attractions and sub
457760,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Considering the amount of money I paid the room didnt exceed the excitement when walking in the room the light behind the bed was hanging off the wall and also the room was very small considering i paid over 120 for the room it was the same size of a travelodge room also considering the amount of money I paid there was no breakfast included , I liked the entrance to hotel it was grand Also enjoyed the view from the hotel room 
457761,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I think there should be more options for breakfast as there is a set price of 12 which includes everything Very good unless you just want a light breakfast then there is no option ,No Positive
457762,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was small near the lift and not a double room size the lift was noisy and even with the deal the room was a rip off the shower was poor and the room was tired the view was meaningless The lift took 5 minutes and when it came it was packed we and many other guests walked 7 floors down and one gust was disabled It was a disgrace This happened on both occasions one lift of 4 didn t seem to work another was permanently sat at floor 10 the executive rooms and that left 2 lifts The management know this which forced guests into the fire escape to get to reception I m not happy with booking com never mind the hotel We expressed our views at check out We will never stay again and I m putting a fanning review on trip advisor Room 709 is a single room NOT a Double , The room was warm
457763,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We did not like waiting for a lift at peak times but having said that we did not make use of the alternative lifts available at the hotel , The room was spacious enough for our needs and well equipped with ironing board iron hairdryer and flat screen t v as well as bathing robes and slippers toiletries and tea coffee making facilities The hotel had free wifi and there was also free car parking with executive rooms The view of the yachts from our room was pleasant and we were given the option of paying 10 extra per room to have a view of the bridge We did not choose breakfast included in the cost of the room when we initially booked the rooms but were happy to pay 12 per breakfast during our stay as there was so much choice between continental and english breakfast items served buffet style and tea coffee brought to the table All staff were friendly and polite The bar on the floor above reception was spacious and well stocked We originally chose the hotel because it was within walking distance of Tower bridge The Shard and the Tower of London the 3 things we wanted to visit Although we checked out of the hotel at 12 noon on our final day we were allowed to leave the car in the hotel car park until we left London at 3pm
457764,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, outrageous phone charges no coffee maker in room hard to adjust the heating be aware after 7pm you can t eat in the area, excellent wifi good value for breakfast
457765,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast was shockingly poor for a hotel like this I expected better service food and cleanliness it was just a free for all Not impressed at all , Hotel was great got an upgrade too but room was very small as was the bathroom Still nice though 
457766,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Cant think of anything I didn t like it took me a while to figure out the shower but apart from that I loved it that much I d definitely stay again, I loved the location the bathroom the storage in the room the politeness of the staff and the helpfulness of the consierge
457767,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Such a beautiful room comfy bed the only thing was we were in room 161 on first floor would like to have been on the second floor and above as we were overlooking the roof

457772,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, They couldn t find my reservation when I got to the hotel also the bed was a double and the bed was 2 mattresses joined together which I wasn t pleased about for the money I paid, Breakfast was really good value
457773,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Sometimes we had to wait quite a long time for the lift when waiting to go down , The location and view was superb overlooking St Katerines Dock We took some champagne to drink in our room as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary but were told that we were welcome to drink this in the lobby and they provided the glasses 
457774,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing , The location is 2nd to none St Katherine Docks at the back door and Tower Bridge and the restaurant square to the front door Tour Bus stops right by 
457775,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Perhaps cheaper haha No the location is perfect and I have no complaints whatsoever , Bridge view room was worth the extra money Breakfast was fantastic Staff all attentive Excellent concierge service 
457776,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel has a lot of carpeting and therefore some dust in the air although we found it otherwise very clean The room starts to show signs of its age , Exactly what I was expecting Great view over Tower Bridge paid extra to get that view Great location for our needs Tower Hill Station and DLR closeby Very confortable bed Restaurants coffee places and supermarket closeby
457777,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Given the location it can be a bit busy when walking to and from the hotel which can be a little irritating at times I think the hotel could do a little more to provide luxury rather than just depending on location e g provide robes and slippers better quality coffee and tea facilities in the room and luxury toiletries in the bathroom , The location of the hotel boasts iconic views I especially love Tower Bridge at night St Katherine s Dock is a lovely spot with lots of nice places to eat and a really nice feel For a large central hotel it is surprisingly quiet and calm 
457778,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Only a minor niggle but couldn t get the air con to work properly as the room was quite warm So just opened the windows , Good sized room with excellent view of tower bridge Can t comment on the food as we didn t eat at the hotel room only Excellent location and would definitely stay there again 
457779,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The decor in the bedrooom was a little tired , The view of Tower Bridge was excellent Very close to Tower Hill tube making it a great base for exploring London 
457780,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The first room we were allocated was extremely small and as I am partially disabled was difficult to get around We were given a complementary upgrade to a family room with a stunning view over the bridge however the room itself was dark old fashioned and looked like it hadn t been decorated since the 1970s Room selection is very important at this hotel as they are far from standard , Excellent location and staff were friendly and helpful Public areas are very well decorated and spacious with some great views over the bridge and marina 
457781,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A different range of pillows they were all too hard so I didn t sleep well , Being in such a central location and being able to upgrade to an executive room 
457782,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, N A, We came for my husbands birthday which was a suprise for him Staff were friendly and great for giving us a bridge view without paying extra hotel room was comfortable the room was small but cosy the bathroom had underfloor heating and a speaker which was hooked up to the tv very clean room great facilities could not fault our stay Some people said rooms need updating our room was quite modern breakfast were delicious hot plates and hot and cold food buffet plenty to choose from lovely view of the tower bridge attentive staff overall had a lovely great stay my husband enjoyed it very much and said he would definitely return to the same hotel At the back of hotel they had some lovely eateries too
457783,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I contacted the hotel to request i pay for the room before we arrived i was informed that i was unable to pay before arrival by reservations then told that i would need to fill out a 3rd party form to enable them to take payment as they could not do this over the telephone AND FINALLY when they had received this form the reservations team member was unable to take the payment as their system did not allow customer not present payments This nightmare went back and forth for 3 days before i finally gave up and paid on arrival When checking in i requested at the front desk to make a full payment and any further charges would be paid when we checked out The receptionist took full payment for both rooms for the full 2 nights Only when we checked out i was informed that this was only AUTHERISED and that the full payment of 2 rooms for 2 nights the balance i had previously paid was due After a brief conversation with the manager he confirmed that a full payment had been autherised and would be completed upon check out Apparently this is a regular mis communication between reception staff and guests So i would be aware that if you are requesting to pay on arrival you will be stunned into silence when they request you pay the full amount AGAIN upon departure , we informed staff that we where staying for my partners fathers 63rd birthday they very kindly left 1 bottle of wine and 1 prosecco in the room with a hand written card such a lovely touch 
457784,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Coming home , Everything Very clean staff very helpful and polite Food excellent View from room of tower bridge was amazing Can t wait to come back

457786,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Above, Didn t have food at all Brilliant view from the window Not enough people working on reception That was the poorest thing Very friendly bar and wonderful location 
457787,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, poor reception service staff being trained but not supervised loose towel rail in bathroom poor lighting partner couldnt see to do make up no bedside cabinet on one side heating didnt work TV quality poor room very small and looked tired partner couldnt turn shower on or off as knob to big and stiff fridge bot very cool wardrobe lights stayed on when doors closed and we like total darkness to sleep when checking out just told to put key cards in slot and not asked how our stay had been poor bar facility , location

457789,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bar closed earlier than stated Poor wifi connection at times The hot tap took a long time to run hot in the bathroom Felt I was wasting water , The view from the room Water in room The hotel was very nice overall The porters were very helpful and friendly Good choice at breakfast and well cooked 
457790,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only downside to the hotel room was the lack of channels on the tv reception wasn t that great for late night viewing , Very clean helpful staff
457791,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Staff in the first floor breakfast room were a bit glum , Given that this hotel is not in the city it s location is great Wonderful views great restaurants nearby and it s not in the Congestion Zone Also they have on site parking although there is plenty nearby 
457792,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Trying to locate the hotel from the road was tricky sat nav mislead us Fridge in room was locked so we could not store our own food , comfy beds windows open slightly for fresh air clean room views of the thames

457794,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Paid 200 deposit for incidentals which is taken off credit card even if there is no spending in hotel then you wait for refund to go through a few days later Most hotels just keep imprint of credit card , Fantastic location and comfortable stay even though our room was small 
457795,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I was rudely asked not to help myself to alcoholic beverages from the fridge in the executive lounge at 4 50pm as this was not allowed until 5pm and my actions would cause others to want a drink early I apologised that I hadn t realised is was not yet 5pm as 1 the gentleman opposite me had a bottle of beer and 2 the fridge was not locked otherwise how would I have got the bottle out The waiter clearly unimpressed walked away to check the fridge obviously finding it to indeed be unlocked He then reluctantly appogised explaining that he would allow me to keep my drink as a member of staff not him must have opened it For my remaining time in the lounge this waiter did not come back to my table and walked around looking clearly annoyed Which I found a little rude and silly Also the following morning the information stated muffins cookies and fruit would be available in the lounge from 11 2pm When I left the lounge at 11 30 these were yet to seen After my experience the previous night I didn t dare to ask the waiter , Amazing location with beautiful views of Tower Bridge and St Catherine s Docks The exclusive club lounge had a great selection of drinks and refreshments on offer Check in was a breeze even on a busy Saturday afternoon The bed was amazing I did not want to get up Our executive twin room was clean and very well equipped The complimentary mini bar and coffee machine was a great touch 
457796,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, seemed only 2 lifts ever worked , bed excellent tidiness good staff excellent breakfast good enjoyed sitting in the bar in the evening looking at the view 
457797,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bar was very busy later on Saturday evening get there early if you want a seat near the window to view the Thames all lit up at night , The hotel has a lovely aroma when you arrive which is very relaxing The staff are friendly and informative The beds were so comfortable too and our shower was powerful without being forceful A very pleasant couple of nights in a smashing hotel we ll definitely use it again 
457798,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The price but it s London , Location and quality of room Difficult to say more as we just slept there and did not use any of the facilities beyond the room preferring to eat and drink out It merited it s 4 star rating and we would not hesitate to stay again at the right price 
457799,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel suffers from poor exterior architecture and needs renovation to the bedrooms It was built in 1975 and needs a facelift , The wonderful view from our room and from the bar on the first floor
457800,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Maybe the option to have basic food options toasties paninis etc , Stayed here before Fantastic hotel prime location really good facilities with helpful and friendly staff 
457801,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Shower was poor head room water pressure and scratched bath complimentary mini bar contained bare minimum room was smaller than expected for a suite and views were slightly blocked by side of hotel when bridge view was highlighted as highest importance , The hotel itself inside was nice and facilities such the exec lounge were good 
457802,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The breakfast set up was too manic no hot drinks station or good continuity with the food counters bit like being in a market , Location and reasonably priced breakfast
457803,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bath was dirty Room was so hot could barely sleep air conditioning didn t work only blasted hot air bed was like sleeping on a rock , The view was good and the staff were great 
457804,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, You managed to charge us for breakfast when it had been paid for by my friends which turned out a little embarrassing I m sure you will sort it out with them , Most everything 
457805,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Pillows were uncomfy but that s just personal pickiness And the shower head was slightly low 6ft2in and have to stoop in most hotel bathrooms , Friendly staff quick check in quiet room with fantastic view Superb room service fast and delicious Room was well appointed and clean and surprisingly roomy given it s location 
457806,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I arrived during the day as is common on a business visit The hotel refused to release any rooms for checkin until 3pm This was very inflexible and completely unnecessary as many rooms would have been cleaned throughout the morning I was very dissatisfied with this ,No Positive
457807,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was clean but badly in need of an update Cracks in the hand basin furniture badly marked The toilet needed bleaching , We didn t manage to get into breakfast e tried twice the queues were to long Only one breakfast room available although it did say there would be two Bed very comfy

457810,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There was no fridge in the room You can see there used to be one but it s been removed and blanked out TV was and old standard definition unit but the quality of the picture was worse than a good standard def , This is an excellent hotel for visiting London with family There was plenty of room around the hotel and in the bed room it s self 269 with view of Tower Bridge for my daughter s pram as well as all of the shopping and luggage me and my wife had The staff were very helpful but happy and relaxed with it so never felt forced Also there was a permanent rank of black cabs waiting at the hotel Helpful when you are travelling with a toddler in a pram Incredible views too Recommended 
457811,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A bit close to the lifts so slightly disburbed by lift voice TV was on a rather low table so not a good viewable angle Few easy access power sockets had to unplug phone charger to boil kettle Minor issues only really , The bed was very comfortable The bathroom was well presented and clean hot water was almost instant Despite not being a bridge view the view from the large windows was still very good Checkin out was smooth and the staff friendly 
457812,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bar area was so full that we couldnt get in In my mind this means that it is too small for the hotel , The room was lovely and our room overlooked St Katharines Docks which was beautufully decorated with Christmas decorations and lights

457838,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The view and location are fantastic but that s already been covered by everyone else What I wanted to highlight was the receptionists who were extremely nice My friend and I had three different bookings for 7 days These were three different types of rooms When we got there I checked if they can arrange just one room for us so we don t have to move to different rooms during our stay I knew the rooms had different rates but they gave us a fantastic twin room with a nice view The lady at the check in counter was very accommodating If I ever go back to London I would definitely stay there again 
457839,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Great view from our room breakfast was good standard for food Staff were efficient but could smile more Arrival reception was very lovely and really went the extra mile Room was extreamly small and small bed but view was great Room was ok for one night but I wouldn t of been able to do a longer stay

457846,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Work was being done on the bridge just outside the room noise of hammer drills woke us up early in the morning the tea coffee facilities were not out upon arrival had to ask staff where they were they were packed away in the draws The standard double rooms are a little on the small side No wine in room as requested as this was mums birthday treat but it did eventually turn up about 5pm Staff asked how was stay when said about the noise distribution no comment was given back , Rooms were clean and hotel is in a great location 
457847,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I was in a room on the 10th floor and despite this being designated a no smoking floor it stank heavily of smoke including in my room not great and would put me off in future, location was good for my meetings
457848,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only reason I rated comfort a little on the low side was the bed was small I am used to a king, Great location and staff were so good its was as if they really wanted you to be happy The guy seating us at breakfast was so apologetic because there was a que and we only waited a few minutes 
457849,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was tiny and severely overlooked by others located in corner directly opposite lift Requested breakfast in room just wish it could have been a little warmer but it did save the horrific breakfast queues , Comfy bed
457850,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The Brassiere The service was poor Our individual waiter was apologetic and polite but still did not provide good service We had to ask for ketchup 5 times and by the time it arrived the french fries were cold He got another order but by this time the meal was over One person got their meal 10 minutes ahead of everyone else We asked for 2 checks and we did not get that The checks were re worked however they were incorrect and charged only to the other couple so I had to settle up with them Inconvenient , The location was in walking distance to many great restaurants

457852,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The tube station was a bit of an up and down walk away and a longish distance from the hotel and we got quite wet when the rain came down , Great view from our bedroom and handy for our requirements over the weekend Very helpful staff 
457853,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Very small room didn t have feeling of space However it was fine for an overnight stay or 1 person for a longer period , Practical functional room with good facilities Good value for money 
457854,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Felt the room which we had been given was pretty poor no side table on one side of the bed so had to put belongings on the floor also no side lamp either side of the bed but then had excessive amounts of lighting round the dressing table booked this hotel as a treat for me and my partner as I was proposing that weekend and the room left us both feeling like you get a far better room from a premier inn type company also good view from the room but the room next to us could see straight into our room from there window so kept the curtains drawn , Location was perfect and exactly as expressed in the advert for the hotel the food in the restaurant was good and the staff all friendly

457861,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No complaints , We have stayed at The Tower on numerous occasions and always have found the overall standards to be extremely good The position is excellent as is the car park We shall continue to return 
457862,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, As we didn t register a card at reception when we had room service and breakfast we had to pay cash then and there which kind of made it feel like I was ordering a cheap takeaway would have been nicer if they could of just charged it to the room , The bed was super comfy great bed linen The room was nicely decorated the view of the river was amazing Superb service a lovely card put in our room to wish us happy anniversary with a bottle of wine Great breakfast too Location was fantastic

457869,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was stiflingly hot this is November so I d hate to be staying there in summer Window only opened a couple of inches and air con was blowing hot air in so it made for a sleepless night Room very dated with peeling wallpaper and cracked tiles in the bathroom For just under 200 a night I d go elsewhere , Good location great views Nice bar area 
457870,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Television reception was awful no mini bar and fridge did not appear to work Only 2 of 4 lifts appeared to be working meaning long queues when leaving Bathroom was cramped , Grest location and friendly staff but poor facilities

457872,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing It was a very good experience Two guests said that they had been quoted 60 each way for a taxi to Regents Park This is very expensive and much cheaper by hiring one away from the hotel on the road , Lovely room and a spectacular view Very comfortable and well appointed Excellent value Breakfast was great Would recommend and stay again 
457873,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I am unable to point to anything that in my opinion deserve comments because for the money that would be nitpicking which does not reflect on the overall quality of, As said in the survey location fab and the service was excellent

457877,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I could hear the upstairs neighbors until all hours and had to be up early for a conference , I loved the location Right next to Tower Bridge and Tower of London you can t beat that Only a quick and cheap cab ride from Liverpool tain station 
457878,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The breakfast allocation was a little confusing with apparently two types of breakfast booking and the lifts were a little slow to arrive after over 5 mins of waiting we used the stairs from the 5th floor , The hotel was well located next to Tower Bridge and a short walk from the course I was attending 
457879,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Duvet too thick and pillows too hard personal choice The room was rather hot and the air con made little difference but not a deal breaker , Friendly staff convenience to Tower Bridge and river area We enjoyed the upgrade room with river view and club lounge facilities which were added at a very reasonable cost 
457880,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Booked and paid extra for a tower bridge view room only to find a ruddy great tree outside obscuring the view no more tower view rooms available , Moved rooms but no view of bridge disappointing but didn t let it spoil our break other than the above the rest of the hotel stay was spot on

457886,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Queue for checking in was rediculously long and very very slow yet no extra staff were bought on and in fact when a further staff member appeared an existing one left Utterly rediculous , Location
457887,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The shower was a hand held one on a bracket The showerhead fitted on the wall did not work which was a bit difficult to manage I think this could be because I had a smaller double room , Staff were really helpful friendly I was here on my own they looked after me really well I ate in the Brasserie which I d recommend especially if you are travelling for business it s relaxed enough to eat alone reasonably priced The hotel itself has lovely views is located next to Tower Bridge the rooms are spotless and comfortable

457890,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Staff did not allow me to check in until almost 1am due to an issue that occurred during payment 1 month previously which I wasn t told about Room service was cancelled for the evening I stayed and generally the service was appalling a real shame for a hotel with a great location , The location is perfect 
457891,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, To be honest the furniture and the bath room is very old No fridges no new shoes to change and no bath robe and no hairdryer This price of room is very bad for 336 per night , Only view 
457892,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lifts were very slow but a small price to pay for a lovely stay in a lovely hotel, The view over the Thames was brilliant and will go back just for that alone The rooms are just right for a long weekend and its close enough to everything you want to do in London
457893,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Seems like a place that s seen better days and needs renovation Poor quality TV channels no power outlet anywhere near the bed current floor indicators in elevators were broken The hotel also required a 150 GBP deposit in order to use room service which seemed quite excessive to me for a 20 GBP burger , Big rooms friendly staff nice location good water pressure 
457894,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was on the small side but had a fab view and was otherwise perfect , Fab location right next to tower bridge 5min walk to nearest tube station and across the river is butlers wharf with lots of restaurants and bars Stayed for my boyfriends birthday and got upgraded to a tower view room which was amazing

457901,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Wonderful central hotel Rooms small but adequate clean and well maintained I stayed with a group of 9 family members we were all located on the same floor and all rooms had either a view of Tower Bridge or St Katherine Dock The only slight negative point was the slowness of the lifts A great place to stay if you are in London for a short break 
457902,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The beds could have softer Could have been quicker booking in instead of queuing, Very close to tower bridge Tower of London Location not so good for west end Lovely staff Upgrade well worth the money Would use again
457903,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The breakfast service wasn t great empty sauce bottles empty juice bottles staff clearing the table while you re still eating and leaning right across you had to wait some time for tea and coffee and had to go and find someone eventually , Good location comfortable room with wonderful view of Tower Bridge

457909,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, As before mentioned a King Size bed would have been nice but is hardly a complaint , The room was excellent and very clean Our room was River View so we expected a decent bed and were not disappointed The only improvement would have been a King Size bed but I realise the space is limited The bathing facilities are also top class and very clean The location is 1st class as St Katherine Docks and the surrounding area are all of a superior standard We have stayed with you several times and it has always been a pleasurable experience The staff are all very helpful and efficient and made our time with you a delight 
457910,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Awful customer service at check in told we didn t have a reservation Also claimed we hadn t booked paid for breakfast Afternoon tea reservation wasn t put in the diary so no booking for that either Disgraceful service entire stay ,No Positive

457914,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I find checking in out a little slow and rather confusing When I checked in I was told the total price of the three rooms I had booked and then entered my pin number into the card machine and so presumed I had completed the necessary payment process but then when I checked out I found out that I had only paid for one of the rooms and then had to make two more separate payments for each of the other two rooms it was difficult to understand what the receptionist was trying to explain and she felt it necessary to ask her manager to help , I love the location of the hotel and the view from my room St Katherine s Dock and the view from the Xi Bar with the Bridge lit up 
457915,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was too small for a double it seemed to be a single room with a double bed squeezed in additionally ithad not been renovated for many years very old appliances and furniture etc , The location was excellent with fantastic views of Tower Bridge

457919,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing that we didn t like Only tiny improvement could have been some herbal teas in the bedroom but absolutely nothing else , From the moment we arrived we were met and dealt with from friendly professional helpful staff The beds were fab the view was amazing the breakfast had a great selection 
457920,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Due to the poor wet evening we ate in the Brasserie which was very disappointing No atmosphere rather clinical atmosphere and not very warm due to draughts from the air con , the stunning panoramic view from our 5th floor room overlooking Tower Bridge The breakfasts in the 5th floor club

457924,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had access to executive lounge but found they run out of everything if you don t get in there early including cups spoons etc , Reception staff very helpful and friendly Clean and comfortable
457925,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I had booked a suite as I was proposing to my girlfriend and wanted something special with an amazing view only to have to keep the curtains shut as the suite next door could look directly into our room We had no privacy and didn t appreciate seeing an elderly lady naked from the waist up in the morning,No Positive
457926,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Receptionist tried to sell upgrade when checking in inferring I had an inferior room when I thought I had paid for a 250 plus room which was discounted down to 108 without breakfast, location

457930,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, It s the perfect place to stay if you want to be out of the hubbub of the city but still be a part of it Great views over the Thames and Tower Bridge and a morning s wander around St Katherine s Dock is a bonus 
457931,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Horrendous problem when 1 booking of four wasn t found we signed in showed bank statement to prove pre payment of room but you still text me twice on leaving to ask me why we didn t show And recharged us even though you were shown bank payment We have not had any apology since from you regarding this spoilt wedding anniversary trip , lovely views across the river and of the bridge
457932,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was very small and when you looked out of the window you looked directly into the window of another room The facilities in the room were also incredibly dated We reserved this room on a booking com deal however had we paid full price I would have been even more disappointed , The location of the hotel was great and the staff were very friendly 
457933,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The air con could have been better , Very welcoming attentive members of staff We we re able to leave our luggage at the hotel free of charge even though our stay had come to an end this gave us extra time to enjoy more of London

457935,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing everything was wonderful , Lovely hotel wonderful view of Tower Bridge from our room and a lovely birthday surprise sent to our room chocolates wine and birthday card Love this place we will be back 
457936,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We didn t not like anything but if I had to say one thing maybe the bed could of been a bit bigger and more than one shower gel for two people, We liked the view from the room and location
457937,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The pervasive smell of cheap aftershave everywhere in the hotel though fortunately not in our room Did they test this scent on a large enough sample of their customers And is this really what they liked best , Everything you expect from a hotel friendly staff clean and comfortable room no noise problems walking distance from bars and restaurants nice neighbourhood As a bonus the view on the bridge is definitely worth the higher room price 
457938,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bookings com I bought this night s stay for my daughter and son in law as an anniversary present I assumed I had paid for it as I was asked my credit card details The hotel asked them for their credit card details as a security and then took the price of the room from their account Thoroughly spoiled the experience for them ,No Positive
457939,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing, The staff where really helpful from booking early we left our bags at the hotel when the room was ready they brought our bag to the room the hotel was clean taxis parked outside the hotel which was helpful as one day it rained heavy and we had booked to go elsewhere would definetley stay again
457940,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic bed and pillows The view over St Katherine s dock felt like we were in a small town not busy London but we were in very easy reach of everything we wanted to see and do 
457941,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The rooms while very comfortable were quite small and air conditioning not as efficient as it could have been , Location the friendly staff and lovely open entrance space Didn t eat there as some reviews were not great but the space looked very stylish The exterior of the building is a bit of an ugly duckling but so very much nicer inside It really is the location that is so special literally at the foot of Tower Bridge next to the Tower of London and with St Katherine s dock just behind with loads of restaurant and bars to choose from Really recommend it 
457942,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The view from the window of Tower Bridge day and night was just great lovely breakfast overlooking St Katherine s Docks friendly staff what more do you want 
457943,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only downside we found was that when you eat in the brasseri they add an automatic 12 5 service charge on regardless of whether you have had service over and above As the prices of on a par for this type of hotel it can add upto quite a lot so need to be aware when checking bills , On finding out that we were there to celebrate a significant anniversary we were upgraded The upgrade just made our weekend so special and the staff were so friendly The location of the hotel is fab being right at the side of the tower of London and tower bridge There is also a marina to the rear of the hotel with some fab bars and eateries

457947,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We were offered a river view room and as we had stayed in the marina view before we opted for that Room was right at the end of the corridor and therefore had a view of a brick wall and just a little of the river a little disappointed also had the noise of some sort of generator all night, This was our second stay within a few weeks and the reception person actually said welcome back Rooms nice for what you need i e only staying overnight so perfect
457948,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, An extra day s stay , The view of my wife s favourite tower was perfect Booking an executive room was worth every penny The staff especially Ferdinando excellent 
457949,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bathroom was a little run down and in need of refurbishment The breakfast hostess whose English was not easy to understand was brusque rude and aggressive We arrived a couple of minutes before ten o clock when service ends and she was clearly not happy to accept us I had to remind her that we were still in time and she reluctantly allowed us in Some other guests at a nearby table cast us a look of desperation and later remarked on how unpleasant she had been to them too , Perfect location The view was stunning to see Tower Bridge from the very comfortable bed was wonderful Reception and housekeeping staff were very pleasant and highly efficient 
457950,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Manager was very kind bottle of wine in room to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary and complimentary breakfasts included it was also my birthday same day 6 8 16 great weekend

457952,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Dining room for breakfast extremely busy some inexperienced staff and non English speaking at times Replenishment of food could be better guests sometimes had to wait for more food , Concierge staff outstandingly helpful very knowledgeable and efficient Reception staff mostly non UK staff and understanding of English could be better nevertheless still very helpful and informative Rooms very comfortable with outstanding view of Tower Bridge and the Thames 
457953,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Our room with a view of the bridge was only if you looked left but as we got a special deal on price and we only stayed one night it didn t bother us that much Truthfully it was a view of the air conditioning unit with the bridge thrown in Room 133 , The location right next to The Tower of London and Tower Pier was excellent The breakfast was good Reception staff very welcoming and friendly 
457954,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, nothing everything was great , I stay at this hotel every time we stay in London at least 5 times a year for a couple of days at a time it is ideally situated next to Tower Bridge the staff are always very friendly and helpful rooms are clean and comfortable excellent Hotel 
457955,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Temperature controls in the meeting rooms Either too hot or too cold , Made provisions to allow me to use the stairs and placed me on 1st floor as I can t use lifts
457956,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The customer service was not good In particular restaurant and bar staff Long waiting times to be served or staff completely ignoring you Not the expected level of attention in a hotel of that quality and price , The location was excellent if you paid extra for a view 
457957,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room we had 874 was very tired and in desperate need of redecorating The air con was ineffective Breakfast was chaotic and not well organised We were moved 3 times , The view from the room
457958,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The wifi resets every time your screen switches off so you have to redo it quite often , The view over the river is stunning especially at night and the location is wonderful Breakfast was lovely Every one of the staff is so friendly and helpful and really contributed to our enjoyment

457960,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The rooms were a little too small for 3 people , The location was perfect The room had a view of London Bridge which was spectacular The hotel was clean and the beds were comfy 
457961,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Although my room was good value with a great view It s decor was tired and the carpet was grubby and needed cleaning , Excellent location with friendly and helpful staff 
457962,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The air conditioning in the room was poor albeit it was a particularly hot evening I still would have expected better from a quality hotel, The fact the hotel recognised immediately our concern about the room temperature and arranged a desk fan to help cool the room which was much appreciated
457963,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room quite small Booked for my friends special Birthday but no mention made in room or by reception staff I decorated the room to mark the occasion , Comfy bed and clean room Location perfect for exploring London 
457964,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The check in desk was very chaotic and the staff didn t seem to know what they were doing Long queues for the lifts , The view of the river and Tower bridge us spectacular 
457965,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Faultless really Another biscuit might have been nice though , Everything was pefect liked everything except for check in which was long and slow but probably due to the Clipper Racers returning to St Kathryns 
457966,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No criticism, Great room Amazing view of Tower Bridge Birthday card wine and macaroons in room I was impressed Top notch to the Tower Team Thank you
457967,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bar was shut from 1 00 a m even to residents which was a real shame when you have headed back to your hotel for a final nightcap Who gets in before 1 on a night out in Town , Taken in isolation the external impression of the hotel is not as impressive as many other locations in London however inside it is great the location is fabulous and the proximity of all of the other astounding architecture completely changes your impression Great place to use as a base camp for exploring north and south of the river with the added benefit of all the other activities going on around St Katherine s Dock
457968,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in process was abysmal Did not expect to arrive at hotel and to have to queue from outside the front door Took half an hour to be seen and then at that point the member of staff on reception told us that our room had been cancelled we had certainly not cancelled it it took her several attempts to sort it out and despite us asking to see a manager we re still waiting perhaps a manager intends to call and visit us at our home address The experience of having to queue for 20 minutes in order to get our breakfast was not particularly inspiring either at check in we had been advised that there would be two restaurants open for breakfast as the hotel was obviously busy and seemingly unable to cope with so many guests it seemed that they were hosting a staff event for Top Shop Top Man but in the end there was only one restaurant open and it was chaotic This along with the check in experience left a poor impression of the hotel , Bed was very comfy views from the room were spectacular good location for underground etc 
457969,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Vegetarian sausages at breakfast maybe tomatoes mushroom , Breakfast was wonderful and fresh croissant fruit coffee scrambled egg smoked salmon fantastic choice
457970,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was clean towels changed regularly but room could have been bigger , Brilliant views from the room Bed was really luxurious Staff were professional helpful and friendly Lots of choice at breakfast and system was well organised even though it was very busy

457972,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room service didn t do pizza all night Who doesn t love pizza, Great service and great location Stunning views and extremely good value for money Upgraded stay when arrived and was worth every penny Look forward to returning and would definitely recommend it 
457973,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing, Only used the hotel as an overnight stay but would definitely use it again We were on a budget but we did not feel like it when we arrived The room was more than an adequate for 1 night and everything worked All staff were very polite and helpful
457974,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in was chaotic We never came into the hotel without encountering a waiting line The evening we arrived there seemed to be issues with lots of booking as people were complaining about wrong room assignments all around us In the middle of it all we were informed that the Bridge view room we had paid for was not available and we were offered a Twin We refused as we wanted a double and eventually they got us a standard double room We were then offered a complimentary upgrade to an Executive Bridge room for our 2nd night which was most welcome In fairness the view from the standard room out over the docks behind the hotel was lovely The 2nd night in the exec room was really great and the club lounge was a very nice touch But overall they really need to work on their front desk operations staff were lovely but too often there wasn t enough of them available I saw many guests getting irate and demanding more staff be brought out to alleviate the Queues , Best location in London Right at foot of Tower Bridge and Tower of London and with St Katherine s Docks behind it we were spoiled for choices of restaurants shops bars and things to do A hopper pas for Big Bus Tours gave us freedom to use the stop at tower of London as a commuter service to downtown lor we could just walk out of our hotel and take the boat instead if we chose At the front entrance on the river is a lawn area with food trucks and a bar with lots of seating all around a perfect spot to watch London go by whilst sipping a cocktail and eating pizza or traditional English fare 
457975,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A bit of a shame to complain but the room was a little cramped not enough room for two bedside tables Surprised that the bar shut at 12 30 even though there were quite a few people still in it , One of the best hotels we ve stayed in in London Perfect location with great views of the docks from our room and Tower Bridge from the bar Plenty of bars and restaurants nearby Hotel immaculate and staff very attentive Would highly recommend We paid 112 00 for a Saturday night considering the luxury of the hotel and surroundings you couldn t do better 
457976,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing , Fabulous views took a 20 upgrade to a bridge view room and it was worth every penny Breathtaking view of Tower Bridge and surrounding buildings See day night pic Room was spacious we had two rooms one had a double bed one had a Kingsize Full size bath and great shower in each Wide screen tv Staff were excellent super friendly and keen to help Breakfast was 12 a head payable at the time Excellent selection of baked goods cereals fruit cooked meats plus full English and omelettes cooked to order 
457977,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Great location Fantastic price and even a complimentary bottle of wine for my wife s birthday Would highly recommend to anyone staying in london
457978,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No water in executive room as mini bar not stocked until 2nd night but with an executive room should be in there anyway plus tried to check in at 3 30 pm and room not ready not good enough, Location and bar on riverfront great vibe
457979,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The English of the waiting staff caused quite a bit of confusion at times however the reception staff couldn t be faulted And although off duty the large group of staff around the end of the bar meant that we went without a seat , Great room for the price worth paying that little bit more for a view of the bridge 
457980,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The cleaner coming in to the room before I could answer the door I was stood there in my pants, The whole trip was great The hotel is in a good spot for London next to the river 
457981,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Food in the Hotel was not particularly good value and really quite a limited menu Do not like tips automatically put on the bill, Liked the fact that there was a safe and ironing board and excellent view
457982,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The toilet had been used before we got into the room and not flushed , The view over London Bridge was amazing we got to see the opening of the bridge and watch the world go by The temperature of the room was perfect Beds were comfortable Tea and coffee facilities were well stocked Great selection of tv channels Free excellent wifi during our stay helped to keep my teenager occupied Safe was useful and the check out time was perfect Location was on point Restaurants on site were perfect and the little tesco was perfect and almost on site for the toothbrushes that we had forgotten All reception and concierge staff were impeccable Thank you so much best hotel I ve ever stayed in 
457983,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was small you couldn t get down side of bed to get in without moving it to an angle Air conditioning didn t work Price of drinks was extortionate , We liked the location brilliant for River Clipper
457984,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, My partner and I went to have a meal in the hotel restaurant we were told to take a seat by a member of bar staff we sat and wait 15 mins as the waitress walked pasted us a few times My partner walk to the bar to ask for menu s the bar staff told us to take a seat again After a further 20 minutes I asked the waitress for a menu she handed it to me and didn t even look or make any contact with me We sat and look at the menu and decided what we wanted to eat after another 20 mins no body had even attempted to take our order or even make contact with us Such a shame to that happen , Beautiful view beautiful room comfortable bed and seating in room Plenty hot water for baths showers etc 2 min walk to tube station 20 secs form a shop 
457985,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The curtains were hanging off the rail I had to keep ringing up everyday for a breakfast in your room menu Apparently the staff are supposed to leave one each day but they didn t and I stayed for three nights , The room service was reliable Location was excellent Food was good 
457986,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel is itself not the best looking outside although nice inside , Location is brilliant next to the Thames tube stations restaurants bars Also Katherine s dock is a peaceful relaxing haven from the hustle bustle of London View from our room across Tower Bridge the Shard was simply breathtaking Room was clean roomy Food was excellent We only used it as a base but it was everything we could have wanted 
457987,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast lacked variety and was over priced for both the quality and lack of choices The hotel is isolated and difficult to reach plus far from venues we would like as tourists Choices for eating are very limited both with quality and variety Hotel itself was so skimpy on just little things like the soap barely large enough for one shower , not much Wake up calls were on time 
457988,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The views from the rooms were fabulous The X1 bar area overlooking Tower Bridge especially at night was incredible The standard double bedroom was very adequate for our one night stay A brilliant location with St Katherine Docks on the doorstep 
457989,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We did not realise that we had not booked breakfast as this was not made clear and caused embarrassment at the breakfast check in , The view was amazing
457990,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had an issue getting drinks and snacks at the outdoor seating area we didn t get any despite waiting over 30 mins and our order being taken Mentioned this to the reception staff and when we later arrived back at our room there was a complimentary bottle of wine and some chocolates which was a nice touch, Reception staff were very helpful throughout our stay and also gave us a lot of assistance printing off our flight tickets

457995,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Queue for checking in 5 minute queue for breakfast just to be seated which seemed like a lot longer when you re in a rush ahead of a meeting Iron didn t work staff only brought a new iron without an ironing board the plug sock didn t reach to the fixed ironing board But after waiting 2o minutes for an iron gave up asking for a board, view location were fantastic I stay in London a lot on business will stay again with my family 
457996,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Disappointed by housekeeping staff knocking on door to clean room before 8 30am on day of checkout , The view from our room of the docks and the location of the hotel were excellent The staff in reception were very welcoming nothing was too much trouble

458005,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, For a room of this price and calibre one would expect the safe to work there to be a mini bar the heated towel rail to be hot bit below par really , View from room Tower bridge
458006,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Although the view of the river was amazing we also had a clear view into 2 other rooms This is not a problem for all rooms here but tinted windows or some thing for the ones affected would be an improvement , Excellent location really clean and the staff are polite and helpful The room was small but comfortable and had a great view of the river We will definitely return here

458023,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No complaints really Perhaps the hotel could do with some slight modernization but at the price we paid I don t think you could ask for better, Excellent value for the price paid Outstanding view of the Tower of London from an angle I was not aware of Lively hotel bar and great outside spot for drinks I would definitely stay again 
458024,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We had access to the exclusive club lounge which was great Apart from a very grumpy member of staff we was bad tempered with all the guests She spilt coffee over my partner and didn t apologise , Our second visit to the hotel great location great views comfortable bed 
458025,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast not included in package air conditioning in room did not work gym is small, Location very close to tourist attractions and underground staff very helpful and polite 
458026,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Paying for car parking but hey it is convenient and secure and easy to access, Best location get a bridge view room for memorable and quiet stay Classic 60s quality Good restaurant 
458027,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Needs some refurbishment 2 3 elevators out of the 4 not working every day of my stay No fresh orange juice at breakfast was a disappointment from a 4 star Gym tiny and very hot felt like a sauna , Fantastic location view with the Tower Bridge and the City Good price for central London Staff very pleasant and helpful 
458028,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I liked everything , Excellent room overlooking river vet comfortable and very clean All staff we professional and friendly Will definitely stay here again 
458029,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Interior was very dated and worn View of tower bridge was obscured by a concrete pillar Window in the corridor looked directly into our bedroom , Excellent location for sights Staff were polite and helpful 
458030,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Provide extra water in room, bed very comfortable great shower fantastic location for sightseeing with amazing Tower Bridge views Full English breakfast very good with great choices on hot and cold buffet and all food items at correct temperature Tesco extra with cashline available and an underground station very close 
458031,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The double bed was two singles put together and the edges put together could be felt in the middle of the bed, Amazing location and the best view from a hotel room we ve ever had 
458032,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A little disappointed that we were told to go up on to Tower Bridge flag a taxi down on the Friday night when we were going out , Everything was perfect location was great hotel and room were really good Fantastic break away The view of The Tower Bridge never grew old perfect 
458033,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, could wait an age for a lift and 1 was out of service, we stayed in a standard room which was much bigger than I expected and had a great view over St Kathrines dock We also arrived about 10 30 to drop off bag and they allowed us to check in early Bed was super big and very comfortable Breakfast was really good value It was buffet style but a great spread and attentive staff 
458034,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room required refurbishing there was marks all over the walls and chunks missing from the skirting board and doors etc The lifts are an absolute nightmare we had to wait 10 mins before we could get in one with a pram but everyone was having to wait some time My partner went running at 06 30 on a Sunday and he still had to wait 5 mins , The location was brilliant with easy access to the centre of town including traveling buy tube or boat We had a room with a view and wow what a view 
458035,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Staff were so helpful and considerate Everyone from reception to room service were outstanding I always stay at this hotel when I am in London this is my third visit this year I am so impressed every time The breakfast was delicious too 
458036,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No minibar Poor choice of hot drinks in nedroom Safe too small for laptop Crowded breakfast room too much bustle Horrible sulphur preserved orange juice, Staff Brasserie Comfort
458037,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, None, Cleanliness comfort lovely helpful staff and most of all the position of the hotel on the Thames We have been staying at the tower hotel for over 25 years Love it 
458038,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was pretty small and the lifts took ages , Room was clean and the location was fantastic we had a nice view of the river not the bridge Enjoyable stay 
458039,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The 4 main elevators were very slow and it appeared to me not really suited to hotel size and during busy periods you had to use service lifts or stairs with luggage I understand this may have been that due to some being out of service so perhaps it was only a temporary glitch during the weekend I visited hope so Rooms are clean and comfortable perhaps little dated by other top London hotel chain standards but for a short break its good value for money and if location is your main concern it is ideal , Wonderful views a great location right on the Thames very close to the Tube MBNA clippers River boats great inexpensive way to see the city and get around You also have St Catherine s dock right on the doorstop ideal for a waterside drink or a quick bite at the end of the day in lovely marina surroundings you might forget you are in central London Very friendly smiling staff including those we bumped into back of house in the service lifts 
458040,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I payed extra for late check out but the hotel cleaners decided to start banging about at 8am so the late check out was useless really , The place was absolutely fantastic Best hotel I ve ever stayed in 
458041,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, My only complaint would be that I had to run the cold water tap for at least ten mins to get the cold water through , I have stayed here several times I think the location is FAB the rooms very comfortable and staff always helpful and friendly 
458042,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Although paid extra for breakfast staff did not agree I had so quite annoyed to be arguing my case twice in front of other guests Very poor , Upgraded room good with great river views
458043,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, At peak times the public lifts were overwhelmed and we had to wait for over 15 minutes for one to stop at our floor We were directed to a service lift but when we got out at the ground floor the was no clear sign directing us to the public area , The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel was in an excellent location our room had a wonderful view of Tower Bridge and the Thames Behind the hotel was a marina surrounded by a variety of restaurants The breakfast represented excellent value for money with an extensive choice 
458044,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast all self service apart from tea coffee Ran out of bread for the toaster and had to wait a while for more A bit of a bun fight , Excellent position for getting to the Tower gateway for the DLR to The ExCel exhibition centre or for getting a boat down up river Also good choice of restaurants and bars within a couple of minutes walk 
458045,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We were slightly surprised by size of Room 307 expected slightly bigger Obviously disappointed that we didn t have a nicer view especially as it was a treat for my husband s birthday but appreciate it s first come first served But we were only in the room to sleep The room could have done with its own bin rather than using the one in the bathroom , The location facilities hotel information reception staff breakfast was superb Bed extremely comfortable 
458046,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Unfortunately there were no tea or coffee making facilities at all in our room at all We didn t discover this until the morning as we were attending a function and were a late arrival We were on room only so had to buy a cuppa before meeting friends later for brunch which was disappointing , The location was great as was the view and the staff were very polite
458047,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Everything top marks, I drive and hold a blue badge my surname is Clements and we met up with your Mr Clements who not only helped with us parking but was extremely helpful and a very friendly Top marks Mr Clements
458048,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Free mini bar was disappointing one small bottle of white wine was all it contained we only drink red The club lounge was almost as bad as there wasn t a very good choice at all As the house wine wasn t very nice we went into the normal bar and paid for the drinks so we still had a good time at the hotel , As it was my husbands birthday we stayed in an executive room It was very comfortable clean and had a good view of the river Thames even though I had specified that I wanted a good view of Tower Bridge 
458049,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room is old and small Need major renovation Bath room is small clearly saw the age of this room by counting how many holes on the walls Wardrobe was old and tore due to age and lack of good maintenance Door to the room is so difficult to push open and it springs back to close in such a force that you will weak up all the rooms around you Window is small and you can see your next neighbor sitting on his her bed reading yes it is that close so you have to close the curtain all the time Go back to the toilet the seat is loose and it took at least 3 flushes everything to clear even a tissue I will not recommend this hotel for leisure but I guess that it will be good for short stay for business as there s offices blocks in this location , Great location 5 10 mins walk to the nearest underground station 
458050,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bar was not open until 16 30 on a Saturday even though in the room information book it said that the bar opened from 12 late at a weekend When we asked where we could get a drink from after a long journey the staff told us that the brassiere was serving The staff in the brassiere basically ignored you and were more busy clearing up after lunch I even saw them tell a man with a disabled son he had to go to the bar himself to get a drink leaving his son outside alone , We had an amazing view of Tower Bridge from our bedroom window 
458051,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had to wait 40 minutes for second bed had booked a twin Then breakfast had undercooked sausages , Grateful for an upgrade on arrival but was double edged sword 
458052,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had asked for champagne to be in our room on arrival at 3pm as was a birthday celebration but it wasn t there After enquiring champagne did then arrive after an hour this obviously was only a small oversight which staff apologised for and would highly recommend this wonderful hotel , Loved this hotel helpful and welcoming staff amazing location and lovely room Breakfast was a huge selection of delicious food both cooked and continental Beautiful scent when you arrived in the impressive lobby area Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here 
458053,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing faultless, Can not fault this hotel at all Friendly welcome on check in from Emmanuel Lovely staff throughout the hotel Breakfast was fab such a wide variety and choice The location is the selling point of this hotel Fabulous views of tower bridge 5 minute walk from the tube and 10 minute walk to the Thames clipper Will defiantly be staying here on our next London visit

458055,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Regrettable that the bedroom was not cleaned and made up the second night The lifts are inadequate queues at every floor in the morning Still a nice hotel though , Brilliant location view of Tower bridge Nice bedrooms good breakfast spread very nice and efficient staff at reception 
458056,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We asked for a walk in shower and were given a disabled room Everything was too low, The staff were excellent particularly in the breakfast room and we said so
458057,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The prices in the bar were the highest we have seen the bar was in a super location overlooking Tower bridge but the price of the drinks there were far to high we would have loved to had a few drinks at the bar but we could not afford too we drank at a nearby hotel where friends of ours were staying where there was a large difference in the price , we were so happy with the staff there The breakfast manager by the name of Catalin was especially helpful and excellent he always made us feel so welcome for breakfast The breakfast was also very good 
458058,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Had an executive room was disappointed with the facilities complimentary mini bar was only stocked with 1 tiny bottle of white wine 1 beer and 2 colas Minimal toiletries in bathroom had to ask for shampoo etc not what I call executive had better in a standard room , Stunning Views from the room comfortable bed 
458059,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hot breakfast was inconsistent some dishes average and some very poor The toasting machine was slow and did not toast the bread However a good range of hot and cold dishes provided , Excellent location The staff were very helpful polite and friendly The rooms were comfortable and quiet with good views 
458060,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel is situated quite a long walk from the nearest Underground station , Brilliant views of Tower Bridge Proximity to St Katherine s Dock restaurant area 
458061,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Slow lifts No toilet brush No writing paper Being told at reception that our breakfasts were not included when our booking form clearly stated they were OK I ll put that right for you She didn t Next morning at breakfast in the Gallery we were told that that it wasn t included we told them to check at reception They must have done as they didn t accost us further I then went to reception to confirm that this wouldn t happen again in the Brasserie where we intended to breakfast the following morning I ll do that everything will be fine Guess what Don t these people talk to each other , The view although we paid extra for it 
458062,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, To be honest the exterior of the hotel it looks so drab too much concrete , I have an egg allergy and the restaurant manager was amazing and look after me really well they were exceptional also the position of the hotel was fantastic for all the attractions and the South Bank well done
458063,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Small room size misleadingly presented to us as Standard Double at booking and check in described as for one by member of staff at check out This aspect made it very poor value , Well located interesting area
458064,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Coming home , Absolutely stunning hotel it was our wedding anniversary and we had champagne laid on by the hotel everything and more you could ask for 
458065,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room cleaners started at my end of corridor early and made a lot of noise Quality of breakfast could be better with option for bacon cooked well done etc , The club lounge was good
458066,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Booking com did not inform me that it was only a sleeper double room Very small room with bed up against the wall Not as in the pictures Hotel said booking com have done this before so you may need to check with hotel once you have booked You think you have a standard double and you don t , The staff were great and very helpful The food was good Location good Very clean and comfortable once upgraded 
458067,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was a little small Room was overlooked by other rooms so had to keep curtains drawn for privacy , Bed was lovely and comfortable Lovely view of St Katherine dock Good facilities excellent location

458070,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Two members of staff had a massive argument in front of us whilst seating guests waiting for breakfast One lady telling us to follow her and the other telling us to stay where we were Made us feel extremely uncomfortable , Brilliant view of Tower Bridge from our window and incredibly comfortable beds
458071,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The standard rooms were pretty basic and found the mattress to be quite hard and uncomfortable , The location was spot on The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel itself was lovely

458077,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Was expensive but was to be expected as the view was superb and it was marathon weekend, Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the view from our room was brilliant
458078,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There is nothing to dislike, Really easy to book room and car park at hotel The welcome we received was perfect and it was busy due to the day before the London Marathon staff were really friendly check in was easy with plenty of staff to deal with you not pushy and professional for the room we had no key issues opened first go room clean bed comfy television picture and sound great breakfast choice was good cereals several juices croissants muffins toast fruit and really good English breakfast couldn t fault hotel will be first choice next time we visit London

458081,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Drink prices in hotel bar was expensive , Every member of staff was friendly and very welcoming The view of Tower Bridge from our room was breathtaking 
458082,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room a little cool for my Mum but she does feel the cold Walk in shower would have been preferable but again it s a personal choice so people prefer to have a bath , Breakfast had a good selection and was constantly being topped up The view from our room was wonderful particularly at night when Tower Bridge was lit up All the staff very friendly and helpful
458083,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The suite that we stayed in was divine The staff even left a signed card and chocolates for my wife s birthday It was a fantastic place to stay and great value for money Excellent views and facilities

458085,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room crampted for a double room and other rooms could see in the window as we could see in their window suggest one way windows or net curtains the room was also very hot as well as the corridors, Location good
458086,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The view from the hotel is second to none The hotel and staff are excellent It was a pleasure to stay there again as we are regular visitors to the hotel 
458087,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, It s more nitpicking than anything else but the faucets in the bathroom sink one for cold water and one for hot water have too short a neck so you rub against the sink in order to wash your hands Not a problem but something for the hotel to perhaps think about Also by having them separate you can t get a medium temperature when washing hands or brushing your teeth You either get cold or hot The bathroom is not too spacious but it s not uncomfortable The toilet is a little tight spaced which might make it difficult for larger people , I ve stayed at this hotel before and it just keeps getting better The location and view of course are its main selling points and they don t disappoint but it s the modern comforts style with old style details that keeps me coming back The staff is always super friendly and accommodating The beds are comfortable and the rooms really nice with some very nice touches like an ironing board which I needed during this business trip and 2 hair dryers in the room and in the bathroom Everything was super clean with the amenities one expects It s truly an excellent hotel

458091,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, thankfully the large screen television has been removed from the xi bar it is totally unnessasary people want to see the views not a loud irrelavent screen if the tv returns i will spend no money in the bar , most things the staff are so friendly and polite 
458092,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, It s a horrendously dated building in an amazing place You can t do much with the extortion but spend some money on the interior and it could be quite special , Amazing location hard to beat 
458093,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Standard room was a bit small had to climb over end of bed as no room left hand side and no bedside able , Friendly professional staff at reception concierge Attentive staff in upstairs breakfast Quality breakfast Location was fantastic for city end attractions underground 
458094,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bathroom towels didn t smell very nice, The staff were very helpful and very friendly the breakfast was one of the best I ve had Only one slight criticism and that s the bathroom towels They were clean but just didn t have that nice clean fresh smell you get

458096,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, A little tatty , Great location and friendly helpful staff But the hotel is getting dated now and I m need of a refurb But if you can get a good rate it s still worth a visit for the location alone Make sure you get a room with a view of Tower Bridge

458098,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room wasn t very well maintained and quite small dated for the price There were chunks missing out of one wall a badly done repair in another no tea and coffee because we got a standard view room and we couldn t operate the air conditioning there were no instructions it was baking Lots of places where the varnish and paintwork could have done with touching up and for the price we paid I m not sure why that couldn t be done I know it was standard room but I thought the Guoman brand would have higher standards of presentation even at the lower price end , The view of Tower Bridge was outstanding the bed was very comfortable and the staff lovely and happy to help
458099,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Beds uncomfortable mattresses too soft Windows dirty bathroom floor slippery and tiles cracked no bedside cabinet next to one of the beds no light switches under one of the beds staff very noisy along the corridor from early morning , The staff at check could not have been more accommodating and polite The location is one of the best in London perfect view of beautiful tower bridge Room a good size and very comfortable

458108,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, If visiting the Tower of London or seeking an excellent location for visiting London how can you better this hotel Rooms face either the Thames with Tower Bridge one side or St Catherine s Dock with all the local history to take in the other A tube station near and lots of restaurants Just great for a break Jan Keith

458114,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lifts didn t seem to be working properly On several occasions we couldn t stand the wait so walked up 7 floors , The staff were all really friendly and helpful The breakfast had plenty of choice 
458115,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Being woken at 7am by the noise of running water coming via our bath plug hole presumably from the room above using their shower bath , Location was perfect room view of tower bridge is amazing
458116,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Beds were really uncomfy woke up with back ache every morning could hear every word from the room next door no vocal privacy at all , locaion and view from the room was brilliant breakfast staff were very helpful and friendly

458118,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Lifts were very slow in arriving at your floor The overpowering scent in reception was sickening Our double bedroom was too small not enough room to get out of bed on both sides , View was excellent Breakfast was delicious Staff were very friendly 
458119,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No complaints at all queues for the lifts but thats just being picky All good really, The whole experience lovely hotel in a perfect location The staff were very good and helped make my wifes birthday special 
458120,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Lifts were terrible I didn t appreciate not being able to get my breakfast which was included the queue was so ridiculously long that I just had to leave it wasting my money, The staff were really good and i appreciated them leaving a bottle of wine in my room for my birthday 
458121,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There is often a queue for breakfast so go for an early one The breakfast is so good people linger longer and why not , The view from the bedrooms is the best on London either the iconic Tower of London or the marina with its array of interesting ships It is also an area where you can wander around outside without traffic unheard of in London ideal for a wheelchair or pram Love the hotel and stay as often as we can I should have shares in it 
458122,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bathroom could have been a little better But nothing to spoil our stay , Being treated like someone special Even though the hotel is huge The location is excellent The view from our window will stay with us for a long time 
458123,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The WI FI was very poor in our room and the noise from the corridor outside our room was a bit obtrusive , The bedroom was comfortable and the double glazing was very good The cooked breakfast was very good It was buffet style so you could have as much as you wanted and was all very tasty We paid for a room with view which was just what we got with a good view of Tower Bridge we were on the first floor and would of been better if we were on a higher floor The Hotel is next to St Kathrine s Dock which has a good selection of restaurants 
458124,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Would have liked tea coffee making facilities in the room , Room had an excellent view over St Katherine s Dock The bed was very comfortable and the breakfast plentiful and good 
458125,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was very very small nowhere to put a suitcase we had to block the door with suitcases a fire issue Queues for breakfast were very very long on both floors and we therefore had to forego breakfast as we would have been late for an appointment , The view from the restaurant
458126,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, They knew I had a disability and just put me in a standard double room with hardly any room to move Certainly not a 4 star hotel and not worth the money , Good location
458127,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Gets quite busy around breakfast time The staff try hard to deal with everyone quickly but it s reminiscent of a cattle market, Central location friendly staff 
458128,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Customer service was shockingly bad We had a group booking and they messed up the check in for a number of rooms It was painful trying to resolve the problem and the man on reception wouldn t take responsibility for the mistakes he had the courage to admit when something WASN T his fault A disgrace Don t stay there unless you love hassle and unhelpful staff ,No Positive
458129,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The orange juice as breakfast was vile I m not sure it had seen an orange In a hotel of this quality it should be fresh orange juice The lifts seemed to take an age and we had to use the alternative lift through the kitchen, The rooms were very comfortable
458130,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Mattresses a little hard for my personal taste no choice of pillows which I found where also a little hard , Extremely friendly and helpful staff Ideal location Great value for money when booking with booking com

458133,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, 20 minute queue for breakfast I have never experienced this before at a costly hotel It felt like being at school I would not stay here again for this reason especially given the price When I got to the room I couldn t work out how to turn on the lights as I hadn t realised there was a master switch which is a bit stupid of me However I walked past a maid just outside my room so I thought I would open the door to ask her She avoided eye contact and just said no no I thought this was really poor If you are going to have staff working at the hotel at least train them to say I m sorry but I don t speak English , Bed very comfy Room very clean Breakfast was very tasty and there was a good selection Room was quiet Shower powerful
458134,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel might need a little modernisation especially in the bedrooms We were allocated room 327 Our bathroom had a slight odour of stagnant water from the plug holes and this was very apparent at night This may have been due to lack of occupation of our particular room before we arrived The problem was sorted simply by putting the plugs in the plug holes The bathroom door had a weird creak to it when closing and this was very much apparent especially when my significant other was asleep and I needed to use the bathroom and vice versa Other than the two minor aforementioned gripes we had a wonderful time at the Tower Hotel and we would highly recommend it , The location of the hotel is brilliant as is the view from the rooms overlooking the Thames and Tower Bridge Great base for anyone to take in all the sights and sounds of London

458137,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel building externally looked dated but also not particularly well looked after given its location Similiar comment in relation to interior and decor all a bit dated which was surprising , Magnificent location and views out of the river and bridge snd close to several other landmarks Enjoyed breakfast in the hotel too overlooking St Katherine Dock 
458138,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Don t bother with breakfast buffet was lukewarm and took three attempts to get a decent cuppa Head to Cote just round the corner and get peaceful table service instead, Fantastic view of Tower Bridge and super quiet room
458139,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel not clean room covered in plastic which had been left behind by a builder Piled it up on the window ledge to find it wasn t gone after the room had been cleaned Facilities very dated very small for the price and not really that comfortable A C didn t work and the heating was clearly on full Poor quality and value for money Took 20 minutes to check in as the staff couldn t understand us we re english which stumped us spoke too quietly and didn t keep us updated as to what was happening and why we couldn t check in, Friendly staff and great concierge service 
458140,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, As a vegetarian I would have loved a choice of vegetarian sausages for breakfast and would have loved a spa and massage , This was my base for a 2 night stay for a shopping trip with my mate as birthday present from my mom Loved the view from our twin bedded room it overlooked the Tower Bridge This was a great base to explore London as transport links were near the hotel Well worth every penny

458143,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Waiting times for check in lifts breakfast and bar Only 2 desks open on arrival with long queues Extremely lengthy queue for breakfast and once seated although plenty of staff they were running around the entire time filling everything up to cope with demand It was very chaotic Long wait for lifts, Room size and powerful shower
458144,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Our two night stay at The Tower was a perfect The room we had was a very good size and very clean and with all the amenities and the location couldn t have been better We had upgraded to the executive room which we were a little unsure of at the time but would definitely recommend and do again The breakfast was delicious and the before dinner canopies were the perfect thing to come back to before getting changed and heading back out The staff were all very helpful and welcoming and we look forward to staying here again soon

458146,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Bar staff The lift system 2 out 4 lifts were not working a lot of angry and frustrated customers, Breakfast and staff at breakfast very good Staff at the sports bar not so good they seemed uninterested in serving customers Loved the view from the room

458148,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lifts wasn t working And I got abit loss with for staircase , Hotel room was well nices hotel was lovely The lift wasn t working and I got abit loss looking for stairs apart from from it was a good stay 
458149,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, At peak times the 4 lifts don t appear to be adequate however the team have thought this through and have labelled alternative lifts service and the stairs clearly The hotel would benefit from a larger coffee shop meet up area on the ground floor , The staff at the hotel were charming Always there to help and happy to do so I would like to compliment the management of creating such a great team 
458150,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Lifts could have been more regular didn t appear to all operate , Breakfasts were very good however on weekends there is a queue and you may well have to wait a while

458155,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, lifts were slow and only a couple were working Big queues for breakfast which I wasn t too concerned about but you could see others were quite irate , staff were extremely helpful at check in and also the concierge service I think you could think about solo travellers and especially a single female being so far from the lifts I had an excellent night s sleep though very comfy bed 
458156,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The staff at Reception were dreadful rude and unhelpful for the most part Checking in was made traumatic and difficult and started our break off very disappointingly The little coffee bar sold tea that was served with in a large cup with a teabag floating in it there was no teapot nor any hot water to add and then we were charged 3 00 per cup Ridiculous It took 2 1 2 hours before security responded to our call to help us with the in room safe and we had to call housekeeping twice before we got the extra towels we asked for , The view from the room was superb looking over the Thames towards Tower Bridge The room was small but comfortable and clean The buffet breakfast was delicious

458159,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Check in we had to queue but was dealt with well the breakfast service was poor we were shown to a table in the neville suite area and the breakfast buffet was in a tight corridor and there was no bowls plates sausages or mushrooms which we had to get from the other room whilst the rest of our food was getting cold the tea was slow to arrive and only 2 choices of cereal in our corridor not good it must be like this every weekend at peak times staff need to be better organised a refill crockery quicker, The view from our room was fantastic the food in the brasserie was great the comfort of the room bed bathroom etc very good location perfect xi bar great
458160,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing , The view we had to Tower Bridge particularly at night was fantastic Nice room size although only a standard but a good size for London 2 minutes walk to St Catherines Dock and 5 mins walk to the Tower of London perfect 
458161,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Upon checking in late afternoon a half empty bottle of sparkling water was left for us to consume clearly we reported this to reception Air Conditioning wasn t working in the room the temperature of the room couldn t be adjusted One of us slept well the other not so well , Staff were friendly welcoming location was fantastic for visiting the sites of London

458170,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Only 2 lifts working for a full capacity hotel leaving us to walk up 8 floors and hundreds of stairs each time to get to our room Room very dated and not to the standard expected for the price See breakfast queues, Amazing view Worth the extra paid for this Breakfast was nice but we had to queue almost 40 mins to be seated 
458171,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Out of 4 lifts only 2 were working leading to unacceptable levels of congestion at certain times , The view from rooms looking out over Tower Bridge Breakfasts were excellent
458172,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The elevators were always busy so you had to wait for minimum 10 min before it got to your floor And because of this we had to use the staff elevators in the back and it was not so convenient , Good service and very polite staff The rooms were nice and clean and had an amazing view looking over the Themson river and right at the Tower Bridge 
458173,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Hotel busy and you could wait a very long time for a lift Nothing more negative to say , Wanted to stay in London this hotel is in a great location Room very small as was the bed but spotlessly clean and comfortable we had a view of Tower Bridge Staff polite and helpful if I was staying more than one night I think I would try and get a bigger room Buffet breakfast was great

458186,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I processes my payment online and when I get there I had to do it all again Then they me home was not working but they made it seem like it was my card I spent about 20 minutes at the front desk trying to process my payment at the end the have to do it manually Got to my room and got a call that the card rejected the payment so I should come downstairs with another card As I was getting ready to go downstairs the called that it was they card machine I was too tied for one hour process They need to find a way to process people , Breakfast was good The rooms were clean 
458187,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, For the price we would have had more room and a more comfy bed in a premier inn the hallway and room was like a sauna we couldn t see where to turn it down and the windows only open a little which is no good in a room so hot Xi bar is advertised as being open all day which it wasn t and then silly little things like pictures aren t straight on the wall and there are marks from i m guessing the trolleys along the walls doesn t look good for what is meant to be a Hotel that prides themselves on excellence Shame as the hotel had been recommended to me , We liked the location and the view 
458188,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Decor a bit shabby, Lovely view lovely room and an amazing breakfast Late checkout and were allowed to check in early 20 for 36 hours parking too 
458189,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Excellent the staff were friendly and helpful We asked for bathrobes and they came straight away Hotel was spotless and the location was fabulous We booked a room with a view and it was well worth the small extra cost some other hotels charge a premium for the river view but tower bridge is amazing 
458190,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, One of the lifts takes you upstairs but not down The bathrooms could do with updating But to be honest neither made any kind of dent on our experience 122 a night for a room that looks out on Tower Bridge who cares about one wonky lift and a perfectly functional unfashionable bathroom , The welcome at reception was brilliant We felt really at home The food in the brasseries was out of this world We had scallops to start followed by the sea bass the produce was superb and everything was cooked perfectly The sauces were also incredibly well made Wherever you go in the hotel you find smiley warm helpful staff We haven t had an experience like that in a London hotel in this price range ever 
458191,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, As we said this is our 4th visit and unfortunately wasn t the best this time The room wasn t a particularly good standard in that the toilet flush was intermittent trouser press ironing board was broken wallpaper peeling in places and towel heater not working took some photos DId report issues at time and maintenance was quick but only looked at toilet and said toilet system is old , Location is perfect is for what we wanted Lots of nearby attractions great walks and sights Great breakfast This was our 4th visit to this hotel
458192,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, small rooms a little outdated looks aged in need of a refurbish some staff could try harder, great location good prices for London good breakfast buffet free fast Wifi

458199,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lifts were terrible and we stayed on the 10th floor over crowded and slow stopping at every level Room was very hot as were the landing areas The shower was weak and was either freezing or boiling , Location is excellent right next to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and a short walk from Tower Hill tube station Staff were lovely 
458200,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Nothing apart from the scrambled eggs weren t to my standards but overall fantastic , Great customer service I will definitely recommend Love the wide range of breakfast as you don t get this in many hotels

458204,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Lifts were occasionally tempramental Bed was a little too firm for our taste , Excellent location in St Katherins Dock had high level room with great view of the Thames Very friendly and obliging staff Really good breakfast included in room rate overall an excellent deal
458205,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Location staff and facilites wee excellent and value for money for a Central london Hotel Room was upgraded to a River view at no extra cost so get there early to secure But was only 20 to guarantee Would definately recommend and stay there again in the future
458206,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only minus in our hotel room was that there was very cold , The location was awesome metro station was near and the view to Tower Bridge My words can t even describe how beautiful it was especially at night time Breakfast was good and hotel staff was very friendly and helpful I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is travelling to London and wants to get a good hotel to stay There is also wide range of different restaurants very near and we found a nice restaurant where you can eat a starter and main course just for 10 
458207,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Very slow check in and even slower lifts Could do with two higher chairs in bedrooms in order to be able to appreciate the views from windows better Sure they would more than pay for themselves due to revenue generated from room service patrons would not to able to tear themselves away Minor issues though , Spectacular view from bedroom window Much more impressive than photos suggest Really comfortable beds and good breakfast 
458208,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, greeted by very helpful staff first impressions wow everything was perfect lovely room bed exceptsionally comfortable food lovely no complaqints at all thankyou for a lovely stay we ll definatly be back

458213,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, overall for the price and in london you can t complain, great location and price this hotel is a no frills type of hotel showing its years but overall for the price fantastic value you don t get a mini bar or other mod cons but overall everything else is catered too breakfast is ok too
458214,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The only thing we found was that the shower curtain did not fit as well as it could and water sprayed out on to the floor behind the toilet , The hotel was central to where we wished to visit comfortable and the food was excellent The lady on Reception Marta was extremely helpful 
458215,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Vishal Parab the Reception Manager provided excellent customer service giving my wife a bottle of wine on her birthday He also explained the room upgrade options which we took advantage of Thank you Vishal

458217,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I booked this Hotel back in Feb for myself my husband and 7 year old daughter We booked an executive room as I was told this would be large enough for a bed for my daughter and also a tower view for the New Years celebrations The room was tiny and we did not have a view of the tower we were on the back over looking the docks We were moved after I complained The breakfast in the executive lounge was shocking , The Hotel looks impressive a long side the Tower Bridge 
458218,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Minor issue at reception but it was quickly resolved so not problem there , The location was just perfect literally on the river We had a view looking into St Katherine s dock floor 10 which I highly recommend asking for 
458219,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Finding the previous guests open packet of fruit in the fridge, Having booked online and getting a good deal we got a late Christmas present of being upgraded to a large suite free of charge 
458220,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bed was extremely hard The room was far too hot and we were told the air con unit didn t work We were charged an extra 50 in case we damaged anything however this was not explained and the money was taken out of my account without consent and not returned until 3 days later , The views were stunning and the bar was lovely and drinks were good 
458221,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Shower head in our bathroom wasn t very good Couldn t really call it a shower it was more of a drip but apart from that it was fantastic , We loved that we were upgraded to a suite the location the staff the food and the executive lounge access 
458222,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I had requested a room with a view of the river and Tower Bridge but was put in a room only on the 2nd floor facing St Katherine s Dock , The breakfast
458223,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Poor speed of lifts for quality of hotel sometimes could wait for 10 mins for lift Lift did not accurately display where they were when waiting , Location was the best could not fault it 
458224,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, We went by car and parked in their car park The rate for the car was 20 a day so we left the car there 2 days Went to pay for the car and was told it s free Friday so had to pay nothing Thanks
458225,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, View from our executive room wasn t good yes could see the river but right next to our window was a hall window not only rotting but anyone could see in our room , Good location great views staff very friendly and helpful Would return to this hotel 
458226,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Rooms a bit tired TV reception poor and programmes limited , Second stay at this hotel Location ideal for my visits Staff were again excellent welcoming and helpful 
458227,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, In my opinion the rooms are not great value for money They are quite small and have poor lighting As a girl getting ready for a Christmas party Lighting and space is key Last year I stayed at a budget hotel nearby which was half the price and much better value for money I m afraid , Staff are good and they have efficient systems such as express check out It s beautifully decorated at Christmas time and has the most amazing view of tower bridge The breakfast and the service is also very good 
458228,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Noise from room cleaning awoke us around 7am hoovering Queue for breakfast Room not cleaned due to us not clicking a button not something you think of on holiday , Position of Hotel
458229,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I was not impressed with the staff The chambermaid woke us at 9 a m on Sunday and the wait staff at breakfast rushed us even though it was not yet 11 a m Dirty dinner plates from room service the night before were still outside rooms at 11 a m the next morning , The location was fabulous We had a room overlooking Tower Bridge
458230,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was slightly on the small side to compared to other double rooms we ve stayed in at similar size London hotels, Fantastic location Staff very extremely friendly and helpful

458232,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lighting in the lifts was a little unreliable but the worst thing was having to leave , The hotel position is perfect for a weekend in London The room had an excellent view of Tower Bridge absolutely worth the money The hotel was quiet the bed was a great size with an excellent comfort level 
458233,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The location was superb for the attractions we planned to visit on foot yet the close proximity to the underground affords easy access elsewhere We upgraded to a Tower Bridge view and slept with the curtains open 
458234,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The decor seems a little outdated Felt like the hotel hasn t been modernized in about 10 years The lifts took forever to arrive during breakfast time on Sunday which resulted in people just hopping on any that weren t full just to get a move on Not much choice on takeout or eating out if you didn t fancy anything from the hotel , Every member of staff I encountered was courteous friendly Myself a couple of friends were happily assisted in taking some party decor to our rooms
458235,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was too small for two people There was a problem with the drain in the bath and water in sink only had warm water But no big issues, Location was great staff very friendly and helpful Definitely be back
458236,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Waiting for lifts at busy times like checking out had to take the stairs , Excellent views of the river from 8th floor room at no extra cost Ideal stay for seeing the sites and theatre land Decent price for a London hotel 
458237,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was small and run down Need some update ASAP They don t have a fridge in the room called the reception and they brought a portable one that didn t even work For the price I had higher expectations Go spend your money somewhere else , Staff was really nice 
458238,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was much smaller than when we stayed last year , The location of the hotel is excellent Right next to the Tower Bridge and a short walk from the Tower of London and river cruises 
458239,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The hotel booked us in under somebody else with the same surname then when we noticed the mistake it appeared they had lost our booking but made up for it by upgrading to executive suite instead of standard double with complimentery drinks so they redeemed themselves , Room was clean and bed was comfortable and the hotel was close to where we needed It was quiet considering the size of it
458240,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Waiting for a room an hour after specified checking time , Lovely clean hotel Staff were very helpful and efficient Restaurants on site were of good quality and value for money especially the breakfast
458241,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, a Reception was always busy b I was paying for a group but they made it very difficult to prepay all the rooms Each room had to be paid separately and in the end they did not take the payment merely pre authorised my card which meant I had to attend reception again for each person checking out c I stayed three nights but they made me change rooms every night which was rather inconvenient , We were attending an industry event the hotel has a good location by the river 
458242,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, My room had the most amazing view of Tower Bridge It was a real highlight if my trip The room itself was quite spacious and comfortable The location is fantastic right next to Tower Bridge on the north bank Close to restaurants at St Katherine s Docks and Tower Hill tube and DLR lines Staff were very friendly 
458243,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Most of staff spoke English well just one young woman of oriental ethnicity was difficult to understand due to poor standard of English are staff encouraged to go for lessons , View of river and tower bridge from room Friendly helpful staff Handy for tube station river travel Decent size of bath
458244,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Long wait for the lifts , The staff were all exceptionally friendly and professional The views We also liked that you could open the bedroom windows for some fresh air 
458245,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Very old fashioned room not yet renovated far too expensive for this old style hotel room Wrong location if you want to go out in the evening, Great view towards Tower Bridge if you take a room with Tower Bridge view
458246,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, All the lifts weren t working which was quite inconvenient I only saw one out of four working , The location is amazing We had a fantastic view looking across the river Thames and Tower Bridge 
458247,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I stupidly put my wifes oystercard in the door key returns envelope We then had the issue of trying to find it Two days later you did Thank you , Walked into room 741 the comment of the view was OH MY GOD We laid in bed that night 2am and just stared at Tower Bridge Forgetting the absolutly fantastic view we found the staff very friendly The room well laid out and the bed fairly comfortable Will we be going back Oh YES 
458248,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Our check in was slow and staff were confused we were not allocated the rooms we booked with view of the tower Instead told we were upgraded but the room was not positioned as good as room booked Did not want or use extras that were included in executive room except continental breakfast,No Positive
458249,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Its nice there was late night room service but the burger which cost 14 tasted more like horsemeat The decor is very 90 s, Paid for a room with a view and that s what we got 
458250,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room for 224 for the night very small Nowhere to put our large suitcases only on the floor We had just left a cruise Cabin much bigger than room Carpet had big hole in it which we reported Very ordinary and needs updating , We had had a very long trying day travelling to the hotel Pleasant Hotel reception staff gave us a complimentary bottle of wine to cheer us up which was very nice Also our room didn t include breakfast but they also gave us a complimentary breakfast Location was excellent for access to river and underground etc plus being by the Tower and walks along the Thames and river cruises 
458251,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Rooms were tired and dated with a dangerous step out of the bath to the floor level Upgraded to a superior view of the river however building works on the roof of the hotel below ruined the views Air con for the room was also broken and room was very hot, Location of hotel couldn t be beaten and the restaurant for breakfast was very good 
458252,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The communication between departments and staff need to be better was not happy getting a wake up call at 6 45am when I didn t order one my mums 70th birthday I requested a card for her room and did not get one I did get a bottle of wine chocolate and a card saying happy 18th in my room which was not ordered Was not happy at all , Staff were very friendly food was lovely Very clean
458253,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Our only concern was that we were on the 9th floor our choice which was great but we could not find any stairs or signs for stairs during our stay Obviously there were stairs in the foyer but definitely no signs on our floor at least I am sure you will agree this could present problems , The location was stunning and very accessible for seeing the rest of the city Staff very helpful and the room was lovely with an amazing view of Tower Bridge
458254,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The hotel staff were very helpful polite and friendly The hotel is situated in a great location excellent views from our suite and felt very comfortable 
458255,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Not all lifts were working so caused unnecessary waiting time Needs to be looked at especially when it s the only option for disabled or guests on crutches , Great location got a great deal staff very helpful accommodating 
458256,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Tiny room and when ordered room service they charged a delivery charge of 5 to bring it up the lift I thought that was disgusting as room service is expensive enough without charging an extortionate amount to bring it to your room , beautiful view of tower bridge
458257,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, We left our room on Saturday at 9 am and did not return until 10 pm and the room had not been cleaned bed not made or towels changed no water left and no milk for coffee and at 181 a night was greatly disappointed , The location was fantastic quite close to many visitor attractions 
458258,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, No bar open late on a Saturday night Even though there were clients wanting a drink Lifts were slow and only 2 working out of a bank of 4 , Proximity of where I had to get to Staff are polite friendly and courteous in the reception area 
458259,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room with construction supplies outside no view they changed it by request They promised room with a view to river was not I ordered breakfast to room they forget it had to call after waiting Promised chocolate to my son for his birthday to room forgot it 4 stars hotel nothing special , Location 
458260,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Overall feel of the place was a bit corporate and last century The smell of the aircon in the lobby It all looked very grand when you came in but the rooms weren t really that different than those in a Travelodge or Premier Inn only more expensive The lifts took forever , Bed was comfy The shower was great Nice views of tower bridge 
458261,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, When we went to check in tower hotel the reception had no confirmation of our booking this caused stress and delays to get a room, Good location for sight seeing plenty of bars restaurants in walking distance
458262,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, This hotel is surrounded by tall buildings so the views are of nearby walls windows On our side the noise from the London Bridge building site and railway meant the window had to remain closed, Hard to think of anything 
458263,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room at the Tower Hotel was TINY We booked a double room and this was certainly not fit for 2 people London prices are high but that is no excuse for selling single rooms as double rooms just to make more money , This hotel is in the perfect location of Tower Hill right beside the Tower of London and Tower Bridge Tower Hill subway is also very close and the sightseeing buses pass the door 
458264,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Small room bin in bedroom full of baby wipes bottles of wine etc Bathroom floor dirty and bath With hairs in Window filthy and weeds and rubbish for the view on the ledge ,No Positive
458265,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, 4 lifts only 2 weeking at any time if you are on a upper floor it can take 10 minutes and several lifts before you can get in a busy times , Great location view of the thames and tower bridge clean tidy well equiped room 
458266,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Only slight inconvenience with A C but was quickly remedied by maintenance staff They even brought a fan to make sure we were comfortable It worked , I love staying at this hotel when I bring friends to London BEAUTIFUL view of bridge and everything is close by and convenient for site seeing or staying in if the weather does not cooperate Love this hotel 
458267,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Limited overpriced menu in the restaurant , Location is an obvious bonus Restaurant has a late last orders for food which was good as we arrived late 
458268,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Can t think of anything , Location was excellent Was given choice of room position in the price band i e overlooking the Thames or Katherine s Dock Quiet overnight
458269,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was small and quite dated Furniture and woodwork peeling I had emailed and requested an upper room as was booked as a birthday treat for my partner I had already paid extra for the view but my Request was ignored and the birthday not mentioned , Great location great views
458270,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Having to queue for reception when a hotel is busy is to be expected but having to queue for the lifts when they are not all in operation was tedious and then to get to my room and the key card not work so I had to do it all again , The location and afternoon tea 
458271,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Cramped rooms clean but tired old bathrooms Breakfast good value at 12 BUT very poor TEA poured from the Waiter s jug very weak didn t get your own Teapot All Tables were Wobbly Far too many people in the one room at one time lots of queuing everywhere Most of the Lifts never worked properly which was causing a great deal of frustration to customers and making them late for the inevitable queues at reception , Location Location Location Friendly Helpful Staff
458272,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room was very small felt like a single room , View from room 345 Had mentioned it was our wedding anniversary and very grateful for bottles of wine in our room in the evenings 
458273,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast the information on the room card was different to the info displayed at the dining hall the room card showed a later time for breakfast We then ended up coming to breakfast at the end of the scheduled timeslot because of this we didn t get tea had to ask 2 3 times for a cup of tea we also had little choice in the buffet Service was poorer which is not at all usual for the hotel restaurant ,No Positive
458274,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bed throw had stains on and the hair dryer socket did not work The general decor of the room and bathroom is dated for the price charged , The view which I paid extra for 
458275,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Reception not very friendly and we were given a room with a crane outside the window after we had been asked if we would like a room with a view , Location and hotel was very good
458276,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I stepped on two pieces of tomato left on my bedroom carpet I wasn t very pleased about that My elderly Mother could have slipped , The view was incredible 
458277,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, The staff were the highlight of the stay Very polite Especially a man who was running around trying to wave down taxi s for everyone Lovely stay

458280,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bed was large but it was two mattresses together which was a little odd when trying to sleep in the middle , Fabulous view great staff good location nice bar inside and out 
458281,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Queued to check in for 15 ish minutes Paid for a room with a view but half view was the marina behind and the other half was into another bedroom Turned away from both breakfast restaurants due to queues , Room was comfortable
458282,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Dust on bulbs and mirror frame leaking tap no toilet brush rusty shower pipe noise from external air conditioning when window opened burned lamp bulb , Comfortable room Amazing view of Tower Bridge The Shard and Southwark skyline near Thames 
458283,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The Hotel feels old and in need of some investment bedrooms and corridors dark with no natural light On the morning of departure housekeeping knocked 3 times to see if we were leaving starting at 8am , Reception staff and concierge all very cheerful and helpful Good location close to bars and restaurants in St Katherine s dock a nice walk along the south bank to the Hotel
458284,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, nothing all was good, The view of the bridge and the location Staff were very attentive and helpful when our key decided not to work The Brassiere was brilliant food was excellent 
458285,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Very dated inside and out Minimal facilities in hotel room no mini bar rubbish tv and very hard to use bathroom needs an update Expensive for the standard Hotel bar over priced even for London 15 for G T and pint of lager Got locked out of our room before we had to be checked out and took 3 visits to reception to get it sorted Many staff passed us outside our room who we asked for help and were rudely told to go to reception No offer of help or apologies Real shame as location is superb , The location is amazing the best thing about this hotel 
458286,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Room service is VERY pricey not only the cost of the food but a 5 delivery fee to the room also , The view is always lovely and the room is wonderful so comfortable clean and quiet Also the staff were helpful and pleasant and the location is fantastic Starbucks and Tesco express at the bottom for when you re feeling lazy wonderful restaurants on St Katherine s Dock for when you re feeling fancy I would 100 come back as I already have twice now 
458287,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, If your facing St Katherine s Dock the sound of the boat horns in the morning do wake you up It also took me a day or so to figure out that the coffee making facilities in your room are hidden in the draws same as the hairdryer which is a little outdated , The views from our room were fantastic Very close to local amenities and tube station Numerous bars and restaurants to choose from within the area 
458288,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, I booked a room which was not available when I arrived but a free upgrade to a Executive Room with a view on the Katherines Dock was offered and accepted Excellent solution The staff was very friendly and helpfull 
458289,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The rooms are in urgent need of an upgrade everything is very old feels like the 80 s Found a few cockroaches in the bathroom area Rooms are small , Location is great View of the Tower Bridge spectacular Breakfast is quite good 
458290,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Not very clear where disabled parking is did nt find lift into car park Breakfast a bit of a bun fight Had to queue t get in and then was not told of the procedure as to where food was or if it was at table coffee service etc Food was also cold If you do not want a view then you might as well go to Premier Inn, Staff very friendly views and location excellent Parking if required
458291,The Tower A Guoman Hotel,No Negative, Hotel situated in picturesque position adjacent to Tower bridge Close access to river boats so main attractions are all within easy reach Lovely quiet room Excellent staff all willing to help and very polite 
458292,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The lady knocked on the door about 9 30 and let herself in check out was 12, Excellent location all staff happy polite said good morning wonderful experience I ve stayed 3 times now won t stay anywhere else
458293,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The bed quilt was heavy and too warm for the time of year The pillows were too thick for me It would be nice if we were given one thick and one thin pillow so that we have a choice , Absolutely everything except the bed quilt and pillows I cannot fault the excellent polite courteous helpful staff The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice 
458294,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There was a quilt on our bed but no sheet and as the room was warm the quilt was too much but there was no sheet so it was all or nothing , Excellent views Our views were over the marina at Kathherine Docks Breakfast had an excellent choice to cover all nationalities I couldn t fault it The staff were very attentive and couldn t do enough to help us Our room was large and airy with blackout curtains and with the double glazing we had an excellent nights sleep 
458295,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Not being told about scaffolding and building work we had to be moved because of this The hotel is very dated and needs modernising outside it looks bad but it s clean and tidy inside But my biggest dislike is not being able to pre book quest into their own carpark , Views Location Xi Bar staff breakfast were all good had lovely time except for having to change room 
458296,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Breakfast was extremely busy and slightly chaotic , Great location with fantastic views of Tower Bridge and The Tower of London Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful Lovely outside bars eating areas Bedroom was a good size with decent soundproofing and comfy beds 
458297,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, There wasn t anything we didn t like except the rain , Location of hotel convenience of underground parking We had a room looking onto Thames and the beautiful Tower Bridge which was special and the bed was comfortable and room clean 
458298,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Very dated Toilet flush didn t work Hairdryer useless Doors and drawers wobbly Bed wheeled around the floor very easily Queuing 20mins just to get in for breakfast unacceptable and lifts didn t all work and slow when they did , Location
458299,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I know it s very picky but the only fault I can give is that the pillows were not of great comfort , The location is fantastic and the view couldn t be better The room was just to our needs This hotel shows great value for money 
458300,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Queues for breakfast that snaked from one side of the landing to the opposite side and down the stairs Unacceptable when got to end had to eat breakfast in lounge , location
458301,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, I think a hotel of this standard should include two armchairs not one and a dressing table chair When I requested one on our first night I was informed that there wasn t one available On the second day I was looking through the hotel guide and noticed that a Carvery was on Friday Saturday and Sunday On questioning the lobby staff nobody knew what a carvery was as most of them were foreign and probably never heard the word carvery so I requested to speak to a manager No one was available I was told but later an under manager appeared at our door and I explained about the carvery and showed him the Hotel Guide which he said was out of date He knew about the chair request from the previous day and he arranged for one to be delivered to our room He also presented an up to date guide with no Carvery mentioned In the Bar later I requested a Drambuie only to be told there wasn t any available in any of the bars On questioning the bar manager he informed me that various spirits and beers had been removed due to management policy I think this is a big mistake as any drink should be available in a hotel of this standard, The room with view and the cleanliness 
458302,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, The room was quite small although it did have everything in it that was required, The room view 247 for the price in London and location was excellent 
458303,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Cost was a bit more than i would normally pay for a hotel room for a night but don t begrudge the cost after staying there now , Location bed comfort clean friendly staff great view
458304,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, Wi Fi would not conect Room a tad small, The location view of Tower Bridge river All the staff we met were amazing Evening meal was delicious
458305,The Tower A Guoman Hotel, In our room the window didn t open and the air conditioning didn t work we were however offered a fan for the evening but at a cost of 135 per evening I think that was a disgrace and I probably wouldn t go back and stay there First impressions last and all that , The location and views and the breakfast and we even left some items behind and they returned them at a cost but they returned them promptly once I had been in touch
