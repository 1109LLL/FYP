472857,Hotel Milano Scala, I can t remember a thing my wife or I were disappointed or could complain about being worth of mention or use to anyone who s bothered enough to have read the hotel and rooms descriptions and other people s comments , We were given an interior southern faced room with terrace on the last floor which might be the reason why we felt being in a quite and bright room We didn t need to ask or complain for anything but all the staff we had to exchange with including front desk and breakfast room where welcoming polite and smiling and perhaps both parties speaking fluent Italian English or French made things easier for all Seriously considering to repeat here in our next stay in Milan Try the prosecco at the shop next door and the chocolates and ice cream in the one just crossing the street 
472858,Hotel Milano Scala, We went to the terrace bar and selected an open seat that was upwind due to cigarettes Two girls non hotel guests came in and pointed our seat to the waiter He came and told us they were reserved and we had to leave We asked where He pointed to his head and said in here We informed the desk manager who said no seats are reserved A phone discussion followed between him and presumably the bar staff with frequent use of word Americanos The desk manager said that if anything preference should be given to hotel guests I asked to speak to the hotel manger and I was informed that the manager was off for the weekend The next morning the staff failed to serve us in the breakfast room instead only serving a different ethnic persuasion It is quite apparent that anti U S sentiment is prevalent We are Canadians and did not correct their mislabeling In many countries this conduct would be considered racist at the very least discrimination This behaviour is unacceptable and booking com should remove this location and their corporate partners from their service The hotel also failed to turn on the a c leaving the room at the centrally set rate of 25 C I by passed this control but our travel freinds could not and the hotel took 5 hours to put them in a smaller room There is no excuse for this practice and we do not know if it was the same anti U S discrimination or just plain incompetence ,No Positive

472867,Hotel Milano Scala, The room was too noisy couldnt sleep something was making noise in the room that kept waking me up and cars outside were too load, Hotel design was great friendly staff had a nice take away breakfast box prepared for me good location
472868,Hotel Milano Scala, My trip to Milan was a business trip for 2 nights only I arrived in a taxi to Scala hotel and asked the front desk to pay the taxi then charge my room but refused so I asked them to support me with a change in order to pay the taxi but had zero support as thier excuse was no change was available I was literally stranded between the taxi and the hotel at night time without any help In addition I had no one to help me with my luggage during check in or check out not to mention the very poor Wifi which was good for nothing Moreover the breakfast variety was poor I had two nights paid in full but used only one night I had to look for another hotel the next morning I d rather lose my money and pay for another room at a different hotel than staying at Scala hotel ,No Positive
472869,Hotel Milano Scala, The bathroom door didn t close , Reception staff is absolutely amazing especially Dimitros who welcomed us and helped to find a perfect restaurant for New Year celebration we only arrived on 31st and had no idea where to go Hotel has a perfect location on a small street very silent though it is only a 5 in walk from la Scala Fortress Duomo Montenapoleone Rooms are very cozy and well designed There is a very nice library with a fireplace in the lobby great for a night talk with a glass of prossecco 
472870,Hotel Milano Scala, We asked for a cup of tea at 11 00 pm because we were not feeling very well as we explained on the phone but both room service and the reception denied bringing anything to the room We had to go and get some tea ourselves and we were charged for it eventhough we had kettle in the room Also despite the fact that our early check in request was confirmed 2 weeks prior to our arrival we had to wait for 2 hours before we could get our room , Location

472874,Hotel Milano Scala, The only specific glitch was the shower a relatively uncomfortable wall to get into the tub and the rain shower sprinkling all over the bathroom , Excellent location impeccable service good value as it came with wifi and breakfast included in the room rate spacious and comfortable room 
472875,Hotel Milano Scala, My only comment would be the inability to control the rm at night It got a little too warm for our personal taste, Location was perfect it was short taxi ride from Linate airport We were able to walk to the Duomo castle the Last Supper fashion stores and so many of the wonderful restaurants Breakfast included offered a great selection and so convenient The staff was very pleasant accommodating as well as informative

472882,Hotel Milano Scala, overpriced for quite average decor not very comforable suite at 720 euros a night way too small, Staff friendly and helpful fabulous central location
472883,Hotel Milano Scala, One of the reasons for choosing this hotel was the michelin listing No one had told us that the restaurant was on a severely restricted menu as the chef was on holiday I anticipate a slightly higher price with the listing I have yet to receive a discount when the service is not offered And even an expression of regret would have helped , Location was superb and the breakfast was good Really enjoyed soft live music at breakfast
