53301,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, We were very displeased that wifi in rooms was not complimentary As a result we did not pay and needed to be in the lounge to make plans and check emails This is the only hotel of many that we have stayed in recently that had such inconvenient wifi We thought the hotel would give better complimentary service , Location close to the Gloucester tube station
53302,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, It was ridiculously hot and we were unable to sleep well Also there weren t any full size towels provided We were only given what appeared to be hand towels It was bizarre , It was convenient to the tube 
53303,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, Man the cleaners drove me crazy early every morning banging in and out of rooms ignoring that they can actually close a door with the handle so is would be quieter They disregard that guests are trying to sleep It is seems they have the attitude of I am at work so you all should be , I stayed for a week and it was home from home good size room with full amenities and very comfortable bed

53310,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, I had a no smoking room but other guests on the same floor had been smoking cigars so it smelled awful There was a drunken fight in the corridor between a large group of men between the hours of 3 5 am which disrupted our sleep as you can imagine Hotel did nothing to compensate our dissatisfaction Received an insincere apology from the guests involved and reception Considering the cost to stay in this hotel per night it was incredibly disappointing , The location was very good
53311,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, Only basic selection of tea and coffee in rooms Disappointing that wifi is not free throughout the hotel, Good location Large pleasant room very comfortable beds and helpful staff
53312,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, The only negative I had was that while the wifi was free in all the public areas it came at a cost of 10 per day for room access As along with most people in today s world I use internet as an integral part of life it was an extra cost that I hadnt expected , The staff was very helpful genuinely solicitous and provided a personal touch which is sadly lacking in so many hotels at this time It made such a difference I felt that I was more than just another face I actually felt welcome Our booking included both breakfast and use of the executive lounge which was a haven of peace It also supplied constant beverages Our room was very well appointed with immaculate linen and a towelling dressing gown The furnishings were of a high standard and very comfortable The breakfast was truly excellent both in choice and quality The coffee came in generously sized individual pots and was very good I love my coffee in the morning and it didn t disappoint My only regret was that I didnt have the opportunity to avail of the excellent on site gym

53314,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, But we are on the 8th floor top floor and the windows have gaps and strong winds blew into the room very cold in particular we have one bed next to the window The food in the restaurant is okay but not up to a four star hotel standard My son s fish fingers were under cooked , The room is quite spacious which I like 
53315,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, Just very Expensive one night with a Meal drinks for my family of 4 was over 500 It is noted at Parking on site but this is 35 a day too as I was there for a day 4 hours spent 50 extra on Parking at the Hotel just took the edge off , Excellent Hotel the Staff are what made the Hotel an even better experience

53327,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, Breakfast Having to wait 40 min for a breakfast order after having spoken to two different waitresses about it is absolutely unacceptable Concierge The concierge arranged a car service for us in order to get to Euston Station in good time to catch our train on the morning we departed Prior to getting into the vehicle the Concierge confirmed that our 2 bags that had previously been left with the Concierge while we ate breakfast had been loaded into the car Needless to say we were angry and extremely disappointed to arrive at Euston station and find that our bags had not travelled with us They were still at the hotel When we called the hotel about this issue the Concierge proceeded to argue with us about it and basically called us liars As a result of the ineptitude of the Concierge and the missinformation we missed our originally scheduled departure time with Virgin and we were required to purchase two new tickets at a cost of 150 This disappointing end to our stay in London caused us to miss a very important appointment later the same day , Location
53328,London Marriott Hotel Kensington, I would have loved if the Lounge was located in an area with windows and not in a cellar type closed off room , Great location with Subway access within acceptable distance A quick stroll to Hyde Park and Royal Albert Hall also makes this a great place to stay if you are in London for music like we were
