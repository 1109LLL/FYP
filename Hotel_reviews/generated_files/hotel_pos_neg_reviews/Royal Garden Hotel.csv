84294,Royal Garden Hotel, We were disappointed as we thought the breakfasts were inclusive and should had been for the cost of the rooms at 450 per night I have checked on your website after returning and you are advertising the same rooms for a lot less please explain why ,No Positive
84295,Royal Garden Hotel, Small rooms but fine if you were single like myself , Great location for running in Hyde Park and if you are willing to walk a little there is good tube station on the Central line The Circle line at Kensington High Street is close but a pretty bad line as it is slow and infrequent The staff at the hotel are super helpful 
84296,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Concierge services were outstanding including dinner recommendations emergency shopping recommendations and transportation recommendations Additionally when barman in training made errors in preparing cocktail senior barman voluntarily explained situation apologized and replace cocktail on his own initiative Idea of raised area for study working space by window was brilliant Finally of course the availability of twin beds rare in London was decisive 
84297,Royal Garden Hotel, No tea or coffee facilities Would have charged 2 00 for a knife and fork in the room , Comfortable room Plenty of room Larger bath and shower room 
84298,Royal Garden Hotel, I have never be evacuated as fire alarm ringing at evening when where I was living at any hotel before No apology no refunding from hotel when I checked out at next day morning ,No Positive

84300,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing we appreciated everything , welcoming staff lovely rooms convenient restaurant on site excellent location for site seeing and affordability Extremely pleased 
84301,Royal Garden Hotel, the night staff were unbelievably rude and abrupt and so was the restaurant manager no manners what so ever will never stay at this hotel again also very far from mayfair which is pointless as it takes 20 30 min to oxford street and back NO HALAAL FOOD,No Positive
84302,Royal Garden Hotel, Did think the cost of breakfast is a little high at 25 per person so chose to eat out , Had a very enjoyable stay at the Royal Garden Hotel even though had traveled to see Phil Collins in concert which was cancelled still went down for the weekend The staff were so friendly and professional we felt at home from the minute we walked though the door The views of the park from our window were stunning and there were plenty of places to eat and drink around the hotel re booked for November already 
84303,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing really, Great room with a great view of Hyde Park super friendly staff it was our first time in London and they were all very helpful and made us feel really welcome special thanks to Christina Very extensive roomservice menu and a great bar Bertie s bar to chill out in at night Buslane next to the hotel helped us tourists greatly as well very easy to move around in London like that Very calm and quiet at night What else great beds haven t slept as well in an hotel recently and a very spacious bathroom I couldn t fault a thing and we loved our time there We ll be back in November 
84304,Royal Garden Hotel, Couldn t find anything not to like in our two night stay , Staff were friendly helpful helped to make our stay Great location They had scooters at the concierge to use at the park 
84305,Royal Garden Hotel, The entrance to the parking We were not told about the restricted height or the difficult access and as we have a large Mercedes MLS 4 wheel drive the height barrier had to be lifted and we still managed to scrape the roof of the car The ramp and walls of the access to the parking was very narrow and the whole descent to the parking level was met with the rubbing of tyre on kerb and the sounding of the collision alarm in our car No it wasn t a case of bad driving it is very tight , I loved our stay at the Royal Garden Hotel We were allocated a Smoking room which was foul however we had been given a view over Kensington Gardens which was wonderful so we decided to endure the horrendous stench of stale cigarettes 
84306,Royal Garden Hotel, Some waiters could be nicer and caring , Walking to the left it s Kensington Palace Albert Hall and the other parks To the right all the shops at Kensington High St as Zara TKMax Gap Mark and Spenser and HM just to name a few So many restaurants to choose from and Whole Foods The Chinese restaurant Ming Jiang is on the 10th floor and besides sharing a beautiful view from the palace gardens it also offers some delicious dishes 
84307,Royal Garden Hotel, Despite having stayed here many times we are never welcomed as returning guests and good clients With some exceptions the staff at the front are cold and rather officious As opposed to household and restaurant staff who are very welcoming and helpful it s a pity My other pet peeves for me pillows are too soft and I detest rain showers , Great Location park on one side High Street on the other bus stop outside Underground 5 mins walk 2 seater couch in room Park Terrace restaurant is pleasant and very good value 
84308,Royal Garden Hotel, receptionist on check out not particularly friendly didn t ask how our stay was say thank you and in fact I had to say are we done to confirm check out process was complete Not many HD channels on TV , excellent location comfortable room and bathroom great view over Kensington gardens very good receptionist on check in
84309,Royal Garden Hotel, The wifi kept going in and out which was a hassle Also the house keeping kept knocking on my door even with the privacy light on , The view from the room was incredible The room had all the required items I loved the seating area by the window to look out onto all the rooftops The location was great I was stuck with no luggage thanks British Airways so I had to buy new things and it was very easy to do that as all the shops were around 
84310,Royal Garden Hotel, 1 We ordered a Queen Room with a Double bed in a quiet room We got after a lot of checking by reception a twin room They said our booking was changed from a Queen Room NOT BY US 2 The breakfast is not good vale The food was just warm and the eggs looked as if they had been sitting around a while We did wait for our food , The closeness to the Royal Albert Hall and the staff
84311,Royal Garden Hotel, Erratic room services sometimes water other days not sometimes bar frig checked other days not My friend was asked did she want a turn down at 10 pm ,No Positive
84312,Royal Garden Hotel, food wasn t really good through my online booking i asked for non smoking room in upper level floor and i get non of this as they game me smoking room in first floor the view of my room was the celling of the entrance block so there wasn t street view as they said,No Positive
84313,Royal Garden Hotel, Breakfast was awful The buffet weekends left a lot to be desired If I m paying 25 pp for it I expect it to be made to order for me The second day we went to McDonald s for a mcmuffin that was hot and made to order and a lot cheaper , Location comfort bathroom
84314,Royal Garden Hotel, Was not very happy with level of cleanliness at room and common areas Quite expensive as well , Fantastic location on high Kensington street right next to park Staff really nice and friendly they were all professional in their areas 
84315,Royal Garden Hotel, Room was a bit small considering how upscale the vibe of the hotel is , Walking distance to Notting Hill Kensington Palace Victoria and Albert Museum Room was small but comfortable Large picture window with window seat for enjoying the view 
84316,Royal Garden Hotel, Everything the staff were amazing , Went there for my daughters 10th birthday they upgraded us for free gave us cakes etc and was so nice to make my daughters birthday extra special
84317,Royal Garden Hotel, I liked everything in general , To be honest the reason why I chose this hotel is because it seems like the one of the closest and nicest hotel close to Holland Park where my sister lives And although maybe it is not 5 7 stars from the entrance including the guys at the door to the reception and concierge they were all very helpful and so caring As well as the people at the breakfast Thus the options at the breakfast are great like the chia seed porridge etc and thus the gym is just a big big bonus Which is really big and open 24 hours and has all sorts of equipments except the weights for the legs I have to say in general I was really surprised I will definitely come back And the dim sum restaurant at the top is a must vist place the best in town 
84318,Royal Garden Hotel, The smell of food in the lobby on arrival Also I could smell cigarette smoke on a couple of days in my room The time it took to service the room I left the room at 8 20 returned at 16 30 and it was still not made up ,No Positive
84319,Royal Garden Hotel, The cost was high comparing to a previous visit Also I forgot a sac in the lobby just a few minutes then I couldn t find it , Location staff food
84320,Royal Garden Hotel, I was so disappointed with my evening meal I never complain but the steak was so tough I couldn t eat it If a waiter had come and asked before my knife and fork where placed together I would have sent it back However they offered me a free drink to compensate Was it enough I didn t return the second night because of this and ate else where This was the only thing that let my stay down , Brilliant place to stay I was travelling on business and the rooms where clean and spacious 
84321,Royal Garden Hotel, Bedroom double glazing was poor lots of noise from traffic and demonstrations outside Probably a side or rear facing room would have been quieter , Good air con Breakfast excellent although very expensive at 25 Bertie s Bar good for evening drinks or nightcap 
84322,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing, I could not fault this hotel Staff were super helpful and friendly The room was well maintained and clean Fluffy white towels robes and slippers with toiletries from Penhaligons Tea and coffee in the room comp newspaper Breakfast was fantastic delicious and fresh 
84323,Royal Garden Hotel, Restaurant food not up to scratch leeks with fish 0 Nor was the room service food it was overdone and not particularly hot however the room service itself was quite speedy and the staff were polite friendly and efficient, Staff
84324,Royal Garden Hotel, Pricey but I guess you get what you pay for in London , On Kensington High Street so most facilities are available such as supermarkets banks underground station eateries and shops Breakfast is excellent with Western and Asian selections 
84325,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing , Bed was very comfortable shower was excellent modern room Overall excellelent experience Room service food was very good and reasonably priced In hotel dim sum restaurant was very good but couldn t book a return visit because there were no reasonable times available Great location too 
84326,Royal Garden Hotel, Absolutely Nothing , The staff delivered superb service especially Torie she was out of this world and blew us away with her attentiveness and level of service
84327,Royal Garden Hotel, Hotel bar is a bit pants No ambiance and no real thought as to its potential by Hotel management As not a lot of local comfortable pubs and its great to come back from a good night out and have a few nightcaps and head for bed on a roll Having a drink in the bar just shuts the evening down , Exec double Room was spacious and the bed was supremely comfortable requests for extras pillows etc were not a problem We had a second floor room not facing the road and it was very quiet also no real problems with guest noise or late night party animals Brilliant location for the RA and concerts and some nice local restaurants if you get time to explore Not a problem if we had of being staying for longer than a weekend Never ate in the hotel so no comment on this topic 
84328,Royal Garden Hotel, I can t think of anything, Amazing views from our suite overlooking Kensington gardens Staff were extremely helpful and I m already booked in for a return stay in June Very convenient position for Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall and easy walk from High Street Kensington tube 
84329,Royal Garden Hotel, Some of amenities towels and glasses were always not settled during my stay I had to ask roomkeeper to bring those stuff I didn t stay in such an unorganized room in any other 5 star hotels Plus reception was not so kind , Location
84330,Royal Garden Hotel, For some reason the supplies in our room were not properly replaced We had a double room and obviously there were two of us yet we often only were left with 1 face cloth or 1 set of cutlery That was our only complaint , The location of this hotel is perfect It is very close to the tube and there are many stores and restaurants within walking distance Most special is the location on the edge of Kensington Palace grounds Every morning and evening a walk through the gorgeous Kensington gardens makes a stay here extraordinary 
84331,Royal Garden Hotel, Breakfast is extra and expensive plus it is difficult to find out what is gluten free in the restaurant Why can the menu not have GF beside gluten free items as they do for vegetarians and hundreds of other hotels around the world do Endless checking with the chef is time consuming and wastes staff time A problem with Avery simple solution , Extremely helpful and friendly staff Ideal location for a concert at the Royal Albert Hall 
84332,Royal Garden Hotel, If your room is on the road you will hear the sound of police ambulance which is quite annoying they should make block for sound on the window to make it soundproof price not included the breakfast Other would be perfect hotel dont miss it , Location is perfect Helpful staff great staff the atmosphere of the hotel perfect for family Its make my London trip wonderful in memory DONT MISS IT 
84333,Royal Garden Hotel, The rooms were a bit small and the buffet in the morning didn t have a lot of variety for vegetarians The pillows were not comfortable I had To put 4 pillows on top of each other to try to sleep , Staff was super friendly accommodation was nice and clean Great location as well I would definitly do it again 
84334,Royal Garden Hotel, Noise The room was facing the street Noise is normal it is a busy street even at night you can hear ambulances and police cars The problem isn t the street the windows isolation I very poor The window frame and rest of the window structure isn t very adequate , Breakfast is good English and continental are very complete However is no easy to understand what s included in our room rate and not At the breakfast room lobby you are informed that the breakfast is or isn t included after seating you receive a menu with prices you need to ask several times the stuff if this or that is included Nice is the kindness from the stuff they are really helpful

84346,Royal Garden Hotel, Our room was booked some two months ago and was an executive room at around 400 for the night we had booking paperwork as conformation but on arrival we had no room We were told that it was because it wasn t ready and had a smoke problem We booked a none smoking room this was a Christmas present for my wife as we also went to a show We believe that the Southampton Football Club had our room as they were appearing in the EFL Cup final We in turn were offered a very small room of which you still tried to charge me for , None of it
84347,Royal Garden Hotel, Stayed in a twin room Incredibly hard beds Most uncomfortable nights sleep in a hotel Hair dryer useless despite asking for another one , Excellent location Lovely breakfast Great View

84350,Royal Garden Hotel, The spa does not live up to the Hotel IMO the treatments were good but it is small underground and not very polished This is really picking holes though as it is not a spa hotel , Great location right next to Kensington Palace Fantastic staff parking at the hotel and the valet parks your car too The hotel arranged some lovely chocolates as we were staying for a birthday Room of a great standard bathroom huge and immaculate For central London I thought this hotel was exceptional value for money it is far superior to many other hotels in the area charging a lot more 
84351,Royal Garden Hotel, We came a bit late in the afternoon and there was not much of a choice for afternoon tea First time we were there we were upgraded to a larger room always appreciate the extra space but we enjoyed it also this time and the breakfast was very good too , the location recepction and concierge staff were particularly nice

84361,Royal Garden Hotel, The rooms are small if to a high standard Size dictates that some of the expected items such as a trouser less or iron etc rang standard in the rooms , Location is great and staff very friendly and welcoming High standard hotel that isn t intimidating

84364,Royal Garden Hotel, nothing Everything was more than excellent, Everything From the room to the afternoon tea from the lobby to the friendly staff always ready to help This was one of the best experiences we had with a hotel in Europe
84365,Royal Garden Hotel, We stayed at 2 other 5 star hotels during this same visit to London and Royal Garden was the only one that did not off an included minibar although that that booking was booked the earliest and was the most exspensive one , The maids were amazing the room was always spotless and I quite loved the evening visit where they maid up the bed and left a water bottle before our night sleep The lovely mens out side the hotel with the lovely pipe hats were always there to answer your questions and get you a taxi loved them 
84366,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Great customer service from front desk when checking in early and moving us to a room with a better view without being asked to Cleaning staff were also lovely when we were running a bit late on check out and really friendly and helpful Great place to stay and a wonderful experience

84368,Royal Garden Hotel, The breakfast is very expensive so we ate down the road at the ivy brasserie which is lovely and much cheaper , The bed and bedding are superior and make for a very comfortable sleep I also like that even if you have a single room it is very spacious with a lovely queen size bed

84373,Royal Garden Hotel, Cooked breakfast wasn t great , Really good for children free scooter hire to use in the park their own check in and a goody bag room service menu was extensive and reasonable and great for kids Parking next door great location and a guide to different places to visit
84374,Royal Garden Hotel, When we arrived at the property at 2pm check in time after travelling for 4 hours to get there we were told our room wasn t ready and they would ring us when it was available so we went for a drink in the pub opposite the hotel and waited in there for 2 hours until we went back over to the hotel and I asked how long would our room be and the receptionist told us it was ready So not only did we have to wait an extra 2 hours over check in time we wasn t even contacted like we were told we would be This 2 hours meant we were late for our evening plans and we didn t even get a later check out time or anything complimentary Not happy about this experience , Clean and modern hotel Room was really nice with a comfy bed also very clean 
84375,Royal Garden Hotel, Wifi would be extremely frustrating if this was a business trip Continued to drop out and could only log in one device , Great position and an extremely over the top service without it being too sugary service from all levels of service Our room was exceptional although second level without a view into offices meant curtains closed If you stay and want the real English pub experience suggest The Goat across the road where the staff there are equally awesome 
84376,Royal Garden Hotel, We arrived a little early just after 2pm and were told the room wasn t quite ready and to get a complimentary coffee whilst waiting Fine but it wasn t ready until 3 40 Housekeeping knew we were there at 2pm so this was not acceptable especially at a so called 5 star We were given a voucher for 5 off lunch or 10 off dinner to compensate not off breakfast which might have been usable We had a King Room room 904 the carpet was dirty the pillows were flat and hard and the shower was over the bath in a huge bathroom English breakfast was 25 we didn t bother to stay for it We may have been unlucky with the service but we have stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel was probably the most disappointing On a positive note we had a lovely view over Kensington Palace from our room We wouldn t stay there again , Location is excellent on the edge of Hyde Park and a few minutes walk to the Royal Albert Hall 
84377,Royal Garden Hotel, The bar wasn t open for some reason or other for a drink before dinner When we asked they said it was a bank holiday but it wasn t , The bed was so comfy and the view from our window was wonderful

84382,Royal Garden Hotel, The hostesses in the breakfest room bar were useless quite stupid and unoriginased Sad story Change them and how they are working , Everything exept the morning clash with the stupid girls hosting the breakfest 
84383,Royal Garden Hotel, Therea strange approach with breakfast It is not included in the overall booking and on the spot you have to choose between continental and English breakfast and so all vague explanations push guests to near located restaurants, I ve got an upgrade apartment It was nice 
84384,Royal Garden Hotel, In our experience it was all wonderful , The Staff were excellent room clean spacious everyone went the extra mile We were made to feel like royalty
84385,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Complimentary upgrade to a better room with a Beautiful view overlooking Kensington Palace and Hyde Park Excellent location in a lovely area of London Tube stop nearby Friendly professional and welcoming staff 
84386,Royal Garden Hotel, Bar lounge is very strange they do not seem to care whether you are there or not service was slow we left during our first attempt We usually find this area in a hotel is important for quick or leisurely drop in but not here , We had a garden view room on 9th floor fantastic view across the lake park and right over to the City Sunrise at 7 45 was spectacular Arrival by car is a bit fraught as there is not much space out front but helpful staff took the bags and the car and all were whisked away Room very clean comfortable good wifi and well laid out Breakfast is only advertised at 25 each but there are actually a lot of other choices In the end we cancelled our breakfast booking up the road and had one in our room no room service charge 25 between us which was ample and good value and good quality 
84387,Royal Garden Hotel, It was all very good My only slightly negative criticism is that the shower could be more powerful , The staff really took my request for a quiet room seriously and were generally extremely pleasant and helpful Thank you 
84388,Royal Garden Hotel, Can t fiault anything, Extremely friendly and attentive staff absolutely made our weekend break to see jools holland at the royal Albert hall with the hotel being just a short stroll to the venue Beautiful comfortable bedroom to relax in and great food and drinks both in the Park Terrace pre theatre and Bertie s bar after show 
84389,Royal Garden Hotel, Bed was great pillows were perfect but duvet was a bit thin for my liking Like to sleep in a colder bedroom but duvet was to thin for that , Great view of Hyde Park attentive staff
84390,Royal Garden Hotel, The heater is very very loud and you cannot sleep when it is on I ask the reception for a solution and they promised to fix it but they never follow up it happened every night till the last night we spoken to the night manager and he himself managed to give us a portal heater what they were able to give us from the day 1 As I booked the room in non refundable rate for the first time even if I wanted to leave the hotel first day they charged then I stayed hoping for an improvement I had just one night sleep out of 4 nights stay All the furnitures got old and need to be replace for a five star hotel The floor carpet is dirty and iPod doc is still suitable for iPhone 4 No body cares about you and the worse feeling is ignorance even when I wanted to talk with morning manager at the check out he told me he is going to follow up the case and email me which they send me an email few hours after I left the hotel with the note that we checked and during your stay it was all the time the room temperature 25 but they never mentioned that if you turn on the heater for not freezing you cannot sleep because it is the noisiest The point is that I was already there and I was unsatisfied maybe I felt better if they left me an excuse note during my stay After all you will feel cold ignored stayin in a moderate facilities room it is a 3 star hotel now It was better in the past , It wasn t my first stay there then whatever I post is my experience over These years The only plus point now is location for this hotel 
84391,Royal Garden Hotel, The spa was disappointing to say the least it was like a back street spa 1 small room Nowhere to change A chair to put my clothes on 102 for this experience Disgraceful and unbelievable for a hotel of your standard, Food was excellent as were the staff
84392,Royal Garden Hotel, Breakfast had no green foods like salad olives leaves 20 minute to get a cup of tea very slow service On weekend buffet everywhere smells food Rooms furniture is not 5star standard Small lobby , Kettle and cofee and water complimentary

84401,Royal Garden Hotel, Could not find fault at all, The hotel was excellent staff courteous and efficient A wonderful stay The restaurants were of a high quality Recommend the duck in the Asian restaurant a great culinary experience We would thoroughly recommend this hotel 
84402,Royal Garden Hotel, I was cold in bed needed a thicker duvet don t have heating on due to the noise, we enjoyed the buffet C rolled salmon would have been appreciated not the standard of the ritz breakfast
84403,Royal Garden Hotel, There was some confusion our room size we thought we booked for 2 adults and 2 staff but we re only provided with a single sofa bed in our room so not big enough for two children to sleep on The room was at the back and we were woken up by the rubbish men emptying what sounded like tonnes of recycling at 6am on a Saturday morning It just wasn t a great stay I ve booked one more weekend there That will be the deciding weekend to see if we stay there again , The location is excellent We stayed their for two weekends the first weekend we had an excellent stay amazingly accommodating staff lovely spacious room Second weekend was like we were in a different hotel a hotel that just wasn t as good disappointing as our first stay was really good 
84404,Royal Garden Hotel, I was disappointed the Spa was unavailable for treatments as that was the main reason I chose this hotel The Spa was under new management so my online bookings for treatment requests had not been acknowledged , It was a beautiful hotel Very friendly and efficient staff 
84405,Royal Garden Hotel, Some staff were not nice They never smile and they did not help me carring heavy suitcase That remains me at Fortunm and Mason that some treated me so badly because they hate Asian People We did not do any thing bad The room I booked from Booking com sale Yes I might had paid cheaper but I was expecting the room had nice view We had King Suite on 3rd floor maybe the worst room for King suit And the most annoying was that they did not clean the bathmat and towel There was a blood on the towel For that reason I will never go to this hotel and never recommend this hotel I was too expecting , The location was fantastic We can take buses to anywhere for sightseeing and shopping 
84406,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, This is our absolute favourite hotel in London This is mainly due to the wonderful helpful staff and their great service starts the moment the car door is opened The quality and size of rooms bedding and bathrooms are great too Breakfast is absolutely wonderful with a fantastic selection of all things desired But the service all over the hotel is the best of all 
84407,Royal Garden Hotel, A twin room was booked for my autistic son and his carer The beds were next to each other and should have been moved at each end of the room I thought the cost was rather expensive considering the disappointing view A bottle of gin was offered in the room at a cost of 85 needless to say it was declined , The staff were fantastic 
84408,Royal Garden Hotel, It s very minor but there was a creak in one of the floor boards on the step but it wasn t a bother what so ever, The bed was amazingly comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate
84409,Royal Garden Hotel, Internet a little erratic but was given as complimentary addition on arrival, Pleasant and accommodating reception staff Room ready on arrival early Good breakfast 
84410,Royal Garden Hotel, The only negative point I can make about the hotel is the fact the wifi was not free In this day and age it s a given nearly everywhere you go that there will be wifi So to arrive and find out it was 5 for 2 hours was a bit of a surprise , Couldn t fault our stay the room was incredible with beautiful views especially for sunrise I was even brought a plate of chocolates on arrival to celebrate my 25th birthday which was a very lovely touch from the staff The restaurant we visited was also very attentive and had a lovely menu we re vegetarian so this was also catered to well at dinner as we were offered the choice of items from the lunch menu too The room was obviously well cared for and felt very fresh and clean on arrival Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London and will be visiting again 
84411,Royal Garden Hotel, We have been before to the hotel but this time staff not friendly and room smells and they refuse to get us coffee machine and she gave us street view and it was sooooo noisey she said we were full , Location
84412,Royal Garden Hotel, The length of our stay I didn t want to leave , I liked every staff member with whom I had contact They were all friendly and efficient The food was excellent as was the service Natalie I hope I am remembering correctly at the front desk should have a raise 
84413,Royal Garden Hotel, Unavoidably noisy could hear the drunkard lewdness from the club from the fifth floor Vomiting people outside the lobby I could not even leave Had to pay for wifi although booking com stated wifi was included was told to book through the hotel directly in order to gain access to free wifi Housekeeping opened my luggage which was then denied by the hotel Bad location situated next to a night club, Clean
84414,Royal Garden Hotel, The bedroom could have been a bit more luxurious but the bathroom was a good size and very clean , Food in the restaurant was excellent and all off the staff were very efficient and friendly Relaxing atmosphere lovely view from the bedroom overlooking Hyde park 
84415,Royal Garden Hotel, It did not feel value for money We had to request WIFI to be made free which it was Breakfast was not included Empty water bottles in the room were not replaced as these are not complimentary Walls between the rooms are too thin and could here noisy neighbors To get a cup of coffee late in the evening was a challenge and had to put up with uncourteous staff at the bar I was told that I would have got a better deal if I had booked directly with the hotel rather than with a third party platform , The hotel was clean and concierge where helpful 
84416,Royal Garden Hotel, We didn t like to spend our first night in a room without any view as we specially had requested a room at a high floor with a nice view they were willing to help and have changed the room on the second day with a spacious room at the 9th floor with a beautiful view One more point is that the room service breakfast is poor for the value for money,No Positive
84417,Royal Garden Hotel, The wifi is not free you have to buy it is costy The room doesnt have iron iron board gitta ask for it There is no coffee machine and in my room the kettle was inside the closet Plus the closed was small, The view of the rooms overlooking the garden is mesmerising The staff are friendly and the houskeeping pass by twice cleaning in the morning tidying things at evening so that room is ready for sleep after along day
84418,Royal Garden Hotel, A small lift for disabled persons from the street level to the entrance was malfunctioning on day 1 OK next day , Most if all the staff the service was the best I have ever experienced Everybody went out of their way to help and answer our questions The location is fine too a walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall 
84419,Royal Garden Hotel, the pillows too soft I am a room in a higher floor but the provided me in the 1st floor I miss the view of the Hyde park which I bay for it, the location
84420,Royal Garden Hotel, There where things I thought would have been in the room like biscuits etc you had to pay for little things like that The breakfast was very small to two tiny eggs on a very small piece of toast , The room was quite comfortable
84421,Royal Garden Hotel, Front desk staff did not explain why or what they were doing on check in had to ask Requested rooms adjacent or interconnecting they did not provide rooms were miles away from each other Park terrace restaurant staff slow and did not even get a copy of the bill to sign we had enough of waiting so just walked out then they had the nerve to post a gratuity on our room bill won t be staying again ,No Positive
84422,Royal Garden Hotel, I liked everything , The room size was just perfect I have requested a smoking room and they were able to accommodate my request Room service was the best I have had so far The quality of food was excellent and the way dishes were prepared gives the menu a realistic credit Impressed with the chefs Bravo 
84423,Royal Garden Hotel, Staff not cooperative Called 3 times to get complimentary bottles of water which must be in the room upon arrival Not connect the phone if you called a wrong extension, Location
84424,Royal Garden Hotel, Guests booking with Booking com are charged for use of Internet , Great place to say especially if you are going to the Royal Albert Hall Excellent pre theatre dinner 
84425,Royal Garden Hotel, Only things missing in my opinion is a steam room sauna which are nice to have after a days activities PLUS an outside terrace area With such fantastic views across London it was a shame not to be able to enjoy them in the open No free Wifi this is a must these days so very poor in my opinion especially at the rate paid, Staff really friendly the complimentary touches that seem to be missing these days i e a bottle still water by the bed the radio was on low and a chocolate when the bed gets turned down at night Good choice in the bar too
84426,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Hotel staff welcoming courteous friendly and helpful Spacious and comfortable rooms and bathrooms in both King Room and Executive King Room for two and three adults respectively Strong wifi signal Excellent location 5 minute walk to tube station bus stop in front of the hotel and on foot to Hyde Park V A Museum Royal Albert Hall etc Good numbers of cafe and restaurants in the area to suit different bugets 
84427,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Andrea at the front desk is a great employee super helpful and professional Overall great staff and a perfect location at edge of Kensington Palace grounds 
84428,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing They d thought of everything , The smart decor freshness of the paintwork furniture fixtures and fittings polite and helpful staff room facilities a full minibar great views lovely bar food on 10th floor if you feel like a light meal excellent room service 
84429,Royal Garden Hotel, No free Wi Fi no clarity with breakfasts we were charged differently all the time some of the staff members were not able to explain the difference at all , Situated near the park lots of restaurants near by tube is near by comfortable rooms and extremely comfortable bed 
84430,Royal Garden Hotel, We booked two rooms at the hotel Before arriving we were told that we could check in from 2pm When we arrived at the hotel at 1 45pm we were told that we could check in to one of the rooms but not the other We were then not allowed to check in to the second room until 4pm That meant that we were rushing to get to our performance in the afternoon I find it incredibly disappointing that the hotel does not offer wifi as part of the price of the room particularly as prices begin at around 210 a night How can this be justified , Location is absolutely fantastic The hotel is located in the centre of Kensington next to the palace within walking distance of the underground and Hyde Park
84431,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, It s right next to Hyde Park Good view and nice walk in the park Lots of good shops in the neighbourhood and as it s very near High Street Kensington tube station makes it so easy to get around 
84432,Royal Garden Hotel, In seven weeks of travel this was the only hotel that had Wifi fees Considering the high price of rooms this is cheap and outdated, Great location At entrance to park buses right outside near shops restaurants Kensington Palace Royal Albert Hall Nice dining room with good food good value Particularly like having a comfortable 2 seater couch in the room 
84433,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing it was perfect for us , Staff were extremely helpful and friendly room clean light and airy with a relaxing sitting area over looking Kensington Gardens 
84434,Royal Garden Hotel, Accommodation is a little expensive which is even more expensive when the cost of the internet and car parking 35 per day is added , Location is ideal for shopping and its convenient for shows in the West End The hotel seemingly operates and manages very efficiently and everything works 
84435,Royal Garden Hotel, The alcoholic drinks are slightly over priced which is a shame as it discourages people from having a nightcap , Although the hotel is very central the rooms are lovely and quiet I loved the comfy bed and fabulous bedding The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the restaurants are good also I stayed by myself this time and felt very safe The concierge staff are very helpful and have great knowledge of the city and what is going on I have stayed there twice and will stay again 
84436,Royal Garden Hotel, Having to pay for internet access is one of the most annoying facets in any hotel stay , I ve stayed at the Royal Garden many times and always found it to be very comfortable The location is excellent for any activity you d care to undertake while in London 
84437,Royal Garden Hotel, They didn t release the amount that they blocked on my card upon initial arrival Although i checked out and paid all my dues I went back to my country and was shocked to see a whopping amount deducted from my account when i followed up they told me the Hotel you stayed in never released it I then had to make numerous calls to the Hotel in order for them to release the blocked amount and til today they havent They blocked it on June 1 and its June 29 today I felt I was ripped off,No Positive
84438,Royal Garden Hotel, Needed more pillows but we didn t ask , This location was perfect for all of our needs Close to modern amenities and easy to get to the other locations we wanted to visit 
84439,Royal Garden Hotel, They gave a street view room this time and I wasn t happy about it On bed I can hear every single bus car ambulance in the street and it s one busy street Very annoying Just make sure you avoid that when you check in , I like this hotel and always book in it Good location and freindly staff 
84440,Royal Garden Hotel, The fact that wifi costs 20 pounds per day for booking com customers as opposed to clients that book directly After two nights and much insistence they gave it to me for free but it is not right , The rooms are spacious and modern 
84441,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Great and friendly staff and right next to the park peaceful and beautiful location far away from the chaos of other overly packed tourists areas And next to WHOLEFOODS 
84442,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Great room for sleeping Quiet and totally dark Well designed with maximum facilities for square footage Terrific location for enjoying London s magnificent parks 
84443,Royal Garden Hotel, Having to pay for wifi France and Italy wifi is free as in USA Nowadays not really acceptable , Loved my room with view to the park the attention in detail to celebrate our 35th anniversary made me wish to return next year 
84444,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, The staff were excellent very responsive and efficient The room very comfortable wonderful view and very convenient for leisure activities We would certainly stay here again 
84445,Royal Garden Hotel, The TV could have had a channel or two for children Disney Disney Jr Nickelodeon some kind of BBC kids All we had was news channels one sitcom channel and a lot of muslim channels , Nice use of space Comfortable bed safe location in the city There is a whole foods a block away The sofa bed was a plus but very small 
84446,Royal Garden Hotel, Room smelt smokey the hotel generally looks and feels tired and I wouldn t rate it as 5 stars It doesn t compare anywhere near other 5 star hotels in which I ve stayed in London The bar is very poor and very dated , Staff were professional and friendly Location is good for Kensington the palace and gardens and a little further away Knightsbridge 
84447,Royal Garden Hotel, The sofa bed for such a high quality hotel was awful It was made up for us while we were out and had a massive bend in the metal bar at the foot of it The house maid could not help but know this as we saw it on entering the room so it should have been fixed We had a man come and look at it but as it was 11 30pm it could not be replaced due to limited staff at that time of night so he and my husband bent it back up as best they could and he said a new one would be put in the following day It was not replaced and the following night it had a printed sign on it to say no sitting on the end of the bed we were not impressed Felt it was a waste of our holiday time to follow up the issue We had similar beds over our 6 weeks of travel and they were of a much superior quality than this one not good enough for this hotel , Great spot for what we wanted to do in London Room service breakfast was fabulous and the table it was served on kept the hot food warm while eating our cereal As we were travelling with our adult daughter the room size was great for 3 people We did book an executive king room The bar in the hotel was also fabulous 
84448,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Garden view rooms overlook Hyde Park and back of Kensington Gardens quiet and peaceful Excellent bus service to Piccadilly and Trafalgar areas Beautiful Japanese garden in nearby Holland Park 
84449,Royal Garden Hotel, You have to pay for wifi connections which today is very poor The room rate is high but acceptable for the standard of hotel so it should include free wifi If I was on business I would not stay there, Friendly staff comfortable rooms Close to good shopping and restaurants in Kensington all within walking distance as is the Albert Hall and Hyde Park of course 
84450,Royal Garden Hotel, Reception staff were a little condescending once they knew we had book through Booking com The wifi was free for other guests but not for Booking com guests which I found vey irritating , Good position Excellent breakfast Very spacious and comfortable room
84451,Royal Garden Hotel, We had 2 rooms The hotel blocked separate amounts on my credit card on each of the rooms However when checking out they had to combine into a single receipt and made a mess as a result they blocked again on my credit card without releasing the previous block s Will take a few days to sort this out and in the mean time my card got maxed , Excellent helpful people all around Great location nice room size for London lots of places to ear within a short walk 
84452,Royal Garden Hotel, The hallway acoustics were pretty bad Admittedly a light sleeper but noise in hallway hindered my rest sufficiently , Ideal location to get around this beautiful city without a cab The tube and buses were very close and convenient Booked a Garden Twin room that looked out over Hyde Park and KensingtonPalace which was fantastic 
84453,Royal Garden Hotel, Pillows and room facilities not up to 5 star standard and no view Plus took a payment from us twice costing nearly 700 for 1 night , The location of the hotel 
84454,Royal Garden Hotel, Could not get into bedroom on one of the days and had to wait for someone to come and sort out the problem Extremely helpful mam sorted everything out for us , The extremely comfortable beds
84455,Royal Garden Hotel, None , The room was spacious The view of Kensington Gardens was fantastic Staff were very helpful and thoughtful They set up the sofa bed for use as sofa during the day and as bed before night My daughter even got chocolates for her birthday 
84456,Royal Garden Hotel, The shower is a bit weird as it has no separation from the rest of the room except for curtain so it can get very wet in the toilet if you are not careful We asked for an iron and the thing that was brought was very old and bit scary to use on white tee shirts as the steam holes sputtered yellowish rusted bits when steam was on So we just gave my husband s shirt and trousers for pressing by the professionals in the hotel for 12 pounds and it was done in half an hour The WiFi is 20 pounds a day which is pretty expensive but we were offered complimentary WiFi for the whole stay because our room was not ready until 4 pm , It was three of us me my husband and our friend There was enough space for all of us in one room one king size bed and one couch that was made daily while we were out The bathroom is huge and very nice There was complementary water for each of us every night when we came back Staff was friendly and accommodating Our window faced the busy High Kensington street but windows were perfectly soundproof and we didn t hear a thing 
84457,Royal Garden Hotel, can t understand why in this day and age wifi is not free 20 per day ridiculous amount to charge , convenient and comfortable great views in garden rooms
84458,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, The rooms were amazing And there was an error with our reservation and I was impressed with how quickly staff took ownership and compensated us We also had our event OAA89 there and it was excellent
84459,Royal Garden Hotel, no outdoor garden seating area pillows too soft and sunk into them we requested an upper story room a long time in advance but only got a 2nd floor room very hot walking around the hotel although room was lovely and cool due to temperature control bath was very slippery despite having a non slip mat , the location the classiness of the d cor the staff the facilities music available in bathroom amazing food and service in berties bar
84460,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location and easy to commute to central London Oxford street or Knightsbrige for example Room service will always arrive earlier than the estimated time so service was not only quick but at a high standard Staff were beyond helpful friendly and polite Room and bathroom were exceptionally clean upon arrival and the bed was super comfy The view from the room was also amazing but the view from the Ming Jiang restaurant was even better One of the best hotel stays I ve experienced 
84461,Royal Garden Hotel, Pictures of the Kensington Palace on the website lead to think that the building fa ade is superb and neoclassic Nothing further from the truth Despite this the services of the hotel are quite nice ,No Positive
84462,Royal Garden Hotel, The hotel services are outdated compared to other similar hotels No free wifi and spa facilities are not real a hotel spa was just used as advertising When I called the spa it was just one guy who showed up sometimes to the hotel, Room was big and bed was comfortable Staff were very nice 
84463,Royal Garden Hotel, Probably not the best location for theatre land depends on purpose of visit , Ideal for our visit to The Albert Hall lovely view over the Park The staff were very attentive despite us dining at 10 30pm after the concert 
84464,Royal Garden Hotel, Hate rain showers , Love the location At end of Kensington High St with its shops and restaurants overlooks park buses right outside Tube 5 mins walk Comfortable rooms with great views The Terrace Restaurant is great very good value spacious bright room friendly staff 
84465,Royal Garden Hotel, I have stayed in five star hotels in New York and South Africa which were far more luxurious and better value for money , Location was excellent Loved the fact how even though our room was overlooking the High Street we didn t hear the traffic Bus right outside to get around London 
84466,Royal Garden Hotel, Room had no outlook but then it was one of the cheaper rooms , A comfortable practical room in a good location next to Hyde Park and all the conveniences of Kensington really the only downside to the location is the ltd for London frequency on the district line branch to Hight St Kensington 
84467,Royal Garden Hotel, breakfast overpriced and not value for money , Excellent location Magnificent views over Kensington Gardens Comfortable room beautiful bathroom Genuinely hospitable and helpful staff 
84468,Royal Garden Hotel, Wifi is charged at GBP20 a day I don t know what age the management is living is to do something like this Overall the hotel is expensive for what is on offer even with the good location Add on wifi and breakfast and the rate suddenly is 60 pounds more, Room is well maintained Staff is helpful but sometimes needs a little push
84469,Royal Garden Hotel, The overall design of the hotel wasn t cozy for me rooms are very comfortable though , Great fitness center Friendly and helpful staff Location is good but wouldn t recommend it if visiting London for the first time The view from our room Free water every day If you ordering via Booking com the wi fi and breakfasts aren t free but this was sorted out for us
84470,Royal Garden Hotel, Only objection was having to pay 5 for 2 hours wifi In an age where free wifi is the norm it s very bad that they put this additional cost on, Emailed hotel explaining it was a special occasion and requested a room overlooking Hyde Park Arrived and had a lovely spacious room with a fantastic view Staff were also very helpful
84471,Royal Garden Hotel, Had to change my room 3 times 1st time air condition didn t work then after 2 days in the 2nd room they moved me out problem with water pipe Moved me out in a bad way 3rd room air condition didnt work and they didnt care to fix and was tired to even talk to them Hotel bar lobby small and the bar most of the time reserved you can t work or have a drink more important people reserved it than you are and no were else to work and you cant sit in the lobby and have a drink even the bar is closed You cant work in the lobby if you open your laptop to work and then you went to stretch your legs or toilet you laptop will disappear with all your stuff a security guard will remove them as its not allowed to leave your stuff in the lobby for more than 30 seconds other wise they will take it and throw it out too expensive for this kind of service so stay away from this hotel Also it needs refurbishing TV keeps hanging must plug it on off and small TVs, Location Hotel is clean
84472,Royal Garden Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like However it was quite pricey for one night , Breakfast staff friendly Location in relation to Royal Albert Hall was great which was reason for stay Also good to have KP Gardens next door had a lovely walk around there 
84473,Royal Garden Hotel, Nothing, A very friendly welcome they even welcomed us by name entering the hotel Our room was upgraded to face Kensington Gardens on the eighth floor Outstanding and very clean Quick room service We can t wait to come back

84476,Royal Garden Hotel, After I plugged the kettle in black smoke started coming out from the plug in the socket I freaked out and called the security They apologised sincerely but I probably wouldn t stay there ever again taking the price into account , The location is amazing as I can oversee Kensington Palace from my window Staffs were generally very friendly and welcoming It was clean Chinese restaurant Min Jiang is the best in town in terms of food and view 
84477,Royal Garden Hotel, Didn t have breakfast there as 50 for continental for two people was just to much, The staff were fantastic and I was there on business and the IT staff were brilliant and the most helpful I have ever come across Cheers guys Paul West Ent Ltd
84478,Royal Garden Hotel, Free WI FI would have been a bonus, Everything was brilliant from booking in to booking out Very friendly staff and exceptionally clean comfortable

84482,Royal Garden Hotel, The room was cold for a day and when they fixed was to warm for the rest of my stay Did not sleep well and very annoying , I was several years ago at Royal Garden and was beautiful and one of my best hotel to stay Time change everything and anything in this case in the worst The only thing that did not change the scale is the staff at the room really good service 
84483,Royal Garden Hotel, We felt the sofa and desk should have been round the other way to maximise the view over park Just saying , Very comfy bed Lots of space in the room especially helped by the mirrors 
84484,Royal Garden Hotel, Although for us it s a nice walk to centre some may think it is a little out However tram stops are right outside Not really a dislike for us but could be for some , Very comfortable Good choice of food Large room
84485,Royal Garden Hotel, Less expensive more informal place to eat would be ideal especially for breakfast , Loved the size of the room and the family friendly staff Plus adjacency to a large park was huge traveling with young children 
84486,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, the hotel was very nice close to the park Bus stop right in front of the hotel that takes you to knights bridge and Oxford very clean and staff clean the rooms well every day 
84487,Royal Garden Hotel, Knowledge of the one concierge about public transport should have been better , The breakfast was superb and the view over Kensington gardens from the room great
84488,Royal Garden Hotel, The bedroom smelt of stale smoke and should have been identified by housekeeping I immediately raised the issue with reception and they sent an air spray No offer to move us to another room despite the housekeeper agreeing that the smell was unacceptable Very poor customer service and as a returning lapsed guest I m unimpressed ,No Positive
84489,Royal Garden Hotel, Having to leave for home after just one night, The hotel was top class from the moment we checked in and were offered an upgrade The hotel pulled all the stops out to accommodate our request for a late table in the restaurant and catered for all our needs Fabulous location 15 minute walk to Harrods We will be back
84490,Royal Garden Hotel, The staff respodible for cleaning are nice and friendly they however needs to clean much better Also i would like to mention the matress of the bed wasnt comfortable at all i had back pain as i felt the matress are old It will great if to reconsider chaning them, Overall my stay was great in this hotel comfy and cosy staying i had a room with view to the Hyde Park it was stunning the hotel has helpful staff good location as many things near it such as pharmcy supermarkey coffee shops More importantly i felt the hotel has good security in terms if i lost my key card they only give when they check I would definitly choose to stay in it again 
84491,Royal Garden Hotel, Christina the housekeeper who started to harass us at 08 50am and didn t stop until 11 50am on the day of check out VERY disappointing , The staff especially in the downstairs bar 
84492,Royal Garden Hotel, Waiting 3 hours on arrival my arrival time was around 12 noon, No 1 location and the excellent and help full staff No 2 the stunning views of the park from my room

84497,Royal Garden Hotel, We didn t have a view from our room when this had been promised We were moved immediately but the new room smelt of smoke , The bathroom was excellent 
84498,Royal Garden Hotel, Considering the pricing per night I would consider including a basic breakfast and wi fi in the base price even for non direct bookings, Very spacious room with large and comfortable bed and sofa bed for the children Spacious and recently updated bathroom Good quality food served by the park terrace and very good breakfast options The staff paid a lot of attention to making the children feel welcome starting by providing an activity pack and being very friendly with them at all times 
84499,Royal Garden Hotel, Change the towels and bathrobes they are old Why not have a loyalty card for frequent stay with discounts , Location staff Not my first time at the hotel 
84500,Royal Garden Hotel,No Negative, Definitely book the garden rooms They re worth the money The garden rooms were lovely and I asked for a high level room which was provided so the views were amazing overlooking kensington gardens I also requested for a message to be left in the room when we arrive for my mother as this trip was her gift on Mother s day The staff not only left a message but also a plate of delicious chocolate truffles They definitely go the extra mile The hotel is situated at the start of kensington high street so access to great shopping is a stones throw away Twin beds were nice and comfy and the bathroom is great

84575,Royal Garden Hotel, Thought it was expensive for what it was Housekeeping knocked on door despite do not disturb being on Extortionate mini bar prices , Check in was very efficient even though it was busy we were dealt with quickly Parking facilities were handy being underneath the hotel and I was sent a link via email for a discounted rate Concierge was helpful Room was nice and we were supplied with an iron and ironing board when requested

84605,Royal Garden Hotel, Arrived carrying well travelled backpaks which we dropped on entering reception only to have some guy shove a card in my face telling me I m security are those your s Well if he was really security he would have seen us arrive I truly feel that as we did not arrive by taxi carrying brand name luggage we were treated differently In my life I have learned not to judge a book by its cover and nor should the staff at this hotel treat us like commoners We have stayed at better classed establishments with better service and attention than was received at this one , Location for Royal Albert Hall
84606,Royal Garden Hotel, Inconsistency of service Staff at concierge desk are very helpful but staff at reception can be unpredictable Inability or unwillingness of staff to control the noise level of their guests after 10 00 pm , Proximity to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park

84613,Royal Garden Hotel, Having to pay 20 pounds for wifi for one night is way beyond what I would expect Virtually all hotels have guest wifi for free around the world If I was to stay again I would be requiring free wifi or a max charge in the vicinity of 2 pounds, All ok the staff were friendly Concierge at the desk in the glasses
84614,Royal Garden Hotel, Bathroom was broke Had a leak in my bathroom first time and the manager insured me next time I come back things will be better This time the toilet seat was broken and they didn t even offer me anything a part from fruit and water I don t think this a standard of 5 star hotel, Location
