36835,Park International Hotel, Room was very small Our safe was broken which we reported twice but it was never seen to Room key deactivated twice Carpet in the hall needs a good clean and curtains in the room need a wash , Nice location in Kensington Comfortable bed and good shower Free wifi was reliable 
36836,Park International Hotel, the main of the room was very very small the bad was also very small the window couldn t open and the view was to stairs of something also it felt like someone was smokers room, the bathroom was the only highlight of the entire facilities it felt clean new and updated 
36837,Park International Hotel, Room a tad small but adequate as we were only there for 1 night we had 2 single rooms Rooms weren t ready and they were keen to accommodate us but when they discovered we had booked through booking com we felt that their interest waned We went off and had lunch while they were preparing it , Close proximity to everything we wanted walked through Hyde Park to Memorials and Kensington Palace Plenty of sops and restaurants nearby Excellent door staff who helped us with luggage and transport Uber to the airport was convenient and better than the train Great bar staff Happy Hour worth it 
36838,Park International Hotel, The location is wonderful and convenient The showers do not drain very well but the bathrooms are very stylish and the sink water is drinkable , The breakfast was delicious and the staff went out of their way to make sure that we all had what we like to eat I suggest notifying the hotel beforehand if you have any food allergies The breakfast room manager made sure to buy margarine and soy milk for my daughter who is allergic to milk 
36839,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Attentive friendly staff at reception and breakfast room Attractively furnished room with plenty of storage Ample breakfast Good location for museums and Royal Albert Hall Gloucester Road underground station nearby 
36840,Park International Hotel, The room we stayed in was in the basement and looked out onto a brick wall which was only 2 meters away from the window The noise of the trains rattled the room and woke you up everytime a train went by The shower in the room was constantly getting blocked ,No Positive
36841,Park International Hotel, The room was right on Cromwell Road and incredibly noisy even though I had requested a quiet room , Not much The location is not bad in south Kensington quite near the tube 
36842,Park International Hotel, Earlier check in , Great breakfast comfortable bed small but adequate room for 1 night stay Location was great being 5 minutes from Gloucester Road tube station and 20 minutes walk from Hyde Park where we were going to a concert 
36843,Park International Hotel, I selected this hotel as a late booking Considering that normally this room would have cost over 300 I was disappointed I have stayed in higher quality rooms for a fraction of the price There weren t even any biscuits let alone complimentary water in the fridge the cleanliness was of a high standard but the room was small and average I felt that despite the late booking discount I was paying for location rather than accommodation , Staff were very friendly although on check in there is an assumption that all visitors require a passport Concierge were very accommodating in holding my baggage for most of the check out day whilst I did a little sightseeing before catching a late train Hooking into the Wi Fi presented no issues 
36844,Park International Hotel, our friends were given the double room and the twin room where me and my wife stayed with 2 year old child was small and crammed shower was broken and we had to give our child a cleanup by filling glasses of water from the sink were then told that they may not be able to fix the shower but then some manager and handyman did fix it but told us to not to adjust the hot cold settings our child had bumped his head on the side of the bed twice due to the room size and furniture and baby cot was taking us most of the space we spoke to the reception but were told that they will not be able to do anything for us baby cot and beds were so close that our child was able to get on the bed but at times lost control and fell on to the floor but the staff didnt seem to care much one of us had to spend the night awake to ensure that our kid doesn t hurt himself badly poor poor experience , breakfast was tasty and plentiful satisfied everyone 
36845,Park International Hotel, The tiling in the bathroom would need some attention The hotel is pretty far located from the City but has good access to the tube The price was quite high especially if you consider the location , Nice and friendly staff Clean and comfortable room 
36846,Park International Hotel, The room smelt heavily of cigarette smoke When mentioned to staff at reception they only said this is a non smoking hotel as if that somehow dismissed my claim Shocking lack of interest in guest feedback Will not stay again ,No Positive
36847,Park International Hotel, Non sound proof room , I guessed room is just refurbished I loved everything Actual room better than a photos Minibar in a room was good Helpful crew Nice bar lobby 
36848,Park International Hotel, Nothing really, everything was just perfect We dined one night had drinks and cocktails also tea and scones sitting in the lovely reception area The tube was just along the street which was very convenient for going into town and the theatre Even the weather was perfect 
36849,Park International Hotel, Nothing to complain , Hotel is in a nice central location Staff is very friendly and pretty good room service Hotel has a bar that serves very very good cocktails on happy hours and food is very good for London Definitely will be a returning customer 
36850,Park International Hotel, payment completed on another card on the day however funds were still locked from holding card though asked receptionist to amend still hadnt happened 5 days later , location nice comfy bed
36851,Park International Hotel, Restoration of building across street created noise and activity during day Rooms are small , Located in the Kensington area close to many restaurants and tube Lovely small boutique hotel Breakfast was excellent and ample Staff professional and helpful This property had the Handy smartphone for guests to use during stay instead of your own no cost Will stay again when visiting London 
36852,Park International Hotel, 3 bookings made 2 out of 3 wrong Charged for a cancelled booking where no fee was due Chairs etc in one room very very badly stained No one at hotel could handle complaint as they were all in a meeting Mmmmm ,No Positive
36853,Park International Hotel, The only downside for me was the cracked tiles on the bathroom floor as it did detract from what was otherwise a beautifully appointed bathroom but it is only a minor detail , We booked 2 single rooms which were well appointed Air conditioning in the room made for a great addition especially as we were there on the hottest weekend of the year so far The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel surprisingly quiet with no disturbances at night The breakfast was extensive There was a huge variety and something for absolutely everyone Staff were very attentive and courteous We also frequented the bar area and took advantage of their offers for cocktails 2 for the price of one from 5pm until 9pm which was well received All the staff in the hotel are exceptionally polite and attentive Nothing is too much trouble Free wifi was an added bonus All in all this hotel was excellent for location comfort cleanliness and value for money and I would highly recommend it 
36854,Park International Hotel, Room 323 should be used for single person No where to put suitcases tiny for two people Room type said double room suitable for 3 We are retuning in November but sadly won t stay there because if the room size Staff vey friendly and polite shame about the room ,No Positive
36855,Park International Hotel, Breakfast was ok could do with more fresh fruit not much of a choice At checkout there was a mix up with our bill they wanted to charge us double for our upgrade after 10mins of my refusal manager agreed with me but there was no apology they never even asked if we had enjoyed our stay , We upgraded our room to delux for 40 night extra room 106 has great view on a quirky London st a great balcony this made up for it not having a bath 
36856,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Lovely and clean hotel with a pleasant staff Full english breakfast is really full Location is also great close to Natural History and V A museums Harrods and Hyde Park Actually if you are a fast walker almost every central amenities are at your distance I definitely will recommend this hotel to my friends 
36857,Park International Hotel, Some rooms quite small and dark one small window Property in need of upgrading which is starting to be done now , Staff a real asset to the property 
36858,Park International Hotel, Temperatura in the room hot without a c too colld with the a c because of a limited range of regulation of the a c , Good breakfast Very Nice staff Close to a underground station airport lane 
36859,Park International Hotel, shabby carpet in the hallway leading to the lifts the room looked very tired and the single beds were VERY small , It was a standard room the staff were helpful 
36860,Park International Hotel, N a, The staff was very courteous and helpful The concierge was extremely helpful and helped arrange transportation to the train station The location is excellent with easy access to two tube stations Also great location for multiple restaurants and grocery stores The room is perfect for a solo traveler 
36861,Park International Hotel, The double room is way too small for the price that you pay for 2 people They need to seriously buy new mattresses and carpets our mattress felt like it was 30 years old too soft and they need to put in block out in their curtains The staff in the breakfast room were inconsistent with service some days friendly other days indifferent almost like ignoring you Some people just got seated and then were offered coffee tea immediately and most days we sat for a while before we got offered coffee tea or we had to get someone s attention and ask for it On our 10th day we heard that one of the guests next to us was offered hot chocolate cappuccino etc But we were never informed that we had a choice The plates weren t always clean , The best thing about this hotel is the location Just a block away from the tube station big variety of restaurants nearby as well as museums They offer a good breakfast good variety to choose from I especially liked the danish pastries eggs hashbrowns and french toast 
36862,Park International Hotel,No Negative, The bar restaurant is an excellent place for a solo traveller good food great staff very welcoming Good place to do have a beer and do some work also 
36863,Park International Hotel, Rooms are too small solo room not comfortable to be there and it has some dated furniture , Close to the Underground station Friendly staff but a little dated furniture 
36864,Park International Hotel, The staff were not very friendly and the toiletries and tea etc weren t replaced each day, The location was great and the rooms for London were a decent size
36865,Park International Hotel,No Negative, i book hotel cause it mentioned it has gym Actually gym i a joke its size of 4sqm and fits only one person Very dissapointing Also they put me in the room in the basement 
36866,Park International Hotel, Air conditioning hard to set Flush buttons of toilet sometimes stuck so filling water continued running , Spacious and bright room very close to Gloucester Road underground Quiet room but could hear some rumble of underground Many nice choices at breakfast buffet Definitely will be our first choice hotel on next stays in London 
36867,Park International Hotel, The initial tiny room , We booked a standard double room but when we arrived the room was TINY and not suitable for 2 adults our 2 suitcases took up all the walking space in the room We upgraded to a junior suite which was an excellent size The lady at Reception who assisted us was very friendly and efficient Alessia was her name and she was superb 
36868,Park International Hotel, The first room we were allocated had a smell to it as though someone had been smoking and it had tried to be covered up by air freshener cleaning products the second room was completely different but small for a deluxe room, Bed very comfortable room spotless food in the restaurant was first class and breakfast was tasty had a problem with our room which was allocated to us but the lovely staff member on reception offered us an alternative one 
36869,Park International Hotel, We got a 10m2 room 305 and had to ask for a bigger room in order to get the standard we are used to in hotels In the small room the air condition did not work and it was not possible to open the window The bed was 130 200 Altogether a horror for claustrophobic persons The 50 bigger room 402 was excellent had a bigger bathroom and a normal size doublebed The air condition worked properly and the bigger window could be opened at least a bit Conclusion The room size should ALWAYS be indicated on the booking com website as an orientation and as a reference The photos show the bigger rooms The small rooms are not acceptable in a hotel , Close to Gloucester Road Station quiet room
36870,Park International Hotel, Charged 30 extra per night for child s bed This was booking com fault they did not alert me to the extra cost at any time during the booking process ,No Positive
36871,Park International Hotel, Super noisy from maids woke me up by knocking at my door constantly at 8 30am I had to shout at her then she stopped knocking unacceptable to be honest but overall the hotel was great , Nice ok size room with good facilities and beautiful interior design 
36872,Park International Hotel, only problem we found was it was hard to pull the curtains to shut them at night but other than that it was a great stay, it was easy to find from the underground stn we arrived yesterday to be greeted by a nice gentleman at reception who then informed us with a sorry but we have upgraded you to a junior suite from a double room for no extra cost he informed of all the facilities where the bar was and the breakfast room we then went up to our room and it was a shock to our system it was double the size of a normal room in a hotel in London it was a wonderful surpise for both of us having stayed in other hotels nearby would I recommend this hotel to others your damned right I would the whole place was spotless the staff really well presented and nice to speak to the other thing it was only a 10 15 minute to the Royal albert Hall where we were going later that day so on behalf of my wife and thank for making our stay with you perfect
36873,Park International Hotel, The standard double room was so tiny you could hardly move in the room The toilet was so small it was a challenge to shut the door or get out in the room every single time Way too pricey for this size room really disappointing , Location breakfast
36874,Park International Hotel, I really would find it difficult to pinpoint any particular thing that I disliked I definitely will be returning , I was particularly impressed with staff and how helpful they were The location was excellent within a few minutes walk of underground station 
36875,Park International Hotel, breakfast wasn t included in our price unfortunately bed was little hard but room was stunning and huge for London hotel , we got free upgrade to a fantastic junior suite Breakfast was very good 10 per breakfast voucher very good value compared to places around hotel Location was great very near underground station and museums are in short walking distance Room was huge and the bar makes good cocktails 
36876,Park International Hotel, Although smoking is becoming has become an unsociable habit for smokers the lack of ashtrays outside the hotel restaurant bar and hotel itself made it difficult to dispose of cigarette stubs cleanly very difficult and should maybe considered ,No Positive
36877,Park International Hotel, The decor was a bit chintzy The lock on the bathroom door was broken and I nearly got trapped , The size of the room and facilities far exceeded expectations 
36878,Park International Hotel,No Negative, I was fortunate to be upgraded from standard double room to a junior family suite which was superb The bed was very comfortable bathroom and dressing room facilities were excellent Spotlessly clean The food in the bar restaurant was also very good 
36879,Park International Hotel, The staff were unfriendly And I called room service three times and no one answered , The location was excellent Only 20 minutes on the tube to most places
36880,Park International Hotel, Room service meals after 10PM are quite limited, Very clean and nice room good quality toiletries and provided ample towels slipper and gowns etc so very convenient 
36881,Park International Hotel, First morning it took a while for a staff member to get us hot drinks at breakfast and the buffet breakfast could have been hotter Some paint was flaking off the bathroom door in our room does need attention , Warm and comfortable decor Excellent cleanliness and friendly staff Lots of hot water 
36882,Park International Hotel, The hot water in the bathroom did not work It required maintenance to visit every morning to fix it They could not find a permanent fix so came back four days in a row Management acknowledged the issue and belatedly day 3 offered to change room The room was in the basement Not an issue other than the proximity to street level noise , Room was spacious although this may just have been my room 013 as I heard other rooms were cramped The manager covered the costs of coffee drinks and snacks at the bar to compensate for the issues i had with the shower 
36883,Park International Hotel, Original bedroom too cold and Hair dryer didn t work was immediately moved to another room which was fine Music too loud in the bar, Breakfast was good and room was good
36884,Park International Hotel, Firstly the room was far too expensive for what we got It was the worst room I ve ever stayed in after paying over 100 the room serious is worth 40 Disgusting it was The noise from the main rd meant we slept really bad Windows need double glazing The shower room was nice but the rest was awful I won t be staying there again full stop, We loved the bar of the hotel
36885,Park International Hotel, Double bed too small , Fantastic location comfortable hotel very helpful Concierge Great eateries supermarket and tube so close Walking distance to attractions
36886,Park International Hotel,No Negative, We stayed at a comofortable junior suite Despite the fact that it was facing the main street in front of the hotel it was very quite due to the double windows 
36887,Park International Hotel, Although our room was good I was disappointed that we had been put in basement Hotel a bit of a maze for finding your way around , Beds and pillows very comfortable Location excellent 
36888,Park International Hotel, The room was frozen I had to warm the bath with the hair dryer There s a gym room but without electricity nothing work, Admitedly nothing Big mistake 
36889,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Quiet and peaceful place It s lucky that here is the final stop of my studying in UK I spent 2 days here the breakfast was great service was full of passion and the building has the typical old age style of the great Britain 
36890,Park International Hotel,No Negative, I checked in late and left in the morning so I didn t spend a full 24 hrs at the property but I was impressed by the front desk Concerige staff They provided tips for the few hours of downtime I had for what to see and do Location was great too 
36891,Park International Hotel, Minor issue with staff knocking on room at an inappropriate time, Location good breakfast near the Underground and major attractions good neighborhood
36892,Park International Hotel, Our room was cold and dark The duvets were really thin I was cold on the first night and had to ask for a blanket The breakfast was really average too I had booked this hotel as a treat and didn t feel the extra money I spent was worth it , The location was great
36893,Park International Hotel, Pathetic billing double charged me and I had to wait 10 days to get my pre authorisation payment back Staff have poor communication skills, Round the corner from Gloucester Road tube station Walk in shower
36894,Park International Hotel, Very small room with twin beds The matress was old Asked for late check out since a genius member of booking com and they did not know anything about this at the Reception , The room and bathroom were very clean They offer a free phone with internet Very good location and common areas very nicely decorated 
36895,Park International Hotel, there was absolutely nothing that a vegan could eat on your dinner menu your room service menu and your breakfast menu so I had to eat out in the evenings and went hungry in the mornings, The room was amazing
36896,Park International Hotel, Although the hotel was well maintained the carpets throughout the hotel need to be changed Current state of carpets show dirt and wear New carpet should be patterned and brighter colors to obscure the heavy use of tourist and business traffic The free mobile phone only worked about 10 of the time I was a guest of the hotel The breakfast that I purchased could stand a revisit The food was unbelievably bland Even after eating breakfast you felt as though you hadn t eaten at all Also if the hotel is going to offer complimentary electrical adapters they should offer equipment that actually works The hotel issued an electrical adapter that didn t work for my IPhone 6 Hotel access could use improvement for older and physically handicapped guests Entrance front steps are very steep and handrails need to be useable for senior aged and handicapped guests The Breakfast Room should be accessible from both elevators , Overall the Park International was a pleasant experience It was a new experience to book a single room in the UK Didn t realize single room meant twin bed I would recommend this hotel with no problems and I would probably return to this hotel if my preferred hotel The Bailey s Millennium was not available as was the case this time The staff was friendly and helpful The hotel was clean in both public areas as well as the room The free mobile phone is a stroke of genius and one of the best guest features I ve ever experienced The problem is the free mobiles worked about 10 of the time I was a guest A much better product is needed to make this guest feature a real plus 
36897,Park International Hotel, A very minor improvement would be if housekeeping replenished the tea sugar etc each day in the room And after travelling for six weeks and staying in 20 different hotels I would love to have a good quality tea available in the rooms , This hotel was comfortable with friendly staff and a lovely breakfast service It was in a great location in Kensington and was near Kensington Gardens Natural History Museum Victoria and Albert Museum and about 30 minutes walk from Harrods The Gloucester Road tube station was only a few minutes walk away which was a blessing with our heavy luggage 
36898,Park International Hotel, Room very very small smelled of smoke to warm to sleep well even with window open in December air conditioning unit blocked by wardrobe so useless, Public areas very bright and friendly 
36899,Park International Hotel, Rooms small Paid for a double room and got a single as one member of party was ill, The restaurant was good and the food tasty Good location for museums Hyde Park and close to the underground
36900,Park International Hotel, The basement room we were given which was very small The hotel also didn t bring breakfast to rooms but to the staffs credit they organised a continental breakfast for my mum who has mobility problems, restaurant food was really good and the gym had goo equipment considering it was small
36901,Park International Hotel, My room was in the basement The area outside the lift smelled damp although the room didn t smell unpleasant The room was a bit cold though no temperature control on the air con heater , Good location near Gloucester Rd underground affordable 
36902,Park International Hotel, I cannot criticise given the value for money , The Park International is a lovely old hotel a short tube ride from city centre If offers very good value for money I stay there regularly 
36903,Park International Hotel, One small complaint the scrambled eggs at breakfast were always cold Those buffet line heaters never work well After day 2 we had the staff microwave our plates in the kitchen and all was well for us anyway , Excellent location 2 min walk to the Glocester Road tube station Lots of restaurants right across the street especially Italian ones Very nice room the Junior Suite was huge by big city standards Breakfast was large and plentiful The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the stay 
36904,Park International Hotel, Room was a bit small only a double bed wardrobe full of 2 robes and ironing board and iron Not sure where they thought our clothes would go No heating in the bathroom , The room was clean and the bathroom well equipped with a decent shower and good towels Ok breakfast 
36905,Park International Hotel, We felt that our room was too small Maybe there could have been larger rooms that we could have opted for and payed a little extra Especially when booking on line had we have had known , We both enjoyed the cooked breakfasts A great variety to choose from The food presentation was inviting and the kitchen staff were friendly Great Coffee Fantastic location 
36906,Park International Hotel, The shower door was missing and the blind on the bathroom window was broken Very disappointing for a 4 hotel , Great location and staff are very friendly
36907,Park International Hotel, Nothing, Breakfast had a wide variety with enough tablespace for everyone Room very clean with large TV and enough plugs close to the bed for overnight phone charging Good shower with soaps etc provided Friendly check in staff 
36908,Park International Hotel, To start we didn t get any help with our bags and the front desk staff could see my daughter and I struggling to go up the 4 steps into the hotel Nor did they help find the room or help us with our bags to the room The hallways are extremely small you can only take one suitcase at a time and the layout is confusing with rooms behind closed doors etc The rooms are very small The first room they put us in was so cold that we had to wear our shoes and coats while in the room We did ask for an extra blanket for the bed which we got but staff weren t very happy to bring We did ask to move to another room which was warmer but even smaller The breakfast was typical but food was cold and tough Even the coffee wasn t hot We go to London every three months and won t be staying here again , The location was great Close to restaurants Bed comfortable Nice lobby Ample hot water in shower 
36909,Park International Hotel, We our friends were upgraded which was very nice but our friends were given the Junior Suite we had a normal room The mirror should be more central above the dressing table as it was very difficult to dry your hair try it the pillows were too hard central heating was too noisy we had to turn it off , It was very central to the venue we were going to friendly helpful staff comfortable room 
36910,Park International Hotel, Well couple of times the cleaner forgot to give more milk in the tea tray , I stayed in the hotel with my daughter 5 nights We enjoyed our stay very much The hotel is well situated it was beautiful our room was big and clean and the breakfast was wonderful and staff very friendly Perfect stay I ll go in this hotel again 
36911,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Ease of access to the tube both from the airport and from downtown An 8min walk to Hyde park too which is one of many lovely green spaces in London 
36912,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Impressive spacious foyer Helpful staff Good breakfast with some unusual options Close to major museums Victoria Albert Science and Natural History 
36913,Park International Hotel, Rooms could have been a higher standard for money paid Requested upstairs room but got given basement Took 2 different people to find our booking and this happend at both arrival and check in as we arrived early unable to check n straight away , Bed room was ok Bar and resturant was lovely
36914,Park International Hotel, bathroom and toilet toilet next to door not good toilet roll holder in wrong spot kept hitting toilet lid when putting it up or down, staff and location
36915,Park International Hotel, Ice machine would be easier than asking staff for ice Handrail and or ramp is definitely needed for main door , Desk staff were very helpful and informative refrigerator in room is great Two grocery stores nearby make it easy to eat very well on a budget 
36916,Park International Hotel, The triple room had little extra space but it did have beds for three a cot There wasn t anything that I didn t like , I liked the friendliness and efficiency of the staff the bright and very clean bedrooms and bathrooms I was with various members of my family and I loved the fact that we could use the foyer to meet up The 3 young children in our group loved their stay 
36917,Park International Hotel, I was not able to visit London this day and it took 2 weeks until unfriendly persons at the front desk changed my invoice of course i did not get any money or anything else ,No Positive
36918,Park International Hotel, The bed was standard double bed and we had to pay an extra 30 per night for a King size We have stayed 4 times and from the first visit which was excellent each visit after that has not been to our expectations, Location A short walk from Gloucester Rd Tube Many nearby places to eat and drink 
36919,Park International Hotel, We found the staff to be extremely unhelpful we dragged our own luggage in while they watched from inside No help in directing us adequately Very dismissive attitude, Very clean
36920,Park International Hotel, Nothing I didn t like I would have loved a bath in the ensuite instead of just a shower but that s just being fussy , Breakfast buffet was very nice The bed was really comfortable 
36921,Park International Hotel, No bath in the junior suite which I had requested when I booked , Amazing bed the room when you first entered smelt really lovely and the breakfast room was Very pleasant The room was also very quiet 
36922,Park International Hotel, Paid WiFi in room did not find out about free WiFi in lobby till evening before check out We were not informed on check in , Location close to tube laundromat grocery store restaurants
36923,Park International Hotel, Single toom was really small and hall carpets tired , Comfortable clean rooms with good air con system Good breakfast selection Good shower system and hot water 
36924,Park International Hotel, Unhappy staff not very friendly apart from the blonde bar girl and the breakfast staff Upon check in they still had us down for 2 nights when I had amended our booking to one night, Not a lot
36925,Park International Hotel, room location basement very poor 3rd time at hotel haven t had room with view to front of hotel sadly will not return , we love area and location of hotel tube access pleasant and safe area to visit good restaurants coffee shops walking distance to some attractions 
36926,Park International Hotel, The biggest issue that I had with this hotel was their wifi policy they charge an extortionate amount each day 8 for 2 devices 12 for 3 and it s not even very good Wifi should be free in the first place but if you do pay a charge which should be nowhere near as high as this then it should be a fast connection This was very weak and files were slow to load and send I was staying there for work so this was a time consuming issue The signal dropped out completely one morning at 7 40am which cost me valuable work time as I was dealing with clients in Asia 7 hours ahead so it was close to the end of their working day I called down to the front desk and they said would call back in 5 mins after they d checked the control panel After 15 mins wait during which I could ve taken a shower but was expecting their call within 5 mins I called back he said he was just about to call and everything was now fine just need to refresh all devices I had to call back again 10 minutes later as refreshing hadn t worked and there was STILL no wifi a different member of staff answered and she had a totally different story saying that yes it s down but should be back up in 10 15 mins if not call them back and they ll chase this again I explained that it needed to be working and I was paying 12 quid for wifi that doesn t work so she said she would chase them right away It finally came back on shortly after that The TV signal was also down during this time but that wasn t as important to me When I checked out they did give me that one day wifi FOC but this policy service should still be revised Also the chair in the room was incredibly uncomfortable to sit in and work for any period of time , Close walking distance to tube station also close to supermarket so can buy food water to keep in fridge in room
36927,Park International Hotel, There was no carpet in the room due to it being disabled which was fine however this caused a problem with the bed that moved every time you got on it , Location fab good sized disabled bathroom
36928,Park International Hotel, The room smelt like a smokers room Noisy next to the street Minibar present but empty staff told me that only 1st floor s minibar are filled , The room seemed to be renovated Furniture bathroom brand new 
36929,Park International Hotel, Paid on arrival When we tried to order drinks at bar later in evening embarrassing as told no card registered even though I had had to pay in cash after 10 minutes trying to sort out Then charged us three times for room on Bank account and took hours to sort out on our return home and a member of staff actually lied to me telling me this was common practice ,No Positive
36930,Park International Hotel, Having to re subscribe to the wifi every day was a nuisance Also TV options were very limited , Location near the Gloucester Street tube stop was very convenient Also we had a room facing the street but with the double paned windows there was no noise problem Bathroom updates were also good quality 
36931,Park International Hotel, Breakfast was not included in our package and when we went to the dining room our first day we found out that the cost was 14 p per person We were prepared to go elsewhere most places have breakfast for 1 2 that price and they offered us a 2 for one deal so we stayed Great breakfast buffet but we didn t go back , The room size was adequate Good closet space but we travel light Clean well appointed and nice bathroom Staff was pleasant and very helpful Very close to the Gloucester tube station and nice restaurants within walking distance 
36932,Park International Hotel, while there are allways room for improvements we enjoyed the stay and room upgrade finished our enjoyable holiday off on a good note we have stayed many times at the park and will continue to do this only change is we will book suite each time, we were upgraded to suite which compensated for the room we had in the first visit in the basement which had no phone and they forgot to make up room the first day we were there
36933,Park International Hotel, Made to feel stupid as out card would not work in the hotel but worked everywhere ellse made to sit in lobby to sort payment out I think this was because we got a discounted price as rooms had tripled in price, Location
36934,Park International Hotel,No Negative, Everything was very good Since the staff comfort of the accommodations cleanness breakfast location brotherhood till the Tube that is a few meters away 
36935,Park International Hotel, Breakfast was ok as part of our room deal However it wasn t very warm and only had option of scrambled eggs for cooked breakfast Good selection of pastries for continental option , Room was very clean however had to call maintenance upon checkin as part of the toilet housing had fallen from the wall and needed some silicone to fix it back in 
36936,Park International Hotel, Nothing, We had a lovely quiet room with restfully coloured decor and the bed was very comfy Excellent breakfast and no fuss The towels were plentiful thick and soft and the shower was efficient and spotless As our trip included concerts at The Royal Albert Hall the location of Park International was perfect taking only about 15 minutes to walk and we felt safe doing so Being on a bus route was also useful 
36937,Park International Hotel, Better secondary glazing as a bit noisey during the night when your room is located on the front of the building , In good safe location with restaurants near by and on bus routes with underground just around the corner 
36938,Park International Hotel,No Negative, It was OK but nothing special Front desk staff needs some training to be polite Gave us a broom cubard what smelt of damp But a nice young man on the front desk appeared and sorted another room 
36939,Park International Hotel, everything else Bedding the colour of chewing gum mattress wafer thing room extremely small no iron or ironing board in the room bathroom and shower tiny, Breakfast and the staff at breakfast
36940,Park International Hotel, I would definitely introduce free guest Wifi I do not like the Swisscom provider It is too expensive and complicated , The breakfast is Excellent I like the fact that the rooms have Security safes The rooms are very clean and well cared for Also the tea making facility kettle and refrigerators provided are a nice touch Overall I would not ask for more plus the great location in London 
36941,Park International Hotel, Access to wifi was not free I payed alot less for a 1G roaming internet data package , Right next to the tube station Same line that went to Heathrow 
36942,Park International Hotel, The room was tiny compared to rooms at other 4 hotels around the world So it was a bit annoying The free Internet in the lobby was extremely slow You had to pay an extra 7gbp or so for high speed wifi Internet in the room for 24 hours , The room was clean and the beds were comfy Staff was super friendly and helped in every possible way The hotel is located about 3 mins walking distance from the underground station which was very convenient for us 
36943,Park International Hotel, No bell service to help bring in luggage off the street , Excellent location near Underground stop 3 in a room at a reasonable price Clean Fit our needs very well 
36944,Park International Hotel, Cromwell Road is a bit noisy at night but then you don t get the location , Excellent location Great room with a balcony Loved the bar and the piano player on the Friday night 
36945,Park International Hotel, NO free wifi small room and old bedding Big gao between the photos posted to the Internet and the real situation really disappointed , Good location the only benefit
36946,Park International Hotel, Noting stood out particular the option of a bath would of been nice as my partner prefers them But wouldn t stop us from using the hotel again, Quiet hotel Great location good for value costing Would stay again
36947,Park International Hotel, We had a twin room The beds were lumpy and soft I woke with back ache every morning, The breakfast was very good A reasonable selection of both hot and cold food
36948,Park International Hotel, Weak air conditioning Defective kettle that would not automatically turn off and which they said could not be replaced Refrigerator not working and could not be replaced Sour staff TV very limited No CNN , Good shower 
36949,Park International Hotel, The stuff was horrific Not helpful and some didn t speak very good English We were put in the room with a view to next building wall and lots of tubes , If you want a good treatment require a room on top floors 
36950,Park International Hotel, The attitude of one of the workers in the reception Though most were really good and helpful The breakfast was also very average very basic , I was happy that my room changed due to some circumstances 
36951,Park International Hotel, Wifi charges 7 pounds per day Poor wifi in the lobby In all almost unconnected Rooms were really small If wifi matters to you it would definitely not be a place for you , Perfect location near Gloucester Station Restaurants and cafe within 10 minutes walk Fridge Cheap in this area 
36952,Park International Hotel, Bedrooms could be bigger and be easier to find Hotel didn t have wheelchair access , The staff were extremely helpful Location was ideal Great choice of food for breakfast Our luggage was kept by the hotel until it was time for us to catch our train 
36953,Park International Hotel, The first room allocated to us was in the basement which had no corded phone and mobile service felt like an isolated basement bunker We eventually requested for a room swap which took some trouble because we had to go to the reception no corded phone meant we weren t able to dial from our room to reception Had to pay for in room wifi but was not much of an issue because I had mobile data , Comfy room and breakfast staff were very friendly 
36954,Park International Hotel, The eggs in the morning no choice just scrambled and seemed like powder eggs , Looking after cases on departure The checkers bar and piano man The room on fifth floor good
36955,Park International Hotel, The breakfast is a little expensive We did spot a mouse in the bare hitch the staff didn t seem too concerned about when we alerted them to it Also we d checked the bar times which was till 1am but they closed up before then , Nice friendly staff The hotel is very nice My room was very small but what I expected for a single room in a London hotel 
36956,Park International Hotel, The noise outside the room on the ground floor was not great at 7am I think this was the cleaners as our room was next to their room but still slightly annoying , Great clean room and quick check in
36957,Park International Hotel, I was disappointed that the hotel didn t make any mention of my wife s birthday after I have specifically emailed them to ask if they could make her 30th birthday trip more special by recognising the significance of the trip to London ,No Positive
36958,Park International Hotel, The staff treated booking com customers as second class and made sure to let you know Internet is not complementary for booking com customers and I was told had I gone through someone else it would have been Once the rest of the staff found out we were booking com customers we were treated very poorly I was asked to step aside while checking out to allow two non booking com customers to checkout , Very convenient location and beautiful facilities 
36959,Park International Hotel, Straff is not at all attentive Had to ask for help with my luggage and upon request the concierge reluctantly took the luggage to my room although it took him almost half an hour to deliver it The room attendant was less than friendly she didn t appear to like that the room was not available to clean at 8am Hotel is tired and in need of refurbishment , location is good only moments from Gloucester Road station
36960,Park International Hotel,No Negative, poor service The cleaning is not really up to the basic standard And no wifi unless you pay The wifi at the lobby is really terrible The staff is not providing any service upon your requests 
36961,Park International Hotel, I found a mouse in my room and received little to no compensation for that inconvenience even after I showed them video evidence Daily house keeping services knocked 4 times thought out one morning and afternoon despite the do not disturb sign Internet and breakfast were extra daily charges Internet was very laggy and the service at breakfast was non existent ,No Positive
36962,Park International Hotel, Stuff wasn t really welcoming and helpful Both at the reception and at the Bar area , Perfect location close to two of the metro stations Glouster road and Earl s Court 
36963,Park International Hotel, Never great value for money as a single traveler , Very comprehensive breakfast continental and English Nice room facilities and great shower a must Close to major attractions including Hyde Park 
36964,Park International Hotel, Free WiFi available only in lobby only for one hour at a time with a passcode Passcode freely given at reception , Comfortable but ask for room with uniformly high ceiling Very helpful and friendly staff 
36965,Park International Hotel, There were lots of mice running about in the bar dining area When reported to the member of staff he laughed it off as if it wasn t an issue I then reported it to the lady in reception when I was checking out She apologised and said she would report it to her manager She thanked me for bringing it to her attention and said they were unaware of the problem I told her they were aware of the problem has there were reviews on trip advisor that mentioned the mice She then became a little embarrassed and wished me a good day I left and won t be returning , Location good for my meeting in Knightsbridge
36966,Park International Hotel, I usually stay at the Chelsea Harbour Hotel whenever I m in town for my business meetings The only reason I chose the Park International was because there weren t any rooms available at the Chelsea There is a very rude staff member by the name of Mia who made my check in a complete nightmare she tried to bully me into going to another hotel down the road that I believe they have affiliations with When I insisted on checking in it s one night only she sent me to the basement I had a massive argument with her and the manager who handled the situation perfectly I must say this girl Mia has zero hospitality skills and is definitely in the wrong business , The prices were adequate for the location 
36967,Park International Hotel, The previous nights here were ok But when I arrived at my room on the last night saw my night dress and the line for iPhone was on the bottom of the bedside table They should be on my bed and on the top of the bedside table I did not put any stuff at that place before someone threw 2 things there What s the manner and attitude of cleaning room like this This place is usually for SHOES I can t wear my night dress that night and I had flight on the next morning I reported this to the receptionist that night he asked me to send email to the manager and typed the email address for me said the manager will handle this the next morning when he s back to work I asked for an explanation and a proper solution to solve this issue The next morning the receptionist then had no idea of this case so obviously they did not handed over cases Till now there s no reply no explanation and any solution from them which is so disappointed This behaviour is very bad All my experience for the previous 2 nights are good but this experience did shock me and disgust me ,No Positive
36968,Park International Hotel, The attitude of the staff at the reception not too upfront to help us when we complained about the rooms ac not working we were allowed a v tiny bed for 2 days except for 1 gentleman who gave us a wonderful room on the last day of our stay one tall guy whose name I don t know , Bed was awesome housekeeping staff too good specially the lady in charge I guess her name was Andrea 
36969,Park International Hotel, Didn t get free wifi in the rooms, Great room great staff and a great location Good beds close to the piccadilly line and the shower was awesome 
36970,Park International Hotel, Room was not cleaned fully before we arrived We asked for a quiet room and were put in a room directly beneath the bar which was open until 1 in the morning Not exactly a quiet room ,No Positive
36971,Park International Hotel, The room was very compact somewhat different to the photos which would have been fine however the beds were so hard sleep was impossible made all the more challenging by the very loud and constant road noise It would be fairer to customers booking to advise that the front building rooms are subject to constant noise throughout the night and this was heavy traffic , The bed linen was of good standard Hotel staff were polite
36972,Park International Hotel, In 5 nights we were placed in 4 different sets of rooms as the staff juggled accommodations around us One was a basement room with a window on the sidewalk where pedestrians walked by at all hours and in another a steady stream of nasty water leaked out of a fixture in the ceiling onto a bed when it rained The hotel s business model seems to be 1 to fill the place as full as possible by making promises for rooms that they can t possibly fulfill and 2 advertising a low rate that is augmented by charging lots for services like in room wifi 19 95 ponds day 28 that are included in the cost elsewhere There are many better hotels in Kensington Chelsea that aren t a bit more expensive once all the extras are added in , The ceiling didn t actually fall on us The staff tried to be helpful and one staff member was competent 
36973,Park International Hotel, bed springs kept bonging when you turned over small room no biscuits with tea no soap left barman did not know how to prepare a Pimms , it was a lovely quiet room as requested 
36974,Park International Hotel, Had room in basement or lower ground floor as they called it It was directly under the bar and very noisy especially on the Friday night when there was a performer on Although the music stopped at 11 was still noisy as they cleared away and people still drinking ,No Positive
36975,Park International Hotel, Room was in basement and very very small Traveled over 9 weeks around Europe this year and this was possibly our worst room , Ease to get to Heathrow and museums 
36976,Park International Hotel, I wrote the dislike in the wrong box sorry Check the like box , Laundry service was a little inconvenient as only certain times it could be done We were travelling internationally so would have been ideal to leave with no dirty laundry On the day we checked out our times clashed with the cut off time for the laundry service 
36977,Park International Hotel, No free W Fi Cold bathroom no heating cold ceramic floor tiles Asked for room with a view all we could see was brickwork and drains 6 feet away No breakfast included in room rate should have continental at least with these prices , Location comfy quiet room good powerful shower 
36978,Park International Hotel, The only negative is that the hotel needs a facelift It could be returned to its former glory by just a lick of paint , Surprisingly good value for money I have stayed in London hotels at twice the price that weren t as comfortable Great room Great bed 
36979,Park International Hotel, In view of the price paid even allowing for it being in London I think breakfast should have been included Bathroom was a bit smelly, Room clean and bed comfy
36980,Park International Hotel, Our room was in the basement so we had no view apart from a brick wall approximately 2 foot away When we were sitting in the bar on Saturday night having some pre dinner drinks my husband caught something out of the corner of his eye and thought it was a spider but unfortunately it was a MOUSE running around the bar and restaurant We told the staff and they did nothing about it , The location of the hotel was good 
36981,Park International Hotel, Manager not very friendly he checked out a client who was queuing behind me made her passing in front of me purposely not very professional he made me imcomfortable , good atmosphere in the evening in the bar 
36982,Park International Hotel, Woke on Saturday morning to NO WATER No way to wash flush take meds make tea Breakfast was served boring English buffet lack of fruit yoghurts etc somehow It sounds like this has happened before the electrics in the street go out so no water pump Staff seemed pretty oblivious and unconcerned kept saying it d be on in half an hour Manager refused to reduce our bill by any more than 25 regardless of the fact that we had to leave for our function unwashed Very unhappy ,No Positive
36983,Park International Hotel, The kettle did not work Also forgotten to bring my own hair comb realised that phone was not working therefore cannot contact the reception, Nice location easy access to tube station close proximity to Harrods National History Museum Size of room is reasonable decor is a bit dated but it is clean Bed is comfortable It is very quiet
36984,Park International Hotel, Nothing , The best thing is it is a 5 minute walk to Gloucester Rd Station which connects to the Piccadilly District and Circle lines Just about everything you want as a tourist is on one of these lines Also the concierge was very helpful 
36985,Park International Hotel, Didnt like waking up to no water air con and electricity due to a power cut Bed was small and lacked support, Concierge very helpful and breakfast waiting staff were efficient with nothing too much trouble despite the extra pressure after power cut
36986,Park International Hotel, Having to pay for WIFI FREE WIFI in lobby was very poor Advertising free WIFI only to find out it s only free in lobby , A nice feeling of quality throughout the hotel Proximity to underground Value for money 3 person rooms 
36987,Park International Hotel, nothing, Great location 2 min walk from the tube station amazing value for money lovely clean rooms very impressed Our room was ready early as well Free wifi Would stay again

36989,Park International Hotel, 3 bed room a bit small for 3 adults but sufficient , Perfect Hotel to explore London Directly located at Piccadilly Circle District Line to reach Heathrow Airport and other major places of interest Breakfast was very fine and various very good price performance ratio Perfect Room cleaning and friendly staff Room was located in the direction of the main road but street noise was not disturbing 
36990,Park International Hotel, The breakfast could have been better not much choice and whilst I enjoyed the Thai version of rice congee the bread was tasteless and there was no choice of milk No major complaint though I was allergic to the washing powder they used so the towels and the bedding brought me out in a rash but that wasn t the fault of the hotel, The staff were helpful and the location good my single room was comfortable the shower a reasonable size instead of the tiny ones you cannot move in and everything was clean the fridge in the room was a bonus too
36991,Park International Hotel, Breakfast should include more fruits The bed was not comfortable as the centre of the bed was much lower , staff were most helpful Location near Gloucester Road Underground was great 
36992,Park International Hotel, No free internet 12 GBP per day for business use no light over the work desk area , Good location good breakfast service decent room good all round 
36993,Park International Hotel, Our room wasn t ready until 2 despite asking for an early check in, The bed was lovely and comfortable It was great to have a full size hairdryer next to the dressing table and mirror
36994,Park International Hotel, We were disappointed when we realised that our booking did not include breakfast When we went back to read the online details we realised that we had been rather misled with the wording all inclusive breakfast available Other hotels were clearer in not including breakfast in their deal and we chose Park International because it seemed to include breakfast It s our mistake but we were disappointed and felt rather misled The room size was also amazingly small possibly the smallest double bedroom we have ever stayed in compounded by the fact that we were up in the attics so the roof sloped too adding to the smallness of the room available The window in the bathroom had been left open and because it was raining a substantial amount of rain had come through and puddled onto the bathroom floor The bed was at best a double although it seemed more like a queen Again after reading the small print we realised beds could be between 130 150cm wide which meant that the hotel had not misled but it seemed rather disappointing The room was clean well furnished and we slept well so thank you for that but all in all I don t think we would stay here again , The room was very clean with an excellent ensuite bathroom lovely The reception staff were also very polite and helpful when we made enquiries
36995,Park International Hotel, The location of the room we were supposedly upgraded but actually felt like we were shoved in the corner Window faced direct to bricks no natural sunlight there was a dead pigeon out the window hanging on wire and other ones cooing around I know birds are a problem butc nets may help Light in room on the wall nearly fell off wasn t secured properly Paint needed touching up Bed was tiny and not much room only a double and it was suppose to be an executive room , The customer service was very good Let us check in an hour earlier Never went to the restaurant but it looked like it was nice 
36996,Park International Hotel, Been there twice before Really nice This time no heating in the bedroom cold all night Had to put heating on ourselves next morning Went for breakfast and realized it was not included which it was last time We asked if we could pay and they said no as we hadn t registered a credit card No one asked us to register a credit card So we had to go out for breakfast the two days we were there Very disappointing ,No Positive

37002,Park International Hotel, The window of the room was open when I arrived late at night Therefore the room was freezing cold There were small flies dead on the bathroom floor which made me questioned the cleanliness of the room straight away However everything else looked cleaned The room was not very welcoming OK room but a low rated 4 stars in my opinion , Easy access from the subway Nice comfortable bed Lovely staff Very good price for London

37004,Park International Hotel, No free internet Initial room very small 2nd room even smaller Terrible stench in corridor right up to door of room which prevented me staying in that room , Location Eventually I received an upgraded room because of initial problems with 2 others Good rate for 4 star 
37005,Park International Hotel, Pillows could have been slightly softer In fact a soft and firm pillow would be best instead of two firm pillows per person, We were upgraded to a junior suite The accommodation was excellent Bed was very comfortable En suite had all necessary fittings with soap and shampoo etc supplied Air condition controls were easy to operate No traffic disturbance meant a peaceful night Breakfast was very good hot and cold with an extensive selection 
37006,Park International Hotel, Didn t book breakfast but decided in the morning we would have something Cost us 15 pound each and was a shambles Everything was cold no offering of hot drinks not very much to choose from To expensive for what we got , Great stay at this hotel comfortable bed powerful shower and very clean Literally 2 minutes from tube station very easy to get around London Lots of restaurants and pubs nearby Surprisingly quiet considering room was facing the road

37010,Park International Hotel, Room quite small but we did have a reduced rate deal so still good value , Much quieter than I expected given that hotel is on the main Cromwell Road Very close to tube station 
37011,Park International Hotel, Male bar tender was the most miserable person ever quite rude and ignorant when ordering drinks didn t even look like he was paying us any attention Our room 70 was lovely inside but my god the view was of big massive pipes and at night they hummed all night long , Rooms were lovely reception staff were polite food was great at breakfast

37015,Park International Hotel, Uncomfortable as single woman Been in a room with access from the road As I was down in the basement with a room with two large windows I should have put that In my Room request not to have a ground floor room I would have asked for a room change if staying more than the one night , Staff very helpful and informed Room clean and tidy Did not look tired and worn Liked the bathroom lovely shower I would stay again Close to transport Lots of places to eat nearby if you don t want to eat at the hotel 
37016,Park International Hotel, No WIFI in the room Wifi in the lobby was VERY slow and impossible to do anything even to read e mails The charge for Wifi in the room was 7GBP for 1 device 9 for 2 devices and 12 for 3 devices When asked if I could disconnect one device and connect the next I was told that this was not allowed Once I used the code for one device it was unusable by another Since I had to have internet in my room business traveler I paid the 12 GBPs for 24 hours but even then internet was so slow that I decided to go to bed Complaining about it was a total waste of time Breakfast was decent but limited For cold meats for example they only had ham and salami I asked for turkey since I don t eat pork and they didn t have it No boiled eggs either only scrambled Finally there was a serious mix up with my reservation but there was absolutely no service from the staff I ended up being charged about almost 100 euros extra for the exact same dates that I had originally booked my room through booking I asked for the manager but he refused to help me They told me to talk to booking which told me to talk to the hotel There was a fake kindness anything else I can do for you that resulted in no service Anything I asked them to do they wouldn t do it but kept asking if there was anything else they can do for me Overall the staff was so inflexible that were the equivalent of machines no human consideration whatsoever for anything you might have asked , The location was very good close to the Tube and in a nice neighborhood 
37017,Park International Hotel, No free WiFi in the hotel This is ridiculous You can only have WiFi in the lobby for 1 hour Air conditioner is locked on cooling no any option of getting fresh air without opening the window Something stinks on the way from the lobby to the elevator , Nice district easy to find the hotel underground station is near supermarket is nearby

37020,Park International Hotel, Would have liked a room with a view as our room was in the basement and we stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in total , Staff were very friendly and very helpful Room very spacious and clean Location excellent 
37021,Park International Hotel, That one couple out of the party was upgraded and the other was not as it was a little awkward Standard rooms very basic for the standard of communal areas and other rooms The couple who were not upgraded had to switch rooms as bed was damaged The hotel moved the bags and said the new room would be ready at 2 Upon going to the new room at 3 30 the bags were there but the room was still dirty from previous guests This was however sorted quickly after speaking to Reception , Good location convenient for the Tube Travelled as 2 couples for 2 special birthdays Upgraded one couple as a special occasion which was appreciated

37024,Park International Hotel, There was a mouse that had free run of the empty restaurant area from 10pm onwards it was skating across the polished floor and even made it onto the chairs to find crumbs etc So a friend and I watched it for a bit over a few beers Quite funny actually until it made its way into the bar to clean up the peanut debris left by the humans I told the staff but they seemed unconcerned and said I could leave if I wanted Which would ve been fine if I hadn t have been staying there Anyway I decided to call it a night I went to my room and was then serenaded for an hour or so by a coo ing pigeon that lived in some kind of wooden box outside my window If I d have wanted to spend the evening with the local wildlife I would have brought a sleeping bag slept on a roundabout and saved 100 Very poor stay and experience Never again However I m sure the mouse pigeon would disagree with me they were very comfortable ,No Positive
37025,Park International Hotel, Room and bathroom both on small side Have used this hotel before and rooms were a good size Just unlucky this time I guess , Good location very clean and comfortable Lovely breakfast 
37026,Park International Hotel, While the full English breakfast was good the food could have been kept hotter instead of at warm temperature Free Wifi was available albeit only in hotel lobby bar or breakfast room and for one hour at a time whereas it would have been nice to have that included in the price of the rooms and not pay per 24 hours use especially as one is not in the rooms for 24 hours at a time , Excellent location for getting right into central London with either the bus bus stop just about opposite side from hotel entrance or with the tube 3 minute walk away Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times Size of the room was good as well as that of the bathroom 
37027,Park International Hotel, Duvet not thick enough felt like a summer sheet rather than cosy duvet you would expect in Feb Bathroom compact If you were a large person you would be uncomfortable , Location excellent and rooms exceptionally clean Although Bathroom compact the overhead shower was excellent 
37028,Park International Hotel, Booked double room with a travel cot only to find that I ve been upgraded to a triple room with no travel cot I had to figure out how my 10 month old son to sleep Staff didn t resolve the problem for our stay operation manager is impossible to find staff is useless The cot offered from staff at 11pm had no mattress and since they were fully booked I had to either figure it out by myself or go outside looking for another hotel In order to complain you need to speak to the operation manager called Rory who is nowhere to be seen during our stay I ve been offered 10 off from my next stay but even the receptionist said You wouldn t stay here again right I wouldn t expect such horrible experience from a 4 star hotel I would never stay there again and I would never recommend it to anyone If I exclude the travel cot situation this hotel offers nothing as a 4 star tiny rooms mold in bathroom and flickering light in the shower ,No Positive
37029,Park International Hotel, Our room was very cold , Excellent service from all staff We were given a room upgrade Piano bar is a great place to relax in the evening reasonably priced and excellent music from Sam Martin

37031,Park International Hotel, We had booked a bedroom for 3 people myself my wife and teenage daughter The double bed if it was a double was extremely small which made for an uncomfortable night , We decided to have a couple of drinks in the bar before going out for a meal To our surprise there was a pianist playing He was brilliant so good in fact that we went back to hear more after our meal

37039,Park International Hotel, Parking facilities was not available Price could also be cheaper However I guess the price may have reflected the seasonal festive demands I stayed here on the new year eve Also there was some noise from the traffic as my room was facing the street , The room I chose was quite comfortable The location was also great easily accessible via road an rail transport links
37040,Park International Hotel, WiFi in lobby for 1h only is from ancient age not convenient for business trips The breakfast fare to expensive the upper rooms extremely small , The location is great
37041,Park International Hotel, Rumblings from the underground kept me awake until after midnight Must remember to take earplugs in future or book a quiet room , Very attractive lobby bar and restaurant 
37042,Park International Hotel, In room wifi costs 7 for mobile devices and 9 for laptops for only 24 hours Free wifi available for 1 hour in lobby but you require a slip of paper with username and password Too much work for something that is readily available in more reasonably priced hotels , Room was clean and comfortable Concierge was very helpful with luggage and staff were friendly Location was pretty good too 
37043,Park International Hotel, The mattresses were not very comfortable neither were the pillows There is no free wi fi either which is rather disturbing for such a price Not much soundproofing between rooms either , The location is excellent just 5 min walk from Gloucester Road underground station The room was tidy very clean and bigger than I expected

37047,Park International Hotel, Wasn t shown to my room so wondered about for a while And to pay for wifi in London in 2015 is crazy , I was upgraded to a suite very spacious and comfortable 
37048,Park International Hotel, Leaving , Everything the location is perfect for exploring London the bar is perfectly sized and arranged which means its not too big to be impersonal and not too small to be cramped it makes it very easy to strike up a conversation or simply watch football on Sky The staff are second to none too very friendly and caring
37049,Park International Hotel, One room and its bed were a bit small for a double , Beautiful hotel inside and out Short walk to Piccadilly Line Tube station Excellent breakfast Very polite professional and courteous staff 
37050,Park International Hotel, The building was a lovely early victorian one with our room at basement just below street level I would add that we were offered the room with the three single beds instead of a double and a single and we chose to accept this The room was very good with lots of space and lovely bathroom but because it was at basement level it was cold The room had lovely thick curtains but ai night the cold seemed to permeate through the walls We mentioned it to reception on leaving However it would not stop me from staying there again , We were able to get a room for three people three single beds and at a very reasonable price considering the location Reception staff were very friendly and very helpful Hotel was really lovely small but tastefully decorated
37051,Park International Hotel, Bathroom was a bit dirty with signs of mound around shower, Hotel was easy to find The reception staff let us check in earlier than there 2pm stated time
37052,Park International Hotel, Wifi was not free in the rooms Wifi in the reception was very slow A hotel like this should really have free wifi throughout , Breakfast was great Staff were friendly and helpful Location was good

37055,Park International Hotel, The plug in the wash basin didn t work and the shower leaked We arrived early evening to drop off baggage and didn t require the bathroom facilities until the following morning The problems were reported when booking out but she seemed to have a couldn t care less attitude , Comfortable
37056,Park International Hotel, The fact that I booked two rooms as we were a group of five but we weren t even on the same floor The twin room was on level one and the other in the basement Not easy for our after show get together , The rooms were large and comfortable 
37057,Park International Hotel, Lousy front desk personal we asked to change a comfortable 3 bed room to a standard two bed room for the second night well before the 24 hours cancellation period as our oldest daughter couldn t stay longer and was we wanted to have the younger kids on the same floor as we were We ended up in a much smaller standard twin room NOT on the same floor after the first changed room was not properly cleaned up spent 1 hour time in changing rooms BUT we re finally told to pay the same price as the more comfortable 3 bed room irrespective of their previous confirmation that the rate would change as well After one hour discussions we nearly missed our plane due to inter alia non availability of the general manager etc they were only willing to cancel the breakfast A 4 star hotel should treat customer differently especially in light of that our invoice of our group was over 1 600 pounds and the amount in dispute 60 pounds deluxe room with opaque window glass no view, Good location very good access to the underground 
37058,Park International Hotel, we were upgraded to a exective room Unfortntely it was right underneath the Bar or some other service room and there was constant noise of furniture moving i don t think they should give that room out to anybody ,No Positive

37063,Park International Hotel, We had to ask for another room in the middle of the night because of a leakage it took us some time to get it the other room was worse than the first one No apologies no discount and the staff member who was checking us out said that all that was perfectly ok ,No Positive
37064,Park International Hotel, Made reservation a year ahead and was given the worse room available The phone did not work nor as the bed reading lamps After complaining they change me the 2nd night to a room as the one my reservation was made under my wife s name Soledad Molina But the treat from the front office manager was very disrespectful and with no knowledge of customer service, Locaci n is excellent
37065,Park International Hotel, Mice running around in the evening in the bar area not what I expect to see in a hotel Bedroom and bathroom very small , Hotel staff and location are good
37066,Park International Hotel, The breakfast is awful for a non British person Only english breakfast and some cereal and meager fruits If you don t eat pork good luck When you have the courage to ask if there is a non pork meat item a lady rolling here eyes chastises you and looks at you and talks with you in a diminishing way that you are not christian making you feel the discrimination And you pay for this food and the attitude This is a hotel in Kensington and they should be more respectful people of other religions in food choice they offer I asked if there is no pork item or chicken sausage How dare I ask was the cold shouldering attitude Just for scrambled eggs bread and disgustingly gooey beens 25 pounds was too much I left and found a deli to have a croissant and coffee in the street In this hotel unless you are christian and muslim or jewish you are not respected fro you food choice Ignorance and rudeness is at a level hard to match They have rice an miso soup for the Japanese tourists and nothing for non pork eaters Is this purposeful attitude Unfortunately they make you feel so Also wifi is from stone age I have seen faster internet that you don t have to pay in many third world countries , The front office is amazing Efficient and kind and very helpful 
37067,Park International Hotel, TV stations are very limited as is typical in European hotels the WiFi is not free in the room It was free in the lobby but you need to enter a password every hour so if you want to check your email in the am again in the evening you have to get another password , We booked a Jr Suite the room was spacious beautiful with many nice amenities The bed was extremely comfortable the whole facility is clean beautiful 
37068,Park International Hotel, Bed very uncomfortable could feel springs Given our room key and somebody still in room and after second attempt still somebody in room , Very clean room and ensuite

37076,Park International Hotel, Thought the breakfast could of included more fresh fruit , Friendly helpfl staff Spotlessly clean room Good location for Royal Albert Hall NH Museum
37077,Park International Hotel, The Wi fi at this hotel is as annoying as it gets If you didn t book directly through their website you won t get free wi fi in your rooms Not only you have to go to the lobby to use the Internet but you also have to get a username and password from the front desk EVERY SINGLE TIME After all this trouble you get a 128kbps Internet which you can barely do Google searches Seriously just charge me more and give me a good hassle free Internet , Rooms were small but comfortable and clean Fair for the price paid They use carpets though Bathroom and shower were also decent Location is also good
