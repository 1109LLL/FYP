403686,Hotel Wandl, Just a word of caution we were given directions to the off site parking but unfortunately we parked in the one next to the one we should have been in so didn t get the 10 per day hotel discount Parking for 2 days cost us 98 , Lovely hotel about a 4 minute walk to the centre of town Our room was spacious clean and airy despite only looking out onto other windows It has a lovely dining room and breakfast was great The hotel on Petersplatz and St Peter s Church is well worth looking around we went to a concert there which was excellent 
403687,Hotel Wandl, Nothing major to note Could have a minibar or at least water in room , Superb location elegant old hotel refurbished to include modern bathroom internet etc spatious comfortable room excellent bkfast very friendly helpful staff 
403688,Hotel Wandl, The carpet in the hallways needed to be replaced The towels were of poor quality too thin and small This was surprising in a hotel of this calibre Also no washcloth was provided , The decor in general except the upstairs carpets The big choice at the breakfast buffet The friendly staff The bathroom although it was small 
403689,Hotel Wandl, Missed baked beans for breakfast Loved everything else , Loved everything about this hotel The room location staff cleanliness breakfast and everything else was just how I wanted 
403690,Hotel Wandl, The room that I booked and fully paid before my arrival DID NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING but only the fan The room has 1 window and opens to the courtyard which is has no fresh air During my stay even the weather was around 24 degrees Celcius the room was unbearably hot I cannot imagine on a true summer day the BOOKING COM must be clear about these kind of lacks because I have asthma and I had the worst 4 nights in my life Another important issue that these kind of hotels located in the ancient buildings must be aware of their water pipe system During a 10 minutes of shower I got burnt frozen many times , the location is great also the breakfast the room is very large 
403691,Hotel Wandl, Housekeeping forgot to put towels in the room and a plastic garbage bag but each happened only once in a six night stay In addition the problems were swiftly taken care of The air conditioning was o k but somehow needed adjustment part of the time On occasion there was a loud sound which might have come from the plumbing or air conditioning Potential guests should know that the hotel does not offer food after breakfast but only drinks and snacks However there are many many restaurants and cafes very close to the hotel However all this was minor compared to the pluses I would definitely stay here again and again , The location and the staff were highlights as was the spacious breakfast room with three rooms Everything worked most of the time and when there were questions or requests they were dealt with immediately It was particularly nice that there was always a deep bowl full of apples at the front desk I especially liked the view of St Peter s Cathedral from the window of my room 
403692,Hotel Wandl, Everything was fine except for the dirty carpets in the foyer and corridors which gave an unpleasant experience especially when Viennese friends came to visit ,No Positive
403693,Hotel Wandl, The WIFI connection is not very good particularly if you are on the higher floor I was on the 5th floor I had difficulty with WIFI connections to my laptop While having a room on a higher floor sounds good it is is better to be on a lower floor and stay very close to the MODEM and Server to ensure good WIFI connections The only way I could use my laptop was to sit in the bar area The other point is when making a reservation through Booking com it is not made clear or obvious on the Booking com site that not all the rooms at Wandl come with air conditioning I only found this out at check in I then requested to change to rooms with air conditioning for which we had to pay extra I accepted the additional cost but I think Booking com needs to make clear that not ALL rooms have air conditioning , Everything was fine At check in the person handling the check in was helpful and organised the change of rooms so that I and my colleagues could have rooms with air conditioning for extra cost of course All the staff at Wandl are friendly and helpful 
403694,Hotel Wandl, No tea and coffee making facilities or complimentary water Soundproofing in room quite bad , Hotel and room very clean Good shower Staff friendly comfy bed excellent location to the centre 
403695,Hotel Wandl, No air conditioning in the rooms VERY loud ceiling fans No outside window or view Very basic rooms No kettle or drink making facilities no fridge in the room No ice making machines in the public areas Staff unhelpful and no English spoken other than by reception ,No Positive
403696,Hotel Wandl, No tea coffee making facilities in the room Two single beds joined together , The fruit at reception The feel of the plush red carpet under my feet Claudia s smile Friendly cleaning staff The coffee machine at the breakfast buffet The view of St peter s church 
403697,Hotel Wandl, I had trouble with the WiFi I was promptly moved to another room when I complained , Delicious breakfast and quite a spread at that Claudia at the reception was particularly helpful All the staff were courteous and pleasant Being at Petersplatz made life east 
403698,Hotel Wandl, I run out of hand moisturiser I didn t expect that they don t have it in the bathroom They provide 2 tubes of hair conditioners 1 cleanser but no moisturiser That s a bit strange , Location is excellent walkable distances to a lot of attractions especially good if you have only a day or 2 in Vienna And the hotel room is large bathroom is well designed Services are good We ask for late check out and staff was able to accommodate The breakfast buffet is good It s also very quiet despite of the central location good for resting 
403699,Hotel Wandl, Our room faced onto an enclosed atrium courtyard which made things a bit stifling as you could not access outside air and had to depend on the hotel s air con system which for us was set a bit too warm , Old but well maintained hotel fantastic location in the old city everything is in walking distance The breakfast was big and hearty Staff very accommodating
403700,Hotel Wandl, There wasn t iron in each room however there was a room downstairs in front of the reception in order to iron your clothes it wasn t a big deal , Great location Great staff very close to train station public transportation there are lots of good restaurants around it you should try Cafe Englander for schnitzel walking distance to all the river and night life very clean room professional and friendly staff full buffet breakfast served from 6 30 am to 11am
403701,Hotel Wandl, At prime time on weekend days the breakfast area was crowded and finding a seat difficult The weather was warm when we were in Vienna our room was warm and there was no way to cool it down the window opened into a glass covered courtyard , The location is absolutely fabulous just minutes from the cathedral the Hofburg the subway and all kinds of eating places The staff is exceedingly helpful The parking is in a secure underground garage about a 10 minute walk away I highly recommend Hotel Wandl 
403702,Hotel Wandl, Room in which I was staying was kinda tiny But frankly it is okay, Actually everything is great Breakfast is rich wifi super quick stuff the friendliest in the world 
403703,Hotel Wandl, No tea facilities in room Room really hot with no air conditioning ceiling fan only and window opened into an enclosed conservatory type area that was likewise hot But as we were outside most of the visit it was not insurmountable , Location So close to central area restaurants attractions etc 
403704,Hotel Wandl, There s a construction next to the hotel which is beyond the hotel s control anyway , Everything is perfect Best location as u can reach everywhere on foot Staff are wonderful and super helpful Good selection of breakfast Totally worth the money
403705,Hotel Wandl, The wifi signal on the top floor Level 5 is weak and unstable , The location is excellent The staff are professional courteous and helpful The hotel is well appointed and spotlessly clean Breakfast is excellent 
403706,Hotel Wandl, The rooms need to be better equipped for a 4 star their rooms were very average firstly all rooms have two single beds joined to make a double bed which isnt done quite well So for couples its not a very good choice The washrooms need better toiletries in a 4 star in vienna you would expect more , We stayed here for 3 nights the location of the hotel is excellent it allows you to walk through the city quite easily The breakfast is good and the front desk is helpful 
403707,Hotel Wandl, Make sure to pick a larger room the single ones are really tiny , The hotel is located just in the hart of the old Vienna but very quiet street Staff super helpful and friendly 
403708,Hotel Wandl, Single room was a not so cozy a bit austere contrasting with the rest of the building It lacked an extra touch for more comfort , Beautiful building Very good breakfast Excellent location Quiet 
403709,Hotel Wandl, Don t know if it was just our room but there was a step up an inch or two into our bathroom from the bedroom and unfortunately resulted in a very bruised set of toes , We were in the middle of the main district and could walk to the majority of the places we wanted to visit Also a very short walk to the tube station buses and trams all very convenient 
403710,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, I asked for a room with better WIFI connection and they gave me a great room WIFI worked and I did not have to go downstairs to the lounge in order to get online 
403711,Hotel Wandl, The wifi could have been better , Nice with sparkling wine at the breakfast I enjoyed the fresh fruits and croissants with nutella Very comfortable bed and TV with many channels Also very satisfied with the cleaning of the rooms Nice friendly and helpful staff Perfect location to Stephansplatz and the metro 
403712,Hotel Wandl, The problem is the WIFI connection is not very good in the room and to use my laptop I needed to come into the reception lounge area , The hotel is well located The staff were all very helpful and friendly Wandl also provides a computer and printer for guest s use which is very helpful and convenient Definitely recommend Hotel Wandl 
403713,Hotel Wandl, In room tea coffee facilities would be a bonus but that s a minor issue really , Staff were most welcoming friendly and helpful Location great for cafes restaurants shops and metro 
403714,Hotel Wandl, This time we opted for the smaller rooms which are very small Will return to the somewhat larger rooms on future stays , This was our third time at Wandl It is a family owned property with old world charm and everything is well kept Breakfast is good and public rooms are lovely 
403715,Hotel Wandl, Breakfast was nice for the majority of our stay but my husband ate some scrambled eggs on the morning we checked out and by the time we got to Vienna airport at 3pm to catch the flight home he was being sick all over the place which made the journey back to Heathrow horrendous , Location was fantastic it was close to everything and the transport system made it easy to get around 
403716,Hotel Wandl, Rooms too hot and airless Quite basic for the cost , Lovely decor in the public parts of the hotel Great breakfast and very helpful staff Superb location in the centre of Vienna 
403717,Hotel Wandl, The staff were appalling The night porter was very drunk so difficult to check out at 7 am The broadband is non existent Very noisy as walls and doors very thin Very basic offering in rooms Thin towels no hot water before around 8 am Then only tepid , Location is Ok but in the middle of a number of building sites so very noisy 
403718,Hotel Wandl, Annoying slow lift even in so called NOT busy times I used stairs 90 on the time Lack of room ventilation no A C but can open window into central void Wi Fi is bad Ask for private wirless although signal is poor and slow most times No minibar or Tea Coffee facilities, Central location Hospitality and helpfulness of staff Breakfast choices Private wireless modem free WiFi not accessible is my room
403719,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, The location was fantastic It was very close to all of the major sights in the city but it was not in a super busy place which was very nice The rooms were furnished very nicely and provided all the basic amenities I loved the interior of the hotel it has a lot of character and Viennese charm 
403720,Hotel Wandl, Breakfast buffet generally OK but scrambled eggs were solid and semmels not really fresh and crisp, Friendly staff clean room efficient check in and out
403721,Hotel Wandl, The room was extremely hot and as many other reviewers noted the window opened to an enclosed courtyard that was just as warm Consequently I spent much of one evening sweating through the sheets , The staff was very nice Breakfast was great The bed was extremely comfortable The location was amazing 
403722,Hotel Wandl, The room had no coffee or tea making facilities which was a bit of a let down , Location Right in the heart of Vienna te Main Street along with St Stephans cathedral are literally a 2 minute walk There is a underground station there for easy travels across the city The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly Good breakfast too 
403723,Hotel Wandl, Breakfast could have been better , The location is excellent 3 minutes walk from K rtner Stra e The night staff were friendly and helpful The room was very spacious 
403724,Hotel Wandl, 1 During shower the water s temperature might turn cold hot suddenly I didn t touch it 2 Room is small 3 Our queen bed is actually composed of two twin beds I didn t expect that even for motels , The front desk assistants and cleaning ladies are super friendly 
403725,Hotel Wandl, No slippers provided and the shower stall was quite small , The staff was very friendly and accommodating The bathroom was very clean and modern with good toiletries
403726,Hotel Wandl, As Superior rooms go it was pretty basic relatively small with poor facilities e g no in room safe no coffee tea facilities no mini bar fridge Or maybe this is just a European hotel room , Good location comfortable bed
403727,Hotel Wandl, In my opinion it is a decent standard of 4 hotel not brilliant but it s ok Basics are key to a good stay for me Ventilation and room temperature We visited in November and with no outside wall window window into the central courtyard of the building with no fresh air and the room was pretty warm Pillows A basic point for me is that I need a decent pillow mine was really soft so I asked for a different one however they only have 1 type of pillow 2 pillows isn t the solution small point you may think but it s the difference between a good nights sleep and a great stay or not I believe a 4 hotel should have more than 1 type of pillow , The hotel is in a great position in the city to visit all areas great transport connections just round the corner and within walking distance to all the main attractions The beds were comfortable there was plenty hot water the reception staff were very pleasant and helpful Breakfast has plenty variety on offer however they could look at the flow as there was a lot of bottlenecks to get food and drinks 
403728,Hotel Wandl, Tiny room I am travelling regularly but I ve never stayed in such a small room more like a mousetrap while still paying a pretty steep price 100 Euro Would not go there again , Breakfast was excellent WLAN was working very well and pretty fast located right in the heart of Vienna
403729,Hotel Wandl, Room was very staffey even we left the window open but didn t help had no air conditioning we were amaised, Location was excellent brackfast was very good
403730,Hotel Wandl, Not enough fresh air ventilation in the room s with only one window facing to an inner courtyard sealed with a roof no air conditioning just a ventilation , Excellent location
403731,Hotel Wandl, Staff not really helpful they will not take care of your car The garage recommended is not the closest one I got burned twice in the shower by unstable hot water Breakfast just average , Excellent location
403732,Hotel Wandl, Room was little small for 3 adults after opening the sofa bed, The hotel staff were extremely friendly and very helpful they offered us umbrellas for the rain and they are always happy and ready to help us about any tourism questions you can buy from them sightseeing tours also their location is great walking distance from Hofburg palace and sisi museum also lots of shopping places near there 
403733,Hotel Wandl, The room was miserable Small with a VERY SMALL BED no air conditioning hot and the window was on the hotel corridor So there was NO really window I think this was non tolerable ,No Positive
403734,Hotel Wandl, A kettle would have been appreciated and having to iron clothes in a common area near reception was a little unusual My biggest issue was the noise coming from the cafe directly across from the hotel but the hotel is not responsible for that , The staff was amazing They couldn t do enough to help Nothing was too hard and the receptionist with dark hair working in the evening when I checked in was amazing Loved the period features in the room lovely bathroom with heated towel rack and English channels on TV
403735,Hotel Wandl, Small room but I didn t mind The floor was a little dusty , The breakfast includes champagne Staff were lovely Central location All the mod cons you need 
403736,Hotel Wandl, Our choice but we had a deluxe room on the first visit and a standard room on the second There is a big difference in terms of space view comfort and facilities If you can afford it chose the deluxe room , Location is excellent within easy walking distance of many of the main attractions city underground and restaurants A beautiful building Continental breakfast was good The hotel willingly stored our bags when we took a 3 day trip to Budapest 
403737,Hotel Wandl, Air conditioning didn t work so room was hot But if you ask reception they give you fans which makes a big difference, Staff were courteous and fast check in We arrived at noon we were checked in within five minutes and shown to our room which was ready Breakfast was self serving and hot Bar is very reasonable priced
403738,Hotel Wandl, This was my most expensive hotel 117 for 1 night of Austria and the smallest room I ever got in a four star hotel wolrdwide Don t book here if you want a room for one person The room itself is fairly small the bathroom is even smaller If you are even a little obese you will be stuck on the toilet No bath just a shower No airco only a fan , Great breakfeast
403739,Hotel Wandl, Standard rooms are very standard with minimal comfort No point in having a room safe as it was not bolted down , The location is great Within easy walking distance of the underground city restaurants and several major tourist attractions Breakfast was good Staff were generally helpful and happy to store our luggage when we went to Budapest for a couple of nights We had a superior then standard room If your budget allows chose the superior Bigger and better all round It it doesn t suggest you look elsewhere 
403740,Hotel Wandl, The big bed was a two joined bed with two mattress so you ever fail in the gap between No A C but a roof fan that did the work perfectly No mini fridge, In a rainy day the hotel lend me an umbrella Good breakfast Very friendly employees
403741,Hotel Wandl, single room 9m2 for 4star hotel even it is center of Wienna it is not for regular customers, excellent receptionist black one solving issues on the spot

403744,Hotel Wandl, Poor Wi Fi connection on the last floor but mostly we spend our time outside the Hotel , Hotel is in the Center and its very quiet place opposite the Church We were provided with the room on the last floor as i asked during a booking Personal is very friendly I m very demanding person but it was a pleasure to stay in this Hotel 
403745,Hotel Wandl, I think it is a serious problem that the rooms are not air conditioned The type and look of the hotel would imply a c so it is an unpleasant surprise in a hot day to find out it does not have a c Nevertheless the room was very pleasant and I appreciated that the person at the reception upgraded my room to one with a street view Thank you , My room was beautifully decorated with high quality bathroom and toilet rooms Excellent design throughout the room I would have enjoyed many more nights there 
403746,Hotel Wandl, it is a city centre hotel therefore you should expect some street noise Nothing too intrusive however , Excellent well trained and well informed staff Beautifully laid out rooms with superb cleanliness Helpful friendly Barrman and great service at breakfast 
403747,Hotel Wandl, The room is rather too warm Yes it s summer but would be more comfortable if the room was cooler The ceiling fan helps but I don t like sleeping with the fan running unfortunately , Beautiful hotel perfect location quiet nice staff nice room clean and good breakfast 
403748,Hotel Wandl, I stayed for four days during July in a so called business room It was 35 degrees and there is no air condition in the entire hotel The room was boiling There is no free water or mini bar in the business room The king size bed were two single beds put together There is free wifi in the entire hotel but no reception in the room All in all the business room just felt like a bigger economy room The facilities of this hotel are not up to the 21st century I would only recommend the place to a tourist traveling off season The hotel is not suitable if you are on a business trip or if you do not like you room to be a sauna ,No Positive
403749,Hotel Wandl, It was very hot when I was there in the 30s and I would have liked air con in my room If it is often as hot as this I think the hotel should install , pleasant decor nice room attractive view very good location friendly and helpful staff
403750,Hotel Wandl, Price little bit high for a small room , Excellent location middle of the city Good breakfast I was able to check in earlier than normal checkin time I made a request Very helpfull staff I had lost my earing and they called me back and sent it to my country Very good service 
403751,Hotel Wandl, No air conditioning Don t know if all the rooms have no ac or just some rooms There is a ceiling fan but it would be too noisy to sleep if you switch to highest Therefore it s either too hot or too noisy to sleep for me , I personally like the size of the room because I m traveling alone so I don t really need big room anyway Excellent location 
403752,Hotel Wandl, The wifi was quasi inexistant in my room Bathroom was a bit small and staff forgot to refill the shower gel The staircases were both closed and I had to use the elevator which I thought could be unsafe in case of fire , Fabulous location very quiet room 
403753,Hotel Wandl, no coffee tea facilities in the room no air condition no mini bar fridge in 4 hotel web site is not accessible in Firefox inexperienced and unfriendly staff in the reception I will never come back to Wandl Hotel ever, location cleanness
403754,Hotel Wandl, The rooms are extremely tiny and without air conditioning thus it gets quite stuffy in summer , Very clean great location friendly and welcoming staff In walking distance to everything you would want in Vienna 
403755,Hotel Wandl, Room was slightly small but it didn t really matter , Staff were very friendly and helpful Good breakfast included excellent location Would recommend 
403756,Hotel Wandl, It would be great if there was a corner for smokers with a bar table The bed was a bit too short , The breakfast was great wide choice of meals and drinks with Austrian and Styrian specialties The choice of coffees was fantastic The bathroom was very clean 
403757,Hotel Wandl, The desk arranged for a cab to pick me up and I got hosed at the airport when driver demanded an exorbitant rate otherwise very pleased with experience, Staff and facilities were very comfortable and convenient Christoph was excellent
403758,Hotel Wandl, I had a single bed room and it was too small something like a dormitory room It was not bad but still not comfortable enough for the price , I really liked the kind and friendly staff Everyone was friendly and did everything they could to help me with whatever I needed The location is great in the heart of the city close to most of the sightseeing spots and to the U bahn and Wien Mitte 
403759,Hotel Wandl, Nothing, Location was fabulous Near lots of interesting tourist sights shops restaurants and metro Hotel was spotless the cleanest hotels I ve ever been in Breakfast was very fresh the eggs tasted like eggs Can t fault this hotel 
403760,Hotel Wandl, They do not accept credit cards and do not make out a cash receipt in the bar I had to look for an ATM at night , Hotel is located in the heart of Vienna Good breakfast 
403761,Hotel Wandl, The walls are very thin I had to use ear plugs otherwise I could understand the conversation of the guests next door , The location Bed was very comfortable storage space in closet a plus and bathroom looked very nice Ambiance of the hotel Room maids were very helpful when I asked for change of sheets 
403762,Hotel Wandl, I would prefer a double bed instead of 2 single ones One time they forgot to put toilette paper in our bathroom Sometimes the WiFi wasn t working , The location of the hotel is the most luxurious of the center of Vienna Very nice breakfast The staff was very polite 
403763,Hotel Wandl, Parking garage being far 7 minutes walk not 5 as they say and what they recommend was expensive I know it is not the hotel s service but please be ready to pay 1 3 of the accommodation for parking as an extra , facility
403764,Hotel Wandl, I hated the fact that the bedroom had a window on to the internal yard and not to the street This caused lack of air in the room and a lot of noises from common areas , Staff was very helpful b fast was good
403765,Hotel Wandl, The rooms were very warm in February with a window onto an atrium not into fresh air , Incredibly central and really good value for somewhere so perfectly placed Lovely rooms decent breakfast friendly staff 
403766,Hotel Wandl, Noisy bathroom vent fan No aircondition in the room only radiator Keep the window open or sleep on top of your blankets No sleepers and minibar Tiny room, Perfect location
403767,Hotel Wandl, The beds were a bit hard We got used to them Otherwise the rooms were bigger and nicer than expected , Hotel Wandl is right behind St Peter s and very close to St Stephen s Cathedral in District 1 an amazing location close to restaurants churches museums the Hofburg and more Yet it was also very quiet in the hotel The staff was very helpful with a room change when we needed to add a guest and were always pleasant Breakfast was a real treat 
403768,Hotel Wandl, The rooms aren t as stylish or pristine as in some hotels but comfortable enough , For location Hotel Wandl is unbeatable a short walk to everything you could want in the centre of Vienna Staff were friendly and helpful 
403769,Hotel Wandl, The inner courtyard rooms have no windows to the outside so the room was quite noisy and lacked fresh air , The location is perfect Staff is very friendly and helpful Room was clean 
403770,Hotel Wandl, Second room we ve booked was with a window into covered courtyard so with no window into the world whatsoever, we ve booked 1 room with extra bed for a kid since room was not large enough hotel moved us to upgrade double room suite for the same price hotel s attitude was excelent
403771,Hotel Wandl, Staff is quite unfriendly Rooms are tiny and the furnishing seems very old and outdated Furthermore there was construction going on and it was highly unpleasant for us to spend any time in that surrounding to top up the horrible experience of our box like room we overlook something like an inner courtyard which was disgusting , Location is perfect Clean rooms 
403772,Hotel Wandl, Only good service and a good time , Changed hotels at the last minute and were delighted we did Wandl turned out to be perfect for us We were in Vienna for Christmas markets and lights Wandl is right off the Graben with some of the most beautiful Christmas lights in the world Hotel itself could not have been better Old family run place with all modern updates but still filled with old world charm Everything was clean and nicely appointed with excellent taste Pleasant public rooms and a nice bar with delightful staff Wandl will now be our go to hotel in Vienna 
403773,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, A very well run and friendly hotel which is a tribute to family mamagement Decor excellent with good style room very good breakfast superb I would recommend it to anyone as it is also superbly situated 
403774,Hotel Wandl, At 8 00 am cleaning lady opening the door with question when do you check out Very sad I am sure it was my last stay in this hotel , Location in city center Nice room 
403775,Hotel Wandl, They had a fan instead of AC in my room although it is better for the environment , The location was really great but slightly tricky to find at first They had my room ready for me at 11am which was really great as I had been on an early morning flight Friendly staff room was comfortable 
403776,Hotel Wandl, The rooms were quite tired and needed redecorating however the bathroom was new and clean, Location was excellent All staff were professional friendly and helpful Breakfast was great 
403777,Hotel Wandl, No tea or coffee facilities in room room had stairs to the toilet which was a nightmare of u need to use the toilet during the night in the pitch dark, Location was fantastic and in the main staff were brilliant and very friendly
403778,Hotel Wandl, So crowded no minibar in room not clean enough old fashion brekfast saloon is so crowded we can not find any table also there were some reserved tables can not understood logic that everyone was guest of same hotel , Location is perfect Personel at front desk is so gentle 
403779,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, My hotel of choice anytime I am in Vienna awesome location nice unpretentious and comfortable rooms great price quality ratio friendly staff good breakfast
403780,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, Everything including the facilities service and comfort was excellent but I was mostly impressed with the helpfulness of their staff I forgot a set of photo booth pictures which had very valuable meaning to me and when I contacted the hotel to see if they had found the forgotten item they replied immediately and even sent back my pictures with no extra charge 
403781,Hotel Wandl, To be perfect 10 10 the hotel could have had a pool and a gym Also there could have been more breakfast options with better coffee , Brilliant central venue for business and Vienna sight seeing
403782,Hotel Wandl, There was no ventilation in the bedroom Opening the window was ineffective because the window looked into an enclosed internal courtyard There was no cross ventilation or mechanical ventilation , Location and the friendly relaxed atmosphere
403783,Hotel Wandl, There was no outside view from most of the rooms When we got the room it wasn t cleaned well small crumb on the table and one trash on the floor , Location was great Just in the heart of the old town 
403784,Hotel Wandl, Only toiletries provided are hand wash and generic hair and body wash, Excellent location excellent breakfast with prosecco beautiful hotel Room was fine but nothing special
403785,Hotel Wandl, I happen to have some problems with the remote control of the TV which I guess needed a new battery , Everybody from reception to housekeeper was friendly well informed and efficient The location was perfect for having to be in the centre on Vienna 
403786,Hotel Wandl, Poor ventilation in the hotel meant we were too hot even in October Literature indicated the bar was open 24 hours but reception staff were a bit reluctant and slow to serve us a drink at 12am and were unable to provide a coffee at all as machines were off , Location was excellent and breakfast room was lovely 
403787,Hotel Wandl,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Our room was superb spotlessly clean and a very comfortable bed Breakfast provided was also very good Excellent location so close to the main attractions and all the amazing shops 
403788,Hotel Wandl, Lady at the reception at the check in was not friendly at all not a good start , The location of the hotel and breakfast was superb Bell boy and restaurant guys super nice 
403789,Hotel Wandl, The breakfast bufet was poor the intenet connection was weak and it didn t reach my room When i booked they informed me that it was a four star hotel but it should be only two star, The location was great
403790,Hotel Wandl, The cleanliness of the room could have been better The bed linnen was very white and clean but the room in itself was very very dusty , Staff was very helpfull when I arrived and the lights in the room didn t work They made every effort to get it fixed 
403791,Hotel Wandl, room was quite small simple and oldfashioned, perfect location in short walking distance to the Stephansdom nice interieur in lobby and breakfast room good and rich breakfast buffet
403792,Hotel Wandl, To be told that a turnaround time of 8 hours for dry cleaning wa absolutely impossible was very disappointing when I walked to the dry cleaner myself at 9 30am and was told the item could be collected in as little as 4 hours The staff member made no effort to assist even though I made my desperation very clear She really let down my experience despite every other staff member being amazing My single room was tiny with a view of a brick wall I was unhappy about not being able to iron in my room When you travel for business this is not a luxury it is a necessity It was nice of the staff to allow me to iron downstairs but this was inconvenient , All but one staff member was very helpful and went out of their way to accommodate my requirements The hotel itself is very grand and I loved the period features Breakfast was wonderful and the decor was beautiful The bathroom was beautifully appointed and very clean despite being the size of a shoebox 
403793,Hotel Wandl, Bath room setup False floors vinyl top layer sounded noisy when walking over them hallways look like a hospital, Location Very friendly checkin Correct checkout
403794,Hotel Wandl, Only minor thing was our room overlooked church whose bells started at 7 every morning then every 15 mins after , Location was excellent close to all local sites underground stations 
403795,Hotel Wandl, Nothing , We arrived at 10am and immediately received the keys before official check in time which was very nice as we were very tired after night flight Perfect location in the heart of the city Good breakfast The rooms looking the street has a small balcony suitable for staying of two persons We had very nice view on the church
