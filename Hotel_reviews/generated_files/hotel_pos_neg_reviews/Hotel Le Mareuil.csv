206452,Hotel Le Mareuil,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and friendly even taking the time to write down a list of restaurants they d recommend that would still be open after midnight I arrived very late 
206453,Hotel Le Mareuil, I Hate plastic matrass protectors I don t need a diaper when I sleep Room a bit smallish , Looks well maintained A surprisingly well functioning shower Very nice and large towels Nice breakfast 
206454,Hotel Le Mareuil, Our stay could have been longer , Management and staff were everything one would want professional helpful knowledgeable and courteous Breakfasts were enjoyable enhanced by expresso beverages newspapers and magazines in French and English
206455,Hotel Le Mareuil,No Negative, The hotel is located in a central convenient location to 2 Metro Stops Oberkampff 3mins walk around the corner from Hotel and Republique 5mins walk from Hotel and larger Metro stop with more interchange lines The highlight of this hotel is the great bed which was the most comfortable I ve ever slept in during my travel and gave good rest after a long day touring I must also mention the Team of Arnaud Gilles and Jonathan who looked after us during our stay with the most helpful friendly service They also recommended wonderful local restaurants for Dinner which we were not disappointed with I had requested a High Floor with Juliette Balcony for our Wedding Anniversary and this was provided to us on our check in Highly recommend this Hotel to anyone visiting Paris as the location is the best in my opinion with restaurants cafes boulangeries and a laundromat small supermarket just around the corner from the Hotel 
206456,Hotel Le Mareuil, It was great Maybe the rooms are not so big but good use of size so for 3 nights more than enough for the 2 of us , Colourful clean rooms nice materials used for decoration high quality towels very nice hammam and eventhough in small room good fitness equipment Close to Republique several metro lines Street itself is quiet 
206457,Hotel Le Mareuil, nothing, I travel every two weeks to Paris and always book a room in Le Mareuil It s the only hotel where I always sleep well and where I have fitness and big room for reasonable price I love the night cove in the rooms 
206458,Hotel Le Mareuil, No complaints, The staff service was excellent throughout Good room with comfortable bed and well equipped Located close to two Metro stations and Plaza Republique
206459,Hotel Le Mareuil, Rooms were a a tad on the small side , Very friendly and helpful staff gave us great local restaurant suggestions and helped us with bookings Cute clean rooms 
206460,Hotel Le Mareuil, Nothing, The rooms were spacious clean and airy Very quiet location and staff were super helpful without being too in your face As soon as we arrived they personally showed us to our room and explained where everything was equipped us with a map and even an umbrella as it was raining heavily We will definitely be staying here again and are already planning our next trip later this year 
206461,Hotel Le Mareuil, Nothing All good , Fantastic helpful staff Adjoining rooms more like an apartment than hotel and spacious by Paris standards so great for families Standout was the quality of the bed fabulous 
206462,Hotel Le Mareuil,No Negative, A great location within a short walk to the metro or indeed not a long walk to many beautiful places to see eat and shop The staff were friendly and helpful making you feel comfortable from prior check in with an email 7 days before right through to check out Great little fitness room and hammam spa add to your escape We had a standard room and it was cosy but for the price it was perfectly good value and we would highly recommend for a couple travelling 
206463,Hotel Le Mareuil,No Negative, The room was comfortable and Hotel was well located so the City was easily accessible The highlight was the extremely helpful front desk personnel with special mention to Gilles Arnaud and Sohrab on an earlier stay 10 days apart 
206464,Hotel Le Mareuil, The wifi could be improved but still really good for hotel standards , Very friendly staff really good food and really nice facilities Really close to good transport connections as well Would definitely recommend 
206465,Hotel Le Mareuil, wifi is a little weak rooms on the first floor are a bit noisy you can hear the rooms above and some street noise room 12 was near the lift so I would advise a room farther away the bed was 2 singles pushed together and even though they placed a thick bedding on top to hold them together you could still feel the crack in the middle classic room is a tad small , amazing location close to the metro in a lively neighborhood Great rainfall shower double glazed windows nice pillows soft bed nice room d cor 
206466,Hotel Le Mareuil, Rue de Malte is a quieter side road and there were discarded needles and homeless men close outside I did feel vulnerable at night when walking back from the metro my fault as I should have got a taxi to the door However this is Paris and the hotel is so well positioned to walk and explore that such issues which are issues in any major city are ones that are no fault of the hotel , As soon as I arrived I was made to feel like a valued customer The staff were friendly and helpful from the front desk to room service Anything I requested such as breakfast in my room an iron a taxi was all swiftly dealt with The breakfast was great and for Paris the price a very reasonable 18 As a solo female traveller I felt safe inside the cocoon of my beautiful and very comfortable room and though outside on the street I did feel vulnerable see additional comment the hotel makes it s guests feel very welcome and secure Oberkampf metro is a stones throw from the hotel I managed to run it in heels when late for a wedding so it must be close and is perfect for Eurostar travellers such as me as it is only a few stops direct on line 5 to Gare du Nord Thank you to the hotel for giving me a very good experience of comfort and luxury on my fairly limited budget I hope to stay again and will recommend the hotel to everyone 
206467,Hotel Le Mareuil, The coffee table was a little dirty and so was the bathroom floor in certain spots Wifi could have been stronger on the 6th floor Bathroom not as pretty as the rest of the room and was a bit dark , I was upgraded to a deluxe room that was really nice and spacious Pretty room with good soundproofing Nice selection of tv channels Minibar and safe in room Really close to metro Hotel located on quiet street in city center Great lighting Great shower Good pillows and soft bed Deluxe room had a small juliette balcony which was really sweet

206472,Hotel Le Mareuil,No Negative, Nice and quite spacious room for Paris Clean Looks like renovated Great device for sleeping with lights and sound could be more sounds i managed to get only 1 type Good bathroom and the eco soap gel for shower etc My company is 3 minutes walk But if you come for sightseeing location maybe not ideal Even though it is only 6 minutes walk to the metro Repablique But for me the district isn t that good 
206473,Hotel Le Mareuil, Wi fi speed in the 4 floor room was really poor , Excellent location close to subway and the lively district of Le Marais worth exploring on the top of Paris must see The crew extremely helpful and friendly We did not have breakfast at the hotel so I cannot say but there is so many interesting places around to have breakfast that it is really worth eating outside in my opinion
