89986,Okko Hotels Paris Porte De Versailles, For us the location was a bit too far out from the main city sights , Super clean new hotel with a lot of extras excellent afternoon welcome drinks and snacks and great breakfast 
89987,Okko Hotels Paris Porte De Versailles, It stated there was parking on website which was not correct and coming there unloading and checking in was harassed by the police for parking right in front by the door on private property he wanted to ticket us in a foreign car And when we tried to park on the street both meters on this actual street are broken and didnt work Then upon departure again moved the car out front check out and load the bags in the car theres many since were on a long trip and the police put a ticket on our car The woman at the front desk went out to speak to them and it seemed pointless but she said they said to tear it up so she did But I do hope our rental car co in Spain doesn t receive this ticket and we get charged for this So besides this and not having a luggage trolley everything inside the hotel was the best ever , Everything was Superb I do hope your brand will expand in Europe and USA I have stayed at the Four Seasons Resorts Marriotts Hilton Brands and you guys blow them away Excellent job and cant wait to visit and stay with you again Also loved you carry Nuxe brand of products really love this french brand

89989,Okko Hotels Paris Porte De Versailles, The only problem was that everytime I showered the water would run towards the sink area and it would get flooded The shower area is not sealed properly There is no barrier to conceal the water and therefore this situation is a safety hazard for adult and children incase they slip and hit the floor , Our stay included breakfast which was good and always fresh It was a typical french breakfast so dont expect a full english one Room was nice and clean TV was excellent had good selection of movies All the staff was quite friendly and their English was way better than my French The hotel and surrounding areas are quite safe Balard Metro Station is 4 mins walk away Hotel gave complimentary drinks everynight one per person and a snack buffet was also served The hotel is great will definetly stay there again STOP thinking and book it NOW 
89990,Okko Hotels Paris Porte De Versailles, When hotel gets crowded breakfast options are really limited Body lotion missing so you need to have one of your own it might be relevant to some people , I really like the concept of this Hotel I will definitely will return when needed They provide breakfast evening snack business lounge where you can concentrate on working have a drink basically you don t need to leave the hotel if you only staying for one night or business purpose really convenient rooms are modern good size clean well equipped
