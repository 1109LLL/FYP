351033,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was relatively small and the hotel corridors feel somewhat old From the several fire proof doors I see along the way to my room perhaps the management think there is some risk of that The bed had a dent in the middle as though they d combined two beds into one , The location of the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with charming cafes and good local food nearby There is a theatre down the street too The staff were helpful and gave us good recommendations on what to eat The exterior of the hotel has an old school charm I reckon was an old hotel that has been refurbished 
351034,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Nothing, Good size room facing inner courtyard quiet for a city centre hotel Staff very helpful excellent breakfast Buffet with delicious strudel heaven
351035,Mercure Josefshof Wien, I didn t like people smoking in the courtyard whilst eating my breakfast it rather spoilt the hotel They should have to smoke outside the front of the hotel We were not the only ones who thought this was bad , Very quiet location
351036,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Very expensive parking no negotiation used 2 and half days paid three no welcome water and they TOLD me what I should have done what they should do this right Just be sure you understand all rooms offered on booking com are on the attic fifth floor stairs up down One elevator only long waiting, Location excellent breakfast quick check in out
351037,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Breakfast was very expensive at 18 euros a head for what was just an ordinary continental breakfast with stale rolls cold scrambled egg and burnt bacon Suggest you eat out for a fraction of the price, The hotel is located up a small side street only a few hundred meters from the Rat House Town Hall and Museum quarter The bed was very comfortable and the room although it had no view it was very very quiet for a hotel in the center of a major city The shower was wonderful and much needed in temperatures in excess of 30deg The staff were very helpful pleasant and friendly 
351038,Mercure Josefshof Wien, There is free WiFi but it is extremely slow If you need to send documents or download anything this is simply not doable Not the place if you need to do some work For a hotel of this category an excellent internet connection should be a given Yet staff was very friendly to help out with hotel PCs , The perfect location for your stay in Vienna Lovely courtyard for an extended breakfast Attractions sites are in easy walking distance Try out Fromme Helene for dinner or spend a lovely evening at Weinstube Josefstadt and join the locals for a glass of wine and some cold meats and cheese 
351039,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Even though we were in the room equipped for disabled guests the mattress was so soft that my father had trouble propping himself up from bed everytime And it made it harder to get a good sleep Very limited choice of food for room service , Clean and quiet very spacious and well equipped bathroom genuinely helpful staff Our room for disabled guests was generally well equipped except for the mattress see above 
351040,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Only had an internal view of the hotel courtyard but others may be able to request an outside room at the point of booking or so the receptionist told me , The convenient location of the property made sight seeing easy We went to the festival on Rathaus square every evening which was a short walk away The breakfast was super vast choice and in a lovely room 
351041,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was a bit smelly old and musty maybe smoky but we were offered to pay for an upgrade to the new part of the hotel which we chose not to do It was very clean though , The hotel staff were really helpful with recommendations and advice on travel
351042,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No tea and coffee facilities in the room , Very spacious room and bathroom with good power shower Excellent location very close to the underground Very quiet location considering so central Very friendly staff on reception for both check in and check out 
351043,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Room was mediocre but it was only a single room however could have done with a little updating although the bathroom was very modern , Excellent location and the staff were great really friendly and helpful Breakfast selection was fantastic and the fact that it was until 12 was really good 
351044,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room didn t have a coffee tea making facility which was surprising given the quality of the hotel Reception facility could have been better organised as there were queues at times extra staff did come but it was slightly tardy and could be slicker , The hotel was close to the centre of Vienna and lots of the attractions The room was clean and reasonably sized 
351045,Mercure Josefshof Wien, When you first walk into this hotel after the surprise of the not so nice street view You could be mistaken into thinking that the four stars it has been awarded are merited In fact the only parts of the hotel that merit four stars are the public areas We were given the keys to our room and made our way up in the lift to the shabbiest room I have had the misfortune to be allocated I left the cases there and returned to reception where I was given another slightly larger slightly less shabby room I don t know if these rooms are given to those booking on this website or if this is the standard of all of the rooms If it is steer clear Don t get me wrong most all of the staff were pleasant and helpful and they are a credit to Mecure However based on the quality of the room I would struggle to award three stars The bathroom was falling to bits and badly designed the shower was hanging off the wall and the screen was square to fit a curved corner bath meaning water went everywhere The tap on the wash hand basin was activated by a sensor making brushing your teeth a task in its self with one hand against the sensor to ensure the water ran and washing your face almost impossible Each day a no smoking sign was placed on our bed we booked the room knowing it was non smoking so this felt a little bizarre especially given the nicotine coloured wallpaper adorning the walls There was an up holstered chair in the room covered in dirty marks There were two bottles of complimentary water in the fridge both sparkling When we asked for still water we were told we would have to pay for it No coffee facilities and no ironing facilities in the rooms you could access an ironing room with your room key I don t have mine with me when I was shown to this room and earned a tut and dirty look for this , Checking out as I knew I wouldn t have to go back The staff were very helpful
351046,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The staff extremely helpful as we needed to mail gifts back home they Provided us with a box and taped it up and labelled it and pointed us in the Correct direction to a post office 
351047,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Room aircon ventilation was so loud you cant sleep with it on Floor squeaks when you walk around in room Breakfast served till 12 00 lunch then closed till 7am the next day why not serve dinner The place is empty till then, Breakfast was great good variety of foods and great coffee Comfortable bed 
351048,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Charges for a Espresso coffee in the in the lobby area of Euro 4 70 while waiting the room is made up Small Garret type room what requires maintenance but had booked and was charged for standard double room , air condition
351049,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The location was great staff very friendly and helpful Lovely old building and rooms were comfortable and large with nice traditional furnishings Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice lots of different cheeses and meat fresh fruit salad and yoghurts bread and pastries We loved the area as just on the outskirts of the inner city so not too touristy or crowded 15 minute walk to museums and 20 minutes to the centre
351050,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Great location The staff were professional and personable The buffet breakfast was memorable A huge range of high quality food I left my reading glasses at the hotel and was immediately contacted There was no difficulty in arranging for the glasses to be returned to my home address in Australia We will stay there again 
351051,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Had a wonderful stay David at reception was so very helpful and friendly a great asset to the hotel We stayed in one of the privilege rooms which was very nice and comfortable Loved the coffee machine in the room which was spotlessly clean The hotel is on a small side street so is nice and quiet but it is within walking distance of everything Close to public transport also which we used to get to and from the airport The breakfast was great lots to choose from to set you up for the day Would definitely stay here again if we are back in this beautiful city 
351052,Mercure Josefshof Wien, the wi fi was intermittent there were no refreshments in the rooms facilities to make drinks except two complimentary bottles of water the buffet breakfast was very good but I thought that I had booked it as included I always do if that is an option When we came to breakfast and signed our rooms we were not advised that we would have to pay so when we checked out I was surprised by the additional cost of six breakfasts I could not explain this to the receptionist as my german was not good enough I do not know if this error was in terms of my communication with the hotel or bookings com the airport shuttle advertised on the website was more expensive than I had thought, The buffet breakfast was good The beds comfortable the bathrooms excellent Perfect location in safe area for visiting museums only 20 minute walk from central vienna the staff were polite and helpful they called us taxis and recommended a local restaurant
351053,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We had A double bed but there was separated mattress pads so there was a hole between mattresses which was irritating when having sex , Great breakfast quiet big and clean room with completely darkening curtains Good aircondition location near metrostops 
351054,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, We upgraded as we arrived early the room was very big and well laid out very tastefully The hotel w s very close to the musuem quarter which w s excellent
351055,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Having a bath instead of a shower recess is dangerous as it is easy to have and accident getting out of the bath Tea and coffee making facilities would also be appreciated, This is an excellent hotel 1 The key feature was the blockout external blinds which mad sleeping much easier 2 The basin in the bathroom passed the male test that is I could shave without getting water everywhere and not having to bend over and put my back and neck out of place early in the morning Very few hotels have this convenience
351056,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The hotel is on a one way street so if you miss it expect to take the circuit again Not much parking outside the hotel when its busy We did a nifty reversing move to get into the hotel parking garage a bit further back up the street Our sat nav really didn t like the tall buildings so we went around a couple of times till we figured where we were going and where the hotel parking was located , Great location short walk to Vienna Center and attractions Fabulous breakfast Really helpful staff Very good recommendations for best way to see Vienna in the time we had available 5 7 mins away from Hofburg Palace St Stephens Museums Town Hall Spanish Riding School etc 5 min walk to hop on hop off bus stop for easiest touring around of Vienna Out to Schonbrun Palace Belevedere Gallery for Klimt and the Jewish market and the Danube for a cruise Restaurant Trilogie greek on Lang Gasse very good food and service Busy lots of locals eating here Gastwirtschaft Blauensteiner Zur Stadt Paris on Lenaugasse again very good local food and service Very busy place lots of locals eating here Fabulous authentic regional food served simply There are a couple of small supermarkets near the hotel Be warned they close quite early 
351057,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Got stuck in the lift on the first night Better instructions for operating the lift needed , Nice clean pretty central hotel Comfortable beds Nice hot water Fantastic selection at breakfast Staff friendly Cannot fault the hotel Near to the Museum Quarter only a 30 minute walk to MariaHilfe Strasse where many shops are Pick up the hop on hop off bus tour at the Museum stop Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff 
351058,Mercure Josefshof Wien, 1 No parking this is really bad You almost feel like you have to put your car on your back and carry it with you wherever you go Hotel staff are unwilling to assist in finding a parking spot understandably but what s worse finding parking on nearby streets is an impossibility This ruins everything 2 Improve your breakfast menu Eggs are overcooked Choice of dishes very poor , Beds are excellent Nice building Good location Excellent greek restaurant around the corner I can recommend it for lamp chops Super 
351059,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Size of the room Extra large with kitchen etc and small study with desk Plenty of room for two people with luggage Breakfast room and food were both good Bed linen and towels were good 
351060,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Some reception staff very aloof no restaurant facility unusually expensive bar hotel garaging expensive only one room key card given so if one of you leaves the room with the card all power goes off including the lights , Very convenient location within short walking distance of City centre and public transport 
351061,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Nothing not to like Room was a bit small but we did not spend a lot of time there , The breakfast was awesome and it s was very close to the U bane Staff was helpful and friendly

351063,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Everything was nice , The staff was really nice They gave us great advice We went to Munich for a concert in Olympiapark so it was great cause we could walk to the concert and come back also walking There is a great bakery next to the hotel and the neighborhood is really calm 
351064,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Saw a fabulous concert with life performers doing Mozart went to the astounding Museum of science ate in may great places and eventually figured out the on off public transportation , The location was central the service and recommendations of the front desk staff great and the breakfasts fabulous 
351065,Mercure Josefshof Wien, 1 Unconfortable bed matrass was hollow 2 Coffee machine very noisy Breakfast was thus never a quiet start of the day 3 Because there were only 2 coffee machines a queue was continually present, The different kinf of bread at breakfast The pastries were also good 
351066,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Car parking is difficult and very expensive at 33 euros a day add this to 15 euros a day for our dog and the hotel no longer represents value for money Also bar prices are very high , Good location and helpful reception staff Breakfast was of a good standard 
351067,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The bathroom in the room was too small , The hotel is in a great location close to the historical centre The restaurant where breakfast was served was very nice though a little small and the breakfast was very good 
351068,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The wifi was a bit spotty and the tub layout made it hard to shower with out spraying water all over the entire bath room, The breakfast was amazing and the tub in our room was deep and excellent 
351069,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Wifi connection quite weak losing the net needs to be resumed thru password frequently, Good location 5 min to metro walking distance to MQ and other cultural places Freud cafe nearby
351070,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, All the staff are extremely helpful and polite They are able to direct you to wherever you want to go The breakfast has a very good selection and should suit nearly everyone s taste 
351071,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Coffee makers in all rooms would have been nice , Good quiet location Close to all main attractions Rooms were clean spacious and beds were very comfy 
351072,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Hotel is situated close to the metro station everything was very comfortable Personal was very kind and sensitive to our wishes Breakfast and room were really fascinating I also want to thank personal of the hotel for fast and professional help with our little problem with credit card 
351073,Mercure Josefshof Wien, There was something drastically wrong with the temperature ventilation of the room Very very hot and could not control it whatsoever Finally asked for a fan on the second night They dont really operate the airconditioner , Breakfast was good n specially reception staff named Maria who was very genuine and extremely helpful 
351074,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The parking is expensive even though it is very secure Throughout our trip we are finding the costs of parking vary a lot and this is one of the more expensive ones I can t say if the photos on the website are helpful because my criteria when choosing where to stay were a car parking and b breakfast included , The area was quite pleasant and once we got the hang of the transport system I felt it was well enough placed but that was not my immediate thought hence my rating The room was quiet and spacious and had a separate seating area with a desk handy for writing post cards and the daily diary The bed was comfortable and we slept well The bathroom was large and well stocked The breakfast room had a very good choice though I never did find the English Breakfast tea bags The receptionists were helpful and spoke enough English to order a taxi suggest restaurants etc 
351075,Mercure Josefshof Wien, All was fine , The breakfast selection was phenomenal and available till noon That is it was more like a brunch than just breakfast Hotel centrally located and front desk help very efficient in getting us tickets to the BIG Bus and a first rate Mozart concert in period costumes Vienna has so much to offer stay as long as you can 
351076,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Our room smaller than expected Tiny bar No coffee facilities in our room No ironing facilities in the room Pillows too soft Room very hot, Quietness Wi fi worked well and had in your room Some hotels only in the lobby
351077,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No hotel restaurant or leisure facilities this was disappointing , Spotlessly clean and modern rooms within an old building Friendly and helpful staff Close to Museums Quartier and all city centre amenities Located on a quiet side street with a lovely traditional Viennese and a modern Greek restaurant less than five minutes walk away and a choice of coffee houses nearby great 
351078,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We booked a self contained room with kitchenette for our dietary needs but the kitchen was very poorly fitted out Only one bowl no glasses unmatched cutlery no cooking utensils etc We asked for milk and tea bags from room service it did not come We asked for items at the desk and the girl laughed with others when we left very unsatifactory , We liked the beds we slept well
351079,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Upgrade to Mercury Privilege was a con an extra 80 and we were in a smaller room with the eaves We had to watch that we didn t bang our heads and we are not tall people Only provided coffee making machine no kettle for tea and no milk would have expected that automatically provided not needing to request having paid 20 a night extra , Breakfast excellent
351080,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Provision of drink making facilities would have been good, Very comfortable bed Good breakfast although no English Breakfast Tea although countless others 
351081,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Overall the hotel was too hot we turned the heating off in our room but it was still too hot The bar area was very limited difficult to get a drink as no one was there Also it would be nice if Tea Coffee facilities were in the room , The breakfast was very good self serve area did get a bit congested at busy times The bed was comfortable Nice bathroom 
351082,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No english tea and breakfast was very badly organised Two long rooms which you had to walk the length of to get a cup of coffee What was on offer was good apart from hot selection That was awful Not really as good as we had hoped , Very comfortable bed and excellent wi fi Location very good for all tourist destinations 
351083,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Upgraded to a suite for a little extra Had a small kitchen but no tea or coffee making kit 5 for a teabag nd hot water Bit steep , Good location Friendly staff 
351084,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The shower did not have an enclosure which caused the bathroom to get flooded every time you shower There were no restaurants cafes fast food chains nearby so dining was problematic , Very nice hotel staff were consistently friendly
351085,Mercure Josefshof Wien, 1 The hotel didn t provide the type of room I booked two privilege rooms 2 reported the matter to the front desk and no one contacted me back 3 the privilege room is very small and cannot fit two persons with their luggages the size is smaller than 200sqf 4 the quality of coffee capsules provided in the room is awful and not at all drinkable 5 no hangers to hang The towels in the bathroom 6 very small closet and not enough for a couple, The location is convenient
351086,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The WiFi was horrible for me this is a dealbreaker Parking across the street was a pain every time you had to ask the reception to open the gate Some staff didn t speak english well in a city like Vienna this is a minimum Also the breakfast is a bit expensive in my opinion , Very clean hotel nicely decorated the beds were pretty ok The bathroom was not too small as some other hotels 
351087,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The location was within walking distance of the old town The hotel and the room were kept exceptionally clean Though it has been thoroughly updated the hotel retains enough of its old world charm to give it a sense of uniqueness that other newly built hotels lack The staff were very friendly and helpful answering all our questions about the city The breakfast was outstanding I would definitely recommend Mercure Josephshof for your next trip to Vienna 
351088,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Good location about 10 min walk from Rathaus We had a superior room with Klimt glass doors to the bathroom and shower a small terrace and very comfortable bed Staff most helpful We did not try the breakfast went for full English breakfast to the cafe round the corner by the main road 
351089,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Th balcony sliding door wasn t locking I told the receptionist lady about it she told me someone would be there to fix it soon no one ever showed up The 22 day parking spot was so tight I would have never been able to park the car without help from a second person , Location was excellent a couple of blocks away from Austrian Parliament Building Super fast Internet very good breakfast 
351090,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Ironing board not eve on the floor but you have to walk downstairs WiFI is limited to 1 GB Rooms are a bit outdated with linoleum on the floor Breakfast is nothing to be bothered really , Location
351091,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, We were a group of six family members spending a long weekend to celebrate a special birthday and explore the city at the same time Our stay was made extra special by Maria who went out of her way to get us all together change of rooms etc Staff like Maria makes it really special as it is all about customer service so we were extremely happy about choosing the hotel for our stay All other staff on front desk were very good too I will highly recommend everything about the hotel to anyone who wish too book Also the breakfast was good too with a very good selection 
351092,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We received first a room under the roof which was very hot with windows that were only able to open when the room key was plugged in , The hotel let us change rooms to a cooler and nicer one after telling reception that the original room was too hot to stay in The first room was not up to our expectation which was smallish and utilities not that high standard We appreciated the change of the room and the very friendly service throughout our stay 
351093,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Paid for upgrade as told great views over city lovely balcony View was not as promised and balcony was not much more than a fire escape looking into hotel workings , Good location good rooms
351094,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Nothing, Upon request the hotel quickly supplied a kettle for the room for us to make tea as we don t drink coffee therefore did not require the coffee making machine Also the early breakfast available from 0700 was ideal to give us long days for sightseeing The reception staff were always very helpful 
351095,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Our top floor suite which we paid extra for had very noisy floorboards and almost no soundproofing to next door so could hear conversations and any movement from the adjoining bedroom sometimes very late , Service was excellent with helpful staff Breakfast was extensive with plenty of choice that was constantly replenished fresh and delicious 
351096,Mercure Josefshof Wien, New rooms are small for the money had to move to an old room that was below our category but was much bigger although toilet seat broken and sink faulty , Breakfast available until midday 
351097,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We couldn t regulate the temperature of the heating in the room It was toooo hot 20 degrees We asked twice to put the temperature down on 20 degrees but it stayed the same and we didn t insist anymore just opened the windows , Very comfortable and nice room We had a privilege room with a nice view over the city 
351098,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Double bed was 2 single mattresses and 2 single duvets room was in the attic with an electronic window that didn t work very well, Receptionists were very friendly on arrival room was a good size great location a short walk from both the old town and theatre district
351099,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Please put something in the bathroom to hang the clothes and the towels If you leave bathrobe and shoes bath in the wardrobe we can not see them Reception should inform us , Bed was confortable Nice room good breakfast 
351100,Mercure Josefshof Wien, From the lobby to the elevator is difficult to reach by people in a wheel chair I one day had to help a woman in a wheel chair to push and to reach the elevator The floor is not horizontal , The breakfast buffet was excellent Wide range of delicious choices Fruit juices delicious and the champagne was appreciated We liked the Klimt designs in the room and in the building very much 
351101,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We stayed at apartment room and the amount and quality of kitchen equipment there is extremely poor not mentioning the level of cleanliness , Staff was very very helpful and nice location is good small side street which is quiet thought close to the attractions and U Bahn station Comfortable bed 
351102,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Room on the attic with window in the roof felt closed in No coffee tea in the room No restaurant in the hotel and it felt cold and isolated , Accessible to the metro and therefore easy access to places of interest 
351103,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Very helpful and accommodating staff They did everything to make our visit memorable Thank you Comfortable and clean hotel Well located Interesting decor Good breakfast Well worth a visit 
351104,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Very nice hotel with cozy environment It s quite close to the museum area and just next to the metro station It s convenient to visit other sites especially the inner stadt The staff here is passionate and very friendly Lovely experience 
351105,Mercure Josefshof Wien, I was surprised not to be able to use the hotel s underground parking so it was uncomfortable picking the car up from another building yet nevertheless did not impact our stay We were very happy , The staff was extremely friendly and professional excellent location and rich and tasty breakfast Great Vienna experience overall 
351106,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, It was as expected after two hotels before during the trip not fulfilling the expectations we arrived to a place cozy and warm which values the rate of stars given Location is very convenient just 5 minutes walk from Townhall and less than ten minutes from Hofburg 
351107,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Two duvets for one king size bed is maybe the only disharmony with the groovy ambient , Interior design of the room and of the hall Loved the extra size shower Very good position Close to u bahn station Rathaus and city centre Clean and quiet hotel Recommended 
351108,Mercure Josefshof Wien, we thought the breakfast was quite expensive and would have preferred to be able to get an evening meal at the Hotel, bedroom was spacious and comfortable very clean 
351109,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Someone had faked our name on a breakfast bill and they tried to charge us for that as we were leaving Time was tight and the front desk said that they couldn t authorize taking it off the bill without the manager who wasn t there I was really upset as it was clearly not us as we would never have had breakfast without our children In the end we weren t charged for it on our credit card but they insisted on blocking the amount on my credit card until the manager did whatever he had to do It was just an unfortunate end to what had been a pleasant stay otherwise , We were warmly welcomed and the staff really was helpful in trying to help us locate a lost passport The beds were comfortable and had duvets The location was quite good once we found our way around 
351110,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The communal areas are a bit soul less and the breakfast whilst very good is expensive But you can always use the cafe at the tram stop Elise I think for breakfast and late night drinks We did , The location is good for transport links especially if you are a tram lover the number 2 stops two minutes away easy walk to the centre past the rathaus and as a bonus there is an excellent non smoking cafe opposite the tram stop We had a superior privilege room which was a strange shape with sloping roof even though we weren t on the top floor very bling gold decor I liked the Klimpt bathroom door but comfortable clean and with a good walk in shower The street above the hotel has a supermarket some nice niche shops and good restaurants at both ends 
351111,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The double bed with two matrasses assabled together beside that nothing to complain , Great location 24 7 reception Very frendly and helpful staff When I booked the hotel I asked to book a hairdresser I was very happy with the salon location and price value ratio Clean and comfortable rooms bathroom was big enough Good breakfast and it is till 12 which is very nice no rush in the morning the dining room was not crowded

351117,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Beds were uncomfortable but not the worse we slept in on our trip Rooms were a bit hot and stuffy , Convenience to transportation and city sights Staff Phillip very helpful Located within walking distance of two Christmas markets bank and cash machines restaurants and mini mart 
351118,Mercure Josefshof Wien, It will be very nice if you can put some English TV channels so that for guest coming from overseas they get something to watch on TV at night , The best thing that I like about this hotel is the helpful and friendly staff They helped us in every manner even helped us locate an Indian restaurant on Christmas day The location is gr8 the hotel is clean comfortable I think whenever I visit vienna again I will stay at Mercure Josefshof I highly recommend travellers to stay at this hotel 
351119,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Shower over a high sided bath No tea making facilities in room Very little comfort in bar area Reported shower screen leaking onto floor not resolved during our stay Reception staff a little abrupt on arrival , Breakfast was good with a variety of food on offer All hotel areas were clean and lovely and warm at this time of year Quiet hotel very good location for attractions and tube stations
351120,Mercure Josefshof Wien, 1GB data cap per room is nothing in 2016 Compared to other hotels staff we have visited during our trip I felt the least welcome here , The location was good but next time I will be ok to live further away if I can get a better hotel The central Vienna is very small compared to big cities and walkable 
351121,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The staff was a little disinterested At check in the guy seemed like we were bothering him and the bartender took 25 minutes to get two beers , The hotel had a great location with a short walk to the Rathaus and Rathaus U bahn stations The room itself had a strange floor plan but it had everything we needed 
351122,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The breakfast was 18 euros per person per day Very expensive We did not eat the breakfast , Beautiful room very comfortable stay Perfect location for markets and sight seeing

351125,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The service at the bar in the evening was a little variable sometimes ok sometimes not so ok , Room was comfortable liked the little sitting room opposite the bar 
351126,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Luckily they have available free space for parking the car in the garage Otherwise can be a problem to find the free place close to the hotel , Charming hotel in the city centre with helpful and friendly stuff The breakfast is very good with great selection of food 
351127,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The glass in the bathroom was not clean Used cups and glasses were not replaced I asked if it was possible to get a kettle and some tea and was told to wait until they came with a loaded tray which they handed to me and I had to juggle up to my room after a long day loaded with bags When the room above was occupied it was very noisy Very heavy footsteps creaky floorboards between midnight and 1 00am Then again at 7 00am At the end of my stay I asked if they would book a taxi for my early departure He said just turn up down here about 3 minutes before you want to leave The hotel itself is quite nice but from my experience of staying in many hotels around the world they would have to be some of the most complacent and disinterested reception staff I have ever encountered I am not a demanding person I am always courteous and respectful but it seemed like asking them for anything was an imposition , The room was clean And it is a 5 minute walk to Rathaus Christmas markets 
351128,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was too hot with an open window it was too noisy at night Breakfast for what was charged was a little simple , Great location easy access nice bathroom

351134,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The only downside to this hotel was the lack of tea coffee making facilities in the rooms , Ideally situated with friendly staff The rooms were spacious and clean and the beds very comfortable The breakfast had a good continental selection but no English Breakfast Tea Sorry but us Brits like our tea

351137,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Even though our stay was short with one night we could tell the hotel was well taken care of and clean The staff was excellent and took care of our needs upon checking in 
351138,Mercure Josefshof Wien, I got a king deluxe room which was 1 5 times the price of their normal room The room was extremely small Absolutely no place to walk etc Hardly 15 16 sqm In the add they said that it comes with a bath tub but when I went there they informed there is no bath tub in the room class Staff was horrible but that is expected in vienna , The room was clean and comfortable and the location was good 10 mins walk to the museums and palace

351143,Mercure Josefshof Wien, A little confusion on arrival as I didn t have the card I had already paid with if you pay by card make sure you have it with you when you go , Location was excellent very close to a U Bahn station and walkable to the centre of town but really quiet on a side street 
351144,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Nice hotel in a good location not that expensive compared to other hotels Metro is nearby only 5min walk maximum The room was really big For breakfast you could get everything you wanted good start of the day

351147,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The receptionist was not paying attention to us when we arrived He forgot to give a key to tge roim and when we parked the car in the garage another person was at the reception who wanted me to queue up again Wireless was slow as well , The rooms are standard clean and nice bed is good location was perfect for sightseeing 
351148,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The reception could pay attention to the guests For a spare key we needed to request 3 times ti the recepcionista who pretended to have not heard , The hotel looks like new 
351149,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The big bed is two single beds combined I like more one big bed with one big quilt but here two small quilts I think it is the habit of european , Nice decoration very good breakfast kind staff
351150,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No dining room in evening No mini bar even in privilege room Air con rubbish room too hot and stuffy Breakfast far too expensive Staff not interested in customers Not sure what privilege actually means , Location
351151,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The mid range rooms are expensive and probably missing the nice extra things that we got in a superior room such as bath products housecoats Our shower was lovely but in the mid level room it was a disaster , We were in a superior room Their top of the line We were upgraded after a disastrous encounter with a poorly installed shower in a lower level room I appreciated their responsiveness Breakfast excellent WiFi good in the new room Not great in the other room 
351152,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Toilet did not work properly door in toilet did not stay closed We asked to call taxi from lobby and got some very strange driver crazy woman almost got to accident only cash dirty car inside The hotel staff should check the services that they call , Location meeting rooms
351153,Mercure Josefshof Wien, WATCH OUT FOR EXTRA CHARGES location tax is not included in the price Queen size bed does not exist even though it is offered as option through Booking , Good location at a rather quiet street very friendly and accommodating staff at check in 
351154,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The bed was so comfortable and the stained glass beautiful in the bathroom wall It was a nice touch to have a good coffee machine in the room The hotel was beautiful and the staff friendly The train was also close by 
351155,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Shallow step into the dining area a trip hazard as my wife discovered , Very comfortable Very helpful staff Quiet 15 minute walk from city centre close to Rathaus 
351156,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We would have preferred a kettle in the room instead of the coffee machine as neither of us like coffee always carry our own tea bags , Lovely comfortable clean room Good breakfast 
351157,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The bar in the lobby is not well attended and breakfast is over priced , Location and comfort especially travelling with a small 4 month old We stayed in one of the privilege rooms which was so comfortable and a perfect size for all the extras e g buggy etc The hotel provided us with a kettle which was not standard in these rooms and also included a fridge Lovely spacious bathroom and shower All very modern decor and very comfy bedding including the cot all bedding was provided In addition the room was lovely and quiet 
351158,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The restaurant only serves breakfast with limited snacks available at the bar This was not a problem as there are a multitude of very good restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel , The reception and restaurant staff all spoke english and were always helpful and obliging they helped with suggestions of places to eat what to see and how to get there They made restaurant and taxi reservations for us and provided a printer service for our return trip boarding passes without charge 
351159,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Room was too small and wifi signal was so poor that we cannot connect We wanted to change the room Receptionist told us there is only rooms with higher price We refused to pay more After half an hour discussion they changed our room Hotel is relatively far from the center I don t recommend this hotel ,No Positive
351160,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Wi fi signal is very patchy in areas doesn t work inside the room Parking availability is limited , Good location and comfortable and clean rooms Great breakfast spread 
351161,Mercure Josefshof Wien, My wife says it needed a mirror in bedroom as she had keep going in bathroom to put on her makeup and her hair Also shower seems to have been put on wrong wall as when you turned it on water went all over floor, The cleanness of the Hotel was first class breakfast fanastic 7 00 am to 12 noon wanted for nothing Our room we had a suite plenty of room to move around plenty of hanging space All all round a very good Hotel 
351162,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Hot stuffy room with broken air conditioning Single beds when booked double room staff and manager totally inflexible and claimed I just didn t understand how hotels work in Austria , Free parking nearby
351163,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We were surprised to find no kettle or tea making items in the room The safe was not attached to the wall and could be slid out of the wardrobe shelf The shower was open apart from a glass panel and so the bathroom floor was wet after every shower There was no extendable clothes line in the bathroom so we had to improvise our own There was some minor damage to the wall and the bedside light which did not affect us , The room was clean modern and comfortable Staff were hospitable and helpfull Entrance was bright and inviting Within the confines of an old building the layout was neat and modern 
351164,Mercure Josefshof Wien, we had a mishap with our taxi booking during the last day of our stay We asked the hotel reception to book a taxi for us we needed a large one because of luggage When the taxi was late and we started to get nervous 15 minutes delay the reception staff was really unhelpful saying that taxi is coming as a result it came with a 20 minutes delay vs the original booking and actually the lady from the reception run after us stating that we need to wait for another taxi that she has booked for us while the first one was late It was frustrating No apologies were offered to us and our questions about the taxi seemed to be burdensome for the reception ,No Positive
351165,Mercure Josefshof Wien, All rolled in glitter TBH Hospital style decor A corner BATH with a shower that didnt have enough power to get water OVER the corner to your body A weird empty room that could have been better utilised as a toilet , Good location Roof room had an OK view Staff OK for Vienna usually stern rude and arrogant staff in Vienna in my experience 
351166,Mercure Josefshof Wien, for a 4 stars hotel there should be a porter service Internet service wi fi was very difficult to sign in and to access except only 1 front desk clerk Lopez knew how to help us access the wi fi it was user unfriendly Also the one 1 nite guaranty leave us in limbo for refund when we paid cash for our entire stay How long will it take for refund to my credit card , all ok croissant not over flaky Bed ok it was all acceptable More towels would be better also a recommendation a small shelve in the shower and a hand grip bar Hooks to hang our bath towel etc Helene Wiederkehr our stay was 21 25August VIENNA 
351167,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Breakfast was a bit pricey but 100 yards around the corner is a lovely Viennese cafe that served as a perfect alternative , Very good staff modern room excellent location close to sights and underground yet very quiet 
351168,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was of a decent size but the bathroom was tiny There was a strong smell of dampness in the room we told the staff about it as soon as we got into the room and they offered to place a call for the cleaners to apply some sort of products to get rid of it The smell did not go away so we had to keep the window opened in as much as possible The issue was not correctly addressed by the hotel staff who otherwise were polite , Excellent location 5min walk from the Townhall square 10 15min to the Hofburg or the museums Also a short distance from the Museums Quartier which is an area full of nice bars and restaurants 
351169,Mercure Josefshof Wien, There were issues with the internet connection I couldn t use at the last day of my stay because the Hotel didn t have any connection at all Breakfast was very expensive You re better off going somewhere else for breakfast , I loved the location as it very near the subway station and very easy to find The room was very clean and comfortable Breakfast was amazing though very pricey 
351170,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Parking was a bit expensive and the bar was way too small You can park down the road for 6 euros a day We used the park and ride on the U3 at Kendalstrasse which was easy and probably much less of a struggle than trying to get into the city centre , Nice rooms good location Very peaceful 
351171,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No hot water in room No USB port in room No adapters available in hotel No bidet in bathroom No proper guidance by staff with nearby restaurants Didn t book my taxi Had no idea to the cost of taxi to airport One said 33 The other 38 Ther other 45 Another 60 euros All front office staff It was actually 36 euros , Not a lot Staff need training Too many mistakes 
351172,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No kettle in room for making tea , Upgraded on arrival to very quiet room on fourth floor with comfortable bed Good choice for breakfast and enjoyed sitting in garden terrace
351173,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice Our room looked out onto an atrium and as it was hot we had the windows open rather than use the air conditioning however there was some noise coming from the atrium with people laughing and talking I m not sure if this was guests or hotel staff however as the majority of rooms look out onto it it really should be closed at night That said the noise had stopped by midnight it , Clean and comfortable hotel not too far from the old town and just round the corner from a Metro station We had a room in the loft which had these great Velux windows one of which opened up to form a mini balcony 
351174,Mercure Josefshof Wien, I just can t understand in this day and age in a city hotel how they could have such a poor wifi service Remove the poor web based login process you can have a secure service without it this will stop the repetitive login process Increase the speeds Finally we booked a double room the receptionist confirmed this when we checked in We received two single beds pushed together with individual single sheets and duvet , The hotel was simple but a beautiful old building fitting for the location The members of staff were excellent and a helping hand to every need and were available at all hours 
351175,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The place looked sterile Just like a clinic waiting room Staff were so impersonal as if they didn t care whether we were there or not Previous customers hairs in the shower 
351176,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was not as clean as it could have been Didn t stay in the hotel only one of the hotels apartments whilst this was an upgrade I would have preferred to have stayed in the hotel with modern facilities The apartment was set in an old apartment block which can only be accessed via the car park entrance, We were upgraded to an apartment which was in another building with facilities to cook and a fridge but no iron The room could have been cleaned better as the cutlery had stains as did some of the furniture which had coffee stains 
351177,Mercure Josefshof Wien, A shared spa facility would be nice but not really a big deal P, We booked one of the premium rooms and it was very lovely The breakfast was absolutely amazing pretty much anything you could expect to have for breakfast was there 
351178,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Air conditioning not brilliant Didn t have breakfast as it was 20 euro each There is a lovely bakery nearby where we got breakfast and ate in the beautiful park , Very good location easy for public transport Nice large room 
351179,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Need fluffier towels No tea in the room Add selections to room service offerings , Bed was comfy Location was ideal Staff had excellent customer service especially Cristian 
351180,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We couldn t watch a movie on our iPad as the Internet in the hotel only allows you to watch 10 minutes and then you re timed out of the Internet for hours All the channels were in German except for Sky news therefore we couldn t chill out in the room for a few hours watching the tv after a long day of sight seeing We asked the concierge where is a nice area for restaurants and bars and she recommended a specific street Myself and my boyfriend travelled to this street only to find a shopping district with MacDonalds and Turkish kebabs We then ended up walking for a long time trying to find a decent restaurant We also wanted a tour of a vineyard which can be found just outside of the city and the concierge advised us how to go about this It took us over an hour to get there and only to find that no one can just walk in and get a tour as they have to be apart of a group We weren t told this and feel that the hotel should have known this fact It wasted our time , Air conditioning was very good and duvet and pillows were nice Free sparkling water everyday Good location too however next time I would like to be more in the centre of things 
351181,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Our room air conditioning not so great kids room worked v well so we saw the difference but would come again no problem, Quiet clean really convenient for sight seeing great base
351182,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The location was great staff was very helpful The room was really amazing in the style of Art nouveau Klimt We had an amazing stay even if it was for only one night I definitely recommend this hotel to everyone considering a stay in Vienna 
351183,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We had a room with a shower cubicle that opened into the bedroom The bathroom was separate it was a bit weird No tea coffee making facilities in the room and the bar price for same was quite high , The staff were very friendly and helpful It was in a good location near the Rathaus Metro stop and easy walking distance into town 
351184,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The room was a bit small and strangely had nothing to eat or drink in its fridge unlike most hotels The excellent wines could only be had at the small bar in the lobby or by room service The facilities for receiving and sending e mails are frankly inadequate by today s standards , Very generous hours for breakfast and excellent choice The fruit the variety of cheeses and the wonderful black seeded bread I would single out 
351185,Mercure Josefshof Wien, In summer the air conditioning is not sufficiently strong to cool down the rooms on 6th Floor The reception with 2 people clearly understaffed WLAN very often very slow and not stable on 6th floor Cleaning of the room either very early in the morning or late in the afternoon only Waterpressure in the bath rooms implies that Vienna has a water shortage, Location to city and to public transportation Good breakfast buffet
351186,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Good Mercure comfort nice sleeping good breakfast Sophisticated location just in a real Vienna quartier with fully local ambience and restaurants Marienhof Rosnovskyundco in a quiet small street absolutely isolated from the crowd and within a shortest 5 10 min walking distance to many key tourist points Hofburg Maria Theresia place Art Museum St Stephan Cathedral old town etc 
351187,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The access to the hotel is not easy with luggage arriving by Metro or tram , Got upgraded to a superior room on arrival beautiful and spacious room facilities and bathroom outstanding Staff was very friendly and efficient Fantastic hotel for a city break 
351188,Mercure Josefshof Wien, TV did not have much of a selection of english channels , Beds and linen are of good quality Breakfasts are great good variety Croissants are fresh every morning 
351189,Mercure Josefshof Wien, I put 10 points So nothing here , Thanks to the staff for a hint about cheepest longterm parking 6 e a day in very Vienna center 5 min walk from hotel is rediculously cheep Ask for appartments in second floor with walk out to the roof terrace 
351190,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Asked for a taxi in the airport Receptionist ordered one with a fixed price of 38 euro As a result mobb looking driver in an old Mercedes smoker and 45 euro Should have just taken it off the street , Nice breakfast with outside terrace 
351191,Mercure Josefshof Wien, This hotel give me an impression that they are very desperate They promoted to us every chance from the moment we check in until check out First they ask if we would like to up grade our room for 20 a night When we ask for slippers in the room we were reminded that our standard room don t come with facilities like slippers and toiletories and speaking of standard 4 star hotel room there is no kettle when we ask if standard room comes with kettles they just said they will give them when they ask for it make me think if this hotel don t have enough kettles to go around And when we want to claim for our 2 hours late check out from the genius they ask if we want to extend it to 3 hrs for 36 it s just annoying that they don t forget to promote their extra pay service in every conversation you have with them when we didn t even ask for it Have to say though the staff are quite prolite despite of the annoying promotion tactics we did pay extra for the breakfast it was standard but we did enjoy it about the room it s quite dated you can smell the carpet as soon as you walk in toilet seat fell off the first time i used it coz it s a clip on toilet seat and it wasn t clip on properly Overall I would say standard rooms in this hotel is a 3 star and if you upgrade you may get 4 star facility which we never know because we never upgraded , Close to metro station staff are quite polite despite of the annoying promotion tactics 
351192,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Unfriendly lady at reception Also I asked for a large double bed at the booking but got an annoying twin bed instead , Friendly guy on night duty Location is good 
351193,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The drawback was the Wifi Most of the time it wasn t working in the room , The Hotel was at a very convenient location The breakfast was very good 
351194,Mercure Josefshof Wien, No choice in The mini bar Only water, Check in easy and friendly A big room well furnished and elegant A big bath in the bathroom AIR conditioning and TV Staff very polite Breakfast tasty and abundant Position very confortable
351195,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Wi Fi was slow and not good for a business traveller , Easy to get the Wien Mass conference centre in Prater The main sites in town were quite close within walking distance The area felt safe Billa Spar supermarkets just around the corner Staff very friendly most notably the receptionist
351196,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Warm water supply didn t work House maid came knocked several times in the early Morning despite don t disturb sign, Interesting modern style privilege rooms
351197,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Nothing it was all great , The bed was excellent and the room was really really nice Spacious and cool airco and I loved the coffee and tea facilities as well as having a bathrobe and complimenatry water waiting for me in the room Vienna is fantastic and the hotel has a perfect location the walk to the old town only takes you 10 minutes 
351198,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, The hotel is situated in a great location so central and surrounded by beautiful buildings lovely restaurants and cafes Beautiful interior and very cosy Lovely and very helpful staff Great place 
351199,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The facilities they provide and charge not matching They are hugely over charging There are nearby reasonable hotel s available , Staff were helpful Hotel in city centre 
351200,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Shower when water was turned on the water spilled onto the tile floor making it very slippery This was due to the shower tub enclosure not being secured properly , Cleanliness helpful staff and in easily accessible location 
351201,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We were told on check in that breakfast was included to be retold at breakfast that it wasn t and we had to pay This was questioned at check in by us but staff re assured us it was included Then at check out we were told we had to pay room tax I produced invoice from booking com to show we had paid this and due to their misinformation on breakfast we only had to pay 36 euros Also Fridge in room didn t work Won t go back as the staff was very rude , Rooms were clean and comfy and quiet Breakfast had a great selection Easy walk or cab to city centre 
351202,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The double bed which was no matrimonial bed but 2 matresses on the same bed frame For a 4 star hotel we expected to have a coffee machine in the room There was none The room was quite small One elevator did not work on the first day we took the stairs with the luggagge up to the 5th floor , the hotel is very close to city center round 5 minutes from metro station and is also walking distance from Rathaus Rathausplatz Parliament We liked a lot the fact that although very central the hotel is located on a side lateral street so it is very quiet no noise from the main boulevard gets to the room They also have English TV channels 
351203,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Mattress not very comfortable seemed too worn down no comfortable chair in the room no enclosure for the shower , Room felt fresh High quality breakfast great bed linen all equipment worked well Water bottles provided daily 
351204,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The kitchenette despite having a boiler and cups did not offer even a single bag of tea Unused The breakfast was okay but definitely not worth 18 , I was upgraded to an apartment with kitchenette for free 
351205,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Reception staff were hot and cold Some matters missed I asked for a wake up call but none came and I was accused of not returning a borrowed umbrella , Rooms comfortable spotlessly clean Breakfast was very good too although a little pricey 
351206,Mercure Josefshof Wien, We were surprised that with the numerous amenities in the room that there weren t any face cloths amoung the towels Also the curtains should extend from wall to wall to have no daylight coming into the room if you want to rest in the day , We were very pleased with the quiet location the room was comfortable and the shower was amazing It is well worth it to book in the Privilege section of the hotel 
351207,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Rooms are with different quality, Receptionist Philipp was very helpful and gave very good recomendations for dining places etc Breakfast was very good and also location 
351208,Mercure Josefshof Wien, About the facilities the Hotel mentions in its description that they have parking spaces for customers with cost of 22 per day this info was critical for our decision when choosing the Hotel but the spaces are really very few and are used mainly by the hotel s fleet When we asked for a place to park our car the staff did not care they just gave us some options of public parking around the Hotel very expensive Also when we did check out the staff told us that we should have reserved the parking but the Reservation web page says Private parking available Reservation is not possible , Very clean and comfortable rooms Great food quality at breakfast 
351209,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The wifi did not work well It s was very slow and most of the time there was no connection When there was a weak signal the pages too so long to load The room was very hot at night , Great location on a quiet street near Rathaus station Nice shower facilities and good breakfast 
351210,Mercure Josefshof Wien, no available parking place at the hotel expensive parking nearby 4 5 EUR hour small room, renovated clean room good location very good breakfast
351211,Mercure Josefshof Wien, My room was very dirty Dust and socks of other guests under my bed Staff not very friendly , I suggest this hotel only for position near underground Breakfast ok 
351212,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The air conditioning was not working because they still consider the time to be winter but it was already warm weather and so at night it was very hot Also the menu for room service has only pizzas or baguettes no other options like salads or even desserts Also we left the room service dishes the night before and when we came back the day after they were still in the room even after cleaning was supposed to be done , The location is very good just a few minutes away from the main attractions The staff is very helpful available and they all speak many languages 
351213,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The standard room was very small Just enough space to go around the bed Ambiance of the room was poor It was a standard room in every sense We stayed for 4 nights and the cleaning the next day depended very much on the person who did it Some days questionnable not enough towels or wet towels not changed etc other days excellent I was left with a feeling that the stay was not worth the money , Location was great we could walk anywhere we wanted to go And windows had automatic blind curtains meaning the attic room was cool and dark enough 
351214,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The bathroom is rather small as well as room but worked out fine for short term stay , Ok breakfast good location quiet area and yet close to Museum Graben 
351215,Mercure Josefshof Wien,No Negative, Extremely friendly and professional staff Very well situated in the city centre Very clean and tidy Breakfast is excellent I will definitely book again at the same hotel 
351216,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Breakfast too expensive 18 Euro person , Good location walking distance to Rathaus Stephan s Dom Clean warm quiet room with renovated bathroom comfortable bed and nice furniture Parking in 2 locations one under the hotel the other very close on the same street for 22 Euro day 
351217,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Staff could have been more personable but were helpful when called upon Was expensive in comparison to facilities however to be fair we did stay over the New Year period when tariffs can be higher Main Restaurant was Closed over this period however smaller restaurant was available , Quite comfortable Rooms a little dated but clean and everything worked Our rooms were spacious Bathrooms have been updated and were very well presented 
351218,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Reception staff not helpful at all Have very little knowledge about touristic info and tours Bathroom windows need curtains You can see people inside bathroom from outside Terrible wifi Housekeeping didn t change towels , Nice Quiet area A little far from city center Amazing breakfast 
351219,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The see through sliding glass door separating the bathroom from the bedroom and about four feet from your pillow would be a deal breaker for any future trip Besides lack of privacy when light is turned on at night time the entire bedroom is lit up and is a nuisance to the person sleeping , Breakfast was great Bed was comfortable although the bedroom was tight Bathroom was modern with excellent shower Staff was attentive 
351220,Mercure Josefshof Wien, Central heater in room is too warm Have to sleep with open window but too noisy to sleep good , Friendly and helpful staff Spacious room which is excellent when we have our dog with us 
351221,Mercure Josefshof Wien, what I didn t like is that I got an email from Booking that there is an offer of an extra 85 Euros if I upgrade to a more modern room the hotel offered me the upgrade at 150 Euros then deducted to 100 also we paid tax of around 20 19 Euros its not the amount it is more the concept, the location was great the staff were very helpful room was warm 
351222,Mercure Josefshof Wien, The staff didn t warn us about the tourist tax , Nice warm apartment clean good location of the hotel close to the centre of the town The breakfast is served until 12pm which is very good
