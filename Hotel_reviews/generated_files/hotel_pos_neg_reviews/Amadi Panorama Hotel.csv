346719,Amadi Panorama Hotel, It s a bit far from the Town Center where much of the tourist activities and restaurants are located However the transportation system makes it easy to make your way over there , It s very new modern and accommodating with excellent facilities 
346720,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Our room had a door with a malfunction it smelled really nasty and moisty We saw this the day before we left due to heavy rain Very unfortunate but the place overall was great , Cozy Clean Insanely good view
346721,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The bed is really soft I you like a firm matras this is not the place to stay The touch screen to let the cleaner know whether you want them to come in or not is very bright during the night , Close to public transport and some shops Nice looking rooms and views 
346722,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The staff were all extremely courteous and friendly and couldn t do enough for us Very professional The breakfast was exceptional best selection and range of any we had encountered on our 6 weeks travelling throughout Europe The facilities in our room where also exceptional including the comfy beds large bathroom and a range of coffees etc well stocked minibar Easy tram access to city centre Would recommend this hotel to everyone 
346723,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I did not like the spiders This is the 8th hotel I stay in so far this year and the total amount of spiders encountered in the other rooms was 2 one in Croatia at a week long stay and one in Arnhem The Netherlands at a 2 day long stay The total amount of encountered spiders in the Amadi hotel for this one night stay was 7 only counting those we came across wandering about inside It is unpleasant to walk into spider webs indoors in your hotel room When I went to the bathroom during the night I also encountered some other bugs scattering around by the toilet which may explain why the spiders were so thrifty Also we brought our own bath salts and we were seriously looking forward to enjoy a nice warm bath in the tempting and fancy tub Obstacle one Several curly hairs in the bathtub not very inviting led to a session of heavy tub scrubbing before even attempting to fill the tub Obstacle two The water never got warm I endured a few minutes in the water anyhow as I had already poured my expensive bath salts in and didn t want them to get entirely wasted but the warmest water we got was actually not warm so the bath wasn t in any way relaxing Tried warming up in the shower afterwards but it never got properly warm either , I liked the view although I would have preferred a more central location also with a view I liked the style of the room I liked that the room had a bathtub We got a corner room so we had view to 2 directions
346724,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Was difficult to find the entrance Took a while to get in but eventually found it The hotel is a bit of a maze so you may get lose in the hallways , Modern hotel Breakfast was good Staff friendly Rooms bright Nice views over canals 
346725,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Extremely courteous and friendly staff although this hotel is about 6km from centre of Amsterdam public travel is virtually outside the hotel and is very easy to understand
346726,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I did not like that I had to take 2 different elevators to get to my room and I also didn t like the narrow hallways The staff at the frontdesk was not quick to serve us Another thing was the rugs in the room they should have been cleaned with a carpetcleaner , I like the room it was well planned tidy and I liked the view The bathroom was really nice 
346727,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The shower doesn t have doors and water gets all over the place Also the bed was not comfortable It was two beds pushed together and my husband and I kept sinking inbetween Also getting to the rooms is like a maze and they don t have their own parking , The rooms were simplistic and we had a good view of the river 
346728,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Filthy carpet water damaged furniture ripped dirty wallpaper Paper thin walls you will hear everything from the neighboring rooms Might as well have stayed in a hostel dorm , Price because of a reasonable deal on booking com 
346729,Amadi Panorama Hotel, it s temporary but there s a construction work right next to the hotel so it might cause some discomfort for people who has a light sleep if you plan to sleep until late morning hours which didn t disturbed me at all , Everything was great Yes this hotel is not directly in the Touristic city center but it s only about 15 minutes away from Centraal Station via Tram also the tram stop is about 2 minutes away from hotel by walking Since hotel rooms are on the upper floors of the building the view is amazing and neighborhood is very quiet at nights so hotel has a very good value comparing with prices 
346730,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The staff was outstanding the first time we arrive early and they made all they could to have our room ready The room was beautiful the view was amazing We were coming back a week later to departure and had no hotel reservatuon yet they took care of us and we came back Next time we are in Amsterdam we are coming back to this hotel 
346731,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The room carpet is off white in color and it looks dirty The shower with no door, Healthy breakfast organic butter jam and honey Good view from the room and the breakfast restaurant Friendly and helpful staff
346732,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The TV channels was not working they just made a report in the night and could not offer a better room for us The breakfast was not worth even 5 euro it was wasting of money The hotel entrence is very strange and difficult to find , The bed was comfortable temparature of the room was good minibar was complimentary the view was great with open french balcony 
346733,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No option for diner but good restaurants in neighourhood, Parking in the neighbourhood streets is free from 19 00 09 00 hrs else 2 40 p hr Facility for electric charge cars Free mini bar drinks Nice view over the Amsterdam area
346734,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The bathroom was different Only frosted glass walls separated the bathroom from the room itself No shower door meant that a shower resulted in water spraying onto the bathroom floor , Very convenient location to cruise terminal especially if you would prefer to be out of the congestion and noise of downtown Amsterdam Only 15 minutes by tram to Central Station An unusual hotel as the top 3 floors of a mixed use building but views were fantastic We enjoyed seeing a contemporary urban neighborhood with local sidewalk restaurants waterfront walkways and new residential complexes 
346735,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I little overpriced considering you still have to travel to the city centre Breakfast was lovely but a bit too expensive , Spacious room beautiful view of the water friendly staff and comfortable bed 
346736,Amadi Panorama Hotel, There was no restaurant for lunch or dinner but we were aware before we booked That s its only downfall but to be honest you don t really need an onsite restaurant there are plenty about, The staff were extremely friendly from day of booking Very helpful with directions and information on Amsterdam The price was fantastic bed lovely and comfortable and very clean 
346737,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Going up first with elevator 1 and then down again with elevator 2 Aircon could not completely cool theroom , Very pleasant high ceilings in the room great views free minibar with two beers 
346738,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Breakfast buffet price was quite high at 14 per head , Location from the nearest Tram stop Fantastic experience with the staff and most of them speak English Room was clean and the balcony view towards the river side was amazing Wifi was fast enough Though we had not heard the brand of the hotel we were pleasantly surprised by the quality maintained
346739,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The bathroom was quite small for my room I banged my elbows a couple of times with the glass partition of the shower , Good public transport connection to the city Centraal Tram no 26 Vennepluimstraat takes around 15 minutes to reach The room had a very good view The staff was kind enough to take my request and have my room ready though I reached very early in the morning Unlimited coffee and water from the reception area were for available at no charge One bottle of water coke and beer in the room were also complimentary along with the option to make your own tea and coffee in the room itself 
346740,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The A C in the room was not cooling well although it did not affect the stay, The property was close to public transport and the room was very nice with a view
346741,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I have no idea how this is rated as a 4 star hotel it is definitely the worst hotel I have ever stayed in The hotel and rooms were infested with hundreds of insects and there were dead bug carcasses all over the floor of our room see photo The carpet and bed linens were foul with bad smelling stains on them when we arrived see photos Housekeeping does the bare minimum our sheets were stained carpet was filthy and we didn t even have enough towels We had such a horrible experience that we complained to the hotel manager every day we asked for one night 279 to be refunded and they were too cheap to even do that for us The hotel is in a sketchy apartment building where the hotel rents a few floors so expect a strange and somewhat unsafe entrance which of course is bug infested also The hotel is 30 minutes from the city at least so for the very undeservedly high price you pay to stay here you should definitely stay at another hotel with a much better location In summary avoid this hotel at all costs , The staff was very nice and apologetic in dealing with our numerous complaints and all of the filth and problems with our room unfortunately they are not empowered to do anything for guests as the owner remains in total control 
346742,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, nice sized room with lovely views A little difficult to get into the hotel at first they couldn t answer the buzzer at the door Tram very handy for cruise terminal
346743,Amadi Panorama Hotel, entry to the hotel its only a part of the commercial building and the entry to the hotel is quite complicated Even the doorbell at the hotel entry was not working properly in such situation you may stay waiting in front of the building, simple but practical room fast and reliable internet
346744,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Perfect room with good price compared to other hotels in Amsterdam and the staff here is very helpful friendly there is a huge bathtub in our room good rest for us 
346745,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No parking facilities for bringing luggage into hotel Bedroom carpet had visible stains My bed sheet had a tear at the bottom and should not have been used in a 4 star hotel , Beds were comfortable 
346746,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Smell in the corridors 6th floor narrow labyrinth No laundry bag available in the room , Staff Location great View free minibar excellent breakfast Review based on 130 E night 
346747,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The morning breakfast was expensive 14 , The room was clean and had a nice view of the harbor The hotel is located on the tram 26 line and easy to reach from Amsterdam Central Station in about 19min
346748,Amadi Panorama Hotel, There is no door or screen in the shower box It is easy to splash the water Room is small pricey a little bit , Overall This is the middle atmosphere of hostel and hotel I mean in a good way Although room is small very clean cozy bright Bed is comfortable Room has a good view Check the view there are three kind of view There are free drinking as water and coke in the room Also you can enjoy the coffee and tea in the robby even early in the morning and evening I really like it Staff so kind and helpful Location is not bad If you take a tram you can get center in 10 minutes you can buy the ticket in the reception There is good tai restaurant around hotel I would recommend 
346749,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Excelent hotel Nice view Good breakfast Very clean and modern Mini bar included Perfect If you visit Amsterdam with a car near the highway only 5 euros per day for parking tram station by the hotel and only 10 min drive to Centraal Station But still as whole Netherlands a bit expensive but everywhere else is Amsterdam is even more expensive and without breakfast and mini bar 
346750,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Nothing really , Surprisingly good We were not expecting much of the hotel when we saw it was a tall building in the edge of a residential area The hotel has three floors the top floors of the building Room was very big and offered some drinks in the minibar At recepetion you could have tea coffee and water for free any time Breakfast was very nice all you can ask for I totally recommend you have breakfast here because of the quality and secondly in the area there is not much around Tram into centre of Amsterdam is direct and takes around 20 min That is brilliant 
346751,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Arrived late to the property and there was no restaurant at the hotel or in the local area , Easy access to Amsterdam Central station via the metro Really nice breakfast offering served and there was a Nespresso machine in the room 
346752,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Because the reception is in the top of the building we needed to go the top and then come down to enter the room , Great view over the Ij Easy and reliable way to reach Amsterdam Centraal by tram near the hotel 
346753,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We arrived at about 03 30 pm but reception could not checked us in as the room was not ready So we had to wait for about an hour , Room was spacious and got a nice view You easily go to Amsterdam Central through tram 15 mins 
346754,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Hotel s corridors were like labyrints Beds were not good , View was amazing and room was clean Staff were friendly and professional Neighborhood was peaceful Breakfast was great with all the local organic food 
346755,Amadi Panorama Hotel, There wasn t anything I could complain about , The staff were very friendly and pointed out to us on a city map the main attractions good restaurants
346756,Amadi Panorama Hotel, This hotel partitioned the top two levels into a hotel the other six levels belong to local residents The wall is not sound proof at all one night we hear clearly the snoring from the Neighbour not to mention the door opening closing by the Neighbours We requested an extra bed for my son via booking com but we have to pay extra 35 Euro per night this is the first time we face such situation very strange Then we moved to the room and there is no extra bed so we had to sleep on the same bed with my son in a larger room and we received 70 Euro discount but both my wife and myself did not manage to sleep at all for the first night as my son keeped on kicking us and this particular room is not sound proof at all as if we sleep on the road we hear clearly the car noise for the whole night After we moved to our superior room with an extra bed very small considering what we paid it seems that this is Amsterdam phenomenon we could sleep but I always need my earplug against the random noise from outside In general Amsterdam is a very nice and attractive city among all EU cities the locals are very friendly people many high quality museums services of sightseeing are also very high quality excellent food all kinds it no doubt offers the best Chinese food in Europe as well while What I missed the most is the chicken salad in the Maritime Museum restaurant But somehow we were not so lucky that the receptionist who was our very first contact in Amsterdam gave us an impression that to stay six night in Amsterdam would be too long as Amsterdam and Holland are so small that there is not much to see this is very strange plus the sleepless fiat night we were really in doubt about our dicision afterwards but the overall experience in Amsterdam was pretty good we would pay more attention to find a more suitable hotel if we come back again , Clean
346757,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No space to stop your car to off the luggage You have to stop on the street any way roads are not that much busy Staffs should be more aware of holidays free parking and near by attractions There would be some confusion when you enter in to the hotel from ground floor because the reception is in the 8th floor It would be better to ask the receptionist to show your room , Room is spacious neat modern amenities and clean break fast is good There are some supermarkets and shops next to the hotel There is a tram line in front of the hotel but I am not sure about the nearest stop View from the balcony is very good so many public parking spots around the hotel Airport is only 20 min drive from there 
346758,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Several situations went wrong Firstly I had checked an extra bed and when I checked in they said that there was no extra bed available Only at the end of the night they were able to solve the problem The hotel double charged the same room on my credit card then they could not return the excess amount I spent the two days trying to solve all these issues Despite the mistakes the hotel staff always tried to resolve the issues and on the last day everything was right having the Hotel offered the extra bed value as compensation for the problems that were created , Hotel with good facilities and access to the city center through TRAM are about 15 minutes parking is very close to the hotel and has a cost of 5 day which is very competitive for parking in cities the hotel offers drinks And coffees with no additional cost The staff was attentive and tried to solve the situations 
346759,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The Hotel is almost new but the room does not look like a new one I mean the general maintenance e g dirty and damaged chairs dirty lamp dirty sofa at the lobby We were negatively impressed about the cleaning Truly believe that hoover has not been used in the 4 days we spent there There s not restaurant at the hotel even if on the elevator there s sign declaring the opposite I expected a lot more from 4 stars HOTEL , Very good position and good breakfast Staff reception and breakfast kind and professional 
346760,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The cleanliness of the white carpets wasn t the best There were stains and we found a few potato chips on the floor , Even though this property was further from downtown it was easily accessible with public transportation Most of the room was modern and comfortable We also had a nice view because the hotel is on the upper floors of the building 
346761,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Should have dining restaurant option Some lights were not working Should have heating in bathroom floor Water was spreading in bathroom while taking bath in shower due to lack of curtain in shower The bed was king size but not in one size It was made of two different beds which was little uncomfortable , Breakfast was excellent with good options The staff was super great to help with everything Very friendly staff would rate 10 out of 10 to staff including housekeeping Bathtub with jacuzzi was good addition to stay 
346762,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Great area with some lovely restaurants A little outside of the centre but very easy journey in 10 min on tram very frequent Lovely to stay in more of a residential area quiet and relaxed 
346763,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The cost of the room was nearly 1000 euro for 3 nights which was a shock to get when I checked in Completely overpriced Also we were asked every morning what age the children were in case we were not going to pay the proper price for breakfast , Hotel is a good location close to Tram line easy to access We were a family with 2 children and it was well away from the red light district Breakfast was good Nice views from room also 
346764,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Although its new needs a paint on the walls rooms are nice but just the necessary space no comodities there is a Nespresso machine but no coffee nothing interesting around the hotel dead city in the night restaurant was not working we had to order from the turkish guy in the conrner , the last 2 floors of a tall building turned in a basic low budget hotel pretty new furniture quite clean not exactly a hotel to spend time here a place to sleep and go nice view tram stops in front of the hotel and goes into the city centre in 15 minutes free coffee and tea good internet connection friendly people at the reception if you get nice price book it with no fears
346765,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We took a superior Room Covered in stains No hot water for duration of stay Was asked to shower in house keeping shower if I needed hot water Beds topped with terrible coverings Staff had big smiles but no solutions Still waiting to hear back from a manager about hot water issue but I won t hold my breath And our friends car was broken into outside hotel along with 5 others in the week according to police Again Hotel oblivious to smashed car windows outside hotel for a week Even we saw them Would I stay again No Would I recommend No , Great view 
346766,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Car window was smashed in on the first night of arrival Same happened to two other cars and the weekend before Wish the reception staff had advised us to park underground on the first night rather then on the street Would have saved us a lot of money on replacing the window Coffee stains on walls and carpets of hotel room , Beds very comfy Overall nice hotel 
346767,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I booked a room with a bathtub but on arrival there was only a shower I asked to upgrade to a room with a tub but they were all booked Other than that the staff was very friendly and helpful Shops are just around the corner ,No Positive
346768,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The location was great and so easy to get in to Amsterdam centre can t go wrong tram 26 about 15 mins the tram does a loop so can t get lost Nice little bagle cafe nearby loved the 2 bottles of free beer in the mini each day if you drank then lovely waters view from hotel 
346769,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No issues at all excellent hotel , Lovely hotel very easy to get to by tram Close to very nice bakery cafe supermarket etc Free tea and coffee and little mini bar Great rooms really clean and comfortable 
346770,Amadi Panorama Hotel, When I arrived the door bell to get in the building the reception in the 8 th floor didn t work I had to wait in feb cold and rain I couldn t call the front desk Lucky someone was going out of the building Limited breakfast vegan options , Gaia Sofia is friendly and helpful receptionist Basic clean room with tram and supermarket nearby at walking distance It was overnight stay 
346771,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No parking on location A bit of a walk but not to bad Hotel is only on top 2 floors of the building kind of threw us off Great hotel can t complain Maybe a tad pricey but it s in the capital , The bathroom was amazing Big tub with jets Very up to date Room was nice too minus the carpet Carpet was the only thing they didn t remodel or something very stained Tram station is a 2 minute walk and then a 10 min ride into central station 
346772,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We booked a canceable room and they blocked 125 I talked with my bank and they said that the hotel blocked this amount weeks before arriving It makes no sense for this rate The answer in reason of no show Hello We booked a canceable rate That means you you do not need a guarantee Our bed was splitted with 2 mattresses Surely you will fall in the middle if you turn at night And we talk here about 40cm In case the tv remote control falls in to this gap you wont ever see it again If you take a shower make sure that you wont flood the whole bathroom Thats dangerous because the floor will get slippery The price for that what you get is definitely too high 40 more and you sleep directly in the city Without this problems and the hotel staff will give you a trust before blocking , The deluxe room was clean and nice furnitured The size of the room was ok Our drinks in the minibar was for free Also we got free Cappuccino at the receiption There is just 2 streets away a parking garage for only 5 per 24h That is extremly cheap for the netherlands 
346773,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Shower cubicle wasn t closed off from the rest of the bathroom which left water all over the bathroom Not a huge deal just minor annoyance , Very helpful staff Very clean Easily access to the city centre 
346774,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Location Tram 26 is only public transport which you can use to get to Central Railway station If something happen to this tram for example it was out of service at the day of our arrival you are a bit in a trouble , Beautiful view from the window Clean room Comfortable bed Friendly and professional people at the reception Pancakes were just delicios 
346775,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The entrance A few times the card for getting into the hotel didn t work but the staff was very friendly and helpful to sort out this problem , Very nice and comfortable hotel and friendly and helpful staff The hotel is also close to lots of facilities like transport restaurants shops etc 
346776,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Dirty drainage didn t work properly in our room we told the receptionist at the time and he wasn t helpful at all Floors were dirty and shower flooded whole bathroom every time we took a shower and dirt came up the drain and toilet making the room smelly , Location nice staff tram right next to hotel so easy access to centre 
346777,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No hot water in the morning due to a problem with the water supply Dirty seats in the hotel room , Nice spacy room with an amazing view Only 10 minutes transit to the city centre Very friendly and welcoming staff 
346778,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Coffee pot looked like it had mold from old sitting water , The Staff was very friendly The view was amazing We felt very welcomed from the moment we walked in The room was updated and very clean Contemporary bathroom that was practically spotless Our bed and the Baby s bed was very soft we all slept great We Loved the breakfast selection 
346779,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Layout of the rooms as a whole is little tricky , Huge room with superb facilities and excellent outside views I consider it VFM for the price and the facilities it offers Very easy to reach from Centraal station Tram 26 stop is just a 200m walk from the hotel 
346780,Amadi Panorama Hotel, A bit wider bed would have been nice, All the staff was extremely helpful Very polite friendly and always ready to go out of the way to help with every request Hotel is not in the centre but Tram 26 from outside the Central station stops next to the hotel so commuting was very easy effortless There is a big grocery store next door some places to eat too The mini bar was included in the room rate hot chocolate other food was also freely available 
346781,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The room was way too warm we tried multiple times to turn the thermostat down but there was no change The bathroom had glass walls which was super modern but not practical at all You couldn t turn the light on in the bathroom during the night without illuminating the whole room The main light in the room did not work so the overall lighting in the room was poor All of that aside the worst part was that it was difficult to find the facility When we put the address into our navigation system it brought us into the middle of nowhere , There was parking on the streets around to facility that was free from 7 pm to 9 am which worked nicely for us There was also a parking garage that was only a 5 minute walk away from the hotel that only costed 5 a day 
346782,Amadi Panorama Hotel, n a, Extra friendly staff The room we booked had 4 twin beds and was very spacious and it had great views of the water ports around Convenient bagel cafe nearby for breakfast Super close to tram station 
346783,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Reception is on the 8th floor but the rooms are on 6th and 7th You have to enter a building with apartments to get to the reception but we could not get in the apartment in the beginning could not find the door ring bell of the hotel outside the building We had to call Booking com and then they reached the reception and the problem was solved The future guests should be aware of this so that they do not get confused Breakfast was expensive so we did not get it , Spacious room with nice view to the city Warm enough for the kids to be comfortable 
346784,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No smell, Any good points were shadowed by the stench of the 7th floor this is where our room was The free mini bar was not replenished We have visited Amsterdam every year for 15 years and this was the worst hotel we have stayed in It doesn t matter how big the room was the lovely view and the nice modern bathroom The smell spoiled everything
346785,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Our bathroom was devided in two parts The lights open in both at the same time The second part has no door so if you want to use the first part during night aha aha aha ha ALELLOUIAAAA Then if you want to wash your hands you have to go around through the room this is not good if you travell with a baby But for a couple I dont think is a big deal if you travel alone , The reception personel always kind and helpful The Breakfast was perfect everything fresh everyday and the staff always kind and competent BRAVO The view from our room 722 was awesome The bed super big and comfortable There is a parking close to the hotel about 3 min walking and kosts 5 euro per day easy payment only with credit card It is better to use the tram Nr 26 for visiting the city Just remember to check in and check out everytime The parking in the city is very expensive 5 euro per hour We will visit this hotel some day again 
346786,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We stayed in the family room which slept 4 people it was comfortable but freezing we were cold both nights the reception gave a blow heater to use for our last night which we didn t feel safe leaving on all night This is my second time staying here and I find the staff quite cold and unwelcoming I m a massive believe in customer service in any role you do and the front of house staff seem uninterested and unhelpful Customer service is key I simply can t stress this enough Maybe smile more to begin with , The beds are extremely comfortable
346787,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The staff was absolutely amazing very helpful I loved the 14 breakfast buffet I thought that having a single bed was going to be uncomfortable considering the fact that I m tall I was WRONG it was the MOST COMFORTABLE bed for the few days I was there
346788,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Very well located hotel close to the tram station and also close to a nice park just across the street Staff always willing to help Great breakfast paid View from the room was superb

346790,Amadi Panorama Hotel, distance from town centre , great hotel loved the free drinks in the mini bar Walking distance to the local shops and tram Receptionists were very accommodating 
346791,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Very late servicing of room on second day 6 pm and luke warm shower which we reported but didn t improve , Fantastic hotel in a great location with really good access to the city by tram tickets easily purchased from the hotel Superb views from both sides of hotel loved the funky decor and the glass box bathroom Staff really helpful and knowledgeable Very good set up indeed 
346792,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Only thing I didn t like was the location which is quite far out of the centre There is a tram stop close by but definitely not walking distance to town and later at night we had to get taxis back which were quite expensive This is the main reason I did not rate the hotel good value for money as we had to spend quite a lot on taxis and transport Also for the room price I thought breakfast should have been included But the hotel itself and the staff are great , The staff were super friendly and helpful the beds are so comfy and amazing water views Also the free tea and coffee in room and also in the reception were very welcome The hotel area and rooms are very modern and clean 
346793,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No curtain in the shower Ventilation very noisy, Easily accessible with Tram Booking com please tell which stop not just that it is accessible and line number Breakfast wide offer and delicious Good location for those who like to go running
346794,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Room cleaning could be better we went out on first day and got back around 4pm room still not cleaned They came eventually and we had to get out of room Not great cleaning and beds were not made or changed very well , Great hotel was a bit worried about location but it was not a problem tram 26 and it takes 15 mins from Central Station Beds were amazing and free mini bar and unlimited hot drinks from reception a bonus Staff were very friendly and helpful even if they did forget the alarm call on our last day Also great views from most windows 
346795,Amadi Panorama Hotel, How to enter the building is unclear , The bed was comfortable and we slept well It seemed a little far from the centre of Amsterdam but using the tram that was not an issue I think we had a nicer hotel being further out The staff was helpful and understanding When I asked for a room with a different view they gave it to us Facilities were good Wifi worked well Free coffee and beer in the room 
346796,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Nothing really Was about 15 mins on the tram from Centraal but I knew that before I booked , Comfy bed very welcoming staff free beer in the fridge

346845,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I booked a tripple room with breakfast I found at the check in that it is free for only two as it was not requested esp during booking This unacceptable as I booked tripple with breakfast So I paid separately Bathroom was not good as always water leaks into the toilet , Close to public transport and coffee machine was always available
346846,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The hallways were not as nice as the rest of the hotel But that s only a minor detail , Very nice personnel clean delicious breakfast Easy and quick transport to central station by tram Nice views Easy to drive to 
346847,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Location a bit further than anticipated Website makes a feature of the views from hotel I was disappointed in the reality However neither of these was a major issue All in all I would stay here again , Accommodation and convenience of local shops 
346848,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No place to drop off guests and luggage , Spectacular views large comfortable family room Amazing breakfast they cook eggs and pancakes to order Staff went out of their way to make us comfortable The parking is about a block away in the shopping center with the Albert Heijn and only costs 5 Euros per day Tram 26 is about a 10 minute ride to the central station You can buy tickets and passes on the tram board at the rear where the conductor is 
346849,Amadi Panorama Hotel, I did not eat breakfast there because of the charge That was fine because I didn t have to pay With a frig it didn t matter , Right on the tram line staff VERY helpful with advice got 48 hour tram pass right from the desk Gorgeous views of sunrise and sunset I am a landscape painter so that matters to me Stores in the next block for food I thought price was reasonable for a place to stay that is literally a 10 minute tram ride from Centraal Station and the heart of Amsterdam 
346850,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The hotel is located on the 8th floor and the rooms are on the 6th and 7th floors all other floors are apartments Getting to the rooms isn t that straight forward but manageable The air conditioning heating system seems a little too complex for some people and I couldn t see any room service options local diner or takeaway menus would be a nice touch for food options for late arrivals , The coffee in the rooms and reception was very tasty The views are very nice comfortable and reasonably spacious rooms Located a 5 min walk from the tram stop 
346851,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Carpet in room was very stained which kind of let it down Because the rooms are a type of capsule the noise from other rooms around really travels Luckily our neighbours did go to sleep soon after arriving home otherwise we wouldn t have slept because it was noisy , Bed was very comfy Everything was in good working order and clean apart from list below 
346852,Amadi Panorama Hotel, staff was completely unfriendly the way to room reception was so confusing had to take a lift every time to go to reception and a second one to get out of hotel, nothing to like
346853,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The airconditioning was functioning fine but there was also another air control system that could not be switched off also when de ac was switched off In my room 723 this made quite some noise far from having a silent sleeping environment I called the night porter to check if something could be done about this but he confirmed nothing could be done and he heard this more often , the staff was very nice 
346854,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We stayed for over a week and were piling up some dirty laundry there was no laundry room on any of the levels a washing machine in our room would have been nice , The bed was so comfortable we almost forgot that there was plenty to explore outside of the hotel 
346855,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Prior to arrival the whole booking amount several hundred pounds was pre authorised onto my debit card when we were meant to be paying as a group individually upon arrival Lots of issues getting it released including a large international phone bill that I am having to pay and a lot of anxiety trying to get this resolved prior to the trip I rated the hotel low for value for money due to the excessive phone charges I incurred as a result of this pre authorisation issue The hotel tried to help when the issue arose but the damage had already been done by their initial actions I would urge them to reconsider their pre authorisation practices only pre authorising a standard deposit or only charging card details if a guest does not turn up as intended , The staff are very friendly and the hotel is welcoming Clean and comfortable with lots of little nice touches On the whole a nice hotel apart from a pre authorisation issue 
346856,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Nothing The carpark is not underneath the building but need a bit walking I am lucky to get a parking space just outside the hotel so it s not a problem for me Need to open a number of doors when leaving or going to the room but once you get used to it don t feel it is a problem , The building and rooms are new silent facilities are good not too far away from the city centre neighborhood environment is nice just a residential area Especially like the free mini bar with coke and Heineken and also the girl at the front desk who lead me to the room explain everything clearly which make me feel a very warm welcome Other responses say it is hard to find the entrance but I think it is very easy just need to note the reception is not on the ground floor and need to press the button to ask for opening the door to go to 8 F s reception The last train from the central station is 00 40 which is good enough for me and it just take me 20 mins back to the station nearby The area looks very safe even I walk alone at 01 00 on the street 
346857,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Could have added a trash bin in the bathroom There is a sink missing in the toilets The bathroom and the toilets are separate which is good When you are finished at the toilets you have to go to the bathroom other side of the room to wash your hands Nothing dramatic Just annoying The entrance to the building looks poor , The staff always smiling and helpful We had to take an early flight back and they suggested to prepare sandwiches The room large and comfortable lot of light Easy access to the city with tram 26 15 minutes and you are there Very punctual The nearby commercial centre good shops Cheap parking 5 EUR day it allowed us to rent a car and travel around Amsterdam The hotel is close to the ring road The breakfast rich you can have your eggs prepared in any fashion you wish etc etc etc 
346858,Amadi Panorama Hotel, In our top priced double room the single beds that were pushed together kept moving apart a real poor nights sleep , Staff were faultless never ever had anyone more helpful 
346859,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The beds consisted of 2 mattresses which were too soft The pillows were also too thick for your head to be at a comfortable height , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful with any request eg taxi booking and online takeaway services as the hotel doesn t have room service Whilst the breakfast area looked small there was a good and tasty variety Convenient to get to the Centraal Station tram 26 was very frequent and only a few minutes walk away

346873,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The entrance to the hotel is strange as you enter via a typical private apartment entrance Enter the lift to the 8th floor and then you are in the hotel in every sense of the word The very professional and welcoming reception staff welcome you and explain everything to be honest they could not have been more helpful Explaining the City and also about a 48 hour unlimited tram access card for 12 5 euros available to buy from reception very good value and made getting around the city very easy and cheap The furniture and style of the hotel is stunning great attention to detail nice clean lines and the room was beautifully presented and had everything you could want or wish for Not the largest of rooms but not small Very clean and large comfy bed we had a problem with fusing the lights and it was attended to immediately and someone came up from reception to make sure we were ok The breakfast was good nicely laid out and they would cook eggs omelet etc for you on demand and with anything you wanted to go with it Its a long time since I have been to a hotel where everything was so clean and welcoming I was unsure if the hotel was too far out of the City when booking but because we were driving and the hotel have parking close by at 5 euros per day rather than 60 80 per day in the center I decided to try There is a tram stop outside the hotel and armed with our cards we hopped on and off the trams during our two day stay never having a problem finding out where we wanted to go The 14 min tram ride into the city was easy quick clean and efficient On Saturday night we were later that 12 30 when the trams stop running and it was 25 euros for four of us to get back to the hotel The savings on the parking more than made up for that I would recommend this hotel to anyone in fact I am booking the hotel for myself and four friends in July which is the highest recommendation

346904,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Room is too small I don t like their price policy You can t change your booking after five days in advance then they go down with their prices and make you a rediculous offer for a too pricey upgrade Entrance downstairs is not very stylish , Location just outside the centre with good public transport 
346905,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Pillows were large there was no alternative for smaller pillows I didnt find the bed very comfortable , Staff was very friendly Hotel was in a nice area No issues with wi fi free drinks in mini bar coffee station in reception and close to tram station

346909,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Very quiet nice neighbourhood 10 mins by tram from central station Great views from the rooms Comfortable clean good breakfast supermarket close by 
346910,Amadi Panorama Hotel, A bit out of town but if anything this added to the charm with its spacious open location, The most excellent and helpful caring staff This hotel is in a pleasant suburb of Amsterdam yet only a 15min tram ride into the central station and the city 6Euro runs right outside It has sensational panoramic views from the comfortable rooms A really great hotel with a fab breakfast buffet 
346911,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Rooms already start to show wear and tear rooms are not consistently clean hard to find parking when arriving after 9 30 pm and public parking is closed, 4th stay at the hotel Comfortable beds good size rooms smooth check in check out friendly staff close to grocery stores bakery etc free drinks close to public transportation 
346912,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Convoluted hotel room layout You need to know beforehand the reception is on the 8 th floor of building and you need to go there first before descending to your room floor Shower is a disaster darling no bloody door or lip to stop water flooding whole bathroom If you re partner needs the loo after you ve had a shower she ll need to get her feet wet , Good breakfast food even found some gluten free stuff Modern style

346917,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Got stiffed by cab Was not a valid cab company Getting to our room from reception was like a maze , Staff was wonderful Heineken in fridge was great 
346918,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Need more English channels that s the only negative comment I could say about this hotel , The staff were amazing they couldn t do enough for us the hotel was in a great place to reach all amenities Love the little touches like the fridge with beer and drinks in and the capachino machine that free all day The wifi is free throughout the hotel The city centre is easily accessible on the tram located outside Which takes 10 minutes
346919,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The guy at reception ordered us a taxi to the wrong place and the taxi driver himself was rude and unhelpful even though we showed them both the printed address We paid 40 to be dropped off on the other side of town and had to get a train and another taxi costing 30 to get us to our intended location When we returned to the hotel and explained this to the same guy at reception he was unapologetic and dismissive which I found slightly rude We travelled in a group of 5 and had a triple and a double room The triple room was fine but the double room had a clogged toilet that back filled and flooded the bathroom The stench was unbearable and we didn t sleep for the whole night The next morning the bathroom had dried out and to our horror and disgust the bathroom floor was left with specks of tissue material and faecal matter from the flooded toilet The same guy at the reception was beyond useless he said that there were no more rooms even though we got moved the first thing the next morning by someone else refused to call a plumber and refused to get involved This is extremely appalling and unacceptable service Especially for the price we paid The lady at reception was extremely courteous and apologetic but the damage was done There were also no doors for the showers so every time you had a shower the whole bathroom would end up wet which I didn t quite like , The hotel was modern and near the tram stop
346920,Amadi Panorama Hotel, not in the city center we had a pipe break in the bath room and could not enter the bath room and had to go to another hotel room to shower we should have received an email about this but we did not heard back from the hotel, very friendly staff nice hotel rooms and view

346928,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, extremely friendly and helpful staff unique setting next to the Ij river modern and special interior design spacey and clean rooms by tram you reach Amsterdam city in under 15 minutes The view of a room overlooking the river is just fantastic one has the impression of not being in a hotel but living in a post modern flat 
346929,Amadi Panorama Hotel, , The staff are excellent very friendly down to earth and helpful The room was perfect good facilities great view very clean The location is good and very quiet The hotel is located within 500 m of a tram which will take you into the central station within about 20 minutes it took only 15 minutes early morning on my way to the airport The tram runs frequently 
346930,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, New hotel free hot drinks in the lobe coffee maker in the room free cold drinks in the room mini bar beers and soft drinks clean rooms not very big but reasonable room for a family with two children is very large We were 3 families and having a great time A tram stop really close 15 minutes and you are close to the center parking 5 euro for 24 hours Breakfast just below the hotel Highly recommended
346931,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We like a full English breakfast which was provided but was cold due to the lid of the server being permanently open Everything else about the breakfast was fine other than there being no decaff tea or coffee anywhere on the hotel premises We only had breakfast there on the first day Our room was a decent size and was clean and comfortable The bathroom walls were two thirds smoked glass which was a bit odd although it looked cool Our room was on the front and there was some traffic noise especially if the balcony doors were opened I would recommend a room at the back as the view was prettier too We were very lucky weather wise but I think it would have been very inconvenient having to commute every day if it had been raining , The hotel is clean and modern The staff were friendly and generally helpful Although the hotel is outside the city the tram service was very good 
346932,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The mattress was soft and springy somewhat sloped and the futon over it slides , Modern room and hotel with an amazing view from my room 12 foot high ceilings complimentary beverages including beer and a Nespresso machine in each room Smart features such as digital temperature controls and a tilt and turn balcony glass door Tram ride into central Amsterdam is frequent and takes only 15min travel time

346935,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was really nice our room was so lovely and spacious and it was so good knowing you could just relax and have a drink in the lounge when you got back from a long day out I would recommend the hotel to anybody that asked 
346936,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Nothing to complain about , As a solo backpacker I was simply looking for a comfortable nights sleep in a higher end place The Amandi Panorama hotel blew my mind The room was simple but had everything you needed What really got me was the view overlooking Amsterdam to the right and the sea to the left Made for a comfortable view of the sunrise 
346937,Amadi Panorama Hotel, rooms are ok but not sensational, a little bit out of center amsterdam but very easy access with tram and cheap parking facilities beautiful views on the IJ friendly staff

346939,Amadi Panorama Hotel, No stopping outside hotel to load offload luggage and reception on 8th floor can t enter without buzzing or with room key swipe ok once you know but confusing on 1st arrival Parking difficult in daytime but hotel advises underground car park nearby which was secure and effective and only 5 per day, The views staff very helpful room comfortable free minibar which is rare to find and free coffees near reception anytime day or night easy tram commute into Amsterdam Central station saves the need to drive in the crowded city 
346940,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Toilet was blocked on our arrival with no other avaliable rooms Night porter gave our room key to a stranger in the middle of the night He entered the room when we were sleeping and woke us We called reception and said what happened and the porter asked if he left his bags in the room Then questioned my wife because he didnt believe her that there were no bags in there Why would you give out keys without checking whos in there We did get upgraded to the suite but come on No parking and the city parking doesnt accept cash or forign cards , Hotel is good
346941,Amadi Panorama Hotel, location wasn t really near by the central station but still trams are so easy transportation all around the city, all hotel facilities where outstanding and it gives you the best view you would want to wake up in the morning and see
346942,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Hairdryer electrical cord too short , Friendly cortuous staff Very comfortable beds and comfy bedding Rooms with splendid view Excellent breakfast buffet Very good coffee Relaxed welcoming atmosphere in the reception area with grand view to the water marina and to the sea 
346943,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, A bit further out of town but tram right out front so Central station 12 minutes ride In a new built area on 8th floor but nice views across the water fantastic staff very helpful and welcoming It worked perfectly for me to rest up from the inner city but be close by and walk the waterfront Good facilities post office supermarket chemist all next door but not if you want bars and night life A affordable option I would certainly stay again
346944,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The cleaning staff only change sheets and dry the toilet No vacuming or true cleaning No trash in the toilet or tissues in the room The reciption os hard to find and bad entrance , Very quiet and pleasent area The room is comfortable cosy and nicely designed 
346945,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Table was broken Just a bit more attention for cleaning would be OK , Location is even quite convenient Better than Sloterdijk or other outskirts and the tram runs frequent and is reliable 
346946,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, i found the hotel spotless staff friendly and courteous out of central amsterdam but tram closeby and cheap and good timetable would use this hotel again
346947,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Despite getting paying for the room with a view of the city the view was to the southeast of the hotel so away from the city centre and instead out towards nothing I guess Weesp was in the distance Not exactly what we expected Also not the end of the world it was still a nice view , Nice good clean modern place Didn t try the breakfast but there s a Bagels Beans right around the corner Bed was quite soft and pillows very large if those are things you like you ll be happy if not probably not Staff was very nice helpful and gave great suggestions 
346948,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful hotel in a beautiful location The staff were lovely we will definitely be back There are shopping facilities near by and surrounding the hotel is a lovely community

346951,Amadi Panorama Hotel, This time we had a really small room we have stayed here before and the room was much bigger otherwise everything as ok, The hotel is new and the personal is nice and helpful 
346952,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The hotel is quite far away from downtown amsterdam and its prices don t reflect this as it costs just as much as a 4 star hotel in front of the train station Don t get me wrong the place is nice It just doesn t offer good value , The building was nice and the staff were very helpful
346953,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Our room was modern clean and comfortable It was a nice touch that you are given complimentary water beer and pop in the fridge Also there is complimentary coffee tea hot chocolate etc in reception The staff were helpful and friendly Location was good and contrary to some comments the reception is not at all difficult to find 
346954,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The lack of a car parking You have to pay for parking in a private one which is a little bit far and hard to find The reception location in the 8th floor and lack of any body to help you with the luggage when you arrive leave It rains a lot and suddenly and would be wise to leave some umbrellas to use and return or even rent , Comfort of bed the high speed of WiFi the staff the quietness and the room view
346955,Amadi Panorama Hotel, A restaurant might have been handy although there were some lovely little cafes in the neighbourhood , The Hotel was beautiful gorgeous rooms fabulous view over the bay The staff were exceptionally helpful and the coffee was excellent 
346956,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, nice accommodation but a bit far out of town 15mins by tram is the only option although after the huge crowds we experienced in Amsterdam that weekend it was good for a bit of space and peace and quiet
346957,Amadi Panorama Hotel,No Negative, Amazing hotel with good infrastructure Stayed in suite which was a fab room to stay in Very clean and comfortable Loved the free standing bath Very tasty breakfast too 
346958,Amadi Panorama Hotel, The entrance is not very well indicated and is not as attractive as the rest of the hotel , Brand new hotel nicely designed rooms very quiet wonderful view 
346959,Amadi Panorama Hotel, There were trash in front of the entrance Upon the arrival there were 3 young man passing time at the entrance area making comments which was worrying because not knowing if they are harmless of not I had booked a twin bed room but didn t get Once the beds were separated one bed was only 80 cm wide which was not enough The bathroom glass door was great looking but does not give any intimacy , Great view and nice decoration in the room Good breakfast Location was great for our purpose Good tram connection to the center 
346960,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Location quite a way out of the center Quite expensive for a hotel without extra facilities Lift system not very practical you always have to take a lift up to the lobby 8th floor first and then go back down with a different lift to go out or to your room , Clean modern rooms Great view from the room Public transport nearby Friendly staff Minibar with some free drinks Nice panoramic lounge area with free coffee tea Some restaurants in the neighbourhood 
346961,Amadi Panorama Hotel, None breakfast plates could be bigger but there you go , Easy to get to nice quiet nebourhood supermarket and coffeeshop 5 mlns walk tram stop 3 mins away burger and chip place 10 min walk lovely staff great room with a safe excellent shower free mini bar 10 mins from cenntral station 
346962,Amadi Panorama Hotel, We had booked two rooms The room allotted to children was far away from ours The layout of corridors is like a maze with too many locked doors and basically it is annoying if you need to go to another room which is not in the same wing, The decor and cleanliness of the rooms There is lot of natural light and good view from large windows Beds are very comfortable and temperature control accurate Hotel located in a very nice and safe neighborhood with good tram connection and amenities nearby 
346963,Amadi Panorama Hotel, To reach the room it is like a labhyrint but only to say something because the hotel is excellent , Had a great stay there Everyone at rrception is nice Parking at 5mins for 5 day and tramway at 6mins walk so to say perfectly situated i highly recommend it because parking is kind of problem in Amsterdam Will stay there again if necessary 
346964,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Didn t look too clean because of entrance downstairs and the a bit dirty carpet on the floor But in fact the room was properly cleaned , Staff atmosphere and location Location is ok if you wan t quiet place outside the center with good public transport connections Price is okay for Amsterdam You can have cheap public parking place in the neighborhood 
346965,Amadi Panorama Hotel, Location the hotel is out of Amsterdam in the quiet village The only way to get there is by one tram that runs in particular hours If you are in Amsterdam for nightlife this hotel is not for you , Staff are very friendly and helpful The hotel is modern style 
346966,Amadi Panorama Hotel, It is very deceiving from the images on the size and actual location of the hotel as it is in a tall building the reception being on floor 8 You cannot access floor 7 direct from downstairs so you have to go up to floor 8 through reception to go back down to floor 7 very confusing , I wouldn t put the fact that the hotel is on a man made island out of the city down as a con as you can get a tram 26 every 6 10 minutes and a tram pass is 21 Euro for 48 hour pass
