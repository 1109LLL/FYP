398681,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, This was my second visit to Duquesa de Cardona I love this hotel The location is excellent the bedding is very soft the terrace is gorgeous the staff are very welcoming On this visit I was greeted by a complimentary bottle of cava in my room I have already recommended this hotel to friends and family 
398682,Duquesa de Cardona, Our room was like a cave so dark I payed 540 for 2 nights without breakfast We need to have the lights on all the time , The pool bar on the terrace was great Amazing views and fab service
398683,Duquesa de Cardona, There was nothing we didn t like, After 22 hours of travelling it was so nice to arrive at this hotel The check in was quick and our bed was so comfortable we fell asleep straight away waking up so refreshed the following morning 
398684,Duquesa de Cardona, Overpriced breakfast wouldn t buy next time as you can find a lot cheaper places to eat just around the corner Small pool looks a lot bigger in the picture , Great location nice terrace on the rooftop Cute room though a bit dark Free coffee machine to use all the time
398685,Duquesa de Cardona, We were late in arriving as there was a suspicious bag left at airport so it was locked down Explained this to guy at reception who was very uninterested and not welcoming at all He handed us our card to get in to room and told us how to get there After dropping off our cases in room we went to roof top bar for a quick snack and drink as had not had anything for hours They had stopped serving food which was fair enough but they couldn t offer us anything even after I explained the situation at the airport olives bread crisps would have been great We then asked for water to take to our room as there was none in the room but they didn t sell any at the bar Breakfast was reasonable but it would have been nice to have had different choices each day particularly the hot food same choice each day On the second day we noticed another table getting a menu which we since found out was for different cooked eggs We were not offered this On the last morning we decided to pack our suitcases before going for breakfast so didn t get down until 10 10am breakfast was 8 00am 10 30am After some fruit and coffee we were told as was everyone else that we had 10 minutes to put what we wanted on plates as everything was being taken away Every place we ve been to in the past if breakfast was 08 00 10 30 you could go down at 10 30 and get the same service and breakfast as you would at 08 00 without being rushed Unfriendly unwelcoming reception breakfast choice not being offered what we should have been and being rushed no water in room being offered nothing to eat after being kept at airport for hours all seem rather trivial but for the cost and what the hotel promote themselves as I expected more , Room was ideal with a fantastic shower Roof top bar is definitely worth a visit to relax and soak in the lovely view 
398686,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Beautiful modern spacious clean European hotel room with good design of space and storage and amenities The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the location was excellent 
398687,Duquesa de Cardona, The cocktails served on the Roof Terrace were not good didn t deserve the prices charged The staff on the roof Terrace were not of a consistently high standard Twice we were almost moved off sun beds at 6 30pm to suit the staff in preparing early for evening set up You don t stock Cointreau in your bar which was disappointing , The facilities and location were fabulous The reception staff were warm and friendly and their service was exceptional Our room was really lovely and very clean and with all the facilities we needed for a lovely stay 
398688,Duquesa de Cardona, Pool is very small , Family rooms were great 2 twin beds plus a king size Showers were awesome high water pressure Great location right on the marina and in the Gothic area 
398689,Duquesa de Cardona, Breakfast ridiculously overcharged Bedrooms except those overlooking the port were dark and gloomy swimming pool on terrace little bigger than a bath tub , View from the terrace nothing else was above good average 
398690,Duquesa de Cardona, The terrace bar staff came round with some tapas didn t tell us the cost or make it clear it was going to cost us and it was very expensive Also no parking available at the property although we found parking around the city was reasonably priced , Excellent staff extremely helpful Beautiful location although not central close to the waterfront which was nice as it wasn t as busy I still plenty to see and do Brilliant breakfast although it was 18 it was worth it eggs cooked to order fresh pastries fruit and continental breakfast 
398691,Duquesa de Cardona, Tried your charge me 7 5 euros for 2 small and I mean small scoops of ice cream Only when I questioned this they said it was a mistake and offered a refund however for me credibility had been lost , Reception team excellent at assisting with tickets for various activities
398692,Duquesa de Cardona, Not directly related to the hotel but more related to the general city condition I am quite sensitive to noise and we stayed in a room right on a noisy side street However this is just a proof of how lively Barcelona is I was prepared with my earplugs so it is a recommendation to anyone who is a light sleeper bring your earplugs in case , The location of the property was excellent It was walking distance to a lot of attractions and all kinds of public transportation Also it is one of the best locations to rent a bike and enjoy a long ride on the shore The hotel was very clean and comfortable our room was quite spacey and the staff was excellent with their assistance and service They helped us with all kinds of recommendations reservations and transportation I was attracted to the roof terrace when I was searching for a hotel to stay in Barcelona in booking com To be honest the roof was better than expected with regards to the view service and the bar This was a trip with my husband and I will definitely stay in this hotel when we come back with our children next year 
398693,Duquesa de Cardona, Hotel felt outdated AC didn t work bathrooms were underwhelming For the money we felt like there was better options in the city , Good location in the gothic quarter
398694,Duquesa de Cardona, The terrace restaurant was poor Both staff and food Also the cafe in the lobby Breakfast was nice However the coffee and orange juice should be served by the staff Milk was never hot enough We all found the coffee machines confusing to work We are on holiday and expect some service for our 18 Euros per person , The Spanish feel of the hotel Original features make it charming Friendly staff and clean Good location 
398695,Duquesa de Cardona, There is nothing in which we didn t like , Bed was very comfortable staff were amazing Helpful and clean There is just nothing myself or my partner could of complained or given a negative opinion towards we will definitely stay there again when we next visit Barcelona 
398696,Duquesa de Cardona, Surprised with our evening drink we were given olives but when asked if we could have some nuts the bowl of olives were taken away Breakfasts weren t good value for money luckily not included in our price of room , Particularly liked the location with our room looking over the harbour Also the fact it had a roof terrace to be able to have a drink at the bar 
398697,Duquesa de Cardona, While the room was very comfortable it did not have a view of the harbour which I had requested , Excellent location on the water front The roof top bar is a great facility
398698,Duquesa de Cardona, The AC wasn t working our first night so it became a bit warm But it was fixed shortly after telling the front desk , The bed and pillows were very comfortable And the staff was very accommodating and pleasant 
398699,Duquesa de Cardona, Room was a little small, Well located near restaurant s bar s the metro shops and bus services The bed was large and rooftop bar was fantastic
398700,Duquesa de Cardona, The pool wasn t very big warm or cleaned I m not sure if it s in use certain times of the year However this didn t affect our stay at all and hope this doesn t stop anyone from booking , Amazing accommodation in a great location Easily walkable to main destination spots Room was ideal size with the biggest double bed and was cleaned to a great standard everyday The staff were very accommodating We didn t eat at the restaurant however costed the roof terrace bar every night which was lovely 
398701,Duquesa de Cardona, I thought it a bit noisy but don t be put off we just had bad neighbours and the hustle and bustle of a busy city was ok, Room was immaculate very comfy beds and pillows and a great location
398702,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, We stayed here for two days and loved it Charming boutique hotel with the best rooftop bar in town Location right by the beach walkable to many good bars restaurants etc Service housekeeping good we had a prompt check in They even gave us early check in and were helpful with information etc They charge 10 euros per hour for a late checkout Room not so big but okay for a couple We tried the classic room on 3rd floor but the patio which is actually just a french window opens towards the veranda on the inside of the building so can be a little dark We then stayed on the 4th floor in a classic room with a patio which was much nicer as it was a little bigger with a small patio you could actually open and step out a bit on the patio if you want it s very small but still a patio Lots of light much better than the inside open window as this patio opened towards the side street Can be a little noisy as there are bars on the side street but we didn t mind it that much We didn t eat at the hotel but we tried the rooftop bar and it was great The rooftop bar is perfect for a sunny drink and some snacks We actually enjoyed the rooftop bar the most Definitely recommend this hotel to anybody exploring Barcelona while staying by the water 
398703,Duquesa de Cardona, Only 2 small pots of milk each day but we were given more when we asked Some noise from the reception heard due to the room being just off the mezzanine , Reception staff friendly and helpful booked attraction tickets and taxis for us Welcome glass of Cava and some Valentine s Day chocolates on arrival Great bathroom and toiletries Location was spot on and the view from the terrace bar was amazing 
398704,Duquesa de Cardona, Rooftop bar closed at 11 , The location of the hotel was perfect walking distance for everywhere The staff were extra friendly and we had a glass of champagne on arrival The roof top bar was beautiful 
398705,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, We were offered a glass of cava on arrival and had a bottle waiting in our room i had emailed and let them know i was celebrating a birthday anniversary which was a nice touch The room was a good size with a large bathroom with bath and shower Our room had a balcony looking straight across to the harbour worth the money a night just for that tbh Close to la rambles and an amazing tapas restaurant called sensi must visit do not hesitate to stay here you wont regret it
398706,Duquesa de Cardona, The shower floor was always wet and cold as the water never fully drained The shower head was a little tricky and not very strong , Had a nice big room with plenty of space The window opened always a plus onto a balcony over a pedestrian passageway The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful 
398707,Duquesa de Cardona, We had trouble with the hot water in two occasions On one day the water was boiling hot and no matter what we tried we couldn t use the shower we didn t tell the management about that The next day there was no hot water so we called the management It is worth mentioning that they acted quickly and in the end the problem was solved They kindly offered a discount for the inconvenience plus free breakfast for the remaining of our stay I certainly hope this will not discourage anyone from staying at the Duquesa de Cardona I for one will certainly stay there again , The hotel was very well located with easy access to various subway stations though if you are traveling with a small child in a baby stroller sometimes the location of the elevator may not be obvious within walking distance to La Boqueria market and pretty much to most of the Gaudi attractions assuming you are OK with walking 2 3 km There is a self service laundry nearby as well The hotel is near Les Rambles and we felt safe walking with small children there even at night though of course this is really subjective The hotel staff was always very kind and friendly one of the managers would always come to give a high five to my son and talk to him making him feel very special The room was spacious and within our expectations we stayed in the renewed section of the hotel Our room was in the second floor facing the street but in spite of that the room was very quiet There is a bar on the top floor with a great view of the pier Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again 
398708,Duquesa de Cardona, Since it was a quadruple room the table could be bigger with additional 2 more chairs to accommodate all 4 guests , Reception staff Ruben and the guy w specs charming guy who welcomed us upon arrival and gladly offered us chilled champagne were superb will make you feel you want to come back to this hotel Room and bathroom lovely Beds good Sheets clean Tea and coffee in the room very useful guest oriented amenities Luggage storage space very convenient 
398709,Duquesa de Cardona, Nothing great choice for Barcelona , Awesome location Very spacious and nicely furnished room especially for European hotel Lovely breakfast Very pretty and charming lobby 
398710,Duquesa de Cardona, It was quite cold in the evening and although the view was spectacular it would have been good to have a proper bar and dinner served in the breakfast room The restaurant prices were high , Welcome Room position Restaurant food Breakfast was excellent and breakfast room charming 
398711,Duquesa de Cardona, I could not fault anything about this excellent hotel , The location is great at Passeig Colom next to Port Vell and Las Ramblas just 5 minutes away The view from the 6th floor terrace is breathtaking The staff were execptional in their service and most frientdly Breakfast buffet was a feast with iberico jambon ham served wide range of cheese salads scrambled eggs the works The room was large and quiet facing the courtyard We were totally satisfied and will stay there the next time we are in Barcelona 10 out of 10 
398712,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Good location close to Las Ramblas with nice view of the marina Room was clean spacious enough and well appointed Good choice of foods available for breakfast Staff were mostly helpful 
398713,Duquesa de Cardona, WE DID NOT TAKE BREAKFAST AT THE HOTEL TOO PRICEY UNLESS ONE EATS A GREAT DEAL, WE LIKED MANY THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL THE LOCATION THE VERY HELPFUL STAFF THE SPACIOUS ROOM AND A GREAT BED 
398714,Duquesa de Cardona, The room was dated and tired Dark colours in room Sink was not emptying and the shower taps coming away from wall Maid was not sweeping the floor daily and even left us without toilet paper its not what yiu expect from a 4 star hotel which clearly it isn t We complained and although the room was cleaned the next day the sink remained blocked It was expensive for quality of accomodation Next time we will go Eurostars Marina similar price but outstanding Staff friendly , Location of this hotel was excellent They have a lovely bar with a great view on the 6th floor 
398715,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, very helpful and polite staff great location for La Ramblas the beach port and good restaurants booking services taxi open top bus trip etc bottle of fizz in the room on arrival Free WiFi with good bandwidth electronic safe good sized bathroom with the all important powerful hot shower quiet location and in room Flexible on check in time We checked in straight away and then stored our bags at the hotel until the the room became available several hours before the official check in time 
398716,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, We were on a cruise and it was very close to the port It was close to everything very walkable They let us check out late as well as had our room ready almost immediately upon arrival Staff was very friendly Almost everyone spoke English They also helped us with tickets for some of the museums Word to the wise buy your tickets for the church before you arrive as I have spoken to many who could not go inside because all tickets were sold for that day 
398717,Duquesa de Cardona, Breakfast expensive but inline with all hotels in the area so we didn t purchase it , Great location Friendly staff who spoke good English Cava on arrival No complaints from us 
398718,Duquesa de Cardona, Nothing , The food was excellent as was the service and the staff were good humoured helpful and very professional It was like staying at a mini Claridges everything was of the best 
398719,Duquesa de Cardona, Would be great if they could extend the pool hours upstairs 7pm seemed a bit early to take the sun loungers away , Staff were lovely Nice location near the beach but also close to shopping and great food 
398720,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Contemporary luxurious hotel with top notch staff who will gladly help to maximize your stay in beautiful Barcelona Gorgeous rooftop patio and bar Will surely stay here again 
398721,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Everything was fab about it beautiful hotel clean great decor great food staff Will definitely be staying again Have recommended to family friends 
398722,Duquesa de Cardona, the main meal we had in the restaurant was disappointing , The room was very comfortable the bathroom was a good size and spotless A lovely roof terrace and helpful staff 
398723,Duquesa de Cardona, Room was average and a little small, Staff were exceptionally polite helpful and welcoming View from balcony overlooking road to the marina was really nice Bathroom was modern well planned and spacious Roof top bar was wonderful with a small pool and sunbathing deck Really enjoyed our stay
398724,Duquesa de Cardona, The noise from the traffic on the busy road outside was very audible , We received excellent help from staff especially Jordi who welcomed us and ensured everything was good for an elderly member of our group The terrace was lovely and had nice views and a welcome place to go to on warm days after sightseeing While the pool is small it is very refreshing to have a dip in the heat Food was also good up there 
398725,Duquesa de Cardona, Nothing, Excellent position a stylish hotel and a really nice roof garden with a small pool Good service with a warm welcome efficient reception 
398726,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Beautiful and amazing rooms And the rooftop terrace was lovely The rooms were clean spacious and quiet and the bed was very comfy we had the best nights sleep It was a fantastic location and the staff were lovely I would definitely return 
398727,Duquesa de Cardona, The service at the roof top restaurant was not great Some staff did not speak English which made getting an order understood difficult Food sometimes took a long time to come out Most importantly there were many errors made in the bills multiple times which was a bit fishy , The location us fantastic and close to the beach We stayed in a family room which was very nice The staff at reception were very helpful The roof top restaurant was great and served nice food 
398728,Duquesa de Cardona, I did not like being removed from my table at the terrace bar for an upcoming reservation when I had been there for an hour continuously eating and drinking with friends I have never heard of having to reserve a cocktail table at a hotel bar The terrace was the main selling point for me in choosing the hotel so I will not be returning even though everything else was great ,No Positive
398729,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Excellent breakfast fantastic view over harbour sensational roof terrasse elegant rooms We will be coming back soon Recommended for private business trips 
398730,Duquesa de Cardona, Construction Zone Construction was going on while we were there with drilling banging and clanging for hours Now I m a heavy sleeper and after a long flight and jet lag I was ready to go into a coma after checking in Luckily it didn t happen at night but with so much noise all chances of us taking a nap were gone This is the worse noise I have every experienced ever at a hotel To make it worse I asked the front desk staff to tell me when the work would be done He said 3 00pm perfect I though it s 2 55 Only 5 more minutes I can finally sleep Nonetheless the banging clanging and drilling continued on and on for at least another few hours until I went down stairs and told the front desk person we couldn t sleep So I went out sat by the water went to the ATM etc went back to the room still clanging and banging They didn t have any other rooms so they finally called the construction crew and told them to stop the noise By biggest disappointment comes from the lack of transparency on behalf of the front desk staff after I talked to them about it twice In addition they didn t offer a discount or apologize upon checkout I finally asked for a discount and got it It looks like it s going to be a large project and addition to the whole right side of the property It doesn t look like something that will be done quickly In addition if you called and you asked if the work was over I can t be sure you ll get a straight answer , Great location and rooms and nicely decorated and clean 
398731,Duquesa de Cardona, I have nothing bad to say , The staff were really friendly and helpful We received champagne on arrival and a warm welcome The roof terrace is great for sunbathing and cocktails Great little spot right at the front and great location for sight seeing 
398732,Duquesa de Cardona, I hate that I didn t get to stay there a little longer , Loved the staff s hospitality and helpfulness The terrace restaurant was incredible delicious and the hotel s location was great 
398733,Duquesa de Cardona, Staff at the pool terrace was kind but inefficient Staff at reception was cold and not very helpful Serious need for more hooks or towel racks in the bathroom Room not as shown no balcony rather dark with a musty smell Booking com site states Enjoy a free welcome drink upon arrival which we did not get Overall pricey for what we got I feel we had the cheap room and service to match , Great location near the port and Barri Gotic Beds were comfortable 
398734,Duquesa de Cardona, Nothing wish I would have stayed longer, Get reception super clean beds very comfortable Energy effecient lights only light with key card Nice champagne reception 
398735,Duquesa de Cardona, It would have been nice to have access to a larger pool but we were very close to the water , This hotel was truly wonderful It had a beautiful look and feel and the staff were sensational Would definitely recommend 
398736,Duquesa de Cardona, There is nothing to dislike My first visit to your loveley City and a wonderful experience staying at your Hotel I would love to return sometime in the not too distant future , I liked everything 
398737,Duquesa de Cardona, The pool was very small, Great hotel in excellent location Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Loved the rooftop bar and restaurant had an amazing view 
398738,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Don t miss staying here Superior service and staff The hotel is beautiful it was a small palace and those details are evident downstairs The rooms have been completely redone recently and resemble the simplicity of the 4 Seasons Breakfast selection was excellent with eggs made to order After a long trip from San Francisco and a five hour delay I was greeted with champagne and an upgraded room since they could not get me into a room before 2 PM that afternoon This hotel would be a wonderful 5 day base from which to explore Barcelona It s in near the historic district with a harbor view so you have everything close by Thank you staff for a wonderful but too short stay 
398739,Duquesa de Cardona, Breakfast is overpriced head out to a pavement cafe instead, Very smart hotel modern comfortable room Beds were super comfy roof terrace bar great for a nightcap Superb location for the Gothic quarter and marina 
398740,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, We had an unsolicited and extended checkin where we given plenty of advice on location nearby activities and attractions Terrace was very nice and an enjoyable place to spend the evening before or after dinner Magician employed by the hotel was nice touch and not too pushy Staff were excellent all around 
398741,Duquesa de Cardona, Breakfast staff never advised when closing the buffet and turned off coffee machine before the end of breakfast , Reception staff was amazing Although there was an electricity failure they still checked me in early Room was very comfortable and quiet Terrace is beautiful and staff was always helpful Beautiful breakfast Great hotel Will definitely go back 
398742,Duquesa de Cardona, Building work ongoing and encountered associated noise of drilling and banging On last night of our stay we were unable to use rooftop bar restaurant only such facilities at hotel as private function had hired it out Disappointed after paying so much unable to use these facilities and take in view on our last night , Location decor food and roof top terrace with small pool
398743,Duquesa de Cardona, Thought charging for breakfast was bad considering for 3nights it was nearly 600 euros I must admit hotel was very nice but one night we tried to get a drink and food on the roof terrace and there was no where to sit so had to go elsewhere ,No Positive
398744,Duquesa de Cardona, Terrace service was poor The pool on the terrace is about the size of a bathtub , The location can t be beaten so close to everything of interest 
398745,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Great location at the seaside boulevard Very helpful and polite reception desk staff Large and clean rooms strong wifi signal One of the best rooftop bars in Barcelona very good service and amazing sea view 
398746,Duquesa de Cardona, I will start from the end If not for one event that cast a shadow on my staying which was for 11 nights I would have given it the highest esteem The event A guest played loud music at the middle of the night for three hours which was too intense to sleep The stuff tried but could not stop him What amazed me is not this particular occasion but the ignorance of the hotel management from it during the rest of my stay at the hotel another 2 nights This behavior of the hotel management brought me to degrade my evaluation of the hotel and to a decision not to stay again in this hotel This wasn t my first staying in the hotel but was the last From a quality hotel I expected to get an official apology from the management and a compensation if only symbolically and small to clarify their understanding of the uneasiness of a guest who stayed there for 11 nights , Beyond that the hotel is excellent the breakfast and restaurant staff as well There is a Remarkable rooftop restaurant with great views and the staff is pleasant professional and with great quality 
398747,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, The roof terrace is wonderful good staff and excellent food We had a room facing Port Vell the room was clean and comfortable no road noise when windows were shut Great views 
398748,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, The location across from the harbor and in the gothic quarter was amazing The rooms were upscale roomy and comfortable My favorite part of the hotel was the rooftop bar which overlooked the harbor This is a boutique property that offers affordable luxury with a non pretentious vibe 
398749,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, The most impressive part about the hotel was the extremely helpful staff Traveling abroad can be a challenge when planning your time and selecting restaurants but the staff at this hotel helped us with everything and made the stay even better
398750,Duquesa de Cardona, The construction noise When there s a discount it s for a reason I told them but the first day they blamed another building On Teusday morning I was woken up at 9 am in my holiday by hammer in the next room to mine and when I told the fro t desk there was just silence , Great location and rooftop bar
398751,Duquesa de Cardona, A restaurant would have been nice but with an extension in progress maybe next year , The staff were very informative and helpful nothing was too much trouble Nice touch a complimentary cocktail and a surprise bottle of Cava on my birthday Lovely rooftop bar with ample seating Our room was a good size with perfect bathroom 
398752,Duquesa de Cardona, Room with great view of harbour but street noisy if window opened , Great location helpful and friendly staff Good but expensive breakfast Good view Well designed room for 4 
398753,Duquesa de Cardona, The room was awful Claustrophobic airless lightless It was their basic room but at 175 per night I expected better It was horrible having to spend time in the room but due to poor weather we occasionally ate there I asked for a table to eat at but was told we couldn t have one so we had to borrow an occasional table from one of the lounges Avoid the basic room like the plague I would have upgraded it had been offered but then that would have been really pricey , The staff were friendly
398754,Duquesa de Cardona, A bit overpriced Also didn t get the room specifications that I had requested , Great location great rooftop terrace and generally good hotel facilities cleanliness etc 
398755,Duquesa de Cardona, Lobby area of the hotel was just ok Pool very small It s really just a small plunge pool No bar inside the hotel so if you are there outside summer like us it s a bit cold in the evening times to enjoy a drink in the open air , Great location beside the marina and the gothic quarter We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms which was very nicely done very comfortable Lovely roof terrace with great views of the marina 
398756,Duquesa de Cardona, I did not have breakfast there so I can not comment on the quality but I found the price a little steep which is what put me off , Staff were excellent friendly and could not do enough The room had a lovely view of the harbour and was spotless 
398757,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Excellent location right on marina easy quick walk to La Rambla and La Boqueria best and biggest food market open cafes Very clean Awesome concierge who was more than happy to help with all my last minute travel plans Lets not forget best rooftop drinks with a view of city and marina FABULOUS 
398758,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, The Dinner on the terrace was delicious and service was great the location was wonderful right on the harbour and very central also great for a run or good walk Bedrooms very clean and comfortable Would definately stay there again when in Barcelona 
398759,Duquesa de Cardona, Coffee could have been hotter at breakfast , Small comfortable hotel in a fabulous location Very friendly staff Excellent soundproofing from outside Very good all round but it s the location on the edge of the barrio Gotic with all It s sights and restaurants and the views over the harbour that stand out 
398760,Duquesa de Cardona, Our room overlooked a main road resulting in traffic noise at night Also A C couldn t be adjusted resulting in room being too warm at night , The location was ideal between the Gothic Qusrter and the Marina Our room was modern with good bathroom and it was right size for a family 
398761,Duquesa de Cardona, Room felt claustrophobic dark as there was only one window which opened onto a narrow alley with another building 10 feet away , Friendly staff rooftop bar with great views Great location Nice modern decor furnishings Excellent bathrooms 
398762,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff Excellent location in the south Gothic quarter with great views from the terrace A lovely mix of traditional modern decor Comfortable and quiet room 
398763,Duquesa de Cardona, Overall the bed was very uncomfortable especially the pillows so i didn t have a great nights sleep i had a back room without a view so a view is your thing then pay the extra because you certainly don t get one if you don t I stayed at 2 other Hotels 5 star which were slightly cheaper and in my opinion much more superior in terms of location professionalism and friendliness of staff and overall comfort, Location is good near the harbour and not far from the Ramblas Rooftop bar is really nice with lovely views
398764,Duquesa de Cardona, This hotel is tool costly compared to it s facilities The room was very small I went to Hotel Eurostars Grand Marina to meet a friend and found that he got a huge room 5 times bigger than the one I got with similar price ,No Positive
398765,Duquesa de Cardona, The port view rooms have the view blocked by trees so no port view in fact, Great breakfast silent rooms even if we had the windows facing the busy street clean with large beds 
398766,Duquesa de Cardona, construction site next door partly blocking the view from the terrace Suppose it is a temporary thing though , location is great The view of the marina from the top floor terrace 
398767,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Excellent location in the heart of the Gothic Neighborhood What won us over was the staff Extremely helpful and courteous And of course the rooftop deck is amazing with great views 
398768,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Fantastic service from all the staff They went above and beyond to help Lovely glass of complimentary cava on arrival which was unexpected Brilliant rooftop bar with the weather being chilly we were given blankets and surrounded by heaters 
398769,Duquesa de Cardona, Nothing It was great stay all in all with gave us access to many close by locations like beach Marina Telefric mountain shopping streets etc, Great facility great location and more importantly very helpfull and supportive staff with 5 stars response to anything we needed during our stay The hotel was close to see side and within walking distance from metro stations 
398770,Duquesa de Cardona, The furniture was a bit old The breakfast is too expensive with 18 Euro Bakerys and Caf s are offering a breakfast for less than 10 Euro For 12 Euro as instance I guess that the most would prefer to have breakfast at the hotel , The reception staff was very friendly and perfect English speaking I liked also the briefing with the first lessons in Spanish on a card Good idea The room was very clean The terrace bar on the top of the roof was great with excellent food and with a very friendly bar keeper Excellent staff at the hotel and you really feel welcomed 
398771,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, Very nice Hotel in a convenient location Breakfast was good and hotel service and amenities great Good sized rooms Internet worked well Seems to have recently been renovated and owners are trying to make it a more up market hotel 
398772,Duquesa de Cardona,No Negative, spacious room comfortable large bed great lighting very quiet helpful staff w restaurnt recaommendations outstanding personable staff roofdeck was great fun
398773,Duquesa de Cardona, Two minor complaints would be that the english channels on the tv didn t work properly and that the laundry service was extremely expensive , Overall a nice place to stay in a great location Friendly staff and a fantastic breakfast 
398774,Duquesa de Cardona, Wish we could stay longer , Great location wonderful friendly professional front desk staff thank you Jordi for excellent tips for trips and restaurants comfortable quiet and well equipped rooms I definately would come back again 
398775,Duquesa de Cardona, Some of the buildings on the same road are not in the best condition which is unusual for the city but don t let it put you off , Location between the marina and the Ramblers is ideal for using the hotel as a base for exploring the city 
398776,Duquesa de Cardona, Staff on the terrace wasn t nice as the reception also we had a tea and they served it cold , Staff in reception nice helpful specially David made things easier for us when checking in and out The hotel gave us a bottle of sparkling to celebrate our anniversary
