486945,Sina The Gray, There wasn t any service on the terrace It would have been nice to have drinks there after dinner , The location is amazing and the staff is super polite 
486946,Sina The Gray, Nothing Just the Wifi didn t work with my iphone for some reason maybe it was something with my phone, We booked a triple room There wasn t much space but overall ok The fastest room service ever All time early mornings or late nights I was really shocked and loved how fast I m getting my requests done Amazing location Helpful staff even if u ask for an outsourced service they helped me with planning trips and airport transportation even when it was done by another party 
486947,Sina The Gray, Aging airport hotel Expected more from a S, Great location on city center Expensive parking but nice to just pull up to front door and have them park the car 
486948,Sina The Gray, Check in took forever like over 30 minutes involving much peering at screens and writing down our passport numbers and credit card details systems down apparently No coffee in rooms Air conditioning weedy and only just ok it was 29 on the day we were there We wanted to use the stairs not the lift slow and only one told it was for staff only Never got the wi fi to work in our room during our stay reception suggested we leave our room and come down and try reception where it was strong We were trying to re book a cancelled BA flight so wi fi was pretty much essential actually when isn t it essential Too expensive ,No Positive
486949,Sina The Gray, the room was very very narrow for a double room size even the TV was very small for the price paid , location of the hotel it is just perfect everything is near another great thing was the hospitality the staff were supportive and helpful 
486950,Sina The Gray, The water was not free and very expensive The shower didn t work properly Often there was a smell of cigarettes that crept in to the room , Location was excellent Thr breakfast was good 
486951,Sina The Gray, Small poor quality of interiors for 5 stars Only benefit is location Generally waste of money It is not 5 stars even close , Location only is good 
486952,Sina The Gray, Wifi coverage can be improved in the room especially on the mezzanine level I missed not being able to make coffee tea in the room , The staff are extremely helpful and made me feel at home Luxury and tranquility are the best words to describe the ambience I experienced The location is right in the heart of Milan Overall a resounding yes from me if you consider staying here 
486953,Sina The Gray, The rooms are small and not comfortable Noise Corridors smelly I don t know how this hotel have 5 stars I wont be back again , Only the location and staff
486954,Sina The Gray, No tea or coffee making facilities in room No ironing room facilities available unless you paid for the restricted service No welcome drink upon check in as stated by booking com, Couldnt have wished for a better location 
486955,Sina The Gray, Quality of services staff and attention to details not fully adequate for a 5 stars hotel and for its price tag, Great location in the heart of Milan More expensive rooms have great size and nice design decor All comforts and services are available
486956,Sina The Gray, loudiest staff ever totally impossible to sleep beyond 8am as staff was uninterruptedly slamming doors every single morning from 8 to 11, design hotel with good rooms amazing location in the heart of milan
486957,Sina The Gray, It s small and really just a place to sleep Their sister hotel is probably better for many for the facilities which I m told are shared It s just a couple of hundred meters away , Next door to la Rinacente and the Duomo the location is as central as you could possibly get If you re there for shopping and or sightseeing you are right there The breakfast was very good and the staff friendly 
486958,Sina The Gray, Location v central but didn t end up regarding this as a bonus as it was very noisy even with well insulated windows due to pan pipes jugglers street performer malarkey of the worst order Also made getting a cab tricky and unnecessarily expensive due to one way system Area was so crowded as to be almost unnavigable at times not the hotel s fault but just saying that 5 minutes away were saner areas Interiors were dated musta been nice in 1992 with overly flashy design touches that were just naff e g ridiculous amount of light switches and gizmos when actually you just want classy simplicity There is no real attention to detail e g crap lighting for make up non working safes both rooms no comfortable chairs COLD had to ask for a blimming radiator in the end Bathroom was tired looking with grotty sealant loo had a ridiculous flush handle which required holding it open to work everything you put on the sink console table immediately rolled off as it was at a slant mirror was drippy the elbow was knackered so it pointed to the floor therefore was only suitable for those under 5ft tall asked repeatedly for it to be fixed nothing happened body and bath products smelt like disinfectant and were harsh to use Generally over priced for what it was Mine 1000 for three nights looked out onto a car park Granted a nicely maintained one but a multi story nevertheless My dad s superior 2000 was large with a lovely view but still really poorly considered only one blimming chair still over priced I think Actually only got his super dooper room because it was the only way I could guarantee step free shower for him All in all a real disappointment The sort of place that charges this kind of dough you shouldn t have to de grease the to remote , I didn t like this hotel at all My rating is as high as it is because of the nice staff My dad was unwell when we were staying and they couldn t have been more helpful and kind Really really nice staff Shame the rest of it was so blah 
486959,Sina The Gray, The rooms are tiny the room service and breakfast buffet is quite poor , The locations is absolutely perfect Its so central and close to so many must see places in Milan 
486960,Sina The Gray, Staff staff staff Room size V Bad smell all over No parking Their are so many hotels around this gray one and much nicer I have no idea how they got 5 stars None of the 5 stars criteria met No gym no business center no lobby no view no swimming pool breakfast very poor and very bad staff with rude attitude Just an advise to any travelers if you plan visit Milano DONT take a nonrefoundble room believe me it s worth it to pay more but you will have the chance to chose and those ppl in this ugly gray hotel knew that you have no way out because of our selection of nonrefoundble room I will never ever go back and I don t recommend it to any body Again as an advisor of trip adviser site look for so many hotels around the doumo and make sure you book a none gray hotel look for white hotels , Location only but no cars can go in and that might be a big problem if you have luggage 
486961,Sina The Gray, Room on top frool is a disaster small door not sealed 1 cm light from outiise no noise isolation you actually hear everything from outiide disscussion infront of eelevator This room deffinately bot worth 415 EUR bight Value for money equal ZERO No place to Even move the suitcase opening it is a miracle, Very gentle and kind person at breakfast
486962,Sina The Gray, Nothing, I liked every thing about the hotel especially the reception staff Sonia and Lorenzo Sonia is very helpful very funny and smiles and makes you feel that you are at your house I loved her dealing way with me and my family she made me extend my stay at the hotel And Lorenzo is a gentleman thank you too The location is perfect very perfect Clean cozy luxury I will come back again
486963,Sina The Gray, The place overall is very tired and dated which is a pity given its location The beds bedding and facilities were two star at best , The staff have been excptional especially Elena at reception 
486964,Sina The Gray, Only a suggestion to offer a free bottle of water in the room , The perfect location in the middle of the shopping district just behind La Rinascente the unique design of the hotel the spacious room with a gorgeous view to Galleria Vittorio Emanuelle The reception staff was very kind to upgrade us Thank you very much again for making our stay unforgettable 
486965,Sina The Gray, Internet was spotty in the room and the valet for the car cost 45 EUR While I think that is a product of being in the city center it is still quite pricey for parking , The hotel is absolutely beautiful and just as pictured on their website The staff was extremely friendly and helped with all of our multiple requests Location is literally steps from the Duomo couldn t have been a better location 
486966,Sina The Gray, Dark dungeon like dining room dangerous bath design for anyone less than agile and surefooted, Staff outstanding in terms of friendliness and helpfulness This includes all staff from front desk to servers to doorman and even chamber maids location superb breakfast choice and quality very good
486967,Sina The Gray, WiFi access was a big challenge for the first 3 days no personnel in house to solve issues like this Room and bathroom were full of brochures and items that make the spaces very cluttered I did not have enough space to put my toiletry items Very crowded , Location was excellent and the staff was very helpful 
486968,Sina The Gray, Drainage of the shower was problematic sometimes Could have cleaned the bath tub a bit better especially the under of the faucet which you only see when you use the tub , Location location location Super near the duomo Fantastic view of Galleria Vittorio Emmanuel Can be a bit noisy at night because of the bar across the street Make sure to close the windows 
486969,Sina The Gray, Breakfast restaurant Toiletries could have been better quality, Location was excellent Our room was upgraded which was lovely however it was not cleaned on one evening The hotel dealt with this brilliantly and gave us a discount on check out Breakfast was not good however very good cafe latte on room service 
486970,Sina The Gray, I made this reservation for my wife as a gift It s been impossible to communicate with the team and at the end the little welcome gift i asked for wasn t delivered Given we are talking about a 5 hotel this is simply not acceptable ,No Positive
486971,Sina The Gray,No Negative, Initially I was given a room that was really a single room so small but it was difficult to unpack my suitcase This would have been OK as I was alone but no way 2 people could fit Due to a problem with the heating the room was stuck at 28 degrees C they gave me an upgrade and handled it all very well A stylish hotel in a great position
486972,Sina The Gray, It is like someone rented the place and brought some furniture from china and rated the hotel as 5 stars It doesn t deserve more than 3 or 4 stars AC dont work properly also rooms are very small And the main thing is the price wich was very high, Just location
