294442,Arenas Atiram Hotels, The room was a little noisy during the night due to the noise coming from the street , The staff was very kind and helpful Less than 5 min walk to the metro station 
294443,Arenas Atiram Hotels, Being recommended the above Spanish place to eat opposite hotel Don t recommend them the food is not fit for animals , Good location 3 mins to Maria Christina metro Good standard hotel comfortable and good staff Internet no issues using good speed Except no password SORT this out as a priority it s letting you down Free lollipops on reception Don t eat at the small Spanish place next to supermarket opposite hotel It is horrendous a beer there is fine Couple of good restaurants on Diaginal 5 mins from Hotel by the large shopping center 
294444,Arenas Atiram Hotels, The bed was not comfortable and seemed old The breakfast was OK but I might have expected better from a four star hotel The TV did not have international stations as far as I could tell , Good position in Barcelona near a metro but quiet Good staff Basically a four star hotel 
294445,Arenas Atiram Hotels, The hotel was very dated and someone had been smoking in the room previously and it stank of stale cigarette and we were unable to change room , The staff were very nice and helpful 
294446,Arenas Atiram Hotels, Bed wasn t comfy Booked the junior suite and the television was in the living room and couldn t see from the bedroom Price of room increase by the time I was checking out, Location
294447,Arenas Atiram Hotels, Everything The elevator was scary jerked horribly going up or down Rooms were tiny and the air conditioning did not work and even after calling the staff he insisted that it was fine and when we asked why it wasn t cooling he said he could not do anything Asked for fans and was reluctantly given one The coffee tray in rooms was old and expired Some The bathroom lights were not working so the area above the tub was unlit The electric outlet in the wall was open and a posed a hazard near one of the beds We pointed it out to the staff and he was dismissive about it I cannot believe that this hotel was rated as a 4 star hotel it was a ZERO star hotel BOoking Com You have failed dismally shame on you , Nothing
