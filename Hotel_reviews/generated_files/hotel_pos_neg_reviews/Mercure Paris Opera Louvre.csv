262214,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The staff wasn t friendly at all no information were given the English they spoke was horrible and they haven t been helpful many times One of the biggest issues was the bathroom it was small without windows and after taking a shower the whole room was flooded because of the stupid construction All in all a well located hotel which is not worth the required prices , The hotel is very well located and very close to the Opera and the Louvre 
262215,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Room Size and the lift was small Would be good if the hotel did not charge us for bottled water It should be a complimentary item for the guest Special thank you to the new staff who is from Portugal We forgot his name He checked us in on the first day , It was close to transportation and shopping outlets and most of the attractions However the room size was small and with the bags there was very little movement in the room 
262216,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Breakfast was terrible room size was tiny bathroom was way to small you couldn t do anything Couldn t find a space to open my suit case The cleaner just knocks and enters doesn t wait for you to reply was getting out the shower both times , Room was clean
262217,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The lift was very small which would make it difficult for larger pieces of luggage A lack of standard tea bags in the room so we bought our own Cups for tea coffee in the room were small and disposable it would have been preferable to have proper cups rather than thin throw away ones as this was not very environmentally friendly , Very clean and comfortable room Staff friendly and helpful A convenient location a brisk 15 to 20 minute walk to the Louvre Conveniently located for both the metro and local shops and restaurants I would definitely stay here again 
262218,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Service at breakfast time was slow I had to ask for the hot food to be replenished and the fruit juice ran out It was too hot in the dining room area no air conditioning which made eating uncomfortable , Clean comfortable bedroom andcbathroom
262219,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Aircondition did not work at summer Reception promised to get it fixed But this didn t happen Was a very unpleasent night In the morning reception ignored by complains ,No Positive
262220,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The hotel didn t have a bar or restaurant and only a limited breakfast and room service offer The rooms were clean and freshly decorated but they were very small The bed was very small my feet were hanging over the end and I only 5 feet 7 It was also very hard not at all comfortable There was a weird arrangement of bedside tables that came halfway down the bed , The air con worked well original features in the rooms were lovely We liked the giant polar bears 
262221,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Nothing, This was a great location and a brilliant price The hotel rooms are modern but the hotel still has character We really enjoyed our stay The staff were all very friendly and were able to converse in english that was really a nice touch 
262222,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, During check out at 3AM receptionist asked me to pay extra amount which is really strange because hotel was pre paid in advance two month before after discussions that we do not have breakfast in the hotel and we did not used any of other extra services he finally decided that everything is ok BUT I had ordered a taxi and after 5 min waiting driver decide to move on unfortunately taxi charged me for a certain amount of money That s sad that due to that fact I lost some amount of my money and then was obliged to look other taxi which is not so funny at deep night we were use to go to airport , Convenient place close to many key points of interest and subway 
262223,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Overall planning of the staf Everyone was friendly but often too little people Examples Cahotic breakfast and 20 min waiting to checkout due to one single person at the reception during rush hour for checking out, Good breakfast choice Comfortabel bed Location
262224,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, The location was fabulous Ok rooms are small but its Paris and its close to everythibg and the value for money was excellent Loads of great restaurants close buy and walking distance to so much
262225,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, It was a four stars hotel and I expected them to provide toiletries at least like three stars hotels but I had to ask them every day before leaving the hotel that I need to have hair conditioner body lotion etc and they had just this shampoo that you could use as shower gel as well , The location was what I liked the most and the people at the reception were really helpful 
262226,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, My only complaint would be the air conditioning didn t work as well as I would have expected the thermostat made little impact so the room was a bit hot , The rooms lovely and clean and modern Breakfast choices were extensive and quality of food excellent 
262227,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, No toiletries provided no balcony nor terrace pictures were misleading on booking com the lift is so small only two people fit in worse yet lift for under maintenance for over 24 hours meaning my 70 years old mother had to take the stairs to the 3rd floor Prices of food were outrageous 100ml of sparkling water 6 euro Unreal I personally wouldn t recommend this hotel and won t be returning there , Location was good staff was friendly 
262228,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, While the staff was friendly they were unable to help with any concierge services Restaurant suggestions go to the corner Help with tour booking problems no suggestions to help Best way to get to the airport got two completely different answers ,No Positive
262229,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, There was no room service microwave iron spa or gym The hotel was old and also very creepy it reminded me of The Shining There were sounds in the middle of the night and the lights begin to flicker around 12am , I like that the hotel was very clean They vacuumed the halls every day and someone was there to clean the rooms every day as well 
262230,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Room was really small and unable to walk around freely due to layout quite disappointing that I was put in this room as the hotel was extremely quiet and I m sure more convenient rooms were available Unlikely to return due to this reason , Staff were friendly helpful
262231,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, The staff were really nice and accommodating the location was perfect one street from the metro and walking distance to the louvre and opera garnier Really lovely hotel and would definitely recommend
262232,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, I felt the room is kinda warm I just opened the windows to let in some cool air since I m on the fifth floor , The location is very spot on Just a few meters from the hotel you can take the metro Breakfast buffet has a lot of selections to choose from Delicious sausages I might say 
262233,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, If the room has more space to put our stuff from big to small things like if the room has bedside cabinet at least thanks, I like the bfast service and staff very accommodating 
262234,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Wifi wasn t the best as it didn t reach certain parts of the room, Bed was comfortable and the staff were very nice Room was always clean and the location was fantastic
262235,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Foyer area very small and alterations going on but hopefully for the better Room was a bit too warm at night but managed to turn down thermostat a It but could have done with being able to make it a bit cooler , Bed very comfortable very quiet area staff very helpful and friendly especially concierge Could walk to nice restaurants in the evening and to get the hop on and off bus 
262236,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The bed was not the best and linen did not breathe well so nights became quite sticky, Superb location and very quiet at night in the hotel itself Breakfast was also very good
262237,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, We ordered room service one the wine came 15 mins after the food not sure if this was a one off or normal practice for them No hotel facilities no bar spa etc, The rooms looked as expected from the website a little smaller but as expected given the room choice amount paid Great location restaurants bars etc all on your door step the louvre is only a 10 15 min walk away the Eiffel Tower notre dame only a 40 min walk away broken up with a coffee on route didn t seem very far 
262238,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, We ate out as the 19 Euros x2 for breakfast sounded a bit too expensive , we have had a beautiful bedroom 325 with bathroom and toilet separated the twin bed were comfy very quiet inside courtyard The staff was super friendly 
262239,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, Great location clean and modern rooms good value for money quiet hotel It is not the kind of room you want to spend time in all day but if you are just looking for somewhere central and clean to sleep then this is a great wee hotel at a very reasonable price 
262240,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The bedroom is small I expected a bigger room as from the photos , I stayed there with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved the position close to the metro station and at a walkable distance from the main sights The staff is friendly and very kind 
262241,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, It was really cold The room was very cold in the first night we were sleeping with jeans and pulovers and still cold You could see that they did not take care to put the heating considering they knew they would have guests ,No Positive
262242,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, breakfast choices are very limited i get tired of it after a few days i didn t double check my bill when checking out as i was in a rush to the airport but found later on that i was charged twice for laundry at different rate but i only had one laundry service worse is for the only one laundry service i ordered i had 4 clothes for wash but only 1 came back after 36 hours I dropped off before 9AM and usually they should be returned the same day The remaining 3 are still missing spoke with reception after i came back they said that they finally found my 3 missing clothes and would mail it out They said that they will double check my bill and if faux charge of laundry they will reimburse it I waited for another 2 weeks but still haven t seen my clothes or the reimbursement for the 2nd laundry that i never had I sent an email to hotel asking for a tracking number of the package that they sent out containing my clothes and the status on verification of over charge i attached my hotel bill and laundry bill Still no response yet , conveniently located in Paris steps to subway and restaurants 
262243,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, I fell asleep because I took some anti anxiety medication which I m required to take It makes me sleepy I accidentally slept past checkout time and I was totally harassed by the staff management and everyone They stood at the door while I cried and packed and they kept yelling and screaming at me like I was a criminal I had to call my psychiatrist and talk to her on speakerphone They threaten to call the police on me and I told the woman I felt like I was going to have a heart attack I believe she was the manager She told me well we have a defibrillator if you have a heart attack And while they were speaking French I kept hearing them say things about American people And I m American never again, The location that s it
262244,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, When having a shower the water can spray out a bit as the splash glass only covers a little , Location was good easy to get a bus from Gare du Nord station Metro stations close by On the same metro line as a few of main tourist sights Rooms are tight in space but it s a city hotel so to be expected Mini fridge was very handy Bathroom spacious Staff were friendly and would help in what ever way they can 
262245,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Staff no smiling face Need to wait even equire the tiolet location as she is dealing with one client, The staff upgrade us to a three people rooms with single beds provided
262246,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Room could have been a little bigger Bathroom also could be slightly bigger , Hi your hotel room was very cosy Breakfast also catered for all my favourite foods Very good location Very clean and tidy 
262247,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, It s my second time in Paris but first time with Mercure It was a great experience Staffs were very attentive speaking English I would like to thank a young gentleman in the front office sorry I didn t get his name all I know is he needs to travel quite far from home to work everyday and he used to work in Australia and speaking good English he was attentive very friendly and very helpful Thanks to him 
262248,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The Air Conditioning in the room didn t work very well so it would frequently get stuffy and warm , The hotel is in a great location near the sites Paris had to offer It isn t located on a Main Street so there isn t a lot of extraneous noise or traffic The price to quality just can t be beat 
262249,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The area in the immediate vicinity of the hotel had a lot of fast food style places to eat Not many real French restaurants nor any bolangeries for bread or pastries , The reception people all were very nice and accommodating 
262250,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Room was tiny And I mean TINY Externally too the signage was quite bad so we actually walked past the hotel at first as we couldn t see it , Hotel was modern and comfortable
262251,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Lack of bar to unwind after a day s exploring The breakfast room could have been used but it wasn t mentioned that we could go there in evening Just one member of staff working at breakfast so had to ask to clear tables No good morning etc as we arrived for breakfast On the first morning there was also unfortunately a large rowdy group in the beautifully decorated breakfast room who completely took over with their bags that we had to climb over They had no idea their voices were spoiling the ambience Left with a headache Had to ask for hot food to be replenished Sausages looked very undercooked Omelettes made to order would have been a good addition The reception area was very small with only one proper chair people tended to put their bags on it so nowhere to sit while waiting There was room for 4 chairs near the fireplace A bottle of water was 3 Small but adequate room facing side street No hotel restaurant attached , Quiet with a good nights sleep Handy for Metro restaurants and theatres 
262252,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, No major complaints Had to ask for more teabags after the only one was used on first evening the coffee was replaced every day Stayed in a premier room from what I can see not a massive upgrade on normal rooms Would still recommend the hotel though , The location is excellent very central and close to the city centre attractions Room a nice size and bed very comfortable but firm 
262253,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The hotel could offer more in the way of toiletries especially as it is rated as a 4 star There was a big standard squeezy bottle of hair and body wash attached to the wall of the shower something you might expect to find in a travel lodge type hotel The shower screen was also rather bizarre half sized and so the floor got quite wet when showering which wasn t ideal , The hotel had some quirky decor and the staff were friendly and helpful Staff also lent us a travel adaptor plug as we had forgotten ours and after stupidly leaving my passport in the safe when we changed hotels they were more than happy to retrieve it and keep it safe for me until I had chance to go back The hotel was close to many attractions and very close to a metro station also This was a bonus although everywhere in Paris is quite easily accessible via foot or metro 
262254,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Rooms a little small but that s expected for Paris, Location to musee lots of places to eat near to three metro stations Good breakfast and pleasant lounging areas
262255,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, The hotel has a great location that is near to a great choice of bars and restaurants It is situated close to a Metro station that makes travelling to other Paris attractions very easy We stayed in a Privilege room which could not be described as a large room but was very clean and had everything that we needed for our short stay in Paris Staff were friendly and the breakfast was good
262256,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre,No Negative, Perfect location quiet and comfortable room kind and extremely polite service at the reception very good breakfast free newspapers there is really nothing to complain about We spent there 3 nights and we were really satisfied with our choice of the hotel we would stay there once again 
262257,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Mini bar was never adequately stocked from beginning Only 1 bathrobe provided initially Had to ask for another Room was poorly made up for second night Mini bar not stocked no coffee pods creamer or sweeteners replaced Dirty spoons left to be used again I told reception and all we got was coffee pods Had to use my own milk that I purchased I felt this really is unacceptable as we paid for these extras Last time we stayed here we were in a normal room with free breakfast The breakfast was so poorly managed and chaotic that this time we opted to bring our own and make use of the fridge and Nespresso coffee machine however this was difficult for the reasons above The reception staff are very friendly but the housekeeping is very poor I d still recommend this place based on the cleanliness and location but be mindful and don t get the breakfast , Room was spacious modern clean and facilities were great Staff very friendly and helpful
262258,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, No slippers provided available even when we asked front desk Odd for a 4 star hotel Also no bathrobe provided either Also no toiletries provided apart from a 2 in 1 shower gel shampoo But there was a notice saying to ask front desk for it Front desk staff weren t rude but not exactly friendly either for hospitality business No welcome farewell greeting Pleasant though if you asked them something directly , Clean comfortable room Perhaps small tight getting around the bed from the window but didn t mind as room looked newly renovated and modern Relatively big bathroom with modern updated fixtures Twin beds are pretty close together but seems twin rooms are commonly setup like this in Paris Beds were comfy Free wifi was great had no connection issues Complimentary bottle of water offered which is a nice surprise Double glass windows Had street side room and was pretty quiet on 2nd floor 
262259,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Hotel has a policy of not changing towels if they are left hanging but not all staff has been trained to leave the towels Our towels were changed so no funds went to planting trees ,No Positive
262260,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Good location for shopping but not teally dor tourist sites Not on a convienient metro line for tourist sites and nonexperienced metro users Complimentary water on arrival but not daily and only one bottle for a two guest room , Great size room and bathroom for paris Recently refurbished Good size fridge and cold Good size closet and safe Great amber light large tv Straight off a metro line 
262261,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, The lift is too small and very slow Avoid taking the car as parking is VERY expensive I wasn t impressed with the location, The rooms are of a comfortable size and in good order The hotel is fairly quiet 
262262,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, there should me more options in breakfast esp more for veg Also the hotel should keep some more landmark or board signs on road inside a road it is difficult to locate at least for day 1 of your arrival , Staff was too good and will assist you in everything My very special thanks to mr Cedric and ms Kelly From morning to end of their shift always v supportive Luv you guys
262263,Mercure Paris Opera Louvre, Nothing A perfect stay , We chose a privilege room because we wanted the extra space Paris hotel rooms are small compared to Australian standards The hotel room and its facilities were clean comfortable and modern in furnishings and fittings The staff were friendly and helpful We had a short stay in Paris two nights and wanted to be close to the shopping district and the Louvre so this hotel in the Grande Boulevard area suited our purposes perfectly
