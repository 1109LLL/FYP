495598,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, We could hear the odd rumble from metro and car horns on occasions but our room was closer to the road and it didn t bother us much at all , Friendly and helpful receptionist The relaxing Turkish bath and spa was a nice surprise and a great location The hotel is located very close to Garibaldi Station perfect for travelling between France and Italy Milano Centrale is close by as well for travel to Venice etc plenty of restaurants nearby We had an early 6am train so 10 mins walk to station was perfect Excellent hotel 
495599,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Horrible hotel Everything starting from very unpleasant staff very uncomforatble shower small room was awful SPA center is working till 7 or 8 p m wich is very inconvenient because you want to relax in the pool or sauna after a long day of stolling around the city The shower in our first room was broken so we had to pack our luggage move to another room without any help because the receptionist couldn t here the phone call for 10 minutes and then unpack again And no apologise If it ought to have been so Will never recomend this hotel and never stay in any hotel of the chain again ,No Positive
495600,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Staff was very welcoming and professional Breakfast was great and healthy loved it Even thought of vegan people Hotel is walking distance from a metro and only 3 stops from Duomo It is also near Centrale Station approx 15min walk 
495601,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Staff were very very helpful and friendly They went out of their way to help us with planning for our shopping trip and train trip We had a great stay 
495602,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, There was no view at all from the room We were looking onto a brick wall The reception took about 5 10 mins each time to be served , The rooms were clean and quiet thought there was no view at all The location was excellent just a short stroll into the main centre but this part of town had plenty to offer in terms of places to eat and drink 
495603,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Best service and staff We had a problem with our booked room so the staff made sure we have an exceptional stay at the hotel upgraded us to the best room at the hotel I would recommend this hotel as restaurants shops are walking distance and the room views are amazing 
495604,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Breakfast was served very late and so we could only grab a quick cake it should have started at 7 00 but was ready until nearly 7 30 We paid for something that wasn t provided Perhaps 7 00 is still late as many other hotels start serving breakfast at 6 30 for guests needing to catch early trains, Reception staff very helpful Air conditioning was very welcoming Location good for trains
495605,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, the room on 2 floors but I do not spend much time there and the back side rooms do not have much light, really good location calm and central and some air around parks the front desk personnel antoniella is really great and helpfull and the room was really nicely decorated very relaxing the terace for breakfast is georgious
495606,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Everything was great , The breakfast was very good with fresh and warm bread every morning a good variety of fruits cheese juices fresh cooked eggs on order The room was comfortable The receptionists very helpful and welcoming There is a very nice terrace with bars pleasant to enjoy the sun with an Apero Spritz 
495607,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Nothing , On arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and spacious Clean modern room with everything you need and comfy beds They have a parking service so you can just drive up to the hotel and they will park your car for you By far the best breakfast we ve had in Italy with lots of fresh fruit and eggs made to order Lovely terrace outside for afternoon or late night drinks and the building itself is gorgeous Friendly staff great WiFi Good restaurants and bars within walking distance About 25 minutes walking away from Milan s main square Overall highly recommended 
495608,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Lovely hotel about 30 mins walk to duomo but an interesting one past lots of eateries shops and fabulous Milan Very close to train and tram if you don t want to walk Lots going on close by as well Rooms modern and functional Front of house staff were a a delight and very efficient Breakfast was good as well Would definitely stay again 
495609,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Breakfast is so poor we came down at 9 30 a there was nothing to eat no vegetables no water just 10 empty bootles nothing for a room that cost 200 per nigth i expecting lot more The room we got was in attic with only roof window the bathroom is 1m2 for that price a little too much ,No Positive
495610,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Room service could be improved the spa was small and sometimes noisy, A lot of choice for vegans and vegetarians at breakfast and dinner staff was very friendly and nice
495611,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Free internet was worthless so I paid 9 90 euro for Swisscom hi speed connection Even this connection was really bad Upload speed was 1 7mb sec and download speed about the same It s a shame they asked 9 90 euro 12 hours for this service , Great breakfast great choice friendly staff nice lounge area
495612,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, but in some standard rooms the bathrooms ar really small and not very comfortable and you should know that on weekends you must select a room in the right wing of the hotel as there is a dance club next to the hotel on the left side with incredibly loud music until early morning you won t be able to sleep , as i have been guest in this hotel quite a few time you might guess that i am generally very satisfied with the hotel finally the spa is ready and the restaurant and bar are also working at night 
495613,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Very bad and unprofessional staff The temperature in the room was extremely hot and you couldn t fix it The bed was uncomfortable , The hotel is next to corso Como area which is great for shopping and food 
495614,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, One particular member of staff at reception was really not helpful at all when asking about stations She told me to get a taxi and completely ignored my initial question Our initial room had faeces on the toilet seat and back cover The sink was also overplugged We managed to change rooms, One member of staff who changed our room when we told her about the faeces on the bak seat of the toilet and our sink being overplugged
495615,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Booked 3 superior double rooms but they were very small congested I m sorry to say my bathroom had stains around the wash area on the wall that was not cleaned previously toilet was stained and shower had black mould was very disappointed If a toilet was flushed in another room you could hear the eco in the room Just glad we only spent one night here , Have to commend NH Group for the excellent staff Once again they were very helpful hotel location is in a quieter part of Milan Location is near the train station and shops which makes it very convenient to transit 
495616,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Mrs Erika is one of the best Congierge I ever meet on my travels and I use to travel a lot Nice small hotel with a cozy little spa The Pigmy Gym can be upgraded for sportaholic clients but fortunately virgin corso come it s really close 5min by foot 
495617,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, The standard room was quite small so not enough space for clothes suitcase to be out The bathroom was in the bedroom with a frosted glass wall and sliding door so if your partner gets up in the night and puts the light on the whole bedroom is lit up too , Friendly and helpful staff and a great breakfast Comfortable bed 
495618,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, The shower is very inconvenient the water goes all over the place Also each time we were asking the reception to bring us something it would take them ages to do so The room was a bit dusty and the toilet area really needs a cleaning because the walls do not look fresh as well as shower and sink were yellowish, Friendly staff
495619,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Location was very good for restaurants bars and Stazione Garibaldi Breakfast was good Room was good I liked the grand architecture of the outside contrasting with the modern interior 
495620,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Style of function in the room Lovely room but more thought needed on practicality A useable plug by the bed would be good The overhead light was so low I banged my head on it , Staff were lovely and very helpful Great location for a wonder into the centre
495621,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Prefer standard size croissants to the bite size provided I found the bathroom far too small and with no shelf for toiletries etc The shower was difficult to control for temperature My wife thought the bathroom was fine , The location within 10 minutes walk of the Stazione was ideal Breakfast good in most respects but see opposite Excellent lift Bed very good Prosecco on arrival appreciated and also wine snacks in room 
495622,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Not much of an atmosphere You can only order drinks from the bar after 6pm Standard room is super tight No complimentary conditioner in the bathroom Mini bar selection is basic no spirits I lost my wallet on the plane to Milan something to soften the blow would ve been nice , Nice hotel Great location 2 minutes from corso come 10 minutes from brera so about 20 minutes to duomo Very clean hotel Rooms are decent Free bicycle hire is also a great way do traveling Very helpful staff 
495623,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Good choice for breakfast Staff very amenable arrived for breakfast early so not everything out but when we asked it was brought straight away Hotel very convenient to Porta Garibaldi train station Good choice of restaurants in near vicinity 
495624,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Friendliness and helpfulness of staff was excellent Good choice at breakfast Offered an upgrade when we arrived and given a welcome glass of prosecco 
495625,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Trendy breakfast choice fancy pastries fruits and juices Friendly helpful staff Ahmed out himself out to sort out our parking Attic room in modernised ancient building great 
495626,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, We were put in a box room with tiny Windows so there was no light at all And the automatic blinds were impossible to work , The staff was extremely helpful and it is a beautiful hotel located right beside train stations and tram lines 
495627,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, It is a walk to the duomo but lots of great places to eat and drink on that walk into town You can catch a train nearby the metro is great , Probably best breakfast we have had at an Italian hotel Staff are friendly Good location near Garibaldi station We booked a superior so had lots of room Beautiful old palazzo Near eatitaly 
495628,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Maybe more of a view as we were on the top storey and had small dorm like Windows The room I couldn t fault otherwise , The breakfast included in the price was truly amazing so much variety 
495629,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Small room less amenities and the worst is extremely slow Internet connection through Hotel Wifi, Small Boutique hotel with Warm and helpful staff especially the Bell Boy who is giving good recommendation on exploring Milan and Restaurant staff who is serving Breakfast
495630,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Location not great 25 minute walk to the square and shopping centre The Dome There were no tea and coffee facilities in the room or bath robes which considering the price to stay I found hard to believe The staff were ok but not overly obliging We had to move rooms as we were invaded by ants which were crawling all over the floor and bed We discovered that the large window door in our room could not close properly this allowed the ants to gain access , Liked the modern decor 
495631,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, During our stay there was construction work happening in a building opposite this meant there was loud drilling noises at 7 30am which affected our sleep In addition the toilet was too close to the bed and did not have a proper door that could shut as it had a sliding door instead Perhaps it would have been better to put the toilet either upstairs or round the corner away from the bed , The room size was good and the bar area was lovely The walk to the Duomo was about 25 minutes and we passed lots of lovely restaurants and shops The location was great for us 
495632,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, The location was not the most convenient we had a bit of a walk to most things Worth the trade off for the price and great people , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The property was very nice with a modern interior 
495633,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, No safe facilities in Some of the rooms Variable tea and coffee facilities from room to room that we booked Leaky shower in 1 room reported but nobody fixed this during our stay of 3 nights Bar closing at 11pm , Breakfast had a good variety and the sweets water and espresso available all day was a nice treat Staff were friendly and welcoming The breakfast staff were great and dealt with our group of 12 brilliantly Location was great right round the corner from good bars restaurants and corsa como Try out Thai gallery authentic Thai food 
495634,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Room is unbelievably small no space for anything no wardrobe hard bed might not be to everybody s liking , Staff are fab go out of their way to help 
495635,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, When I left there was a rude person at the desk who made the check out He was rude to me for no reason to the point that it made the morning uncomfortable The room had some ware and tear also although this was acceptable though and not too bad , The reception desk staff was very helpfull and polite as I arrived The room was very itneresting and also quite comfortable including the bed The breakfast was continental but unusually high quality 
495636,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Loud traffic outside form before function had the suite but could only watch TV from the bed not from the the sofa bad with plugs at the desk no hot food for breakfast not many restaurants close to the hotel , Helpful staff 
495637,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, I think the toiletries should include cotton buds and cotton wool And a vase should accompany the free bouquet , The breakfast is awesome The staff lovely 
495638,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Nothing, Fantastic location near Corso Como The staff couldn t have been more helpful and gracious It was such a pleasure to stay in such s well run comfortable hotel 
495639,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, For some reason the soap was only one piece and they did not put any more during my 5 day stay I could have asked for it at reception unfortunately I noticed it each evening only when I washed my hands and face and it was not very convenient to go for soap so I used shower gel and hoped to receive it the next day but in vain , I wanted for pancakes listed in the menu but they were not available that week So I asked if it is possible to try them next day and personnel did their best so I did try them I also liked that they have porrige in the breakfast menu which is unusual but really good 
495640,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova,No Negative, Well located between Milan Garibaldi and Milan Central stations and at the edge of the Brera District Courteous staff good breakfast well designed rooms culinary delights within walking distance 
495641,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, No own parking but there is a parking area with 24 service next to the hotel they offer discount to the hotel guests I d expect from a 4 hotel to offer a free bottle of water in the room , Good location on walking distance from city center Close to main station only 15 minutes by car to Milano Linate My room was clean nice bathroom Bed very confortable You will like how the hotel looks like in dark it is really nice Staff was very nice and helpfull I like the morning service coffee something to drink and small snack if you leave early in the morning before breakfast The night shift receptionist was very nice The small conversationh we had made my morning fine 
495642,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Shower was a little bit difficult to operate , Great location with restaurants and shops really close We walked to all the major tourist attractions but it took all day so you have to like walking The staff were excellent and the breakfast excellent 
495643,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Small rooms, Specklessly neat and tidy breakfast was good We stayed a couple of days in Milan and stayed in this hotel on our last day in order to catch an early morning train from Milano Porta Garibaldi to Paris 
495644,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Room size I understand that I booked a standard sigle room I got assigned to a room that hadn t even a table or a chair For business travelling a workstation no matter how small is essential When i asked for a different room the reception claimed the hotel was full typical response and i suggested that they bring a table to my room since there was enough space Very shortly afterwards the room service came with a small furniture and no chair I had to sit on the bed bringing the furniture close which by the way was so short i had to duck to type on the keyboard of my laptop Mold on the bathroom Unbelievably low water pressure Impossible to take a shower , Staff friendliness Very good breakfast with wide selection Location close to metro and reastaurants 
495645,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Next door to Disco lot of street noise in the back alley We were in room 101 so needing ear plugs to sleep , If you like to walk perfectly located to start your city trip in Milan 30 minutes to Duomo 15 to Brera 
495646,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Nothing much not too like in this place it is on the high side but clean and modern only thing is the tooms were too small and no complementary water, The location was good hotel was clean The rooms are quite small but the staff were helpful and very kind
495647,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, The room was so small that I couldn t even open my suitcase properly They were rude when I asked for a travel adapter to charge my computer I was traveling with an American power plug Not willing to help at all , The receptionist that greeted me at my arrival Breakfast 
495648,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, Unfortunately the breakfast experience was somewhat haphazard although the food was good quality and fresh there were not enough staff resulting in nowhere to sit because tables were left uncleared and waiting some time for hot drinks , The hotel is a lovely old building which has been restored with a nice terrace at the front The rooms are clean and pleasant if a little simple but be wary of getting a 4th Floor bedroom as this has only skylights and no window the staff were more than happy to change the room but it could be made clearer on the website The area is okay there are some reasonable restaurants and a quite lively area at night nearby but it is a little far walk to the centre trains and trams are available though 
495649,NH Milano Palazzo Moscova, The 5 nights stay here is the biggest disappointment of this trip First night we checked in around 8 but a very bad suite reserved for us it s close to the elevator noisy dark and also poor utility in the bathroom Second day the room is changed to higher floor with better quality to the room fee but the AC really not working properly Every time reported to the receptionist there s no proper reaction and every time a bell boy who can t even understand English is always sent up to us what this s the quality of a suite room worth over almost 300Euro a night Though at the end the handsome manager gave us a total room fee discount 200Euro but still can buy a very satisfied trip back to us In a word there s no 2nd time re visit I m very sorry about this , The location breakfast wifi are the only 3 things we can say OK for this hotel
