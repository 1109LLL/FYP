231734,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Lots of sex shops but I felt totally safe Just not an environment I would take children however in saying that there were families staying at the hotel, It was a great location for us The metro was at the front door The little train out the front for 6 it was a return trip up to the wonderful Montmartre A few restaurants were about Easily accessible Very very very secure 1st floor is reception and there is also a very comfortable place to st if you wasn t time out Wifi was great no problems at all And 1st floor also supply s a free coffee machine for tea and hot chocolate too
231735,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Needed an extra chair in the balcony so two people can sit , Close to Public transport and car parking Lively area just metres from Moulin Rouge Friendly staff Views of the Eiffel Tower and a small but functional balcony Modern facilities 
231736,Hotel Le Chat Noir, It should be mentioned that this property is in the red light district of Paris A lot of sex stores and strip clubs around the property It is not the right property for families ,No Positive
231737,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, One of the aspects was the female receptionist she was so friendly helpful and pleasant The hotel is cool very comfortable and lovely products in the bathroom Great location 
231738,Hotel Le Chat Noir, We knew exactly what to expect of the area i e Pigalle but if you don t be aware that it gets pretty seedy at night It was very warm outside over 30 Celsius and the air con on high was barely keeping up , Friendly staff well trained to accommodate guests which is not always the case in a city like Paris Comfy beds Very good value for money 
231739,Hotel Le Chat Noir, No fridge in rooms Rooms are too small, I liked the location and staff the only poor thing is that there is no fridge in rooms Rooms are clean but small 
231740,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Room was small Many sex shops nearby But the sad thing is that we were robbed at the metro when leaving the hotel heading to the airport If I could give an advice do not take the metro if you are with luggage Get a cab or an Uber to go to the hotel from the airport or vice versa It is not worth it for the price and safety There were about 5 girls around 14 15 years old that entered with us in metro and distracted us You could not tell that they were willing to get your money They got my husbands wallet and all the money that was inside Watch your belongings in Paris ,No Positive
231741,Hotel Le Chat Noir, i was disappointing from the first day i came to this hotel they gave me the room that i didn t reserved and they say we are sorry how that come My friends slept on the floor Don t stay at this area specially for family its full of bad people and fraud , only clean
231742,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The AC didn t work during the stay so it wasn t as comfortable , Great location less than 2 minute walk to the metro Lively area with lots of cafes and restaurants Big bathroom and comfortable room 
231743,Hotel Le Chat Noir, A bit noisy outside as it is directly on Rue Clichy Sleeping with open window thus not possible , Perfectly located at Montmartre very close to Rue Abesses with its brasseries and Caf s Very friendly staff 
231744,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The ground floor lobby was a little smelly probably from the street so not much the hotel could do about that , The view from the top floor was amazing Our room 802 had a little balcony overlooking the rooftops of Paris and the Eiffel Tower 
231745,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, Great friendly English speaking staff modern room with an excellent bathroom a spacious elevator luxury in Paris and great bedding and service Excellent location too a few steps off Blvd de Clichy but facing a quiet street Oh and there is a nice restaurant bar downstairs 
231746,Hotel Le Chat Noir, A minibar or fridge Also room at times was too hot due to slow effect of air conditioning, Really liked the bathroom Room was quiet considering the lively area and comfortable
231747,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The outside entrance door handle should be cleaned It was sticky and disgusting Gave wrong first impression , Beautifully decorated and lovely staff Excellent location for transport and for walk to sacre coer 
231748,Hotel Le Chat Noir, My friends warned me that Montmartre had become touristy I wasn t expecting to be staying in a Red Light District however If that bothers you just be aware , I spent my birthday here They gave me a free upgrade to a two story apartment overlooking the Eiffel Tower The only place during my three week trip The Netherlands France and Italy where I had access to a bathtub I indulged in a bubble bath The hotel is beautifully decorated The staff were so helpful with Metro directions I also had to leave on an early morning train and the overnight clerk encouraged me to pack a breakfast to go and generously pushed foid on me to take He even helped me make a cup of tea to go 
231749,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Did not understand if there was a temperature regulator somewhere Anyway it was a bit too warm at night , Everything was excellent Room is big looks new excellent location At first a bit intimidating neighbourhood but the hotel is normal is not meant only for couples with nocturnal activities 
231750,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Breakfast was not good enough organize Dirty dishes on tables , Great location and funny design very friendly reception personel Amazing location so near to Moulin Rouge Clichy and metro Couldn t be better 
231751,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The safe was not working in our room The coffee was bad This district is not recommended for families with children as this district is filled with sex shops gentleman clubs strip clubs sex toy shops I would not recommend this hotel to families or girls who are traveling alone , The hotel was situated at the heart of MontMartre district which is lively because of its relation to french painters sitting all over this district and painting in front of you This district use to have all the famous painters writers poets so it s popular Moulin Rouge is across the traffic light Hotel rooms are remodeled and new Beds are clean and comfortable There is a safe in the room Hotel staff will book everything for you and help with everything such as reserving shuttle to airport showing you exactly how to use metro bus to get to places you want to go They will reserve opera louvre museum tickets Anything you like they will arrange it for you 
231752,Hotel Le Chat Noir, decor needs updated room was on boulevard so you could hear cars at night not the best area at night, big room with modern bathroom girl at reception was friendly
231753,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Black out curtains didn t fully cover the window which was unfortunate as there was a spotlight right outside , Nice view comfy bed Very close to multiple metro stops 
231754,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The location is a little intimidating for a girl Sex shops and shady characters The entrance elevator smelled bad , The bed was comfortable and the shower was great 
231755,Hotel Le Chat Noir, High audibility of the street and neighbours no robs and slippers no hair conditioner no mini bar bad wifi in the room no tooth set at the reception One power socket exactly which i needed of course didn t work The girl which made my check out was rude and unpleasant with me because i wanted to pay by my husband s bank card which i made my reservation on booking com with By the way you should have your own card or cash to pay there They don t accept any other options, Room view and mini sound system for your device
231756,Hotel Le Chat Noir, This is in the middle of the Red Light District of Paris may not be suitable for young families , Very close to some of the main Paris sites Access to the Metro and loads of bars and restaurants 
231757,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The hotel was situated in a red light of Paris sex shop below hotel and porn cinemas and sex shops every where you looked as we had children in our group this didn t sit well with us you should have known this area and flagged it not suitable for families, The Hotel was clean 
231758,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Breakfast not included and quite expensive tv wasn t able to put in English or had english subtitles , The staff was very attentive they supply you with still bottled water good location NOT for families PERFECT for couples buffee breakfast with local products 
231759,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, I stayed at Chat Noir with my sister for one night The hotel is very centrally located and we could get an underground train to anywhere we wanted to from just across the street The staff was extremely helpful with transport from the airport and again to the Central Station The breakfast was very nice We will definitely be back one day 
231760,Hotel Le Chat Noir, There are a lot of cheats on the street where the hotel is They try to take advantage of the guests visiting , The staff in the hotel was genuinely helpful and pleasant 
231761,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, My second stay at the hotel Rooms are extremely clean and neat Bathrooms are faultless 2 minute walk to the metro Blanche and Moulin rouge is just around the corner Hotel is a convenient place to stay and the area is safe too a lot of people around at all times Would definitely stay at the hotel if we were in Paris again Thank you 
231762,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The room was a bit to warm and it smelled to much of cleaning products , Good located close to the Metro nice staff okay breakfast good shower and a very good bed 
231763,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Walls are quite thin and I could my neighbours voices and music Air conditioning was noisy , Clean and comfortable efficiently run and located in easy place for access to public transport for exploring Paris 
231764,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, The lady in the reception polite halpful shes great the corner room i stayed comfort its one of the best rooms i like in the hotel le chat noiar is our home in paris will be back
231765,Hotel Le Chat Noir, the size of the room was very small and quite cramped for a couple sharing , The hotel was easy to find and in a good location with everything being easily accessible 
231766,Hotel Le Chat Noir, WI FI not working at least at the time we were at the hotel Please fix it , The restaurant Chat Noir is very nice and offers often live music in the evening Tasty burgers 
231767,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The lighting in our room was a little dim for reading and the TV channels didn t have any english channels and we couldn t change the subtitles either , Spacious modern good location The jazz club next door was brilliant Balcony was a nice bonus and we could see the Eiffel Tower in the distant The staff were very attentive 
231768,Hotel Le Chat Noir, We were not aware the hotel was in the red light district and were surprised by all the sex adult shops One of them next door to the hotel , Nice designer fittings and fixtures modern and comfortable Great site history Walking distance to Blanche station and bus lines 
231769,Hotel Le Chat Noir, I felt the rooms did not meet the level a four star design hotel should have It looked more like an upgraded youth hostel , Staff was friendly 
231770,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The rooms needed better more modern lighting The lamps could be unified The walls could have used some nice art work to uplift the atmosphere of the very dark rooms The black carpet was just too dark The location eliminates this as a family hotel by any means The area is just not appropriate for families The sidewalks and surrounding area should be better maintained , Staff was extremely friendly and helpful The hotel was clean and the bathrooms were nicely done The breakfast lounge was nice and the staff were fantastic The hotel itself is decent the area it is located in is not 
231771,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, Staff were really helpful Had 2 full busy working days and was able to leave my luggage there on top of it when picking it up was able to chill in the lounge waiting for the time to catch my train back home using their internet That hour spent there helped me rest to continue my long trip Absolutely recommend 
231772,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Although they called it a design hotel the decoration is very dated The hotel is comfortable but is not a design hotel in case someone cares about it , The locations is very good and the bathroom is spacious and with a good shower 
231773,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The rooms are on the smaller side but enough for a short stay As I was alone as well there was enough place to store my luggage For two however it would be quite cosy , The staff was really friendly And the location is perfect I really like the district with all the little bistros and cafes 
231774,Hotel Le Chat Noir, as we checked in on 18 July 16 and we find the a c of the room not working properly and we asked the hotel to change the room but they say there is no more twin bed room but it s showing in booking com And no wifi in the room we have to go in the lobby to connect to the wifi Also there is no safe box in the room too so how come the rating of this hotel is 4 star , Location only
231775,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Certainly not 4 star no facilities not even tea coffee making or fridge and very noisy Bad value even for Paris charging extra for breakfast really poor Wont be back, Location
231776,Hotel Le Chat Noir, If I just had a kettle in our room to have a cuppa after a long day out I would have been extremely happy , Nice comfortable room good to escape to after a busy day exploring Paris Second floor a little noisy but did not keep us awake Ate breakfast out but only by choice to go exploring Very busy area pretty much next to the Rouge but quiet in the mornings Good location with the train at the door 
231777,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Couldn t fault them on anything, We received a warm welcome all the staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was delicious Good selection of foods our ro was clean and comfortable with a lovely shower
231778,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, Lovely hotel welcoming staff great location perfect for Moulin Rouge and Montmatre will recommend to our happy travellers group in Brisbane Australia 
231779,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, Everything was fine Clean basic room on 7th floor Kind personnel We didn t have breakfast because nearby is many bakery with fantastic baguette sandwiches and croissants Many bistros 650 m to Sucre Cure 200 m to metro Blanche or Pigalle Very good value for money 405 euro for 4 night 
231780,Hotel Le Chat Noir, You pay for 4 star hotel but this one does not feel like 4 star hotel The bed is not good enough The safe did not work No mini bar Trouble with the wifi And the staff was not helpful as one would expect at a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
231781,Hotel Le Chat Noir, No english tv channels that worked, Great location right near moulin rouge one young man on reception that usually worked during the day was so helpful and polite room was nice view of the eiffel tower
231782,Hotel Le Chat Noir, There was a smell off sewerage in the reception area which was obviously coming from just outside we did comment on this but it didn t become apparent through out the rest of the hotel The area around the hotel at night time is a place where you need to be wary It s right in the middle of a strip of sex shops which is fine but we did see a few unsavoury characters so we were careful with our belongings This said there is some lovely cafes bars nearby too so it s beautiful during the day , The bed was super comfy We had a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower over the rooftops from our room Everything we asked for we got Easy access to an iron and Wi Fi codes when ever we needed them The room was very very clean and tidy The hotel is also very close to lots of metro stations and we found it incredibly easy to get around and see the sights 
231783,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Nothing Everything was perfect , Excellent Hotel A Super clean Modern Tripple bed Room on 6th floor extremely helpful Professional friendly smartly dressed staff Front reception desk manned 24 7 Allowing us 3 ladies to feel safe The Hotel was in the middle of the sex district with sex shops sex parlours sex shows either side and we thought the hotel might b a bit seedy BUT OMG it WASNT it was BRILLIANT We choose this hotel because it had good reviews and mainly because our Sons who are in a band were performing at a venue less than 5 min walk away us mums wanted to b able to let our boys have a quick shower b4 their performance as the band are touring around Europe in a tour bus The hotel manager said it was no problem letting our boys shower chill out in our room pre and post show before they left traveling on to Nantes France that same evening The Staff were so helpful regarding all Tourist information as the next day was our mums on tour lol Siteseeing day 
231784,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The room seemed poorly kept damaged walls and plinthes no shower cap in the shower and no mini toothpaste Shame for a 4 star hotel, Extra comfy bed and good breakfast very nice staff 
231785,Hotel Le Chat Noir, No tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms Only one uncomfortable chair even though it was a twin room The immediate area around the hotel does not feel particularly pleasant , Comfortable beds and the bathroom very nice The room was very clean and even though the hotel is on a very busy street it was very quiet Extremely convenient for taking the metro Good value for money but not convinced of the 4 star rating 
231786,Hotel Le Chat Noir, This is a two star hotel masquerading as a four star Small overheated rooms Dodgy wi fi No minibar Nowhere to sit unless you favour a sort of stool that had obviously escaped from the bar of a local cabaret The breakfast room was closed for refurbishment so le petit dejeuner had to be eaten in the room with the tray dumped on the bed because the only table was too small and attached to a contraption that looked like it had failed pole dancing school Memo to proprietor you need more than a breakfast room upgrade to justify your stars unless they are small red dwarves , Very friendly helpful staff 
231787,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Unfresh smell in the lobby and elevator Size of rooms crampy double rooms and bathroom Slow internet Expensive Didnt see really much design A bit too close to the many sex shops and sex live shows , Breakfast was great but costs extra Ok bed comfort Friendly personnel Good location close to montmartre sacre coeur place tetre restaurant street Lepic and of course moulin rouge 
231788,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Boulevard de Clichy is not the nicest street in Paris but just a few blocks away you can find Montmartre area and many nice restaurants , Very friendly staff Modern rooms and great breakfast Metro stop just 50m away from the hotel 
231789,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Disposable plastic cups are really not good enough for a room described as deluxe Having to re register every day for wi fi is tedious The bathroom looks very smart but isn t very practical , In walking distance of Gare du Nord the hotel is well located for exploring the Montmartre area with metro close by when you want to go further afield Don t be put off by the sleezy tone of the area It s safer than it looks and becomes very chic a few steps uphill Staff are helpful and friendly and the rooms comfortable Complimentary bottled water is a nice idea 
231790,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The bad thing rooms not soundproof When your sleeping u can hear to mutch door shuts we always prefer rooms with 601or 603 its less noisy , The best is the pregnent lady on reception shes always there to help and smile bad is comfert
231791,Hotel Le Chat Noir, From appearance and service the hotel seems more a medium quality 3 stars hotel than a 4 stars Location is well connected but not a classy area of Paris Apart the sexy shops at the entrance of the surrounding lap dance bars personnel is very pushy in inviting you in The interior of the hotel is oldish for the common areas Internet connection was practically useless and just cause of frustration Complained several times to staff but they were already aware of the connectivity issue and could take no action Outside is very noisy also at late hours In general I would not recommend the hotel since in my previous stays in the city I enjoyed much better comfort and at lower prices ,No Positive
231792,Hotel Le Chat Noir,No Negative, THis hotel has a lovely staff is tres chic has a yummy breakfast and is a thirty second walk from the Moulin Rouge Lovely stay View of Eiffel tower Huge value 
231793,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The only thing I didnt like was the fact that we had to leave , I booked this hotel for my girlfriend as a surprise for her 22nd birthday and she was absolutely amazed with the place The staff were really helpful and polite 
231794,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Next to Moulin Rouge not the nicest area of Paris Arrived at the hotel rang the doorbell but nobody opened the door Took like 10 mins before I could get into the hotel , Nice overall room 
231795,Hotel Le Chat Noir, The night receptionist made my partner feel like a prostitute The way he acted was un acceptable The fact that he didnt know his guests wasnt our problem the key was left for her with the receptionist in the afternoon and the messages were either not passed on or the evening receptionist didnt listen We will never stay here again, Not much really I liked the location as it was close to Montmarte but most of the cafes are over priced and offer very ordinary food and coffee
231796,Hotel Le Chat Noir, A bit of noise from a nearby restaurant meaning sleeping with windows close Wifi needed persistion to connect, The staff were brilliant and held with directions I fell over I was sober not in the hotel but provided good first aid
231797,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Everything was amazing apart from our shower head was missing but this wasn t a problem as there we 2 showers Also may have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room , Fantastic location close to the metro and very easy to get around the city Deluxe double room was laid out beautifully with romantic package including rose petals champagne and macaroons with a balcony on the room and fantastic Eiffel Tower view perfect as this trip was our honeymoon Staff were amazing and very helpful 
231798,Hotel Le Chat Noir, Nothing, The Staff Jessica was cute and the others at the reception were bravo class Room and Toilet 100 if you are doing the 11pm night show at Moulin Rougue perfect pit stop Restaurants galore
