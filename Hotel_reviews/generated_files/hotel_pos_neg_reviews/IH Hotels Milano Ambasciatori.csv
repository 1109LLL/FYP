325890,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The carpet near the bathroom was completely wet and the staff were reluctant to change the room for us It turns out the shower design means is very easy for most of the rooms to have wet carpet , The location
325891,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Building and furniture is a little dated but remodeling probably isn t worth the investment Bathroom was too small for two people to use at the same time Other rooms might have been more updated , Good value for money Great location near the Duomo heart of downtown Milano Access to TV stations with many languages Friendly staff 
325892,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, The hotel is in the center of the city And it s inside the walking street So it s really perfect for shopping and traffic Room is quiet and clean I really like it and recommend it

325894,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I have booked this hotel based on my previous stay which was great and room was very nice and it was renovated I had no idea that there are old rooms which are so tinny and not comfortable at the same price I have complained at the reception they told they will move us but at the end did nothing Not very proactive team Also internet was not working during my stay at all Disappointing stay , Lady that worked during breakfast time was very nice and helpful 
325895,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, Location so close to the cathedral was our main reason for choosing the hotel It is very tidy and easy to get to The breakfast selection as just right to start off on the day as eating out in Milan can be expensive 
325896,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The floor of the wet room didn t direct all the water back to the show so ran out to the main bathroom , The suite was very comfortable and tremendously spacious highly modern and quiet The bathroom with walk in wet room shower was vast Didn t use the sofa tv room but the open plan layout of the entire suite works well Very well located for Milan Cathedral museums are nearby as are plenty of shops and restaurants 
325897,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The staff wasn t really friendly at any time There also seem to be different room types renovated pnes and old ones with quite a different standard , You can t beat the location just next to the Duomo and two metro stations amazing

325899,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The only minor is that the small flat tv stays on the desk so you can see only on the right side of the bed not centrally But who is watching the tv in Milan , A really good 4 star hotel behind the Cathedral in the Galleria del Corso Friendly receptionists superior room on the 5th floor quiet adequate size comfortable bed kettle The bathroom was smaller Good breakfast with different juices scrambles eggs salami croissant etc The receptionist a young woman recommended us a good restaurant nearby 
325900,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Quiet not interfering barely noticeable remodeling was in progress on upper level Didn t sway opinion of the place especially for great room rate likely on that account , Skip eggs perfect of course We talking Ambasciadori here Breakfast sumptuous hard to try it all in one day no prompting for starting late for you know reasons Perfect espresso but Duomo Piazza awaits Noiseless staff buon giorno notte on all occasions Rooms w o comment perfect not much to say one can always complain about noise from Duomo cathedral close to hotel Single bell with slow grave tone v rarely used welcomed when heard Excellent location for La Scala and rest of Milano 
325901,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Slow drains in both sink and tub and when addressed issue no resolution Very stained and old looking carpet in hallways , The location was the best part
325902,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I have no complaints, Central location to the centre of Milan The Concierge Antonio was very caring My daughter was not well and he was very helpful with luggage and refreshments during our wait for the car to take us to the airport We only had time for a brief breakfast however the food looked fresh and well laid out During the evening we went to the bar Antonio was an excellent host and looked after us very well with antipasti and our drinks Italian hospitality at its best 
325903,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, It was very cold in the room and in the bathroom Old radiators in the room and in the bathroom were cold Temperature regulator didn t work You should wait in the cold bathroom while water very slowly starts to be warmer and it takes too long Shower equipment is old and doesn t work properly and water stream is very weak Hair dryer is absolutely old fashion and very weak could fit only for museum The price 134 euro per night for single room was too high for such poor facilities , Good location Nice hotel Good breakfast kind ladies in the breakfast room 
325904,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Finding the right place to park was challenging Once we figured it out it was ok but we circled around twice after going in the wrong place the first time The correct entrance is to the left of the hourly parking entrance We had to run the water in the shower for 5 minutes before it would get hot It didn t seem very secure We would ask for our key by room number and they didn t challenge us It makes us think that anyone could come in and ask for our room key and access our room while we are away It could be that they recognized us so I m not sure , Location was great Being right near the Duomo and shopping was very convenient The prices at the hotel bar were very reasonable The room was clean in good repair The staff was friendly and helpful and could speak English There was a good variety of breakfast food and it is included with your room 
325905,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Accessibility to the property was a problem because of construction on the road You have to park outside the hotel and if you have a big van the nearest parking building cannot accommodate that The hotel does not have a restaurant but luckily Excelsior across the mall had a restaurant and a gourmet food hall The single elevator is not sufficient to handle guest traffic more so during the breakfast hours , Location 
325906,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Construction in square directly outside of hotel so taxi drive to the hotel the driver could not drive up to the entrance , Fantastic location friendly staff good breakfast

325910,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Our room was excruciatingly hot and when you turned the temp down it made no difference thank goodness our widow could open which we had to leave open all night It said in reviews that the hotel had been refurbished but we must have got an old room not 4 star standards We asked for a taxi to be booked for next morning to catch our train but they diddnt do it The man on the counter in the morning was rude and not helpful I am a genius booker and have stayed in many places this I wouldn t recommend , The bed was comfortable Room clean Location

325914,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The hotel rooms were in awful condition The hotel was under construction which was not disclosed to us when we booked There was mold in the rooms as well We do not feel that we got our money worth for what we paid for this hotel , The location was the best thing about this hotel 
325915,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The hotel doesn t a proper hotel bar area and the places which did serve beer around the hotel square was 15 for a large beer which was pretty much pint size , Fantastic location on Duomo Square great for shopping sight seeing and eating Close to the under ground for travelling around Milan can t get a ticket for around 3 to use all day Hotel room we re very clean no problems with anything in the room Friendly staff Breakfast had a good select of food and served until 10am Hotel was happy to keep bags once checked out as we hate a late flight home 
325916,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Room is cold The door is making too much noise especially when the neighbors lock or unclock at night Can hear very clearly , The location is great Super close to the city centre I feel the single room is bigger than other hotel single rooms The design is modern Room has carpet which makes it good

325922,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, would benefit if there was coffee making facilities in the room, the best location for milan a very good choice of continental breakfast and the coffee was very good there was a tourist computer in the lobby which had local info that could be printed off easy to find and very central for milan
325923,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Carpet in the general area e g corridor old marked Hotel looked old a bit run down internally Street outside being upgraded so hard to find get to the entrance Asked for shower not over bath but was given bath tub and 3 steps up to shower toilet , Room was large location of hotel is very close to Duomo

325926,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Even though this was our third time in Ambasciatori I will not come back to this hotel before a serious renovation is done I have booked a deluxe twin room and chosen to upgrade to a junior suite because the original deluxe room gave quite a bad impression it was smelly like toilet smelly worn out and smaller than I assumed it was Now suite was quite nice newly renovated and spacious until the water started coming out of the bath tub and shower sinks That happened several times It looked to me like water starts coming out when some of the neighbours upstairs use the amenities I just hope it was from their tubs and not from their toilets Finally the room service didn t have our 2 first picks from the menu , This is the best location in Milan in the very city center Tourist landmarks shopping places and a lot of lunch dinner restaurants are all within 1 10 mins of walk You can drop off your shopping bags to the hotel in a matter of minutes Staff was polite and service minded If you re not going to spend a lot of time in the hotel this hotel might work for you 
325927,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I suppose our room was not exactly like in the photos I mean it looked like our floor was the only one that was not renovated so I suppose I was expecting more than what I got Plus our room was very cold Nevertheless if I visited Milan again I would certainly look for a room at Ambasciatori hotel Overall a good choice , The location of the hotel is excellent 5min walk from Duomo exactly at the city centre of Milan near restaurants shops and bars The stuff is friendly and the breakfast is generous 
325928,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Poor shower over fussy lighting too many switches to simply switch on and off room 202 near lift we were disturbed by guests using lift really bad wifi connection , Location location location A comfy bed and reasonable breakfast Staff were ok

325930,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Everything Staff was rude Very late check in The room wasnt even ready And they wanted us to leave rightaway Really bad i d rather stay in other hotels , Only the location
325931,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The only way to travel between floors was in a lift There was no option to use stairs due to them being a fire escape only So sometimes you had to wait That s the only bad point , The rooms are very nice and big too And the hotel is in a great location and a stones throw from the main square and the shops 
325932,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Under renovation The pictures are misleading Balcony full of construction material , Location was excellent Staff was very helpful and friendly Breakfast was good

325937,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The Shower was too small wanted a room with a bath Lights coming through the bathroom kept me awake no door on bathroom Building was a hassle Taxi battled to get us to the hotel , Breakfast was lovely Location was superb 
325938,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, You couldn t open the window because of cigarette smoke coming in , The cleaning staff were very pleasant as were the downstairs bar staff Room was very comfortable 
325939,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The only negative I can think of was the hair dryer was very old and didn t blow with much force but got the job done , The location was steps from the Duomo and shopping Check in and out was easy They have a storage room for your luggage if your room isn t ready I am a booking com genius and we were able to keep our room until 2 00 p m and then used their storage for the rest of the day The room was spacious and gorgeous King bed The towels are fluffy There was plenty of pillows There was a mini bar with all kinds of drinks The a c perfect Wi fi worked great The breakfast was delicious and a lovely setting Taxi drove up to lobby in 2 4 minutes It was quiet had many English channels I d go back in a heartbeat 
325940,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The outdated rooms The bathtub which was not comfortable to take a shower , The hotel is located in an amazing location Right next to the main shopping street and 3 minutes walk from the Duomo There s literally no better location to stay in Milan Rooms were spacious but very old There is a strange walk in closet which is so not usable The bathroom was big and outdated and the bathtub was not comfortable at all to take a shower It is a narrow bath and the water tap is located at the narrow part of the bathtub making it extremely uncomfortable experience But again we were not so bothered by that after all cause you just simply take a quick shower The breakfast was great fresh ingredients good coffee fruits meats some vegetables and good selection of breads and croissants We could leave our luggage in their luggage storage and explore the city and came back after lunch to pick up our suitcase Overall a great location value for money great breakfast and outdated but comfortable rooms 
325941,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, DON T ACCEPT THE SPECIAL RATE IT S A SHAME THE BEDROOM THEY ARE SELLING EVEN IF IT S CHEAP IT S NOT ACCORDING TO A 4 STARS I m used to travel for business in all Europe but I never had a such situation where I haven t slept at all I could write a book on it but I only reccomend not to accept a special rate they are just exlpoiting an older side of the hotel which should renew but it s really unconfortable , friendly team and location
325942,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, all is good nothing not to like , Its not my first time in Ambasciatori hotel and I hope its not my last very good team there good facilities and comfortable rooms all you need is in the room which make it very convenient to you and family in the heart of Doumo with easy access to shopping and good restaurants 
325943,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Rooms could do with an upgrade ours smelt old too wifi unpredictable and English channels don t work, Brilliant location shops and restaurants less and a couple minutes walk

325945,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The receptionist was not very friendly with straight face most of the time , i booked a double room but got a massive room that is even bigger than my entire apartment must be the biggest hotel room I have ever stayed Location is only 5 mins walk to Duomo and if you play Pokemon go the hotel is close to pokestops and gym so you can even play from your room will stay here again next time im in Milan
325946,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, The location of this Hotel is excellent Very close to everything we wanted to see It is getting a bit tired but the bed was very comfortable and both the room and bathroom were spacious and clean

325949,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Very old Outdated rooms with bad air conditioning Even the renovated rooms are low quality the bathroom is clogged all the time And you can smell smoke all night from adjacent rooms Guess what that is not even all you won t be able to sleep due to construction noises starting as early as 5 am, Location only
325950,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The cleaning staff managed to visit my room three times in 24 hours once without knocking I had just arrived once knocking even though I had the Do not disturb sign on the door and once in the evening to check the minibar It left me with an unnerving feeling that anyone can come in at anytime I prefer a less eager cleaning service , Nice location in the centre of Milan 
325951,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, My room was lovely the breakfast was excellent and the front desk clerk was very helpful and friendly especially considering I had to check in after 1am The hotel was also very easy to find from the bus stop for the Liante Airport line 
325952,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I am not a fan of hand held showers and this hotel has those I d prefer to stand under a shower head and have both hands free to wash myself This was the only thing I didn t like , Great location right in the centre of Milan only a few metres from the Duomo Cathedral and the city Piazza You won t find better 
325953,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, why is every staff in this hotel mean and awful Especially the ones at the front desk Yes you have successfully driven away any returning customers so you can continue to chat amongst each other wifi non existent I checked with the front desk staff and they couldn t care less If you don t have it just don t advertise you have it room size is rather big but tired and smells The Aircon makes this squiggy sound all night and there is no way to turn it off funny light switches you can never figure out how to switch each one on or off and I am a seasoned traveler someone else said it already It s a hotel of 7 floors with basement but only one lift is working The other lift has a rope blocking it forget about the breakfast Feels like you are inmates, Location nothing else 
325954,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Apart from few areas the rest of the building is old and dirty Staff needs training most of them seem tired bored and are unpolite , Breakfast area is renovated and assortment is good 
325955,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Staff are terrible So unhelpful If you don t want to help people or smile don t work in hospitality and customer service predominantly front desk , Location was good and breakfast ok 
325956,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, No mention iwhen booking of building works outside or refurbishment to bar inside Temporary bar was a poor effort Breakfast included was sparce at best for the size of this hotel but may have been because of the refurbishment , Location
325957,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The bathroom is old We stayed for 2 days and on Sunday the breakfast was poor They didn t have a croissant or a piece of cake too bad Other customers complained and they said that it was too late but it was at 9am and the breakfast was served till 10am, The position is perfect it s very close to the Duomo
325958,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Couldn t fault a thing , I was lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite which was huge It included a separate sitting room an enormous luxurious bathroom Bed was very comfortable pity I was only there to enjoy it for one night 
325959,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Bed pillowcases caused itches so I put a Tshirt on it for a more comfortable night s sleep towels left tiny pieces of fabric on the body so I needed to wash again , Location wonderful Italian atmosphere breakfast bathroom welcome kit and the amazing Beata at the reception desk 
325960,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Milan was almost completely booked out I would have preferred my normal double room but had to settle for a single which was not the fault of the hotel , The location of this hotel is brilliant I always stay here when I am in Milan They are slowly doing it up so some of the rooms are gorgeous others not so much but it is always clean and I have always found the staff to be helpful and friendly 
325961,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, road construction literally outside and the galleria was also being refurbished can easily miss this place while searching for it really good for solo travellers would i bring my family hrmmm maybe not much of a choice in the continental breakfast do not have own restaurant for lunch , super close to the shopping areas Duomo di Milano the staff is not too bad don t smile as much as I would like them to but really good enough for me to ask them questions with decent answers returning the porter is very helpful and responsible i did not have to carry the room keys around and there was a safety box in the room located in a galleria snugged away quietly from the main street nice people working in the breakfast place 
325962,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Nothing to dislike, An outstanding location in duomo Nice staff Thanks for the free suite upgrade It was our anniversary which became perfect Very good facilities for the price The normal room to other friends was also huge We stayed on B1 and B2 floors Don t knw of other floors room size Breakfast had variety The morning reception guy was very nice and humble

325966,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, No extra water the second day nor good night chocolates And these were very jummy Hope the restyling of the facade of the building ends soon as because of this guests were adviced to keep windows shut A C worked fine tho so no worries I was there in the weekend so no builders at work and was able to open the windows still As a gesture there was a box of special cookies to appologise for the work outside my room , Location Location Location Next to that it s situated at the end of a galleria mall which is awsome very Milanish The old style architecture 2 min from the Piazza Del Duomo but also the Castello and other old parts of town are in walking distance Take bus 73 from Linate airport to San Babila underground station it s 2 min walk from there 1 50 for single urban ticket on your way back get a ticket at the metro station Bus stops a bit around the corner from regular busstop with bus 51 and 64 Go right follow road Next to that the room was quite big in size single use double room with a queen size a bit small for 2 bed high ceilings fridge safe complimentary water 
325967,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The reception is very rude There is problem on their payment systems We had been shown them the updated payment but they ignore us and insist us to pay Really rude at the end we called booking com by ourselves to solve the problem for them ,No Positive
325968,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, We booked the hotel more than 4 months in advance When we arrived staff told us that they didn t have our booked room because of building work and tried to relocate us to a different hotel in a much worse location further out from the centre It was obvious that the building works had been going on for some time if they really didn t have the promised room they should have contacted us and told us which would have given us the opportunity to rebook elsewhere This is presumably why they didn t do this but tried to fob us off with an inferior location I think this is very shady practice verging on fraud in my view After we went ballistic and created a scene in reception they suddenly found they DID have a room that fitted the spec of our booking all along surprise surprise This kind of practice is why people hate hoteliers It really spoilt the experience of our first night and leaves a bad taste Staff themselves were generally good but I ve rated as poor to reflect this bad treatment Hotel itself is fine and in excellent very central but still quiet location I d have recommended strongly if they hadn t tried to trick me out of my booking ,No Positive
325969,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Very old hotel Construction is ongoing in the side of the building where I stayed so it was very noisy Hardly got any sleep at all during the 2 nights I was there A two star charging four star rate , Location location location 
325970,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, A bit outdated but very comfortable , Big room and bathroom You can activate the window shutters automatically from bed cool Excellent location just next to the shopping street and a few minutes away from the dome Nice options for breakfast we really enjoyed it 
325971,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Reception staff were at best at best cool at not very helpful, Loved the location very central and vey well appointed The breakfast choice and room was superb Breakfast staff were vey nice
325972,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Breakfast selection poor even when we went 45 minutes before end of service time Couldn t believe difference on day we were leaving when choice was excellent Not listed anywhere bar opening times and advised to use room mini bar No prices in room for cost of items Shower leaked and not repaired despite reporting it , Location 
325973,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Every day between 5 and 7 pm someone wanted to conduct a Minibar check Maid knocks we say not now maid opens the door we lying on the bed sleeping by the way say no please not now maid ignores it and just enters the room goes to the Minibar performs her check and leaves And that every day during exactly the time where mostcity visitors are intheir room and prepare for the evening Also the room was very noisy as you could hear every noise from the bathroom of the next room When our neighbour turned on the shower it sounded like a whirpool Only 1 lift available to get to the breakfast room quite time consuming waiting so better take the stairs, Location in the middle of the City Center 1 minue walking distance to the Duomo
325974,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Quite expensive Lift not working Key was not a card it was an old fashioned key that you leave in the concierge Room was not ready until 14 30h, Location
325975,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, hotel service and rooms very average Reception staff swearing loudly upon check in Air conditioning disabled in hotel despite temperatures of well over 20 so the room was boiling constantly Asked them to turn it on they refused Room poor parts missing Safety deposit box didn t work Very noisy extractor fan in bathroom The breakfast was really average too Reception staff didn t even ask us if we d had a good stay on checkout It wasn t worth the money at all Stay somewhere else , Wonderful location
325976,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The staff were surly and disinterested I was traveling with my daughter and mother who had her own room She didn t discover until turning in for the night that the bedside light did not work nor did the bathroom light Also the shower handle had broken off so she couldn t take a shower When I told the person at the front desk he showed absolutely no interest in the problems Also this hotel had the worst breakfast of any place we stayed in Italy , The location was good very close to the Duomo
325977,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Staff very rude I reserved 2 rooms One standard single and the other superior double with a difference of more than 100 per day but unfortunately I was surprised that they are similar rooms Room cleanness is very poor , Location breakfast and WIfi
325978,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, On the booking it stated an extra large double bed of 181 120 cm The hotel doesn t have ANY rooms with a bed this size so the information on the booking is false I asked to speak to a Manager about this and apparently the Managers never work on the weekends a curious policy for the hospitality industry The receptionist who greeted us on our arrival was either having a bad day or is just plain unpleasant When we got off the lift to go to our room we were greeted by a number full bin bags and laundry bags I could understand at the end of the morning after the rooms have been cleared but at 6pm for bags to still be hanging around Otherwise the room was large and well equipped but the decoration was out of date and some repairs are even needed Not a great opinion of the hotel as result , The location of the hotel is excellent only a few minutes walk from the Duomo and great for shopping which Milan is renowned for 
325979,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Rooms not ready when checking in Hotel in desperate need of updating Smoking room did not bother me only because it smelled sewer from the bathroom anyway Some of the staff should have another profession Cleaning lady was wheeping Portier did not respond or react Do you like coffee for breakfast Then you needed to chase the staff , Location was very good Right next to the Duom and shopping galleries 
325980,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, We enjoyed the location close to Duomo and city center The breakfast was very nice Room clean quiet and comfortable It was a weekend stay only but I would choose this hotel again 
325981,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori,No Negative, The location was perfect just 3 mins away from Duomo in a quiet square there were too many selections for the breakfast and the people were very nice and helping
325982,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Noise from other people Comes to my room Don t know other guests or hotel staff, Second time to this hotel and it s perfect place for me I likes everything
325983,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Power in my room went out multiple times on two nights On the First night it happene I asked for it to be checked and Andrea at the reception told me he would send someone but no one came In the end I flipped the switch myself to quit the waiting in the dark Its old and outdated furniture Only one lift was functioning and made morning lift conditions quite unpleasant , Magnificent location in the centre of Milan and close to retail stores and restaurants 
325984,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Very poor WIFI connection Especially after 11 pm the speed is dropped below 50kb sec Unacceptable Staff completely rood especially an old guy at the reception Not to mention that I booked a double room with 2 separate beds and they gave me a king bed When I asked them to change my room this old receptionist asked me ironically why don t I want to sleep with my friend man at the same bed , Nice bathroom and furnitures 
325985,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Poor room quality dreary view of cigarette butt covered roof being lied to that it was four star when it was barely one star smoking on non smoking floor refusal to refund awful dark smelly room It was better to lose the cost of the night s accommodation than to stay there another minute It should be bulldozed While location is good in that it is near the Duomo etc it is far better to stay somewhere a bit further away such as Corso Buenos Aires We stayed at a real four star there and the comparison was so stark as to put the Ambasciatori almost into the backpacker category at four star prices The positive reviews about this place must be either doubtful or dodgy There are so many better places and better value too Beware , Nothing Hotel was smelly dark and dated 
325986,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I found the hotel rather tired looking and the staff looked completely fed up The room was disappointing and lacked any charm , The choice of gluten free food at breakfast 
325987,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The room was rather outdated we had the most basic room but we were expecting that right from the start so was no surprise and no problem , Excellent location Also surprisingly quiet we had a 4 floor room towards the street Everything worked ok breakfast was good staff was always ok with us Parking next to hotel offered with reduced price 
325988,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The breakfast room and staff was not set for the amount of people going for breakfast Food was not filled up fast enough waited 15min on the first day for the table to be cleaned so we could have breakfast Coffee service was also quite slow Rooms are quite old which is normal in Italy Heating airconditioning not very stable Noisy when we were there Just outside there was building going on even on a Saturday , The location in Milan is perfect The hotel is just behind the Duomo and next to the main shopping street You can easily reach the hotel by public transport metro to duomo Parking garage nearby the hotel Rooms are big depending on the category Quality of breakfast was good large variety 
325989,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, There is not reastaurant in the hotel in case you want to eat dinner or lunch, The hotel is very good lockated Everything is close and the undergaround is 3min walking The breakfast was great For what you get the price couldn t be better
325990,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The reception is not that nice the building is very old and even if the great Eugenio Montale lived there once I did not have the feeling to be at a 4 stars hotel For example at the buffet for breakfast there were the very basics No hot food like scrambled eggs no natural juices , The location was was great Also the service at the breakfast room was very nice which compensated the poor buffet
325991,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The room was awful I wouldn t say it is a 4 star hotel comparing to the others I ve stayed in Milan In the middle of the night the 2 nights I ve spent there they turned off the lights I wanted to go to the bathroom and had to use the lantern of my cell phone This was unacceptable I had to call the reception get properly dressed and stay awake waiting for the assistant to check what had happened I am not a tourist that loves to be in the middle of the crowd so the location was pretty messy for me and I had to enter the galleria with many homeless people sleeping on paper screaming in another language that was not good It is near the shops some restaurants and the Duomo cathedral but I didn t like it , The staff was efficient and nice 
325992,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, the breakfast was poor since the hotel rate is expensive if you want to eat eggs scrambled or fried or drink fresh orange juice it will be charge extra which is totally wrong since other hotel serve them for free , i like the location Perfect 
325993,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, i don t like the room at all room number 101 is very bad room you can hear a voice from the floor when you walk and the TV screen too small and there is some walls that needs to be panting again ,No Positive
325994,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Hotel rooms need a little maintenance especially the bathroom but nothing major No hand soap left in the bathroom Bath towels are a little worn , The location is the best part of this hotel Right off the main street in Milan so close to all the stores and the Metro etc

325996,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Delux room we had was situated on the first floor and was very noisy It had dirty marks on the carpet One of the two elevators was out of order As a result of the malfunction you have to wait for five minutes at least for the working elevator and then get stuck going up and down for another 10 minutes Price of the room was highly overpriced for the experience we had ,No Positive

326004,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Reception staff a little lacking in rapport Non English speaking members of staff just simple communication issue , Excellent location for the metro duomo cathedral great pavement cafes shopping and restaurants In the room very spacious very clean excellent decor Breakfast was adequate 
326005,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Room and bathroom badly need refurbishment very dated and shabby Receptionists not accomodating at all one was very surly glares at visitors left me wondering why he chose his job Corridors smelt heavily of smoking on the first floor Room heating not cosy enough especially in the bathroom , Excellent location perfect for shopping and five minutes away from the Duomo Breakfast choice was good too 
326006,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, I had a problem with getting the room I wanted although I called before and explain that I will arrive very late and was promissed to have a room with a double bed blocked for me and the safe didn t work The next day I had to change twice as the safe didn t function also in the other room I had to ask for the aminities that were missing in the room , The location is very good The hotel is nice but not taken care of sufficiently Breakfast is nice and good 
326007,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF CHANGED OUR TOWELS EVERYDAY EVEN WHEN WE INDICATED THAT WE DID NOT WANT TO CHANGE I WISH THE FRONT DESK STAFF PAY MORE ATTENTION TO GUESTS WHEN THEY WAIT TO GET ROOM KEY , VERY CONVENIENT LOCATION HOTEL IS IN BUILDING WHICH IS PART OF OF SHOPPING ARCADE ROOM IS CLEAN AND AMENITIES IN BATHROOM ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS 
326008,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, The reception staff are not that professional No parking on site nearby parking might cost you around 25 euros a day The room which has sofa bed that a big lie its just a sofa and cant be a bed and its very uncomfortable to sleep on , The location New furniture Cleanliness

326010,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Hotel staff were not hospitality trained uncooperative unsmiling uninterested Lift out of order and no sign of it ever being repaired mold in shower etc, Location
326011,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, One of the worst hotels I have stayed in Horrible beds I paid for a king size bed but ended up with two twin beds installed closely together Beds were incredibly uncomfortable rock hard mattress where you can feel the metal springs in your back I had to take a pillow and put it vertically under my body to be able to not feel the metal springs I ended up with back pain the next day Despite booking an non smocking room the room smelled strongly of cigarettes it was overwhelming Reception minimized the issue and said that it was the smell of the carpet Someone clearly smoked for hours in the room and the smell was in the curtains and carpet I left the windows opened for hours but it didn t fix the issue I ended up sleeping near the window with the windows open As someone with minor lung issues it was very uncomfortable breathing in this room my windows were opened at all times Staff was not friendly or helpful at all when I asked to change room due to the strong smell They don t seem to have been trained on how to deal with customers they were borderline rude Drain in the bathroom sink was completely clogged the first day Housekeeping had come clean the room that morning but didn t notice so I had to ask them to unclog it the second day Shower pipe was broken so I had water splashing in my face while I was showering Stingy with toilet and tissue paper When I checked in the tissue box had about 5 papers left and there was half a roll of toilet paper in the room The plastic toilet flush was broken it was coming off the wall at every use and I had to put it back in Dodgy area The galleria where the hotel is situated is filled with intoxicated homeless men My colleague and I walked out of the hotel at around 8pm to go to the restaurant across the street an intoxicated man followed us and was trying to speak to us incoherently We had to run into the restaurant to get away from him , The only positive thing with this hotel is its location but even that wasn t 100 satisfying I was travelling for business so this wasn t an important factor for me The gallery the hotel is in is filled with intoxicated homeless men My colleague and I were staying at the hotel and got followed and bothered by an intoxicated men while walking outside the hotel 
326012,IH Hotels Milano Ambasciatori, Staff was cold After we check in I called lobby ask for something the staff didn t understanding what I was saying but answers we don t have any other room available 30 minutes later I understand why he said that there s a night club down my window and makes a extremely loud noise so loud that even my window was shaking and continued a whole night Can t sleep for a single second , In the city centre but lots of noises because of that
