223286,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Coffee and tea making facilities hidden away No view from window , Clean and comfy Great shower and toiletries Proximity to Gloucester Road tube and Royal Albert Hall 
223287,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We had requested the room package that included breakfast and the breakfast was a disappointment The breakfast options were very limited and the services was slow There was only 1 waitstaff who would take forever to replenish food items and sometimes not even do that Also the gym is tiny and there is no swimming pool for kids to enjoy , The location was excellent right in the center of London The hotel was a charming property within walking distance to Hyde park the tube station and many eateries and stores The rooms were a little tight but they were clean and the our bathroom was a decent size 
223288,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The rooms are very small which is ok but not when the space is taken up by a huge desk I was going to store my case in the wardrobe but that had an ironing board in it Being a bit more clever with furniture like a desk which folds down from the wall freeing up floor space and an ironing board built into the wardrobe would make the space much more pleasant to be in , Super clean rooms with very friendly staff The bed was really comfortable The location was amazing 
223289,Rydges Kensington Hotel, During my stay maintenance team pain one wall of the room Then when I was in the shower someone enter my room Quite slow room service , Location was great The room was perfect size spacious and comfortable 
223290,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Did not expect to find blocked sink in bathroom when we arrived Did not expect to find they want 2 5 for a bottle of water most hotels provide free Did not expect to find basic plates and items missing at breakfast and staff would not even get them Poor breakfast selection Not good value as we have done much better for less many times in London Not very courteous staff , Bed was comfortable and room clean
223291,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room was too small with only 1 very small desk to do everything on pack unpack boil water n make tea work the space wasn t well thought out Pillows were too soft No complimentary bottled water ,No Positive
223292,Rydges Kensington Hotel, worn lifting carpet view onto air conditioning units in light well bed mattress needs replacing had collapsed on right side hard pillows perfunctory reception, Close to Gloucester station and therefore Hyde Park great simple food choices nearby including breakfast items AC and quiet 
223293,Rydges Kensington Hotel, On gaining access to the room it became apparent that the bathroom had not be cleaned the toilet had not even been flushed and had to get house keep back to finish the job not what you expect from a 4 star hotel A very disappointing start to my stay Also very unhelpful with an error on booking the system have inadvertently booked 2 breakfasts for one person and they refused to take this off the bill and still charged for 2 not 1 , Location fine for the trip I was making 
223294,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Most important is that they need to improve on the attitude of their staff They only smile when you are leaving , Bad service overall and the property is not nice Totally over priced 
223295,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room we were in had horrible plumbing The sink and tub did not drain despite unscrewing the stoppers This meant leaving a mess in the sink if you did anything The housekeeping staff rewarded the mess by providing decreasing supplies each day The curtains which were over 12 feet tall were missing hooks so you could not completely close them to block the light from the street at night or even to ensure privacy without using something to hold them in place And because of the height were not something you could fix yourself The hotel staff were not friendly helpful or welcoming The breakfast buffet had flies circling it and was definitely not worth the cost Great location but not worth the money , The location near a tube stop in the Kensington area is well suited for tourist areas The room despite being a first floor on the street location was reasonably quiet 
223296,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The cleaning staff were a little non commital when we said good morning, Stayed before and was offered a loyalty card which I produced and was offered a free drink at the bar where we had lunch Continental breakfast was included which was excellent don t need a full English Bed was very comfy 
223297,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Wifi uses Virgin Wifi so requires registration with either social media or email address , Clean recently renovated or well maintained modern rooms 
223298,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No bathroom mat and the bathroom was rather small The toilet seat was uncomfortable And the bathroom door was worn out near the bottom , Excellent location A short walk from Gloucester Road station from which Piccadilly District and Circle lines run which makes it very convenient to travel to the center It is also 10 15 min walk to the museums in South Kensington Hyde Park and High Street Kensington Lots of shops restaurants and pubs within walking distance There are also Waitrose and Tesco stores nearby The bed was very comfy albeit a bit too springy It was a very comfortable stay overall 
223299,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The size of the bathroom, Whilst the room was very spacious and comfortable the bathroom although very clean was tiny especially as it was supposedly a superior twin room The breakfast was great with a lovely choice of juices and food The amenities were very good We stayed here to go to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and it was just a few minutes walk 
223300,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel located across the road from Tube station Gloucester Road Nice rooms clean great breakfast A huge compliment to the staff who have been extremely helpful when we got stuck in London because of the IT crash at British Airways that caused cancellation of our flight Staff booked us a room for another night with an upgrade and complimentary breakfast and helped us sort out flights and eventually book Eurostar train tickets 
223301,Rydges Kensington Hotel, This is not a 4 star property They do not even have Q tips when I ask for them There is no slipper or robe provided The room is small and not enough hangers just 4 The first two bottles of water are not even free and have to be paid The exterior of the building looks like a luxury boutique hotel but they do not provide some basic The lift was broken down twice within one week The staff didn t even inform us , The bed was comfortable and the washroom was big 
223302,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Genlteman at the front desk told me it would be cheaper and quicker to get the taxi rather then the shuttle to Gatwick airport when trying to order the shuttle Over 150 pounds extra for that piece of advice Also the sound on the television was lower than the rattling comming from the air conditioning ,No Positive
223303,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Continental breakfast was on the Spartan side Coffee machine dispensed only 6oz would be nice to get a 10 ounce cup in one pour, Great location Beds very comfortable and nice linens Staff efficient and polite 
223304,Rydges Kensington Hotel, small room and shower over bath , This is a wonderful location for exploring London Gloucester Road tube station is a short walk away with 3 lines and there is a Waitrose near the station and lots of shops and restaurants nearby Kensington Palace and Gardens is at the end of the street A tourist bus as well as local stop at the door The continental breakfast is great and the staff very friendly We would definitely be happy to stay here again 
223305,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We booked a superior twin room When we received the email to perform a pre check in so as to save time when we arrived we did However when we arrived there was no designated queue for guests who have already checked in We had to queue in the general queue We were also asked about our room preferences when we checked in online We indicated our preference for a high floor But when we checked in we got a room at the ground floor near the toilets with no view The room was a tad too small for a superior room We were told that the only twin rooms they have in the hotel were at the ground floor Besides security was not tight at all Anyone could wander into the common corridor and outside our room In all we felt that the pre check in was redundant since we had to wait in line And if by booking and paying for a superior twin room meant no choice of room location and choice do not provide us with options like room near lift end of corridor high floor or low floor etc , The location of the hotel is good with a bus stop right outside the hotel and the tube station across the street 
223306,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room was tiny and the pillows were awful The decor is dated and the woodwork needs repainting it is NOT 4 star standard by any means , Free WiFi and location
223307,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The breakfast was chaotic as a staff member had not turned up Glad I ordered the full breakfast as very little left to eat at the buffet continental Had to ask for spoon and water and butter and other basic necessities that were missing The cooked breakfast was delicious but overall it was a shambles , Very comfortable hotel close to museums and tube station Clean and friendly staff Very comfortable bed Would definitely stay again when next in London 
223308,Rydges Kensington Hotel, What could have been better the allocation of the complimentary drinks token I received one I presume as it was my first stay at the hotel and Id signed up to their rewards offers but my brother who was also staying at the hotel is a Black rewards member of the hotel chain but he didn t receive a drinks token because they d given one to me apparently when we questioned this they were confused because of the same surname and it took along time to explain yet when I had checked in earlier the reception staff had acknowledged that my brother and his wife had arrived there was no confusion then Breakfast the pasties were stale which was a shame as there is an excellent cafe a couple of minutes down the road Pauls where the coffee and croissants were excellent Ah the coffee When our breakfast waiter came to ask about our order I asked if we could have two teas and a coffee He said Yes and then proceeded to take the breakfast order My brother and his wife ordered the full English yet the waiter did not ask how they would like their eggs and exited quickly to place the order with the kitchen Other waiting staff were asking their tables how the guests would like their eggs The teas and coffee never came so when I went round to select my breakfast continental I realised that there was a hot drinks machine this would have been a very simple explanation for the waiter to give instead of leaving us thinking that our drinks were on their way Overall not a great experience for such a nice hotel especially when there are other options so close to the hotel and when those other options Pauls amongst them provide a better service and better quality food , The croissants were poor as was the general breakfast experience but the hotel was ok in general I only say ok I wouldn t specifically book there again as there are other hotels in London where I have had a better overall experience It is mainly down to the staff again they were ok but for that type of hotel I would expect better I expect ok at a Travelodge or a Premier Inn 
223309,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Requires more staff at breakfast Staff that are on work hard but not enough to keep buffet and crockery continuously stocked , Bed comfortable Nice toiletries
223310,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Breakfast We had continental No decent fresh uncut bread or rolls available to go with the cheese and meats Only very ordinary sliced bread was offered good only for toasting No bagels or cream cheese for the smoked salmon The croissants seemed stale and bland cheap No plain ordinary water to be had unless I bought a bottle Note most diabetics can t drink fruit juice The area around the cereals was so messy All together breakfast was a thoroughly unpleasant experience Oh and PLEASE change your bar price list you sell water from Harrogate Note the spelling It is NOT spelt Harrowgate You should change that , Very comfy bed and pillows Great shower 
223311,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Didnt like having to order breakfast the night before I would prefer to see how I felt on the day , Bed was the best Happy Hour really good value 
223312,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Arrived at 2pm unfortunately the bar didn t open until 5pm but found Gloucester Road pub just up the road , Pleasant staff comfy beds clean and comfortable Convenient for the Albert Hall Gloucester Road tube station 
223313,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room service was very poor Toasted sandwich arrived to the room cold and uncooked with no sides Once we alerted the hotel they removed this from our bill ,No Positive
223314,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Service at Breakfast was a little slow Staff were friendly but in no rush to greet or serve us , Location was excellent from Paddington station and ideally located for the Royal Albert Hall 
223315,Rydges Kensington Hotel, View from the windows of the room 002 is to the wall of the next very close building There is constant noise of aircondition facilities placed just outside of the windows , Close to the Natural History Museum and the underground station Very friendly staff 
223316,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room a little tired , Excellent staff very helpful and free upgrade due to reason for stay Bed really comfortable and hotel only a couple of minutes walk from the underground and close to a number of restaurants 
223317,Rydges Kensington Hotel, went for breakfast at 8 30 The milk orange juice plates and bowls had all run out They were replaced very quickly but one lady was very unhappy Would have helped if a member of staff had kept an eye on the situation , Could book in before arriving and state preference to the location of room We were attending a concert at the Royal Albert Hall This hotel was a short walk away 
223318,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Bed was uncomfortable and very small for two people curtains could not keep the light out in the morning breakfast was limited e g no eggs , Hotel is in a good location close to London s main attractions Good and clean bathroom Very friendly staff at the reception of the hotel Overall good value for money 
223319,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The continental breakfast wasn t worth the money Buy a Starbucks coffee and a sweet roll from one of the shops nearby or walk north to a cheaper place offering a full breakfast for about 5 or 6 pounds , Quiet upscale neighbourhood in London Very close to the Gloucester Road underground station Tesco Express store and a Waitrose supermarket nearby Hop on Hop off buses stop close by as well A few restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance Hotel is older creaking floors some noise from other rooms but overall ambiance helpful front desk and friendliness of staff made up for it 
223320,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Nothing not to like , From the moment we arrived we knew we were going to have a fantastic weekend We arrived early to check in and our room wasn t ready but we were assured that it would be worth the wait as we had been given a complimentary upgrade Later in the evening there was an issue with our room and so without question we were moved again to an even better room which was absolutely fantastic The staff couldn t have been any more helpful throughout our stay restaurant recommendations were great delicious breakfasts at the hotel we couldn t have wished for a better hotel stay Location is fantastic for the museums the hop on hop off bus stops just outside and Gloucester road tube station a 5 minute walk away 
223321,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The king size bed was not placed centrally to its headboard which meant no table on one side and only very narrow space to enter bed on the window side , Ambience of the hotel was very good Room very clean and comfortable Continental breakfast offered a good variety
223322,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room could hav been a little bigger for two, Great location near the Gloucester Road tube Good walking distance to kensington and Hyde parks and Albert hall 
223323,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room cleaning was very late after 2 PM Room had air condition but it did not seem to work and the room was fuggy The humitidy of the room would have been unbearable Without possibility to open the windows it would have been very unpleasent Also the minibar wasn t working and we had to tell staff about it twice before it was fixed The hotel also had trouble with the elevator as it did not work every day , Bed was nice and the location was near a tube station The staff was kind 
223324,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Very comfy bed room clean but quite small Bathroom cramped but clean For one night it was perfect Didn t eat here so can t comment on the food 
223325,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We have stayed here many times but feel it does need a little freshening up such as bathroom needs regrouting painting carpets, Staff on reception were all extremely cheerful and helpful
223326,Rydges Kensington Hotel, the staff one gentleman in particular was rude and looked down his nose at us like we are somethin he stepped in i know this is kensington and everything but if i payed to stay in this hotel i expect to be treated with respect at least next issue is the lack of mention about this pre autherisation fee we travelled a long way to come to london with only a little to spend as tourists and then when we arrived we didnt expect to be forced to hand over 50 just in case i MIGHT want to charge something to the room i didnt have the money in my bank account we wernt aware that we had to do this and when i told the rude man that i didnt have the money in my account he refused to let us go to our room that we had prepayed 150 to stay in for one night my friend had to pay the fee which left her short of cash we were told that if we didnt charge anythin to the room at the end of our stay it would go straight back on her card to then find out when checking out that it will take a few days to be returned so our trip to london became abit difficult when your a visior on a budget we didnt get to do some of the stuff we came to london to do also i booked 150 for a superior room just so i could have the breakfast included when we got to the room it was tiny i dread to think how small a standard room is if we got the superior for a 4 star hotel its lacking its stars from my point of view and ive stayed in a few oh and one more thing the room wasnt very clean the tea making facillities were smothered in dust i have bits floating in my cups of tea it looked like nobody cleaned it for weeks even if nobody had used the facilities surely the cleaner has to dust the room soo grosss i would not recomend this hotel to anyone unless your rich and have 50 just sitting in your account and like a snall room covered in dust , the decor throughout the hotel was lovley and beds were really comfey i had a really good nights sleep
223327,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The worst was the receptionist We explicitly asked whether the trains to the airport were running normally he pretended to looked in the system and assured us all was good Having trusted him we arrived at the train station only to be told that that weekend due to planned works on the tracks no trains were running We scrambled to make it to the airport which cost us extra money and we barely made our flight He simply lied into my face which I find unacceptable , The location of the hotel is superb right on the subway nice area cafes and restaurants all over The rooms are of good size 
223328,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We paid for an upgrade to full English breakfast and it really was horrible Very greasy and not well cooked I couldn t eat it They also charged 12 for four coffees which would normally be served as part of a 20 breakfast price They took the price of these coffees and the breakfast upgrade cost off our bill which was good But I would have preferred to have a lovely breakfast There where some bottles of water next to the coffee machine in the room I presumed they would be complimentary but they were not This wasn t clear until we had the bill , The staff where great and the location great 
223329,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The minifridge would not turn and the shower tap was a bit difficult to adjust water was really cool or hot Electric outlets on the bedside did not work , Overall an okay stay Staff friendly and location great We had a discoubted price otherwise would maybe consider another hotel in the same price range 
223330,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Nothing, Excellent location with Gloucester Road tube station just a couple of minutes walk away Hotel staff were really helpful and friendly nothing too much trouble also enjoyed the bar and restaurant on site 
223331,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The polo bar in the hotel very nice but very rude lady behind the bar Got the impression she didnt want us there , Reception staff very helpful room was upgraded for free as it was a special celebration for my partner and i The only thing i would say is they take 50 holding fee i checked out sunday and i still awaiting refund it is now Wednesday 
223332,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room very noisy at night Draft from window making cold spots in room Dust on table we wrote clean me in it but it was still there next day after room had been serviced,No Positive
223333,Rydges Kensington Hotel, everything was perfect , Location is great fantastic facilities Perfect for a weekend in London Staff very friendly and helpful We could check in in advance and room was ready at our arrival 
223334,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No bath but the shower was excellent After a day walking round London a relaxing bath would have been just perfection , Staff very helpful and pleasant 
223335,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Nice hotel in a nice location just closed to metro and have a supermarket and a convenient shop very near by and have coffee local restaurants and bars around there Hotel lobby very elegant and the room design is very comfortable During we stayed 2nights room was clean and everything is so good The most excellent is the very nice services hotel staff are friendly I had a scarf forgotten left behind in hotel after check out they sent me an email immediately to informed when I back to HK just landed open my mobile to read that email feeling was so touched that just a little old scarf but they still have an email to me to ask me how to arrange it they re so kindness and so serious to take to heart next time if we could re visit London hope would stay there again 
223336,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room was very cold despite turning up the heat to the highest setting Bedding was also a bit light The carpet seemed quite dirty , The bath tub and shower option 
223337,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The staff were very rude Threatening me with a 200 bill for smoking when I don t even smoke Then taking 100 out of my bank as soon as I got there as I was unaware of this I was then 100 down for my trip They then didn t give my girlfriend 50 off happy hour drinks saying they don t do happy hour anymore when it clearly states on your website happy hour is between 6 8 And now I still haven t received my 100 back yet Never again would I stayin this hotel You don t get your value for money ,No Positive
223338,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Asked for chanpange on arrival as was gf s 21st and any added amenities possible and wasn t provided Third stay at hotel in last 16 months so not the best but hey ho , Nearly everything was good 
223339,Rydges Kensington Hotel, More things to watch on tv would ve been nice also if the mini bar was more affordable as the price of the rooms are quite large especially for quite a small suite, The staff were amazing and very considerate and friendly The bed was very comfortable the bathroom was also very nice Was very homely
223340,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I stayed here 3 years ago and enjoyed it However this hotel is now in need of refurbishment From the cigarette butts at the bottom of the entrance steps and no help to bring my case up those steps to the small tired rooms and bathrooms this is no longer a go to hotel for me and I checked out early , Good location across from the Gloucester Rd underground station and bus stops outside Handy for the museums 
223341,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I really can not fault this hotel in any way , The hotel was very clean comfortable had excellent facilities was in a great location They have a team of professional friendly staff that looked after us very well The fact that we were able to leave our luggage there all day after checking out impressed me very much I would highly recommend this hotel will certainly be using it again when I next visit London 
223342,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room was comfortable reasonably well equipped high ceiling but rather cramped for two Did they really have to charge for bottled water , Great location close to Tube and Museums Royal Albert Hall RGS etc 
223343,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The cleanliness was appalling completely dirty towels were folded and put back again the windows didn t close properly Maintenance workers used the toilet and left urine on the floor The rooms are too small And the checkout at 11am is ridiculous at 11 05am the reception was already calling rudely asking to leave the bedroom , The location 
223344,Rydges Kensington Hotel, having to give a big deposit when we arrived as well as paying our stay it was not mentioned at all on the website or when we booked it , Bed was very comfy facilities were great and staff were welcoming
223345,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I recommend if you want to charge your mobile or use it while in bed bring a long charging cord , The staff was excellent including the personal touches made for a quite a pleasant stay They even gave guests Christmas cards Also the benefit of checking in early from oversees flight was a bonus 
223346,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Poor breakfast with limited choice Food that runs out is not replenished Stayed there for 2 days and we chose to have a proper breakfast from somewhere else on the 2nd day , Large room by london standard spacious bathroom and stone throw away from the tube station 
223347,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Bare minimum for the price in terms of cleaningness service and general comfort Strongly recommend against rooms in lower ground floor , Great location
223348,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Small room in lower ground floor The roof above was creaking and made it hard to sleep Hotel could do with a slight makeover for the price , The location was great Comfortable room 
223349,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Breakfast was very disorganised They ran out of tea hot water and it was just a mess Some of the staff were very professional Some were very sloppy and unkempt , Great location and very quiet 
223350,Rydges Kensington Hotel, , Very close to the underground station 2 3 mins walk comfy bed clean friendly staff There s also a Tesco Express and a PAUL bakery right across the street from the tube station which was very convenient for me I will definitely book here again for future trips to London 
223351,Rydges Kensington Hotel, It would have been great to have A bath in the room The shower was lovely though , The location of the hotel was excellent Easy to get around and ideal for the museums 
223352,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The step in and out of the main entrance door was a bit tricky but thats a minor point , Reception staff were very friendly Room was immaculate and very tastefully designed Will definitely staying again the
223353,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Food is a little pricey but expect this is normal for London hotels , Amazing rooms Hotel central to all we wanted to see Extremely accommodating staff who go above and beyond Plenty of in room facilities everything you could possibly require 
223354,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I can hear noises from hallway and upstairs , Bed was comfortable and first day reception staff was very kind Most of all the location is just 3 minutes away from the Gloucester station Victoria and Albert Museum Natural History Museums are located within 10 minutes distance 
223355,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room we had was realy great but the hand basin in the bathroom was so cramped up in the corner you had to watch that you did not burn yourself on the radiator, It s location was just right for what we required
223356,Rydges Kensington Hotel, For the cost we thought It was super value When we mentioned the noisy guest across the corridor the problem was dealt with immediately so we have no complaints, Excellent reception staff Super location
223357,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We had asked for quiet room 2nd night we were disturbed for hours by a noisy machine maybe hotel boiler Also breakfast is cheap but poor quality , Room comfortable clean easily reached with luggage 
223358,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Bars on windows and view of very dirty area at front of hotel when complained about room being told You got what you paid for having to keep asking for items to be topped up at breakfast, Airy reception area
223359,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Common areas are looking a bit tired and could do with a refurb , Great hotel in a convenient location close to Gloucester Rd Tube and some of London s leading museums I arrived early in the morning following a 24 hour flight and they checked me in straight away which i appreciated 
223360,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room too small staff were welcoming when we arrived but very poor customer service during check out Wasn t asked how our stay was when departing how breakfast was would you like us to look after any bags during your last day Surely this basic customer service skills Breakfast was appalling took 20 minutes before anybody even noticed we were there Someone took our room number and told us to take a seat then it wasn t explained how anything worked We assumed he was coming back I had to go and ask for help where 4 members of staff were just chatting at the bar We paid for the continental and hot breakfast at 15 each Continental was absolutely shocking Warm watery orange juice warm full fat milk no semi skimmed milk left alongside a poor selection of cereal lack of breads muffins croissants cured meat no yogurt warm fruit no tea pots Ordered our hot breakfasts the order came and was totally wrong Also took around 40 minutes to arrive Really disappointing and should have just gone over the road to Garfunkals for breakfast , The bed was comfy location good 
223361,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Being asked for 50 deposit for mini bar Minimum room temperature a little too warm , Very clean and comfortable Good continental breakfast Room bed size good bathroom excellent Quiet room at the back 
223362,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The only negative could be that you can hear the water falling when someone uses the toilet flush from the room upstairs Also they could have the water bottles free in the price we paid I think Not so important but it would be a positive thing to do so that we wouldn t have to go and buy especially the first day we arrived late They charge it 2 5 pounds each , Perfect location Tube very close Breakfast was very good and the staff were very friendly ready to help you with a smile The room was spacious clean and you had anything you could possibly need from an iron to a hairdryer which by the way is hidden in a drawer that opens from the top except slippers The WiFi works perfect and it s free There are many stores right outside the hotel e g money exchange with no commission very convinient many restaurants indian italian burgers and much more super markets like waitrose tesco and boots and of course the museums just two blocks away 5 7 minutes walk 
223363,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, The room was spacious comfortable clean quiet The continental breakfast had a nice variety of foods and they catered for specific dietary requests The staff were friendly helpful no request seemed too much Lovely bar to have a relaxing drink in Hotel in the Perfect location for museums Royal Albert hall and the area has a village kind of feel Lots of eateries nearby to choose from Tube station 2 minute walk and bus stop right outside hotel Will definitely be staying again 
223364,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Main elevator was out for the time we were there requiring us to use back steps and an inconvenient elevator, Very comfortable well located hotel with helpful staff
223365,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The sink in the bathroom seemed to be be blocked but a very small thing and easily fixed , Very good size room The room service was exceptional with it coming quickly and tasted incredible with very good presentation Literally 1 minute away from the underground And very good service for storing our luggage after checkout 
223366,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No elevator near the lobby very inconvenient for hotel customers esp if you have a big luggage And the service lift was located in a place where you can not find it easily the door is too heavy and the space inside is so small Another downside of the hotel is they do not automatically replenish the the toiletries everyday after they clean the room you have to request for it , I like the interiors of the hotel room and the bed linens The room is just enough for 2 and for opening of luggage It is also very near the tube with a Tesco and Waitrose supermarket nearby and also cafes restos around it 
223367,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Air con in room 301 did not work and I slept very badly as the room was so warm I reported it and they were unable to fix it and could not provide a fan Offered a move but since I was ready for bed did not take up the offer, Great location and helpful staff
223368,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Breakfast was an extra 10 each so we didn t bother Could have done with an extra blanket as it was cold in the night Next time we ll ask for a room at the back as the street is very noisy at night , We were given a room upgrade from a superior queen to an executive It had a fancy coffee machine Good bathroom with a great shower Good location 10 minutes walk from The Albert Hall and close to Hyde Park and the Natural History Museum 
223369,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Having the kettle fixed in the bedside cupboard was a real bind Cupboard door level with bed and steam from kettle permeated the cupboard Not ideal , Breakfast was brilliant Location was excellent 2 minutes from tube and 8 minutes from Exhibition Road for museums Harrods too close for comfort of wallet 
223370,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Breakfast very expensive and unorganised Strange smell near coffee area , Reception staff very efficient and friendly Rooms well appointed and clean Comfortable beds and hot water from the shower Close to tube for good access to London areas 
223371,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Asked for early morning call which I did not get Comment from member of staff Good job you were up Lucky I did not have to catch a train Other wise good location ,No Positive
223372,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room a bit small for a superior Queen room my umbrella went missing , Bed was comfortable staff friendly room clean It was a very quiet peaceful place despite being so close to the Gloucester Road tube the Cromwell road museums 
223373,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No complaints no faults Thanks to Rydges we had a lovely stay, Fantastic location only a short walk to Gloucester Road tube station Staff very friendly and on arrival surprised us with an upgraded room Room was fab Bed very comfortable and room had all the amenities you could need Close to Albert hall and Hammersmith for concerts and in zone 1 on tube line so cheap and quick to get right to the hub of London shopping entertainment Will definitely use this as our London base in the future 
223374,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Booked executive studio but was more a normal double room Thought room would have been bigger as travelling with two children, Bed was very comfortable Clean room

223379,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, Welcoming helpful staff on reception When we had a problem with our air conditioning they tried their best to help and as they could not change our room or get anyone to have a look that night gave us a complimentary full english breakfast We also had an unexpected upgrade to an executive suite which was lovely and made our weekend The breakfast was delicious 
223380,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The toilette seat had not been cleaned The wake up call we requested came while we were checking out , Comfortable bed and an excellent location Room and bathroom quite above the usual London standards probably recently renovated 
223381,Rydges Kensington Hotel,No Negative, great location for the museums just a 10 min walk away plenty of shops restaurants around with a good choice Underground station 2 mins away great 
223382,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Well I Couldn t open the window to get some fresh air into the room which is neither here or there The Gym was a tiny broom cupboard in the basement and the TV wasent tuned in so assumed no one ever uses it a good job there was only me in there as there was no room as it was so tiny I thought the food in the restaurant was rather expensive especially breakfast so went elsewhere Prices in the mini bar extortionate Hallways and carpets all look a bit tired But it s a nice enough hotel all said and done and is great for a short London break , Great shower and bathroom clean fresh cosy room 
223383,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room was no where near the size shown on the website Breakfast was a bit disappointing as no coffee breakfast tea Staff were very hassled , The reception staff were friendly hotel was easy to get to by tube

223386,Rydges Kensington Hotel, As it is a listed building the elevator is small and the stairs are old If you re uncomfortable with this it won t be a good fit The cheapest rooms are below street level not everyone is comfortable with this , Room was nicely appointed larger than I expected for central London and spotless Staff were exceptionally helpful and went above and beyond to assist us Hotel has been renovated recently so rooms decor and plumbing are all modern and wifi service was good I don t normally stay in chain hotels but I got a deal on this one and I am glad I did Hotel is close to the Tube station within walking distance of many major attractions and close to good restaurants and cafes Very pleased 
223387,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The reception staff sounded quite patronising to the international guests When I checked in the lady dealing with the Spanish guests next to me was virtually shouting at them so loud I had trouble hearing the lady checking me in I am a native English speaker Perhaps improving coverage of the main European languages or a translation table to point to the key phrases would make it seem a less demeaning experience for international visitors Not just shouting at them until they understand , The room was massive Everything in good condition and seemed quite new the bed was very comfortable We got a great discounted rate and were a little worried when we heard we had a lower ground floor room normally this means you get given a tiny and dark room in the basement Ours was large and quite bright I would definitely recommend it Fantastic location 10 min walk to the museums and Imperial College Right next to Gloucester Road tube station to go a bit further Also many restaurants and supermarkets next door 
223388,Rydges Kensington Hotel, We could hear the traffic all night so disruptive, Staff were very nice and the location was fantastic we were attendig a graduation ceremony at The Royal Albert Hall
223389,Rydges Kensington Hotel, But I can t imagine what a smaller room would have been like The iron is bolted to the ironing board so it was not possible to use all the ironing board , Room was on special and we got an upgrade 
223390,Rydges Kensington Hotel, the room was on a basement room without much light and worst was the bed really uncomfortable mattress The bed was one of these beds that come out of a closet and you have the feeling your head is inside the closet when you sleep Not a good experience at all, location is quite good with a metro station a short 100 meters from the hotel
223391,Rydges Kensington Hotel, staff was rode there is a bad smell near my room timing of the coffee shop timing of the housekeeper i try to call them and they said their duty is over no security, i like the area of the hotel near the station supermarket and resturant
223392,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I stayed in the single bed room I would recommend always booking the double rooms my single bed was very uncomfortable When I informed the manager the next day I was informed that I could have mentioned this and could have been relocated to another suite The adjacent attached restaurant had VERY poor service The food was good when it came but there the quality of service provided by the servers was not satisfactory they were pleasant but negligent , The location was great quiet at night and right by the tube My parents room was nice and comfortable for their bed The rooms were clean and nice Being from Canada the USB plug in was handy because I didn t need a converter to charge my phone The front desk service provided a really pleasant check in and check out experience 
223393,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Main lift out of order but maintenance personnel trying to fix it Room not female friendly more geared to businessmen Bathroom magnifying mirror too high for ladies , Clean comfortable bedroom Staff very helpful

223396,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No porter to help us with our luggage Card did not work and had to get replaced numerous times Rude staff when asked them to help us with the heavy luggage Only provided us with water on the first night Lack of security as no card is needed to use the elevators , Clean interior Acceptable room size Secure location Walking distance from South Kensington restaurants Harrods

223415,Rydges Kensington Hotel, I think for the money we paid I expected something a little better The executive suite set up is a bit strange the bedroom is in the larger room and then off to the side is the lounge From the description it sounded as though we would have a large lounge area and then a private bedroom which would make more sense We couldn t use the television properly the whole time because it said we were not checked in I called reception about this but the issue wasn t fixed The hotel looks nice from the outside and the lobby is ok but it needs a fresher look in terms of furnishings , The staff were very friendly

223482,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The entrance has steps only but my luggage was so heavy that can t even take it up but 2 young boys passed by to help out Receptionists do not smile much but they willing to help out and provide information The kettle in my room was rust with some oil they replaced another one for me when the house keeping came in the next day morning Someone made a mistake of thinking I want to arrange a bus to airport and forgot to remove the payment from the bill , The location is really good Tour bus and bus station is right outside of the hotel Post office is just across the street Restaurant Starbucks and Burger King so near the hotel within 3 mins Gloucester Road Underground is so nearby Size of room and bathroom are fair They places towels on a heater to warm up your towels during winter The size from hk is about the same The breakfast and food in the hotel is surprisingly good and the staff in the restaurant are really nice Receptionists at the lobby are quite professional They helped me to arrange car service immediately and keep the driver for me in the lobby although I was 30 mins late 
223483,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Dirty A C cold room no space to do anything but sleep in the room, Location is pretty good close to Hyde park Science and Natural History museums which were our targets Grocery 24 7 and restaurants nearby 
223484,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room extremely small Broken floor tile in bathroom and curtain next to bed was stained This was my 3rd stay at Rydges with previous visits rated much higher This was reported to staff who were uninterested, Good quiet area of London 
223485,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The room we stayed in 111 was very noisy every time another nearby room ran a tap had a shower flushed a toilet we could hear the drainage running through the room it was very loud The room was a lot smaller than I expected when I booked a Executive King room , Friendly staff
223486,Rydges Kensington Hotel, No early check in even though I am a regular customer I waited 5 hours for my room and was told it probably wouldn t be ready by check in time I won t be coming back I need a hotel I can get into by noon when flying all night from US ,No Positive

223488,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Room was a little smaller than expected for price paid and reviews read , Location Gloucester road underground was almost opposite This tube is an interchange with several lines passing through Stores such as boots a small tesco and waitrose were nearby Various eateries within 5 mins away too including Paul a money changer across the street for those who really needs it Staff were efficient and helpful esp the Cambodian or myanmese lady we met who studied in singapore

223493,Rydges Kensington Hotel, The only thing that I did not like was the pre authorisation on my credit card if for policy you need a pre authorisation I will then prefer to directly pay at check in instead than having the money frozen in my credit card , This is a very nice hotel extremely well located just in front of the tube and the staff has been very kind and service oriented one of the reception lady assisted my friend with her blocked suitcase I would definitely recommend 
223494,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Gym is well equipped but crammed into a small space in the basement with separate key access Clearly not used often Nice area to stay in but if you re a tourist you will want to take the tube elsewhere each day as not much to see do around the hotel , Located right at Gloucester tube stop so very easy to get to all three airports and the major tourist sites Stayed for several days and the staff were lovely to me Nice breakfast and everything you could need provided in the rooms Used the laundry service too which was great

223505,Rydges Kensington Hotel, Having stayed at Rydges before I was disappointed with the quality of the breakfast on this occasion No fresh coffee tea served at the table but only available from a self service machine Very little fresh fruit with tinned peaches on offer even though it was July with plenty of seasonal fruit available Bread was of poor quality mass produced pre sliced variety Very disappointing , Good location close to museums theaters Comfortable clean rooms 
223506,Rydges Kensington Hotel, They clean the room VERY late everyday we came back to hotel around 2 3pm everyday for a quick break and NOT ONCE was the room made despite us hanging the please clean room sign out early in the morning the shower is kinda funny too without no shower curtain or door to block the water from splashing out why , location close to tube and big bus tour stop safe neighbourhood room is quite spacious too with good bathroom facilities
