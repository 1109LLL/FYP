76390,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Extremely poor room service they mention 24 hrs service but had to wait for 3 hours for food better to eat dinner outside do not expect room servoce to even pick up your call at night had to walk to the front desk at 1 am to request for food and water , Excellent location and room
76391,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It would have been nice if the Hotel provided portable Wifi for guests As a first time visitor the city it would have been helpful , Staff was friendly and accommodating 
76392,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff were very polite and helpful The breakfast and food from the restaurant was very good We had a small issue with a leaking toilet and mentioned it at reception No big deal but later that night they sent up a lovely tray of refreshments and chocolates for our trouble It wasn t a hassle but a nice touch from the hotel The location is also fantastic about a minute walk to the tower and right next to the Aussie embassy Highly recommend this hotel def 5 5 
76393,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The view of the Eiffel tower from our balcony was AMAZING In fact the pics on the website don t even do it justice The hotel should really post better pics of the view would attract more people I think I m big on spacious balconies and amazing views so I was not disappointed They should definitely advertise better pics of it The beds were comfy shower was big having a bar downstairs was nice We didn t eat at the restaurant but it looked amazing 
76394,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, They walked into our room constantly which was frustrating Day one we walked into our room and stepped into a soaked carpet with our socks They also told us it was a King bed when it was really a Queen With this being said the world can t be perfect and after the first incident they went above and beyond to make it up to us We were treated like royalty and there s no doubt they take pride in customer service , The View The location The bathroom The Higher Level management and most of the staff 
76395,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Slow check in and check out and had to wait to check in which after over 20 hours of travel from Australia wasn t appreciated Staff not overly friendly or helpful , View of the Eiffel Tower and location
76396,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Shower design allowed water to spill on to the bathroom floor and puddle up Housekeeping was inconsistent Staff member on the morning of 6 19 gave me incorrect directions to 2 different places Rooms service was very inconsistent The first time we ordered it was spectacular and quick The second time similar item ordered it was like a completely different meal not as good and slow Missing side items condiments butter When we requested these items it took a real long time to get them The first order good day the server accidentally dropped a roll He ran out to get a new one I don t know how he got back so fast but it was less than 2 minutes He left the old roll so I know it was a different one Balcony is small but big enough for a chair or 2 would have been nice , Bed was comfortable the view was as promised most of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable AC worked well which was especially important during the major heatwave that hit when we were there 99 40 degrees 60 humidity Lot s of other tourists were complaining about sleepless nights at other hotels with no AC I d give the AC an American 8 10 and a European 10 10 They also have ice machines on every other floor that actually make ice Ice machines are American 7 10 but 10 10 for Europe 
76397,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing A little expensive but worth it for the comfort and view , Amazing views beautiful bathroom and the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept on 
76398,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, AVOID THIS HOTEL Terrible service Room smelled like cigarettes missed fireworks cause keys didn t work Had to walk 20 mins to hotel cause roads shut down for annual event no warning to us whatsoever Terrible value Only way to see Eiffel tower from our room was to lean out over balcony and look far right Room pictures and view misleading No A C or wasn t working AVOID THIS HOTEL , Location to tower Was closer walking distance 
76399,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The toilet stopped flushing but within 3 minutes after calling the front desk maintenance came up and fixed it immediately That was awesome , What I loved most is that we had a bedside view of the Eiffel Tower which is why we booked this hotel We did not know about the holiday events that would occur during our stay but as it turned out we had the best seat in the house for the fireworks show the staff was very friendly and helpful and the hotel is immaculate 
76400,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The Reception staff always looked very busy and hurried with our queries, The location with the balconies looking onto the Eiffel Tower was amazing The room was spacious and clean
76401,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Too little coffee in the room only enough for one cup each in the morning , Beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower during the fireworks display on Bastille Day 
76402,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The shower, Location The device that is provided at every room cell phone with internet which u can use outside the hotel very useful for google maps 
76403,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We did encounter a little problem with dinner at the hotel however the manager came over apologized and served complimentary champagne for the table , the location was excellent if you want close to the Eiffel tower Staff and managers were nice attentive and professional 
76404,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The waiting time to get into our room was ridiculous We were told it would be ready at 2 and it wasn t ready until 5 pm But once we got into our room the view was great and the room service was good too ,No Positive
76405,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The continental breakfast could have offered a more varied selection of fruit The room was expensive and a little smaller than expected but I felt comfortable in it , This hotel made my first solo trip birthday vacation to Paris a very pleasant experience Great location less than 4 minutes away from the Eiffel Tower Staff were friendly and professional and they give you free chocolate bars for your birthday The room I stayed in Deluxe King Suite with a balcony view of the Eiffel Tower was quiet and comfortable I recommend this hotel for first timers solo trippers and couples looking for a romantic getaway 
76406,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Check In The lobby is a bit confusing as there is a check in table in the middle of the lobby and a traditional check out area set up in the back There is not a clear indication of where to form a queue The wait was approximately 15min Although Pullman is a chain they don t have the same standards as a Marriott or a Hilton The check in clerk kept repeating loudly our room number Not comforting to two women checking in The Room Service The only problem with the room is the mini fridge is completely stocked with beverages for purchase so essentially useless common but annoying We called for a wine opener never came We called for toilet paper more towels since we didn t get turnover it didn t come until we called again an hour later On top of this the gentleman delivering these items had a major attitude I had to stop myself from laughing at him Half way through our 5 night stay our keycard stopped working apparently they were having computer issues Sometimes we would return late and there would be no one in the lobby except the front desk staff they would look at us but never greet us Same level of service for our check out no taxis were lined up so the hotel staff shrugged and walked off Thank goodness Paris had Uber which we used fairly frequently Special Requests This hotel does NOT accommodate special requests or is not equipped to I sent an email to the hotel concierge staff in regards to procuring a reservation at a restaurant No response We also called ahead a few days prior to let them know we will be expecting a package our WiFi JetPack a day prior to our arrival to ensure it was not rejected It was rejected Although when our luggage never came Aegean Airlines they did deliver it to our room at 2am which worked for us because we desperately needed it , The Room We got two twin beds with a view of the Eiffel Tower Not much space but the view was worth it I also loved that the window to our room opened not something you find in the US anymore The room included two robes and slippers The beds were comfy There was an overhead shower and the standard shower option There were also free movies available in the TV menu The Hotel The breakfast was pricey as hotel breakfasts tend to be but it was amazing and the host was very accomodating It was raining off and on most of our trip beginning of July the hotel had sturdy umbrellas ready to go for our use The Fitness Center I was also informed by my friend the fitness center is amazing It had a panoramic view of the Eiffel Tower and was stocked with waters and fruit It was also empty most of the time All and all the rooms and facility were clean and comfortable 
76407,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I was entirely underwhelmed by my experience staying at this property Though the location is fantastic many negative factors came into play My wife and I arrived early in Paris and left our bags with the valet When we returned to pick up our room keys at 2 pm we had to wait for 30 minutes as only two people were there not only checking in guests but acting as concierge at the same time When we finally did get our room keys they said they would have someone bring up the bags After sitting in the room for an hour and exhausted after traveling for 21 hours we went downstairs where the guy who was suppose to deliver our bags said they never gave him the ticket We carried our own bags up to the room where once we pulled the sheets back on the bed saw that the mattress cover was entirely too small for the bed leaving a 6 inch gap on all sides and effectively making the bed one size smaller Every single time I tried to order room service no one ever answered the phone Eventually a recorded message only in French came on then hung up on us After the third time no one answered the room service line I rang the front desk and they said they would have room service call us back which they finally did 15 minutes later as we were about to leave to head out to find food elsewhere Only about half of the nozzles in the rain shower head worked When we went to use the workout room we found worms in the two nectarines we tried to eat I know this one isn t the hotels fault per se but was indicative of our experience The room next to us had what I assume was a wakeup call every morning though no one ever answered their phone and it rang continuously Other than the location I would not recommend this property , The location was incredibly close to the Eiffel Tower and the metro
76408,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, If the ground floor restaurant bar could have a stronger air container the dinning condition will be even better Was a bit hot in the restaurant for our dinner , Second time stay in this hotel All the staffs in the hotel were very nice and helpful Especially the gentleman called Dominique who works at the front service counter Both the breakfast on the hotel s basement level and the dinner on the ground level were great Definitely will come back again 
76409,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Check in was annoying and delayed as 1 hour The check our was realy early and no exceptions though the hotel checked us in late one hour, The view of Eiffel tour from the room was amazing The bathroom was big tidy fresh The staff were friendly and helpfull Checking was early but the hotel kept our luggages stored safely till 5 pm
76410,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The bed was incredible Slept amazingly The room was perfect Great view of Eiffel Tower And the hotel staff made it extra special for my partners birthday 
76411,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There was a bath shower in the room not good for me as I have hip problem Also there was only one drawer an it was tiny , Love everything about Pullman hotel staff and beautiful view of Eiffel Tower from the room 
76412,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bed was too hard for me but better than some , The balcony was a real balcony you could sit and walk on The view was spectacular of the Eiffel Tower We could see all but the bottom piers This is from a superior twin with view Fluffy towels bathrobes slippers room bigger than average Good breakfast choice inc gluten free Good restaurant with terrific staff 
76413,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Whilst the view was stunning it s quite a walk to all the other attractions in Paris so getting around requires an uber or taxi unless your a keen Walker or comfortable with public transport, Providing you book a suite as we did the view is incredible and you can t get closer to the eiffel tower I can t speak for standard rooms however
76414,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The room was average for what you pay for it , The photos in the room information where incorrect and where changed after I had book the room Not happy 
76415,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, AC not really working in the room Fan very noisy and difficult to sleep Room not smelling good Room Service inexisting I called 4 times at 23 00 and no one answer Need to go to reception to order drink and just one guy in room servoce for 400 rooms Twenty minutes to wait at the bar to se one waiter bringing Menu then 30 minutes for two glasses of wine then I had to go myself to the bar to get ice cubes because waiter forgot and after all 10 minutes to wait for paying and no way to charge the room TV system very slow and poor quality Only two coffee capsule why not just one , Bed was nice 
76416,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Only thing that could possibly be improved is the restaurant service not appalling but service was bit slow and unorganised and had to ask for dessert menu 3 times as kept getting forgot about But apart from service food was very good ,No Positive
76417,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel smells badly The rooms smell of manure The managers kept asking us if we would like them to spray the room It was impossible to sleep there comfortably At 400 night it is just bad Nice clean bathrooms but I called twice to get more coffee in the room and no one assisted The actual room is poorly decodated and I m pretty sure the smells comes from the cheap PU furniture Wouldn t recommend although the rooms manager tried to apologise and gave us some chocolate I hardly ever review a hotel negatively as I stay in pretty good places and it s hardly ever necessary to write a bad review but this was quite disappointing ,No Positive
76418,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I had booked a deluxe tower view room and had made contact via telephone to guarantee optimal room for a wedding proposal plan Turned up Was given access card to a room that was already occupied and had people in the room where out baggage and engagement ring had been sent to Then there were no rooms so given a disabled access room 2 floors below overlooking the football pitch Nowhere near what I had booked or paid for and pre arranged Once given that room Bose sound system didn t work and had to call to replace it The maintenance person just let himself into our room and my partner was getting into her robe It was one thing after another and I will list my full experience in a detailed complaint I had set about writing a detailed gym review and have this featured on my site but unless invited back to experience a stay I should have received I have completely given up on any such report , It was only a 1 night stay
76419,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Expected room to be slightly larger and would have liked a balcony to enjoy the Eiffel Tower views better , Fantastic location Could see Eiffel Tower from bedroom window Great service Fantastic night sleep comfy bed quiet location 
76420,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Tea coffee in the room along with the bottled water replenishment is a bit hit and miss Bed was extra large sprung loaded metal frame made some weird noises but made the room smaller than it actually was , Staff were very smart polite and helpful and most were fluent in English The room and shower room were very clean and tidy The shower room had both a hand held and drench showers We had an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower from our room on the seventh floor making the hotel ideally located to reach most of the tourist attractions 5 minute walk to Eiffel Tower Breakfast was brilliant massive selection of food and drink Would definitely book again
76421,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , The Eiffel Tower view rooms with balcony are exceptional We travel quite a bit and have been to many beautiful places This is by far the most iconic and breathtaking view Direct unobstructed view of the Eiffel Tower Also great breakfast with so much variety 
76422,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Check in time took a longer then anywhere else I ve stayed The mini bar is a pain can t use the fridge because it s sensored and you that charged But no worries as you can tell them on checkout and we had no worries at all Chairs on balcony would have been great , View was stunning gave us a high room the bed was super comfy and shower was good Bit of a touristy area for dinner but still managed to find somewhere nice Staff very courteous
76423,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Eiffel Tower view picture in advertising is false Paid extra for the Eiffel Tower view as in the advertising but that doesn t exist Very disappointing and the ONLY reason I booked this hotel , Modern feel
76424,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Front desk was slow After a long flight with a todler we still had to wait more than 2 hours to check in the room with a todler , The facillity has a great location staff was polite clean rooms and a wonderful breakfast 
76425,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I had no electricity two times in 12 hours Each time it took the reception 2 hours to send a technician to just switch the button back on I had no battery charge on my mobile Hotel s phone was not working without electricity So i had to go up and down for many times , Location and furniture 
76426,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only negative thing that happened was a lady in the hotel bar She is not nice she needs to be pleasant coz your dealing with customers , Almost perfect specially Vincent at the concierge he was so helpful and benjamin look for them in the hotel 
76427,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The pictures show a view of the Eiffel Tower from the window Most of the view rooms for which you pay a higher price require stepping onto the balcony and leaning over the railing to see the tower Very disappointing , We liked the location near the Eiffel Tower and the Seine River 
76428,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Location close to the Eiffel tower within walking distance view from the bedroom window of the ET was spectacular especially in the evenings The staff were extremely helpful and all spoke English Breakfast was excellent Will definitely consider staying here again , Could not fault anything 
76429,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff the location the view of the tower and the whole hotel is amazing We spent one of the best days of our lives there Thank You for everything 
76430,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Having a pool would have been great Premium wifi connection should be available in all rooms , The hotel s super close to Eiffel Tower and a three minute walk to the metro Best value The staff s very friendly and the service was excellent Would definitely come back 
76431,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Didnt like price was for 2 night 765 eur but breakfast not included room was small and TV was so hard to understand that I gave up didnt got TV used because too much buttons apps etc on the screen Better is look my own computer and not to use TV Internet not working correctly Every item seems to be overdesigned like reception no regular reception desks so you never understand are you in line or not Mini bar didnt have any wines inside , Like this organic garden with beehives and hens View was excellent 
76432,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Booked this as a special treat for my partner Hotel position food and room were all good but for the cost and the star rating it didn t feel special and we didn t feel looked after , Good position We did have a view of the Eiffel Tower which was really good Modern clean hotel 
76433,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, none, Its my favorite hotel in Paris to be exact this was my third time we stayed in this hotel What I like most is that its just a walking distance to the Eiffel Tower a great location for sightseeing taxis just outside the hotel friendly and accommodating staff Clean and comfortable 
76434,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Check In There is a large open plan lobby and a large desk in the middle It s a little like an Apple Store in the way they try and manage guests but with so many internationals it can get confusing Very dissapointed that our room was not ready for over 90 minutes after we were supposed to check in Very dissapointed that a bottle ordered to be placed in the room was charged for but upon arrival was not available Could have gor in touch and I could have made changes as it happed a birthday treat was instead cancelled , After driving for 8 hours we were looking to getting into our room at 14 00 the agreed check in time Room was not ready for another 90 minutes we were given a free dink in the bar after the third attempt to check in The view was great but you did have to crane your neck slighty to get around the obstrctions 9th Floor As a birthday treat I had ordered a bottle of champange to be placed in the room This was charged for in advance 105 Euros No bottle in room and none in stock could have told me in advance before arrival We were fortunate with parking parking straight outside the hotel entrance There is a public car park nearby underground and secure and costs 35 Euros per day Breakfast was a treat Overall this is a busy executive hotel The staff are generally friendly and courteous apart from the one who tried to Upsell our Deluxe Double Room to the Pullman Suite at 10x the price Would stay here again but would look at others before booking 
76435,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Our Eiffel Tower view king room with the balcony required you to have to lean over the balcony to even see it Do not order the steak We ordered it and it looked great but after one bite we were so disgusted I almost got sick In fact my daughter did get sick It didn t even taste like beef I m not sure what it was but it was very bizarre and we both still have trouble eating steak because of this experience The staff was very nice and made sure they apologized and refunded me for the bad steak Honestly the food wasn t very good The only things we could eat were the French fries and bread So we ordered room service every night Champagne wine French fries and bread Also be careful not to have any accidents while there Don t spill your wine or ketchup on the carpet because there are no towels to clean it up with and they will charge you a fee We were charged 500 euro cleaning fee because my son spilled ketchup on the carpet and I wasn t able to get it out I personally never thought the room was super clean even when we checked in Maybe I am wrong but I thought 500 euro was a little steep for that I would have understood paying 250 euro but maybe they don t have access to the same cleaning supplies I am accustomed to , The bed was comfortable and the staff was very friendly and accommodating Close to Eiffel Tower
76436,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Their policy which allow children under 12 years old free of charge if stay in exiting bed but when I checked in they told me that the room that I booked can only stay 2 persons due to security reason They charged me more for EUR60 per night which I think it does not fair to me because I already followed the policy and did confirm it again through email but they still want to charge me by the stupid reason about security policy , Eiffel Tower view from my room as I wished
76437,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, No electric for the coffee maker and the bathroom outlet they were on the same circuit so no using the hair dryer in the bathroom Bathroom door hinge make enough noise to wake the dead I went down to the front desk twice to let them know and nothing was done about it , Great location
76438,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It was said that the room measured 32m square however was disappointed because it looked way smaller taking into account that I have stayed in rooms that are 32m square before , The view of the eiffel tower outside our room
76439,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Constant banging from upstairs or next door from possible cleaning couldn t fully relax , Clean and lovely decoration staff lovely and very helpful 
76440,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The reception desk manger Antonine is very arrogant rude impolite we tried to request for late check out because previous night was my birthday and we were very late He refused and we started packing our stuff He kept calling in the room and we did not pick up and he cut off our TV and send message through TV Actually we did not watch TV anyway because we were busy on packing and check out on 12 00 noon The way he did is very unnecessary call on phone and cut off the TV OMG We spend USD900 for 2 night in this hotel and get this type of service The reception desk need get some training The night we check in was very late around 1 30AM The guy in the reception desk keep watch something in his computer and I can see what he is watch because the reception desk is open you can see what he is watching I told him I need to Check IN He was so surprise and replied to you CHECK IN I said YEAH He was so unfriendly that I felt I was disturbing him You are on 24 hrs reception desk in PULLMAN PARIS YOU NEED TO WORK , Most of the staff is very nice breakfast chef waitress are very good expect the breakfast reception The hotel manager Younan Taho is very helpful 
76441,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I overpaid for the room too much because its too expensive for that kind of rooms It was written that if I will find a cheaper offer I will refund the difference it did not happen I found cheaper room with the breakfest included in booking com two days before our trip In hotel we dont ask the money back but only the breakfest for free for one day They dont support us Our room for was not prepared in time Personal said to arrive at 2pm we arrive at 5pm and the room was still not ready for use Three days to lift corridors on the ground stood empty bottle of cola and chocolate paper Three days there was nobody to unable to clean , From the balcony had seen the Eiffel Tower 
76442,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, This was an email that I sent to their operations manager when he asked what they could improve on As per your request here is a list of the specifics of what your hotel could do to meet the minimum global standards of customer service 1 Train your staff to welcome guests every time they walk into the hotel I stayed at your hotel for a week and I was NEVER greeted with a hello good morning bon jour or anything else 2 Train your staff to smile there is nothing more universal than the power of it Your staff is rude when approached to the point that I wonder if they chose the right career hospitality industry or if they really enjoy their job They felt bothered and inconvenienced when asked a simple question You cannot train your employees to ask guests if they have any questions then get upset when they do 3 When I called the front desk for recommendations for restaurants in the vicinity of the Moulin Rouge they said that they would have to call me back however they never did 4 Train your staff to not knock on guests room door to check on the mini bar when you are naked in the room taking a nap do this when guests are not in the room Above all do not open the door and disturb your guests sleep 5 Teach your staff the difference between a birthday and an anniversary I received a birthday card as opposed to a happy anniversary card Once again your staff knocked on my room door to deliver an incorrect celebratory card while I was taking a nap You can also improve their English language comprehension skills 6 Train your maintenance staff that there is nothing wrong with giving guests ONE extra coffee pod when asked per person staying in the room After spending a week at your hotel the value of ONE additional coffee pod is insignificant less than 1 Euro maybe , The view was awesome The bed was comfortable 
76443,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I tried to change the room view but the staff were not helpfull Unfortunately in booking there was no sign where will be the view of the room as I was under the impression that al the rooms have a view on the Eiffel Tour, No special to share
76444,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Early check in will charge additional fee, Location is excellent 2 minutes walk to Eiffel tower 3 minutes to the metro and RER stations Friendly staff and good breakfast as well
76445,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Reception Even speaking the language could not help this pitiful experience Not even a Thank you or F you when checking out, The view off the balcony of the Eiffel Tower was amazing The bed was very comfortable 
76446,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was the same everyday standard Nothing special or local menu It was bland I booked s suite for my family and paid a lot of money per night It just wasn t worth it unfortunately The only good thing about this location is it s location The views are amzaimg if you get in the Eiffel Tower side Local to tourists and good cafe restaurants walking distance It s good for a short visit 2 3 days,No Positive
76447,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Very helpful staff especially one particular lady who helped us deal with Air France who had lost our luggage Sadly she could not get them to deliver the bags before we left Super close to Eiffel Tower a 3 minute walk away plus only 5 mins from the Metro so all in all a great location Served breakfast until 10 30 which was also good Picture was taken from the room balcony 
76448,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Food quality room location eiffel tower view was mialeading and inaccurate Pic in booking com must be removed with actual one U still see the tower but never from inside the room except at one corner No tablet in room while during booking it was part of the service, Service caring staff and friendly
76449,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The staff looked that they were too overwhelmed We had to wait in line for 30 minutes to check in And mainly it is way too overpriced , The location of the hotel is certainly its selling point It s literally just a stone throw s distance from the Eiffel Tower The breakfast was good had a lot of variety The rooms were good nothing extraordinary 
76450,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room temperature during winter due to centralized heating is only warm Didn t sleep well at all due to this , Comfortable bed and good view that was allocated Fantastic proximity to the Eiffel Tower 
76451,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, we were not welcomed on arrival and at to find out for ourselves how check in worked The whole system of checking in and out of the hotel is a complete shambles A pricie hotel which lacks that personal customer service I rang to request additional milk pods from reception Waited 15 minutes and still no milk Telephoned reception again and then after waiting another 15 minutes 2 lots arrived I wouldn t recommend this hotel unless the price was reduced Not value for money ,No Positive
76452,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The price can be a bit lower we chose this hotel just because I wanted to spend my birthday there Which means if we do not have any special date we will not consider this hotel , The Effiel was exactly near the hotel but our room was in third floor which could not probably see the whole face of Effiel The gym was nice quite many facilities Also the breakfast was good 
76453,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The free wifi was useless and the bed even thought it was comfy it kept moving and making sounds even if all you did was sit or roll over on the bed , Fantastic view of the tower great restaurants and great souviner shops around the hotel The hotel also provides you with a free bottle of water tea coffee and light snack in the room Also a taxi seems to be available 24 hours of the day 
76454,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I wish they would have had a table and chairs on the balcony of the deluxe eiffel view room The picture that was shown on the website was misleading , The view was awesome 
76455,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I told staff about late check out before 2days and they accepted that but On check out day Suddenly they told me I can use late check out so I have to check out 12 00 They told me 11 30 I just slept in that time How could I pack and shower within 30min I didn t understand that They should had told me before 1days or minimum 2hours ,No Positive
76456,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I liked nothing it took 3 hours to check in because the rooms were not ready at check in time of 2pm we arrived at 3pm The hotel was dirty the one room we were given initially had not been cleaned and had hair in the bed and shower Filthy corridor to rooms So many problems on check out taking a long time because they tried to charge us for extra breakfasts eaten in the restaurant which we did not and had ordered room service A shambles and will never and tell all my colleagues and friends to never book this hotel Appalling value for money ,No Positive
76457,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor service untrained staff shambolic check in conducted with PCs on tables in the lobby queues for lifts 1 out of 3 only was working , Good location comfortable rooms
76458,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Our maid service was lacking Did not restock TP coffee etc Had to go get ourselves, The full American Breakfast that we included in our stay was fabulous and got us off to a great start every day
76459,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Not the warmest of greetings at check in No table and chairs on the balcony to sit and enjoy the view Not enough tea bags left in room but that was only a minor detail, Location and view of Eiffel Tower Clean simple room
76460,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The restaurant and bar staff were rude and acted put out when we walked in with our group of 10 several times Sunday evening the bar tender stood at the bar angry complaining to his friend so loudly we could hear across the room However the food and drinks were excellent , The hotel staff was friendly and helpful 
76461,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There are no table and chairs in the balcony to enjoy the view of the Effel Tower The shower in room kept on getting flooded as there was no glass panel stopping the water from coming out of the shower area We had to use an extra body towel to use for the extra water , Staff were lovely could have done more coffee in the room Breakfast was great especially the female chef 
76462,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, That I had to leave, The location and ease to get too was a real bonus as I was only in Paris for the weekend The staff were so helpful and accommodating and we were made to feel very welcome 
76463,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The shower head was not in an ideal place It was able to be moved from 2 different height shower heads and when in the top one the water sprayed across to the other side of the shower not down I would put the bed in a different spot next to the window so you possibly wake up with a view of the tower, We were on the 9th floor the view was amazing 
76464,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, So we got the deluxe king room and it was such a huge disappointment The eiffel view basically means you ll hardly see the eiffel on the right handside behind a huge tree and pillars Such a waste of money When we addressed this the guy at the front reception said it s called clever marketing more like customer deception Anyway the manager was a very lvoely helpful woman and she said she d give us a smaller room but with a better view but we couldnt be refunded the amount we paid for the dekuxe king room Later on our friend wasnt well at night and the staff was extremely unhelpful They wouldnt call the hospital or the ambulance and while our friend clenched her chest and was throwing up they were just on the phone insisting we get a private doctor and just wouldnt call the ambulance It was an extremely traumatizing experience and their customer service needs to be worked on tremendously We had paid for two nights but checked out the very same night and didnt even get a refund ,No Positive
76465,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We ordered a room with view of Eiffel Tower at 373 euros but the room is small and we had completely no view of the tower inside the room The tower can only be seen at the balcony and we only managed to see the tower 5 mins every half hour because it s too cold in winter to stay at the balcony The upstairs are having party and it was very noisy It is the worst part of our Paris trip ,No Positive
76466,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Can t think of anything , The property was selected for the view and the view did not disappoint People need to understand that the view is off to the side so most rooms you will need to walk out on to the balcony and look right to see the Eiffel Tower but you won t be disappointed Location was close to convenient RER and Metro stations that will take you to all the great sights The room was very comfortable bed was amazing and shower was great Room service was quick and the food tasty Breakfast is self service and the food was great Internet was easy to access and fast for most purposes For the money I was very pleased with the stay overall If I had ridiculous money to spend I would have chosen the Park Hyatt Vendome or the Ritz Paris but The Pullman provides a memorable experience for a reasonable price of course I stayed off season too 
76467,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Everything about our stay was of a high standard The view was amazing and the hotel is located literally a minute walk from the Eiffel Tower The staff cannot do enough for you and are all pleasant and polite and go that extra mile when called upon 
76468,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Not really bothered but a pool spa would have been nice , The view and nespressos were brilliant The restaurant also had great food and service 
76469,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Jeff made the experience so good there was nothing I didn t like , One of the workers called Jeff was very very friendly and delivered great customer service when I come back to Paris I would book the same hotel He helped us a lot and in the three days we were there he made our stay more enjoyable 
76470,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Staff was very helpful polite very accommodating I did not have one bad experience with anyone Everybody was happy to go over the top and provide great service The location is great 
76471,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, All went wrong last day cleaning staff entering room unannounced and completely ignored Do Not Disturb Come back later on the door very rude i was asked When are you leaving by cleaner they do not clean anything apart from making the bed and replaced towels once I was charged 130euros for someone elses dinner took reception 38 minutes to sort it out and give me a refund almost missed EuroStar , Breakfast was great location and overall experience was good 
76472,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I had two of the best rooms in hotel but it was my worest experience ever The stuff and the services are so bad unprofessional treatments towards their clients useless reception they don t answer at all they were holding my bags and my stuff to pay 50 euros for the bar I never seen hotel worest then this one I don t recommend it to anyone poor view also it s not like what u have seen in the pictures, The location only
76473,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Everything was exceptional the location the hotel itself the room the view the comfort the staff the amenities and especially the yummy breakfast 
76474,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, we arrived from USA at 630 in the morning took a cab and got to the hotel at 830 i had called and requested early ckin when we got to the hotel they had rooms for us to ckin but they charged us extra on top of what we paid i did not think that was right we had had friends who ckecked into hotel nearby n they did not charge them ne extra for early ckeckin also they no free wifi , bed was very comfy hotel good location 
76475,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff are always really helpful and always go the extra mille for making us feel very welcome I stay at this specific hotel very often and it s always a pleasure to come back 
76476,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff were brilliant They were all very helpful and very patient with us Especially the breakfast staff considering we travelled with 1 year old twins who are a bit cranky in the morning before they ve had breakfast The location is fabulous and totally worth the price of the rooms considering its location and proximity to everything 
76477,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, To start off they messed up my reservation I went there with my daughter for New Years wanted a room with a view of the tower and what I got after getting it squared away was first floor with a view of bee hives and a winter garden after talking with another woman they had messed her stay as well emailing later that they had her room that she wanted available for a fee I had gotten the same email after talking to her I knew for sure it was a scam and restaurant is a joke got med hamburgers that were barely touched the heat of the skillet and sadly enough for French cuisine the best thing we had at that restaurant was mac cheese and the staff was to blame I m sure for that, Location and a nice bed
76478,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The check in was a massive mess took so long and we kept being moved from one floor to the other despite upgrading to the deluxe room all this was because we asked for adjacent rooms We lost track at the end Otherwise everything else was great, Amazing view of the Eiffel tour excellent location
76479,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, the beds were more comfortable before the renovation of the hotel There was a bad persistent smell like cigars even though we demanded a non smoking room We had to aerate the room each time we enter , Location and the astonishing view of eiffel tower
76480,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The beds were too small I took only two drinks from the fridge refrigerator and they billed me 35 euros I asked the staff memeber and he told me I had 4 drinks I contested it but was told I will have to pay the 35 euros , The location and the balcony with Eiffel Tower view 
76481,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, After initial check in staff on front desk were not helpful or cared There was a conference AND the hotel sponsored a major sporting event so our floor was noisy and not secure as promised When we asked for another room they were too full and offered a downgraded room on a lower floor with no view and no compensation for our situation as we were not part of the conference or sport event Very disappointed Went to use the iron and wisely rethought the process wires were loose and dangerous Not what I expected from a Pullman Hotel , The pastries were amazing at breakfast View from our room was spectacular 
76482,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Small dislike was shower partition did not sit properly on bath so water went all over the floor everytime you had a shower, Staff at reception breakfast area were very helpful and friendly Buffet breakfast was very satisfying and a great way to start the day
76483,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Actually everything was perfect with Pullman Hotel but after we checked out on Dec 23rd around 10AM they sent us email at 7 40PM told us that the housekeeper couldn t find the hairdryer in our room and they wanted to charge us 80 We didn t take the hairdryer and we explained to them where we put the hairdryer back to it s place They replied that they will check again to the housekeeping and until now still no news from them I hope they already find the hairdryer and I still wait for my credit card bill to make sure there is no charge from Pullman Hotel , The Hotel is very near from Eiffel Tower 2mins walking distance The room was spacious and very clean They upgraded our room from superior king room eiffel tower view to balcony eiffel tower view because that was our honeymoon trip Thank you so much Pullman 
76484,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Staff entered our room when we were sleeping to be fair though we didn t put a Do not disturb sign on the door , Very sleek and modern me and my girlfriend loved it 
76485,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The breakfast was disappointing There should be more varieties and it is a bit expensive, Ww had a small problem with our booking and the staff dealt with it professionally specially Fabio He was really helpful The location is the best It s like 5 min walk to Eiffel Tower and 20 min walk to Champs elysees It was my second time staying in this hotel and definitely will go back again 
76486,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast is a little monotonous 4 days of the same food is no fun, Perfect unbeatable view of the Effiel the room is spacious and comfy the concierge is also the most willing team ive seen they zoom for your baggages the instant they see it great place with great people
76487,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Apart from the price you cannot fault this hotel for anything But saying that their clientele are the type that would afford such a price The staff were amazing and really did try go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable We had one of the Eiffel tower view rooms and words cannot describe how great this room was the view over the field across the road and then through to the tower on the right is exceptional The amenities were great and they offered loads of free movies and tv to watch the breakfast were excellent and offered something for all tastes I really do enjoy a breakfast buffet that also has a chef to cook you a nice fresh omelette And location just steps from the Eiffel tower Another plus was the wifi was the best we had on our whole trip around Europe Thank You Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower for a great stay 
76488,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Free wifi was little slow even for the free wifi Collapsed sometimes But everything in the end was done , Bed was very good Have to change my home bed now Breakfast was very awsome 
76489,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Curtainless shower area makes the bathroom floor wet and the shower water was not really hot enough , The hotel was quiet and very well placed for immediate access to many of the prime tourist destinations 
76490,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I thought breakfast could have had a wider selection and real barista coffee A little more equipment in the hotel gym and this hotel would have gotten a 10 from me , Good quality breakfast even if the selection could be a little wider Staff was excellent all from frontdesk restaurant to housekeeping and The older man at the eggstation in breakfast was very outgoing Comfortable beds and View of the Eiffel from the balcony Food in Frame restaurant was great and the salmon with pancake in room service was exceptionel
76491,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We found that the breakfast dining room was excessively warm to a point of been uncomfortable also A full length dressing mirror in the room would have been appreciated , The helpfulness and the friendliness of the staff with a view of the Eiffel Tower the room was great and the set up of the room 
76492,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The service was excellent And the staff really nice Our room view was exactly how described in pictures when we booked It was the perfect ending for our honeymoon in Europe 
76493,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We had only 1 by 40ml bottle of shampoo and same shower gel for 2 days for 2 me and my wife 8 15 am second day I was woke up by a housekeeper who opened the door and stepped in , Location is perfect A very nice place I would definitely recommend this hotel 
76494,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The room service was slow The breakfast was included in the price but it s the same everyday some of the staff it s hard to deal with because they don t have good English , Overall it was a pleasant stay and a wonderful view on Eiffel Tower from the balcony Nice and helpful staff The Perfect location near ber hakiem station 2 min walk from the hotel nice decorations 
76495,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Access to the closet was limited and made it a bit challenging to access clothes minor inconvenience , Staff were helpful and polite view was great room was nice especially the bathroom 
76496,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, No chairs or a table in the balcony the Indian receptionist his name is Akash or near this name he wasn t helpful at all , Location restaurant staff
76497,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Would have liked spa facilities Also room service took nearly an hour over 30 min longer than I was told when I ordered Disappointing , Loved the view from my balcony Perfect The bed and room were absolutely comfortable and well furnished 
76498,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing at all , The food the staff the deluxe room the view could not fault it and would stay there again if I ever do come back to the beautiful city 
76499,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Our mini bar was not filled up every morning I spoke to 3 different staff members and nothing was done about it , We loved the comfort on the bed so relaxing Most staff was pretty helpful We couldn t of asked for a better view was out of this world 
76500,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Many things didn t work in our room as soon as we arrived Asked front desk to have them fixed We were promised right away After 3 days still broken We were given an email address to write to about our problems but more than 3 weeks later no reply I wouldn t stay in this hotel again if they paid me Also pickpockets right outside front door of hotel but hotel doesn t tell you to beware nor do they chase them off They tried to steal my purse broke the handle but luckily I had a tight hold on it Very poor experience at Pullman This hotel is only good for the view but I d recommend you stay somewhere else visit the Eiffel Tower in person Front desk man who checked us in was very rude , Breakfast wasn t bad but it was expensive Parking was convenient garage under hotel but 34 euros a day 
76501,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Not all staff were friendly in reception not bother to help One of the receptionist was impatient I was asking for car service and he thought I was asking for card so he interrupted me and asked me for the room number and gave the room key card Without even asking me questions With the security issues in Paris they should be more careful and cautious when guests ask for extra key At least as for the name booked under the room , Check in was smooth friendly reception one person only Felt welcomed
76502,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast could have been better Good variety though , Loved the simplicity of the reception rooms are fabulous Eiffel tower kept glittering our nights in the room Location is excellent too 
76503,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Eiffel Tower view means that you need to bend over your balcony to see it Hard pillows Bose Sound system is just for iPhone 4 We are in 2016 and they have not noticed Very expensive for what is offered I will never do it again , Big room with a desk and small couch comfortable big bed Location very near Eiffel Tower
76504,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Couldn t make a nice cup of tea to start the day as the water was tepid I am a tea person I had to resort to smoothie or juice which were excellent I like a cup of tea at breakfast time I had to go back in my room to make a nice cup of tea , Nice breakfast loved the fruit salad the big fresh croissant excellent service at the reception Mr Vishal was superb upgraded our room and overall we met nice people ready to help and provide with info the service was excellent 
76505,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Absolutely Nothing its my new favourite hotel in Europe , starting from the moment you arrive till the moment you leave you will be treated professionally and the team will do their best to make your stay better i was planning to stay one night and i extended it to 3 nights well decorated specious rooms with great attention to details throughout the facility friendly professional staff who are welcoming all the time including the deputy general manager Free shuttle to downtown 10 15 minutes very nice breakfast with good variety and options comfy beds free mini bar 
76506,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The best view ever The room was on the 9th floor We could see Eifel tower from the bottom to the top very close Great service Had lunch in the restaurant only once liked it very much The room was nice clean light Loved everything 
76507,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We didn t like the room service as the food that we ordered was either warm or cold and when I asked if the food could be delivered hot I was told that they could not guarantee that As for information you have to ask for it then I asked if they had a bus timetable but was told to go to the Metro to get that information would have been nice to have been told where the Metro was located We paid a lot of money for this 5 star hotel compared to the other 5 star hotels we stayed at I feel that overpaid for what we got , We loved the location we had a twin room with balcony and view of the Eiffel Tower the room was comfortable and very tidy Plus it was a short walk 4 minutes to the Eiffel Tower and public transport 
76508,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It was rather expensive and I wish they had warned us of people outside trying to get you to give money to deaf children which is clearly a scam , I loved the location the Eiffel Tower view and the staff were very friendly also loved the selection in the buffet breakfast 
76509,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Bed was so uncomfortable Do not get a good night sleep Staff sold me a plug converter as I forgot mine for me to only find out that they had uk plugs in the room I did say i forgot mine, The view from our room was great and the location was perfect 
76510,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Some smells in the bathroom coming from canalization Room a little bit small for a luxury room , very friendly and professional staff great location and view I love the design of the hotel the business center and the very good restaurant and bar with good wines 
76511,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Pillows alittle hard and the tower view you had to lean over the balcony Straight on view was of a track soccer field , Bed was great comfortable staff very helpful and friendly to Americans Restaurant has an amazing Truffle burger add avacodo fries to make a superb meal Note in the 3 days here we had 3 of them smile 
76512,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Wish there were more English speaking stations on tv like CNN BBC was the main choice The ac fan wasn t working It was a warm room We just used the window to cool down the room It was shoulder season so maybe only the heat worked but Paris was warm while we were there , The staff view from our room nice restaurant 
76513,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There s NOTHING that we didn t like about this hotel , Pullman hotel is a big WOW beautiful hotel and all of the staff there are lovely and respectful and also very helpful We definitely will go back to same hotel We got a beautiful view of Eiffel from our room 
76514,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, the room has nespresso machine but only 2 capsules are given not that great no spoons just a wood stick not great either do not like wood taste in my coffee the restaurant food was not that great either burger buns and chips burnt, the staff was very helpful especially virginia at reception was able to do free late check out that was ver practical
76515,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, can t think of a thing, Fantastic central location easy stroll to many sites Well appointed room Bose sound wave Nespresso with balcony view of Eiffel Tower Transportation at you doorstep Knowledgeable always available staff 
76516,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast can be better, Excellent location with easy access to major points in the city Very helpful staff I had a late lunch on the 2nd day of the stay just went to the bar restaurant on G floor I ordered a burger very surprising it was so good fresh meat hot juicy great french fries I seldom take such kind of junk food but this one really surprises me 
76517,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We got an Eiffel tower view which did not look like the picture could only see the tower if we stood on the balcony and looked right When I expressed my disappointment they said this was the best they could do , Great location nice modern hotel comfortable beds nice bathroom
76518,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Amazing view of the Eiffel Tower really comfortable bed and friendly staff Bit expensive but you have to expect that for the location view and high quality of the hotel 
76519,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The room was a bit small but for one night it was fine If I were staying for a week or more it would be a little too small , i only stayed one night but the location was fabulous and the breakfast was delicious 
76520,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The isolation between the rooms is extremely poor we could hear our neighbors and they could hear us, The design decor the view from the balcony is breathtaking
76521,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I m certain I reserved a Eiffel view with 2 twin beds balcony I ended up with a king bed no balcony I called Booking was told that wasn t what I reserved however I sent the reservation to my friend it stated otherwise Not sure where the discrepancy was but it wasn t correct , The bathroom is great with good water pressure in the shower nice amenities The view was amazing 
76522,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bedroom had very little storage space for clothes , The location is excellent close to bus tours boat trips and the Eiffel Tower is almost in the front garden The staff were helpful and friendly 
76523,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Hot food during breakfast both days i stayed was pretty cold And an odd damp smell in the corridor outside my room , Good breakfast selection amazing location rainfall shower in our room balcony view of the Eiffel tower nice restaurant 
76524,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The tea could have been hotter There is a need for an ice machine at this hotel We were told that there was no ice machine on our floor but on another floor After an extensive search we couldn t locate an ice machine so every night we had to call down to room service and have it sent to our room I, We liked the location We also liked the quality of food at breakfast 
76525,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Garden room had average views hallway airconditioning not working during a period of hot weather , Location great breakfast spread tablets provided instead of newspapers with wide range of newspapers loaded 
76526,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Overall we think this is an overpriced hotel with ok facilities After traveling through Europe we thinks this hotel is overpriced for the quality of service they offer Breakfast wasn t good they have a lot of selections but taste is just not good We ordered room service at midnight after a long flight and they didn t have anything hoy but only cold soup and fish They re no chef at night so you get only cold premade dishes Lobby is ugly and confusing and the staff it s not very helpful Our room overlooking the Eiffel Tower was expensive and we were left without electricity for more than an hour we keep asking for someone to come up a help us and they kept saying it was in his way but took a long time to get this solved , Close to the Eiffel Tower Clean room Nice view to the Eiffel Tower 
76527,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, there is no French touch design in the interior design , the location the view from the balcony with Eiffel tower view is amazing walking distance to Eiffel the staff very nice and good the room is clean good deep sleep comforting bed and pillow beautiful modern design 
76528,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Hello Thank you I booked and paid through Booking com with credit card my father at reception again asked for Credit card we gave 2nd credit card they have deducted same charges from the 2nd credit card Reception said the first deducted charges from first credit card which we booked through Booking com will be returned to the same card first card Yet no received It means that we have paid twice so far I wonder why reception deducted hotel charges whereas we paid it before arrival to the Hotel Pleased have your kind assistance 
76529,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Ice machine on our floor did not work Ice machine on next floor was locked out Drains in bathroom were plugged Very poor service for the price of the room ,No Positive
76530,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, the attitude of staffs especially at lobby feel not good nobody says hello to you mineral water is very expensive compare to other hotels which at least one bottle is free of charge never suggest to other friends about this hotel , Near the station
76531,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Chairs and a little table on the balconies facing the Eiffel tower would have made our stay better as we wanted to spend lots of time out there but had nothing to sit on brought the only inside chair outside but not very good Staff ok but being a large hotel not as friendly as they could be , Great bed good breakfast but the fabulous location is really the reason for my decision to stay at this Hotel
76532,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Extremely overpriced for what you got Concierge service was terrible not helpful and uninformed Room was small and didn t provide turndown service Room was small with little closet space I could go on , The shower was an american style and very nice View of the tower from the room was great but not as nice as expected Breakfast was very good and the room was clean 
76533,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Since it is a 4 star hotel would have been great if they also provide cutleries same as other top hotels if in case we want to have some wine and cheese in the room while enjoying the view , Our room has a great view of the Eiffel tower from our balcony It is very near Eiffelt Tower and we can stay late at Eiffel Tower 
76534,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, That I ended up getting charged for the free wifi That the sheets on the bed were not clean enough for me They had stains on them so I slept on top of the covers both nights at the Pullman My balcony door needed to be resealed the seal was very loose , I liked my view of the tower and that my breakfast was included The breakfast was pretty good It was nice to be close to many things to do 
76535,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing, I like everything The hospitality of the staff The room so clean The breakfast is fantastic And is only few step to Eiffel Tower n in the middle between 2 train station for ur access around Paris
76536,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The room was not very spacious but very nice anyway , The location is superb and the price reasonable I strongly advise that you check into a room with the Eiffel view if you decide to stay here 
76537,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Lack of information when we arrived about the Paris Marathon on the Sunday which restricted most forms of transport A mention at check in or a card in the room would have been helpful , The location was great for the final stage of our cycle from London
76538,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only thing we would have changes was the reception The check in took 30 minutes There was no order and we were cut in line twice It was chaotic , The breakfast was spectacular The hotel staff went out of their way to print things for us The view from our room of the Eiffel Tower 1037 was priceless 
76539,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We booked WELL in advance and paid for a lot for a nice room however on arrival we were very disappointed to only be on the first floor and have no view of the city After discussing with staff they moved us up BEWARE we had a balcony with tower view but that means we couldn t see the tower from the room only when we stepped onto the balcony Also there were no chairs etc in the room so couldn t actually sit on the balcony only stand , Obviously views of the tower Nice hotel well appointed
76540,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I don t usually complain but we just wanted a romantic night My 40th birthday with room service and movies We had some drinks in the lobby and was made to feel like we were about to do a runner on the bill as the bar tender demanded we pay for our drinks so that was the first awkward and embarrassing incident Second the movies would not work we had constant calls and technicians visit with still no success the movies never worked Room service food was ordinary have had better on a plane of which they forgot part of it so again we had more visitors Basically the night was a disaster and we did not get any peace until around 10pm The manager tried to appease us with Wine and chocolates which was nice but for the amount we paid for the room and have it ruined didn t really compensate , Great rooms and view of Eiffel tower although too pricey 
76541,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The shower water was luke warm The room initially had a strange smell The hotel staff are not the friendliest , Loved the location The chef who made the omlette was great The frame resturant is good too The fitness room was good 
76542,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Overpriced For the same money you can get 5 star hotel with better service and breakfast All for what you pay is view Eiffel Tower One of the best in the city Very romantic But if you prefer comfort design and location in the city center it s not a place for you , One of the best romantic view in the city Very friendly service reception
76543,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing at all Nil, Room just nice right size and cosy Breakfast provided with variety and choices location is quite strategic for visit to Eiffel Tower canal cruise and for meals at cafe and restaurants 
76544,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Double charged room tax upon checkout Now I have to fight them to get it back but saved receipts Just a hassle that otherwise marred a great stay , Very close to the Eiffel Tower Room was spacious bed was comfortable and the shower was great 
76545,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Everything The service is horrible Room service is more than horrible they even don t have a breakfast menu When I called to order and I ordered 3 times not once they say Call after 10 minutes and when I call to bring something like ice or ketchup they usually answer me like ok on the way and no one show up They don t clean the room they don t change the bedsheets They only fix the bed My stay was the worst ever I don t recommend at all Btw it was written like Garden view it wasn t a garden And when I asked to change my room view to the other side they asked me to pay 90 Euro , Nothing Maybe the receptionist the Asian lady she was nice and helpful 
76546,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing to be honest couldnt really fault it , Fantastic location Superb view of the Eiffel tower from the balcony cant beat it Great breakfest delivered to the room Lovely staff Clean modern facilities Loved our stay 
76547,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Our room literally looked like a prison cell It was incredibly stark and furnished like a cheap office , Thea s the most overpriced stark hotel I have ever stayed in Our room literally looked like a prison cell 
76548,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, In my room sometimes the facial basin is not in proper use need to wait for the water to flow down Ordered room service for the foie gras but got to eat the beet steak instead Some smell like drain or something in the room after we back from outside Housekeeper was forgot to give us the shampoo and shower cream for almost everyday and we need to call for it whenever we need to take a shower , Staffs are very nice and good courtesy and they can understand customers very well Location is just 3 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower and downtown to find the good foods in the evening time The inside Room Service is very awesome Good breakfast arrangement Very convenience to stay with all of the accessaries that you need Balcony with Eiffel tower view and football field is the best for our first time in Paris 
76549,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The balcony had a good view but it didn t have even a couple of chairs where to sit down , The room the staff the excellent breakfast and the excellent location
76550,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Mini bar drinks prices are a joke, Amazing location tri to get room with balcony well worth it food down stairs was lovly but the restaurant Opposite is amazing 
76551,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I have been robbed and the staff were not helpful Specially the receptionist After calling them over and over for an hour and then I told them there is no valuables in the the bag that they did not load to my car and when I got the bag 3 external Chargers were gone all usb wires Samsung laptop but I am grateful that after talking to them over the phone over and over for an hour till I said that there are no valuables in the bag just medication of my child and some medical documents that are very important the bag suddenly appeared after they have told me that it has been already kept in the taxi and it s not in the hotel and I had it delivered to me to the airport by my driver they didn t even offer any help as it was there mistake not loading my bag However I am thankful I got the bag back but it s outrageous that a 4 star hotel would go through my bag and take whatever they desire and lie about the bag till i said that there r no valuables It s pathetic , The view
76552,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor wifi in the room Balcony without chairs and table No variety of food on the breakfast and room service menu, There are always taxis front of the hotel
76553,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There was no swimming pool, I had a very lovely stay and all staff made us feel welcome and my requests were done before I got there Two minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower Absolutely lovely hotel would stay there again 
76554,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The Senagalise sellers were a constant nuisance They continually bothered me my wife They seemed to be everywhere tourists would want to visit What was the 2e tax about which me my wife had to pay on checking out , Your hotel is ideally located to all ameneties Very friendly staff whom were very warm in their tones to us The breakfast team were also very friendly the cook was a very funny guy indeed 
76555,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Wifi was awful Employees were rude their english was incompetent Room service was disaster i asked for a birthday candle and they couldn t manage to find it for two days they wanted 5 euros to bring an ice bucket and they couldn t bring a bottle opener for three days and when i complained to the reception i was told to bring my bottle to the restaurant Reception is not capable of helping on anything They will tell you that your problem is not their problem Finally if you are going to catch a plane after your check out check out at least four hours before your plane s departure because they will try to charge you for stuff you even didn t touch from the mini bar and it will take like an hour to fix the issue We almost catch our plane , Eiffel view
76556,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, See above, Checking in seemed to be a problem There is no formal order or lines People walk up from every direction and cut in front Secind my toliet did not work My husband had to fix the flush mechanism 
76557,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was poor and half eaten ham and cheese sandwich was in fridge clearly not been checked when room was cleaned Room bar was expensive , Location
76558,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, A little slow to check us in as they couldn t find us on the computer eventually they found us and then booked us in again But just a small hiccup also we were promised a surprise gift as we were in the premier suite but this gift never arrived , Rooms were lovely with a big comfy bed And we had a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower We didn t eat there so can t comment 
76559,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The way the check in and check out counter were located in a central area This made it harder for staff to be aware and serve in waiting order , Booked this hotel due to its Location as we had booked an Eiffel Tower dinner Location was excellent with only a very short walk to entrance We booked a room with a view and weren t disappointed View was to die for especially the night light view Large Bathroom with all accessories provided

76563,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The lady at the check out tricked me into signing a city tax receipt which was already included in my reservation as I had prepaid That was not nice now I have to contest that on my card An undue hassle Plus the room with balcony did not have any table or chair to sit although it was implied in the photo , Jeff at the desk was wonderful and very helpful 
76564,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, You are paying for the view from the room Which is expensive considering I could have got a room at the other side of the hotel for half of the price, Location in Paris is ideal
76565,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Rooms wee great excellent rain shower wonderful balcony with eiffel tower view Excellent breakfast highly recommend it East access to metro Will come again
76566,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel is expensive for what it is I didn t like being harassed at 11 30 to leave the room when the check out time is 12 The view wasn t great from my room and although they upgraded us to a suite because our original room wasn t available we didn t have a nice view some shabby flats opposite and there was no balcony and I had to share a double bed with my friend instead of the twin beds I had booked The breakfast is very limited in options I ve had far better so I would recommend eating breakfast outside of the hotel I enjoyed my stay but I think you can find better value for money , The rooms were nice and the bed was so comfortable A bit disappointed that my view of the Eiffel Tower wasn t good and I had to wait an hour for my room to be ready but overall the hotel was decent

76572,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, barely any, I ve enjoyed every single moment in Paris as whole and in Pullman specifically On top of a breath taking view of Tour Eiffel from my balcony the hotel s reception facilities cleanness were stunning For sure I ll be returning and recommending it to all of my relatives and friends

76576,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Check in and out facilities appalling long queues and even when you received attention it seemed to take an age Restaurant menu very limited only 4 hot dishes and what I would describe as American style sugary Tried to charge us extra for breakfast on check out even though it was already paid for , Excellent location with bright modern hotel Breakfast fine 
76577,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room smelled like carpet cleaning liquid Hallway had a bad smell like a cheap Las Vegas hotel Balcony is not very private from next door guests and is just split by a glass plastic board Food at the restaurant downstairs was horrible with bad service as well Way to overpriced for what you get You are pretty much paying for being walking distance from Eiffel tower , The location is great Very close to Eiffel tower 
76578,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Pricey and not just the room but the food Furniture in our suite felt a bit dated but maybe retro is cool , Perfect location for the Eiffel Tower and the Le Bus from the Airport Big rooms big bathrooms Clean 
76579,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Anything below the 5th floor would probably inhibit your view of the tower too much to really justify the price There was nothing really special about the room let alone the hotel in a 5th floor deluxe room you are only paying for a view of the Eiffel Tower and that alone doesn t justify the price , The bed was very comfy it was almost hard to get up in the mornings Location is excellent being so near to a major monument and the staff was very friendly 
76580,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There is nothing we didn t like , Everything was wonderful The staff were very helpful and friendly Great location Near the bus and train Had a wonderful room on the 8th floor with view of the tower The breakfast was great

76583,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There is nothing to dislike , The location is excellent you can see the Eiffel Tower from you balcony A lot of interesting things are very close metro station boat station for city tours Very tasty breakfast Comfortable room with good design 
76584,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bathroom was updated but no door on the shower is kinda awkward and let s a lot of water to splash onto the floor Maybe some seats on the balcony so we could enjoy the view of the Eiffel Tower , Room was clean food was good maybe not 26 a person good but everything u could ask for 
76585,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There was really nothing we didn t like we were very satisfied , The stuff was very very friendly and helpful when asked about where things were located sites to go see etc

76587,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Reception needs to be more organized paperwork takes time The power went out when I connected their iron I had to contact the reception to send a technician to get the power back , The location and the interior design 
76588,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Staff is professional and courteous also all English speaking facility centrally located to all the great sites in paris restaurant chic and prepares great food Forgot iPad in uber taxi Had it delivered and staff successfully delivered to my address in Germany Great thanks and appreciation

76590,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I would ve liked a top sheet on the bed not just the comforter which was nice The pic of the balcony online was misleading since there was not a table chairs on the balcony in fact only room to stand out there I could not get my coffee maker in room to work even after staff demonstrated how it worked , Lots of room in the suite loved having a balcony off both rooms loved having 2 bathrooms The s rain shower was awesome The staff was helpful room service was very good The breakfast buffet was excellent lots to choose from Best croissants I ve ever had excellent coffee The bed was super comfortable I was thankful to have the taxi s there anytime I wanted to use one was thrilled with how close we were to the Eiffel Tower 
76591,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bed was terrible nosiey and when we questioned it we were told there was nothing they could do about it The food on the buffet was always cold no matter what time you went pancakes were like cardboard and the coffee old The rooms were not replenished daily and things were falling off the walls in the bathroom at night waking you up , Location to tower 
76592,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, room was neat but there was lil moisture smell may be since it was raining from the carpet Staff changed the room but the other room has same smell they really need to look into this smell Its a real turnoff , friendly staff location breakfast amenities early chekin

76595,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Automatic mini bar charged us as soon as we rummaged about but after explaining to the staff they were very accommodating and removed all automated charges from our bill, Amazing views of the Eiffel Tower from the 6th floor
76596,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It s like a mid range Las Vegas hotel good location and lots of flash but so so room and upkeep Given the price doesn t seem like a chair or two on the balcony would be too much to ask Not having a shower curtain door was odd and makes for a bit of a mess Parking was expensive even for Paris , Helpful staff great location
76597,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing , The staff was absolutely fantastic nice and helpful at all time from our arrival The hotel is ideally located next to the Eiffel Tower with a view from the balcony The room are modern and very comfortable I can only recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to make the best of a travel in Paris 
76598,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Perhaps having a hair dryer in the bathroom mounted to the wall would be all I could say was missing here Lovely large soaking tub with shower over perfect for our first night after a long international flight Then a couple hours spent in the gorgeous upstairs lounge sipping divinely inspired drinks qualify this hotel for a Perfect 10 , Well appointed room for travelling mother and grown son two beds with sumptuous linens and fluffy pillows Gorgeous bathroom complete with towel warmer Huge windows shed cherished natural light by day and are appointed with modern roll down privacy shades at night Great central air for us older girls who need a cool temp for sleeping Excellent location to nearby upscale shops for ladies and gents Courteous kind and honest staff held a couple mens coats we had forgotten in the closet for us to grab on our way back through London at the end of our trip Outstanding

76601,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, My daughter and I got stuck in one of the elevators Since there s a sign on the wall in the elevator I m guessing this isn t the first time this has happened Initial person spoke no English and took 10 minutes to get someone to talk with us After 30 minutes we were rescued They gave us a bottle of water Yippee skippy Asked what room we were in and I thought they might have offered dinner or something to comp us for this but notta , The view from the balcony was stunning Nothing like the eifel tower to make a Paris trip real 
76602,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, No table and chairs on the balcony which was a little disappointing but we were only staying one night so it wasn t that essential , Bed was so comfy and definitely worth the delux double room Excellent view of the Eiffel Tower well worth the extra cost it really made it special 
76603,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, 1 No mirror in the room except the bathroom Long mirrors were available outside in the hallway 2 balcony is nice as u can see the Eiffel Tower however no chairs and table provided in the balcony 3 We were charged 60 for early checked in ie 1030am We requested or 1 hour late check out ie 1pm the reception informed that 60 will be charged This is an unusual policy of a 5 star hotel 4 There is nothing romantic sense about the hotel It is more for business trip Maybe the decor 5 Smelly carpet in the hallway to the room Some fresh lilies or air freshener could help removing the stinky smell 6 Position of the bed is facing the door to balcony and the sunset is direct to your face when you try to unwind after a day of walking Tried pulling the curtain not as easy as we thought 7 The standing lights is not convenient it fell down whenever we try to slide the curtain , Location near to train station walking distance to Eiffel Tower for hop on hop off ride easy access of taxi peaceful neighborhood magnificent Eiffel Tower view concierge service was excellent safe hotel
76604,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Didn t like the view We booked a room with Eiffel Tower view but this means to the Eiffel Tower side because the view it self you can have it or not , We liked the food and loved the location With the location so near with Eiffel Tower we could live and breath the Eiffel environment every single day 
76605,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only thing I did not like was our closet space I did not even unpack because there was no space to hang my clothes , The Pullman staff are fantastic We were greeted promptly by Ben who helped us with our luggages He made a nice connection with our 7 year old son It was a big plus We were overall happy with the comfort of our room Everything was perfect The view from our balcony was amazing We would stay here again and again 
76606,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I upgraded to the room with Eiffel tower view It could not be seen from room but only from balcony at night time Long waits at the bar while staff made complex cocktails instead at taking table order or taking order and delivering , Good location 5min from Eiffel tower Open tour bus stop with some restarauints in the vivinity Provided free printer free water

76613,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, N A, The omelettes for breakfast were amazing and all the staff were superb very attentive and made you feel like royalty The room and view was out of this world Would definitely return 
76614,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I put few hundreds pound inside my luggage when I was out however once I returned to my room and opened my luggage I noticed that someone touch my stuffs and 40 pound was gone I was really disappointed as never thought this will happen in Pullman hotel I went to lobby and informed one of the male staff immediately a female manager was there as well Female manager said will get back to us as soon as possible and will check with housekeeping department further look into it Of course they suggested we could call the police but who wants to spend time on this when travelling To sad that no one get back to us just like nothing happen after we talked to the manager We informed the manager on 28th March around 10 30pm at the lobby check out on 30th March no one mentioned anything when we check out as I don t want to repeat to other staff again so I didn t say anything I was waiting someone to e mail us as least to tell us what s going on Today is 4 April still no one e mail us So I am waiting to tell everyone if you are looking for a quality hotel and will follow up your questions then please go for other hotels I spent 890 on the room and the experience here was really bad I will never stay and recommend Pullman to anyone anymore ,No Positive
76615,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bathroom was in need of a bit of tlc as seems to be getting shabby and stained but was clean which is the main thing The carpets where stained which isn t the best thing , The hotel was lovely food was amazing brilliant cocktails and a massive comfortable bed Couldn t ask for a better location and all the staff were brilliant

76619,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel staff stole my travel wallet Cash credit cards included I had checked in my baggage into the security storage area upon check out to be collected later in the afternoon when my flight was Upon my return I noticed that the zipper to my bag pack was open and my travel wallet stolen The hotel staff were not helpful at all in resolving the issue and instead asked me to go file a police report The security room did not have a camera and thus the perpetrator knew exactly what he she was doing The facility manager follow up on the phone with me several days later out of sheer courtesy but never offered to reimburse anything or offer me a free stay after they were notified that my insurance company was not going to reimburse me because the items were supposedly in a secure room What a nightmare from a hotel that you would otherwise think is well rated , The Hotel is clean rooms are spacious and location is great 
76620,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, staff should be more trained especially the waitresses in the restaurant forgetting our orders waiting long even to get drinks Our room was probably close to a night club so one day there was noise until 01 00 a m You could clearly hear the disco music playingThe windows should be more protected agains the noise I could not sleep one night because of this disco music , great location very good breakfast clean room We were generally happy with our stay 
76621,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was fantastic but we felt a little hurried by staff as cut off time approached , Location and views from room amazing Even a pharmacy hairdresser post office around the corner Creperie brasseries a stones throw and wonderful atmosphere inside outside the Pullman 
76622,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Housekeeping could do with a lot of improvement and I did not appreciate at all being charged 9 euro for what was supposed to be free internet that was just plain rude , Staff were pleasant
76623,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, If you want to be really picky then maybe a small table and chairs on the balcony would be a great touch , Breakfast was amazing anything that you could possibly want was there The omelettes were freshly made to order and delicious We would say that the breakfast is worth any extra money which you may have to pay Croissants were lighter than air The pastries were great Full English meat cheese cereal fresh fruit crepes it s all there The hotel is in a fabulous location a stones throw to the Eiffel Tower Across the road to the river where you can walk all the way to the Notre Dame A lovely walk if the weather is on your side Plenty of cafes and bars along the way to sample the fabulous wines and coffee The staff were welcoming and friendly from the reception during the day until the bar staff at the end of the night We could have asked for anything we needed and nothing would have been any trouble Our room had a balcony with a view to the Eiffel Tower which we would highly recommend At night when the tower lights up on the hour the view is spectacular and we would go so far as to say priceless Room was clean with a large comfy bed best sleep the boyfriend has had in ages and a great bathroom It did not matter what time we left we always returned to a clean and tidy room The hotel was quiet despite such a busy area We cannot praise this hotel highly enough It was awesome 
76624,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It s location as it isn t that central but it s very close to the Eiffel Tower, The staff were extremely nice they met all our needs the food is to die for the room was always clean and it s really cosy and welcoming I would totally recommend it to anyone visiting Paris

76626,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Service was really good and i was supriced how easily everything went There were a strike and we were little pit worried how we would be able to reach airport but lovely lady in the reception got us a taxi Breakfast was also superb and rooms were just what was promiced Loved the view to eiffel tower excellent location

76633,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Staff wasn t very helpful Bit disappointed with the customer service They could be more helpful but unfortunately we had to chase them for everything , Location was really good I like the hotel as it was clean and the rooms were good I was expecting a bit bigger room as we chosen King room but still it was not bad 
76634,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Maybe a little more choice on the restaurant menu, Service was second to none very friendly and helpful they couldn t do enough for you beautiful hotel
76635,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room was too hot even with the temp turned off we had to leave the door ajar Neither of us could figure out how to work the shower it was scalding hot , Good breakfast buffet selection downstairs Open atmosphete Needed to open at 6AM instead of 6 30 Muffins coffee in lobby needed juice cheeses 
76636,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Supplies of coffee milk and sugar is very little , The staff in the breakfast room is the best we have ever encountered Excellent food and service The staff especially the girls from the breakfast room went out of their way to make our 30th wedding anniversary extra special The surprise waiting for us in our room when we returned after breakfast just blew us away For us there would never be anywhere else in Paris that could top this hotel Hope to return in the very near future

76639,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The staff in the Frame resturant where very unprofessional as made me and my partner feel very uncomfortable when we ordered our food they then took our order away and we could hear them speaking about us and kept looking over at where we were seated this was making us feel very uncomfortable and awkward However the food was lovely and we enjoyed it but just felt uncomfortable with the staff mainly the three ladies waitressing , The room was lovely every thing as expected staff where lovely in the breakfast service and reception very pleased

76642,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, if we had to make a comment the only thing would be that the Phaze restaurant could of had more of a selection on the menu , excellent breakfast room was clean and had everything we needed toilets always clean staff very friendly and helpful
76643,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, A bit expensive Room was at 1st floor so Eiffel view was available only from balcony with some athletic moves There were lack of cheese at the breakfast As a turkish couple we can not live without cheese , We love the room It was very comfortable and bathroom was very huge and good Personnel was great kind polite Bed was so comfortable and we fall asleep with the help of perfect pillows 
76644,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, F B in room service was unexceptable for Pullman I stayed in Junior Suite and I have to call 6 times for them to show up Unexceptable Housekeeping manner was bad I was on the phone with front desk while she tried to come in and clean the room she was not suppose to come in without my consent then she tried to lecture me that I should put a sign on the door if we re not ready for them to clean up the room I have a surprise Valentine s plan on that day Front desk knows that we will leave the room at 16 00 and they can come in for housekeeping and special set up DESPITE all the things I don t like I will be coming back to this hotel forget all the others I guarantee the view is unbeatable Forget Mercure that is just right next to Pullman as well their room windows are blocked by other building so you won t be able to see the Eiffel Tower, Ive made special requests from the hotel Service was good helpful and willingly to help me Our stay was magical we loved it Front office service was superb Especially Guest Service named Julia exellent work We stayed in Junior Suite kingsize bed with the Eiffel tower view it was remarkable experiences loved the room The location was absolute brilliant The environment was exellent value for money to stay here Easy access to public transport such as Bir Hakeim or RER C and easy access to Dinner Cruise just right around the corner Without this hotel we wouldnt want to visit Eiffel at night in winter with strong wind but with this location Eiffel Tower at night was even better than during the day time MAGICAL 
76645,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The view of the Eiffel Tower was amazing and Champs De Mars train station was 40 seconds away from the hotel as was La Seine We had an amazing time and the staff were very helpful The rooms were comfy with a digital tv Costa machine kettle some free drinks in the mini bar and a rain shower on the bathroom ceiling Paris is a beautiful city and I was gutted to leave and want to go back already 
76646,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Wardrobe is too small even for a single can you imagine for a couple Despite of no disturb plate fixed in my room for two times someone openned the door The breakfast saloon and also the staff were not well prepared to attend guests together with external meetings or events like happened last Feb 10th unnacceptable , Location but room had not the expected Eiffel tower view Staff was very helpfull 
76647,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I think there needs to be a steam room sauna available in the hotel , I liked that it was good value for money the location was perfect and the staff were very friendly The breakfast was also pretty good 
76648,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The mini bar wasn t stocked I informed reception on our way out for evening came back later and still wasn t done so phoned reception was told someone was on the way It didn t happen and had to go down to reception twice to get it done It was my wife s birthday so spoilt the end of the day It took over an hour and a half to get it resolved , Great location lots of space inside and felt secure

76650,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I loved Frames restaurant in the hotel the staff there were very friendly on the contrary the reception staff were not as friendly The location is good u have a very good distance from Eiffel Tower but with a slight corner not a full view and the hotel has a sports ground for football which can be a bit noisy in mornings if ir looking to relax All in all its a good hotel nice interior rooms are in good size compared to hotels in europe, I loved Frames restaurant in the hotel the staff there were very friendly on the contrary the reception staff were not as friendly The location is good u have a very good distance from Eiffel Tower but with a slight corner not a full view and the hotel has a sports ground for football which can be a bit noisy in mornings if ir looking to relax All in all its a good hotel nice interior rooms are in good size compared to hotels in Europe
76651,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The service at lunchtime in the restaurant was awful It was slow and they forgot to place our order with the chefs On the plus side the waiters were very apologetic when this happened and provided us with a complimentary glass of wine and beer , Our room was incredible with an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower The in room services including free movies were just the cherry on top of our amazing stay The dinner service and the food at the restaurant were also great I would recommend this hotel 
76652,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Some of the reception staff acted like you didn t exist Only helping people who they thought had more money and status Tall Indian guy snob , The cleaners were good Nice biscuits left in the room Restaurant staff were polite
76653,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Quality of the food at breakfast wasn t great The fruit in the fruit salad were too ripe and the pancakes cold , Loved the view of the Eiffel Tower
76654,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was expensive , I was so impressed with this hotel Staff friendly and super helpful Location was amazing And rooms were well equipped Woukd definitely go back
76655,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Only having a 2 night stay , We arrived early were immediately made welcome by the friendly very accommodating staff They ensured we had the best available room we even had a singing rendition of Happy Birthday for my wife Within a minute walk of the Eiffel Tower the hotel is well positioned but we were not affected by noise A warm welcome in the restaurant for our first night dinner once again service was of the highest order Breakfast was Suberb yes again the staff were excellent 
76656,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I didn t like that I paid for a superior room 720 with an Eiffel Tower view and the view I got was very unacceptable I could only see the equivalent of a metre view So we had to then pay 150 to get a view of the Eiffel Tower Which after the initial shock of having to pay even more money the view totally made our stay and we had a brilliant stay , I liked the location and the view we had from our room The hotel was really good clean and friendly 
76657,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Unfortunately we had some money stolen from our room approx 300 00 and when reported to the staff they informed us that an investigation would be done and get back to us After 24 hrs no response regarding the investigation and as our insurance would cover us for only 100 lost in cash we have not made a claim I explained to them that obviously they have staff working for them who are thieves and their response was well you should have locked your money in the safe provided Very poor attitude and I will be writing to their manager requesting a full report on their investigation but safe to say we will never stay there again when we visit Paris regards Mike and Marita O Connor ,No Positive
76658,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We ordered room service it was a club sandwich and it was really bad it was cold and soggy , The service was fantastic the bed was so comfortable and everything was really clean We were so impressed 
76659,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Very slow to check in and had to wait 2 hours until the room was ready, Everything Amazing views inc Eiffel Tower rooms are brilliant bed was very comfy Everything very clean and well designed 
76660,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Staff not so genuinely friendly Hotel was not considerate to our simple request but was late by 4 5 hours in delivering our room , Located very near the Eiffel Tower It seems the hotel including the rooms had been updated and renovated 
76661,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Not really a problem as the rooms are well soundproofed but there is an all weather sports pitch right out in front of the Hotel The front desks are a little chaotic as there is no obvious desk and little signage Although the staff are so attentive that no one was left struggling for long , The room is fantastic very well appointed and luxurious If you are wanting to visit and view the Eiffle Tower make sure you book an upper floor for the best possible view from your balcony you can also see the Seine and the Trocadero on the north bank Which is nice 
76662,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing really too bad just I like abit more power in the shower but over all good accommodation, Good friendly staff and very helpful Good large beds and stylish bar with great service
76663,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Great location you could see the Eiffel Tower from our hotel room The room was clean and comfy We enjoyed the breakfast plenty of choice and set you up for a day site seeing in Paris 
76664,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, An usher called us a taxi outside The taxi was a luxurious one that cost us a fortune We called our own taxi for the return journey and it cost half the price Couldn t work the iPad in our room and couldn t find any instructions , You couldn t want a better location as tourist in Paris who wants to see the sights The initial greeting was excellent as were all the staff throughout our stay The man who booked us in was very helpful The breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed our drinks in the bar area We didn t eat there but only because we had other plans Latest movies in our room free of charge 
76665,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Unfortunately we had to fit our own bed linen on the sofa bed when we arrived in our new room and the duvet cover we were supplied with had a small rip in it which did for the night but wasn t excellent , The staff were helpful on arrival helping us to change rooms when there was a problem
76666,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The restaurant was definitely not as good as we expected it to be with the quality of the rest of the Hotel We chose to eat dinner in house instead of venturing out into the city based on the assumed stature of the restaurant It was the biggest regret of our trip We gave them a second chance with breakfast and again we were disappointed , The location was amazing and the view of the Eiffel Tower was as advertised The rooms were cozy and came with great amenities such as an iPad with various helpful apps and information The beds were very comfortable as well 
76667,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Hotel Amazing Staff Amazing Breakfast Amazing Views of Eiffel Tower from balcony Stunning so good that I purposed to my partner on the balcony I would highly recommend this hotel 
76668,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I told the concierge and 2 employees that it was our Honey moon and we would like to receive a welcome cocktail one employee said that probably they can send some chocolates but nothing happened We didn t received anything Also they overcharged my card for double breakfast They kept me waiting a long time in order to return the money The taxi was waiting outside , Nice breakfast and view
76669,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, At 500 the suite was very very small Good sized balcony and great view Staff was excellent and world class location , Spectacular view world class staff 
76670,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I felt the staff were average the initial check in was particularly awkward Having paid for an upgrade to an Eiffel tower view specifically a room on the higher floors we were given floor 2 which was a bit of a joke 1 floor higher then the standard room All we could see was the corner of the Eiffel Tower no furniture on the balcony so we could not sit down out there or enjoy the limited view , Close to the Eiffel Tower and restaurants and that s all I can say positive about the hotel 
76671,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Wonderful helpful staff and really efficient cleaning service We went down to breakfast at 9am and by 10am when we returned to our room it was spotless I recommend paying that little bit extra for a room with an Eiffel Tower view because it really made the trip special Check in and check out was fast and simple and the staff all spoke perfect English The breakfast was buffet style and offered a lot of choice and it never seemed rushed or crowded An excellent stay 
76672,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Location was perfect The view was amazing Staff very helpful and willing Beautiful hotel perfect for young couples Breakfast in bed every morning Lush 
76673,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Being fooled I paid for a room with view to the Eiffel tower well my view was to the foot ball field they have in front of the hotel if I wanted to see the Eiffel tower I would have to go to the balcony and look to my left from the balcony that is not a view to the tower as they show in their photos that is a trick a lie and dishonest I could have paid half the money and not believe a lie to trick you and have you pay more for nothing, The quality of the room the staff everything was very good
76674,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bed was a little noisy to the point that every time I rolled over I woke my partner I was OK though Location was good for Eiffel but a fairly long walk to all other tourist spots I was covering circa 10 miles a day walking but enjoyable none the less , Staff were very welcoming the room was sizeable clean and modern The view was spectacular and the service spot on 
76675,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The room we got had a stinky smell when we came in and I reported it quickly to the front desk When we came back the staff apparently just sprayed some air freshener so the smell improved a bit However the bad smell came back and it s coming from the bathroom and even if I reported it again to the front desk nothing was done Also the carpet in the room needs to be changed already , The hotel was very near the Eiffel Tower and we got the room with a view And the location was very quiet and it s also accessible to public transport There are a lot of dining options nearby 
76676,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Hotel evacuated 11 14 SWAT team was unclear what to do with little to no recommendation given to us I know hotel can not do anything about it but the way they put me out the hotel without clear explanation and without follow up explanation from hotel beside what we saw in news was below expectation ,No Positive
76677,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Didn t care for being asked to pay up front for my room that was cheap The bartender had the personality of an old shoe , Great location and comfortable bed
76678,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It was all perfect , The hotel looks modern and new and very well designed The room was amazing and the bed was so comfortable including the pillows The bathroom was spacious and well built The staff were excellent and really took care of us at the reception the restaurant and even the guy that helped us to our room Food excellent And the location couldnt be better I cannot fault this excellent hotel It could easily be a 5 star and I am a very hard person to impress 
76679,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Reception staff were a little impersonal They did their jobs well They weren t rude They went out of their way to get us information on events in Paris Just not particularly warm , Location was good F B staff were exceptionally nice and well trained
76680,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, On the Sunday my room was not serviced at all also for the Sunday and Monday there was no hot water, The staff were friendly and welcoming and helped us with directions and the information about free travel for the Sunday and Monday on the Metro and railway and buses
76681,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Busy on checkout, Amazing view of Eiffel tower from the room balcony Elegant modern rooms Great service Champange and birthday cake delivered to the room on arrival 
76682,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only bad experience we had was dealing with the terrorist attack that weekend We had planned to stay for 5 days but had to cut short our city break and return home after 2 because of the security situation and everything was closed , Hotel was just a very short walk to Eiffel Tower in Paris Nice view from our balcony overlooking the tennis courts and football pitch with the Eiffel Tower to the right 
76683,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The security of arrangements were a little shambollick Sending sum to thier rooms in the lift and some to stay in an darkened back room in the basement You should have made a quicjk list of who was in the restaurant at the time and had a plan in place for such an event A secure room set aside , The way the staff dealt with the situation after the restuarant and police called on Saturday the 14th Sept 2015
76684,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, When we got to our room the balcony door was wide open and the room was freezing on further inspection the handle was broke so we called to get it sorted sat in our room for 30mins a guy came up to fix the door he got it to open and shut again but there was still a draft after calling again I waited a further 20 mins by this point I was annoyed cold and Hungry so I went down stairs and told the lady at reception she basically told me someone would come to fix it and that was that later we got a phonecall saying it wouldn t be sorted until the following morning it didn t get sorted so we ended up just putting the heating on 30 for the duration of our stay for this reason on my next trip I would choose another hotel, Bags took to our room free desert when our food was late nice big rooms and shower
76685,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, poor wifi in the rooms we could connect wifi in the lobby only , perfect location it was too close to tour eiffel hotel has nice breakfast service good security service smiling staff clean rooms new building close to both rer metro 
76686,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The restaurant service is bad Concierge is next to none The cleaning staff even came for window cleansing when I was in the room , Good view and convenient location though it is on the left side of the river
76687,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We were a party of four in two seperate rooms and in both rooms the air conditioning was too hot and could not be adjusted to a comfortable temperature which meant all four in our party did not sleep well, Location and friendly and helpful staff very good customer service 
76688,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Only thing was having no bath But you can live with that because of the wet room you have with a large waterfall shower , Hotel staff where friendly room service was excellent the view of the tower was amazing from room Short walk to most places was great The bed was so comfy bedroom really stylish Docking station to listen to music was a bonus and built in plugs for your UK electrics so we did not need a adapter Super cool 
76689,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Wi fi dropped out regularly and the front desk was confusing, The view was one in a million And bathroom was to a really great spec Having a Nespresso in the room was fabulous 
76690,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Milk for child 5 euro s for small glass Via room service asked downstairs was told we don t have milk in the kitchen A kind waitress gave me small glass for free Contridictions with staff very poor customer service for over 200 pound a night, Comthy bed
76691,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I booked through your email invite via a link a Segway trip for 4 with the promise of 10 discount this took me through to getyourguide but the 10 discount did not deduct on my total even though if clearly stated 10 at top of booking page Your customer service department were contacted but I received a poor response the site isnt ours sorry surely if I click on your link the responsibility to ensure the discount works is yours , Great location for Eiffel Tower metro station at end of road for easy access to all the sights some good restaurants within a few minutes walk 
76692,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only negative was the disappointing flow of water from the shower it could have done with being more powerful , The hotel staff were excellent and they were most helpful when we needed assistance with our stay The room was was very comfortable and we especially enjoyed the free movies The view of the surrounding areas was excellent A very enjoyable stay 
76693,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There wasn t anything we didn t like We didn t eat in the hotel restaurant but we had drinks The restaurant with its open plan kitchen looked worth a try if we visit again , Hotel is in a fantastic location just beside the Eiffel Tower We had a view of the tower from the balcony We had one of the recently renovated rooms and the facilities were excellent The buffet breakfast was fantastic with a huge choice of hot and cold food The hotel was very clean and the staff extremely helpful and polite 
76694,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, very expensive staff very rude and not cooperative too noise from football stadium located in the front of hotel I can not sleep elevators are very slow small and crowded, location and restaurant
76695,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Liked it all, Amazing location and everything you could need including little luxuries iron proper hairdryer British plug socket etc made you feel at home Very quiet too 
76696,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Wifi non existent charged 10 for Internet never advised of charges check in desk a bit haphazard, Location excellent room perfect staff helpful breakfast v good near metro and supermarket loved the nespresso in the room 
76697,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, reception desk was not set up in a well organize space it confused people Also you need more and better elevators it a pain when you are on a higher floor , location and the staff great breakfast and room had a great view 
76698,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Everything was perfect Clean spacious room Eiffel Tower view from our balcony was as per our request Breakfast was fantastic Reception staff was very polite helping 
76699,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I make a booking for 4 days in October payed for this 1600 without breakfast It must be a room with a balcon with the view for Eiffel Tower I did this for almost two months before arrival When I came they give a room where the balcony was not working it was impossible to open the door I spent about 1 5 hours in that evening with the manager but she can t give me another room They move me in another room in a next day And I heard that new arrivals manager put them in my previous room have the same problems with the door for the balcony Ones I call to room service and ask them to give me in my room 2 plates I was waiting 30 minets because they have a lot of job Daily cloning wasn t good I saw that they don t clean a balcony The phone in my room number wasn t working while staying there 3 days I ask a lot of times to do something with phone but they didn t nothing There was a problem with the keycard 3 times it was not working And I was need to spend the time go go down and make the key again and again After all while check out receptionist gave me the bill where was almost 90 more than I was need to pay I took a calculator to count all that was in the account and I was wright But to prove this I need to call the manager of the hotel again because the guy on reception don t want to accept it And she came and count And I was right What for I need their apologies after all this if they maje so many unpleasant things for such big money , Only the place where situated
76700,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I wish they could help a guest who needs a change for a cab , Excellent hotel to stay in Paris Lovely breakfast The management was able to provide us a room with a beautiful view of Eiffel tower for my birthday 
76701,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, breakfast the food is just not fresh and cold juices are very good though the check in is the big issue I arrived at 6 in the morning and i emailed them earlier before I get there they said there s pretty good chance i can find my room available i just have to pay 60 i said its okay once i got there they said my room wont be ready before 14 00 minimum that wasnt the issue the problem is i got there early and theres lots of people who got there after me and got there room keys before i do apparently if your eyes not blue and your hair isnt blond you not the first priority to this hotel The lady on the day shift is not friendly at all , Location cleanliness
76702,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The booking com ad said Deluxe King Room Balcony with Eiffel Tower View In fact the room had a view of a soccer field and you needed to lean over the balcony and look to the far right to get a view of the bottom part of the Eiffel Tower The staff did not seem to think this was an issue We upgraded for 60 Euros to a room without a balcony but with a few of the Eiffel Tower , great location
76703,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Paris has a city tax Both Booking com the hotel made no mention of this additional charge Thus when I checked out thinking I d have a 0 balance because I prepaid through booking com I was told I owed an additional 20 Euros for a City Tax The problem is I exchanged all my Euros back to U S dollars the night prior to my check out I only kept enough Euros to pay for a taxi So I had to use my credit card in order to pay for the city tax plus the 3 international fee my credit card charged me All of this could ve been avoided had I known to keep some extra Euros for this city tax fee The hotel staff said the city tax fee could not be added in my prepaid booking because they aren t allowed to add the city tax until the check out day I have no complaints about the tax I just simply wished I would have known how many Euros to keep on me for the city tax to prevent me from using my credit card incurring the additional 3 international fee , The staff was super friendly welcoming extremly helpful
76704,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, not very organized reception area People cannot understand where is a queue for check in check out Registration tables are in a middle of the hall near the elevators and all people are walking around Spent 1 hour for check in There is no actual view from the room to the Eiffel tower You can see it only if you go to the balcony but you cannot see it from any point if you are inside the room No point to pay for it all rooms walls are very thin you can hear your neighbors and cars on the road In overall cost of the room is to high for such hotel Hotel next door was much cheaper for same quality with no view to the tower , near the Eiffel tower but far away from many other interesting places
76705,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing lovely hotel in an ideal position , Location was superb Right next to the Eiffel tower and easy access to have a walk down the banks of the Siene 
76706,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Squeaky bed Didn t spend a great deal of time in it though , Great location Clean and comfortable Definitely pay the extra for the room 2 min walk from metro station About 45 mins from airport on public transport 
76707,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The service was diabolically bad Check in was a nightmare staff were completely disinterested and hopeless throughout payment error at check in useless attempt at help with booking a restaurant non responsive calls to room service it went on Tatty looking hallways unobstructed views not as promised and confirmed with hotel free wi fi completely useless generally a pretty horrific stay , Fantastic location rooms were a decent size the rainfall showers were great 
76708,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, room iPad was set up in Arabic poor interface with TV first world problems so no real complaints , Excellent service great facilities professional and friendly staff strongly recommended 
76709,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There s no spa That would have topped it off a massage steam room and pool Jacuzzi , That the staff were very accommodating and willing to help Also the hotel is a 5min walk from the Eiffel Tower 
76710,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, crowded breakfast buffet with overflowing tour groups , very convenient location nice room comfy bed and linens view of Eiffel and the sports track very entertaining 
76711,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was too pricey Pushy during checkout time 15 mins before noon all the TVs and phones in the room start flashing ringing messages to checkout EXTREMELY Annoying Wanted 60 euros for an extra hr on checkout Give me a break Bath tub shower too high Tripping hazard Bed was very uncomfortable , Location location location 
76712,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Dinner Menu and food was OK to good Not great, Great all round Loved Balcony view of Eiffel Tower well laid out Great breakfast Dinner menu disappointed
76713,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Was to little staff and the way of designing the reception for check in and out it s not comfortable for both customer and staff, Near from effil tower and metro station
76714,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bar was above us in 10th flour we could not sleep on sunday because of the loud music and the people jumping on our head whole night, The new technology using in the room such as the mini ipad and TV with free new movies to watch the view in our room from the balacony was amazing we were able to see the whole of effil tour
76715,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, There s no clear indication on how the heater works in the room , The view was perfect The staffs were very accommodating and they happily conversed in English with customers The restaurant served very nice food as well Hotel room was comfortable and spacious 
76716,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, my first room smelled of smoke and the manager was very rude when I complained about it not impressed with her attitude The cleaner thought spraying it with air freshner would suffice and then insisted it did not smell when it still did I eventually swapped rooms but it was a bit of a hassle , The bed was very comfortable
76717,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, Absolutely unbelievable place rooms were fantastic views from a Eiffel Tower balcony were mischief better than expected and all round clean and very friendly staff
76718,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I have been overcharged at check out I didnt use anything in the mini bar and they billed me for 2 items I took it up with the lady at check out but now see that they charged me for it in any case So please check your bill porperly on check out and make sure they confirm removal of items not for your account , Close to Metro walking distance from Eifel Tower
76719,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The views advertised from the deluxe rooms with the balcony are photoshopped The hotel overlooks a soccer pitch and the Eiffel Tower is actually not viewable while inside the room This along with the restaurant which is impossible to eat at without a reservation are the 2 biggest marks against this hotel , The included breakfast buffet was fantastic and the staff dealt with all of the entitled americans with smiles and patience 
76720,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The fire alarm went off at 6 am and we had to run down 9 flights of stairs There was no explanation and no apology , Super Comfortable bed and room We were close to the Eiffel tower and boat cruises and too close to the crepes 
76721,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Only one slightly bad experience We got stuck in one of the lifts on our return to our room at night I was a little disappointed with the staff once we managed to get out of the lift as they were more interested in the lift than us To be honest I think they were very embarrassed at the situation and this took preference They did apologise and brought us some water but after that they just left us , I booked this hotel as a 40th Birthday present for my wife What a fantastic hotel Friendly and courteous staff who could not do enough for you The hotel is immaculate inside and out The room we had 718 was fantastic Overlooking the Eiffel Tower What a view It certainly lived up to my expectations I had when I was making the booking My wife was over the moon Food was first rate could not be faulted We both fully recommend the hot chocolate at breakfast We will certainly be returning here as we both fully enjoyed our stay 
76722,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Media equipment was way to slow TV functionality was enoying very slow even if you have enough channels to choose BUT you dont go to paris to watch TV in your room , Perfectly located Frendly staff Good breakfast 
76723,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Some of the hotel areas were not so clean and it smelled Bed was not comfortable at all so dose the pillow, Location location and location staff are so friendly
76724,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Reception staff not friendly were not helpful and if you asked a question it was like it was a issue and I was only asking for a metro rail map There was a conference going on and hotel was overbooked for the lifts ten minutes or more to get up lifts each day and down halls dirty rooms clean excellent Balcony view is just that you have to walk out on balcony to see Eiffel Tower picture is not what we got don t believe the picture,No Positive
76725,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Not a bad experience but would have preferred a bath or as it only had shower facilities at least a bidet Need a bigger bath mat as water overflowed onto floor as glass only covered half of shower Breakfast was a lot pricier than all other 4 star capital city hotels we have stayed in many cities , The staff were extremely friendly helpful Great for the Eiffel Tower 
76726,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, amazing amazing amazing one of the best hotel i have ever been best staff zyeina leo and khouda exterme polite and help view is the best more than perfect hotel
76727,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Had to use stairs elevators were always full They had a convention and not enough elevators available Also did not like breakfast area in basemant it does not go with how modern the hotel is , Close to Eiffel Tower 
76728,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Tower View is only from the balcony No furniture on the balcony to enjoy the only place with a view There was no heat in the room They ended up sending an additional comforter for when I was sleeping The staff gave me conflicting answers regarding why The check in process is very unorganized The staff is scattered around an island style desk with no specific line for guests , The location was very convenient The bathroom shower were very spacious 
76729,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, They need to increase their staff especially in the reception There are many guests and a small number of employees which make it a long waiting time for the guests , The location is excellent good breakfast Also the room was clean and nice
76730,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Breakfast was very expensive for what was on offer , Excellent location for the Eiffel Tower and the Champs de Mar train station Room was very nice and comfortable 
76731,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, It is somehow a business hotel Very busy and staff are not enough to handle the guests Also they were not helpful in organising tours or even direct you Food for breakfast is very limited in variety , This hotel is situated very close to Eiffel Tower 2 minutes walk to reach the best attraction in Paris If you get the balcony then you are lucky to have the best view ever Great technology in the room iPad SmartTv etc 
76732,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The hotel accommodates Viking tours so lots of people at breakfasts and on the elevators in the mornings , Great view of the Eiffel clean and modern good location for what we were doing We loved watching the athletes at the track from our balcony 
76733,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor service door man operation non punctual elevator not working for days internet poor connection breakfast greasy and with oily smell as did not have active and clean duct operation poor cleaning of the rooms and arrogance of certain staff Blame goes certainly to the GM of the hotel as poor and weak leadership results in poor operation When questioned all excuses but no fast visible action to remedy , The location was the best close to the Eiffel Tower
76734,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We didn t receive what we thought we were paying for eg we were given 2 single beds no table or chairs out on the balcony as advertised staff did not inform us of breakfast gym facilities local surrounds and check out time, The location
76735,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, N a, Couldn t get a better location Hotel is stunning and view from the room is even better Staff are faultless I d definitely book again 
76736,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Booked a double bed room for 2 nights with balcony and Eiffel Tower view On arrival I was told that this room is too small for 1 adult and 3 small children I got a bigger room for an additional charge of 80 Euros per night This room was featuring one double bed no balcony and facing the backyard Although dissapointed with one sleeping and two crying kids I decided to stay the first night and cancel the second The receiptionist agreed and showed me the cancelation on her computer She said she would transfer the money back on the next day However during checkout I was informed that they never do refunds and will keep the money Certainly my last stay at this chain ,No Positive
76737,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Had to ask what was free in the room and what was chargeable as only chargeable things listed in room Found that because of room type had some free drinks available every day from fridge Should have been told this when first booked in at reception Very mean with coffee tea and milk and always had to ask for more poor especially for such a pricey room Didn t even leave any Nespresso on last day Surprised no bath nor table and chairs on balcony , Fantastic location and had a great balcony view of Eiffel Tower Lovely light room and excellent wifi 
76738,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We did request a bed for my daughter We arrived at 11 30pm without a bed made up The receptionist had to find some bedding I made the bed up Only a very small issue in no way spoilt our stay, The hotel was very clean ideal location Staff were very friendly helpful Food was delicious
76739,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The attitude of one staff was the ONLY let down This staff in particular needs to understand the fact the she works in a service industry Her aloofness to an issue I raised and the way that the matter was treated showed she had little to no customer service or complaint handling skills , I spent hours looking at various hotels in Paris before I settled on Pullman The hotel was in excellent location right next to Eiffel Tower and the RER and Metro startions of champ de Mars and Bir Hakeim were about 2 minute walks from the hotel A good collection of eateries within 5 mins walking distance as well Rooms were clean and well appointed Cab charged around 20 euro for the trip from Paris du Nord to the hotel for those thinking of using the cab from the station 
76740,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The bar staff let the hotel down badly More interested in chatting than serving guests very slow service even when quiet Staff were sat around the bar drinking in the late evening playing louder music not a good image the staff partying They were desperate and encouraging quests to leave so they could clear up the truth was it was because they wanted to drink party in bar area this needs sorting it s not a good image for a four or five star hotel You would not see that happening in a Pullman in London, Excellent friendly check in staff Amazing view of the Eiffel Tower from balcony in room Very comfy bed good choice for breakfast Staff in breakfast room very good couldn t do enough to help friendly
76741,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The staff were all friendly and very helpful with any questions or difficulties We wanted to change our room which we weren t entirely happy with it was done with very little fuss or bother I would highly recommend this hotel their staff 
76742,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Had to change rooms due to issues with bathroom and bed Shouldn t have to report issued like this after just checking in Staff should stay on top of this When alerted to issues handyman was called out right away and we ended up changing rooms after the first night, Excellent location and lovely staff
76743,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room was a bit small but the view made it insignificant , Polite and helpful staff room service breakfast included in breakfast deal and available until 12 And most of all amazing view from the balcony
76744,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The check in out was very confusing I understand trying something new but there needs to be a more smoother way of checking in and out the receptionists also didn t feel comfortable with this arrangement They need their space They need to be behind a desk so their energy isn t drained from travelers being in their space Let the receptionist have a desk in front of them with a desk between the travelers so they have that space If you are doing this so travelers can see the screen that can also be done with the receptionist still behind the desk Also the elevators don t feel safe I felt like something wasn t program right and you feel shaking not a solid feeling , The view was crazy amazing 
76745,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Early check in process needs to be explained better I would have saved EUR137 if someone would have told me to check in around 9am cost 60 instead of 7 30am which costed me 197 , I had a room with a great view of Eiffel Tower 
76746,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Everything was nice Hardly a thing to complain about , Everything was nice My wife kids and I thoroughly enjoyed the stay The staff location the facilities breakfast were all too good 
76747,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, We were to check in after 2 00 pm We arrived at 2 30 pm after travelling from Canada on a very long flight with two young children and the room was not ready They asked us to sit off to the side and forgot about us I had to stand at the desk and persist that we get our room which was very expensive booked and paid for 3 months in advance , The proximity to the Eiffel tower 
76748,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, they downgrade my booking to an standard room rather than Eiffel tower view room I got disappointed a little bit then they pay me the difference later on, it is really close to Eiffel tower great location massive hotel
76749,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room and dining area differed from the advertising on Booking com The hotel is further away from the Eiffel Tower as pictured in the video We paid 600 Euros and had a view of a soccer field Had to go on the balcony for a view of the tower which was still very far away than advertised from the room with a view The hotel would not refund our money after being disappointed about our room blaming Booking com for the advertising of their hotel Not impressed with paying so much for a room that was small and no direct view of the Eiffel Tower , Friendly staff clean room comfortable bed
76750,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The male dining staff staff for breakfast need retraining Thought that the female staff were excellent and efficient Male staff avoided doing their job , Location is excellent and so close to the Eiffel Tower perfect Overall the hotel looks smart and fresh 
76751,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, they had accepted and charged us for our rooms and when we arrived they said we are big family and cant give us that room i need to take suite and no refund can be given so i had to pay extra alot to get a room they are very rude and pathetic,No Positive
76752,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, I really enjoyed the hotel we stayed in an upper level room with a view of the Eiffel Tower The staff were friendly and helpful Very modern and new facilities Overall our stay was excellent 
76753,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Nothing, Welcoming staff started the experience at the beautiful modern hotel on a positive note Highly recommended View of the Eiffel Tower was breathe taking 
76754,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, 1 Shortage of elevator which is busy 2 Poor and slow free Wi Fi 3 Refrigerator is locked and does not open ulness by remote which you didnot have it BUT good thing i ask them to remove Minbar things and they remove it 4 Balcony does not have tables and chair to sit on it , 1 friendly helpful welcoming staff 2 Location is great near to Effial tower just 7 minute walk and hotel is quiet 3 Clean wide room with fanstatic veiw of Effial tower through balcony 4 Air condtion of room 5 Breakfast is excllent and staff were friendly and nice with quick service 6 Decoration of room and tolit modern was amazing and i like it 7 Taxi avaible at hotel gate 8 Facilits of room including ironing etc are avaible
76755,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I think the breakfast could be better The food was cold and left out uncovered and not on heated plates to keep it warm The cocktails were awful The bar staff should stick to cocktails people know and not make up their own , The location is excellent The hotel is very nice Clean and comfortable The rooms have more than enough 
76756,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The reception desk is too small for such a big hotel Sometimes You really have to wait till Your problem will be solved The other thing is a breakfast the restaurant is always full in the morning You have to stand in line to get some good stuff , The location of the hotel is great 
76757,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The stool in the room very squeaky and the bed despite being very comfortable was also extremely squeaky , The hotel itself was absolutely beautiful Location was great and there were always taxi s available from outside the hotel The room was very clean and the staff were helpful 
76758,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Restaurant near lobby had mediocre service we went there on Saturday night around 6pm and it wasn t busy we were seated then forgotten about for 30 min despite me waving at a hostess and her acknowledging me We left as we had plans for the evening and this was a waste of time and ordered room service and had our food in 15 minutes but at a higher cost obviously , Location less than 5 min to be at Eiffel Tower View of Eiffel town from our room Breakfast was fast and good quality Reception staff was excellent and super positive 
76759,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only thing Wasn t happy to see a dirty spot in toilet But over all its a perfect hotel , Great staff perfect location food is quite good for Vegi A special thank U to Miss Helene for her kind personality and willing to help others 
76760,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, location proximity to shops is woeful staff english particulary in housekeeping bad had to pay a check out tax of 2 48 Euros which was not explained or advertised at all view of Tower although advertised as great was bad Couldn t see it from room veranda other than a very small sideways portion i did read this comment from other reviewers but thought they were being a bit harsh but now i know better stay in the city and transport to the Tower Could also hear the guests in the room above walking around and next door Don t waste your money at this place like I did , nothing
76761,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The reception area was confusing and unorganised Our bathroom wasn t clean and the toilet was overflowing on arrival four hours later we still couldn t have a shower or use the toilet yet we asked the staff if it could be cleaned several times When you pay for a luxury service or product it s natural to have expectations , The restaurant staff was really helpful and friendly
76762,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The reception area Never go for classic rooms always duplex because you will see a huge difference as if you went to another hotel Breakfast area needs to be improved , The location The setup of the rooms 
76763,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, 1 out of 3 rooms were ready when we checked in Not happy esp as we were waiting for good few hours in the suite Expected the suite to be cleaned for when we got back in eve nothing Finally got into the other 2 rooms , Amazing hotel and location impressive room with facilities
76764,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, 2 lifts broke down on Sunday morning which was a real problem especially as I had a child in a buggie a very long wait 3 staff at reception is not enough people for a hotel as busy as the pullman Had to wait too long to check in check out and get queries answered , Location was superb and room was wonderful Couldn t fault it 
76765,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, check in and out is awfully slow when they say balcony view is really balcony view sideways i mean there are maybe a couple of rooms that have direct balcony view to the eifell tower The images that show on booking are not what you are getting , staff is multilingue and very nice it is very close to the tower so it is very central to get anywhere my wife enjoyed having nespresso at the room
76766,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Though I booked in advance my request has not been care off and I been charge extra staff was ok not too helpful as they should be Room are not as clean as should be Very small rooms and toilet is bad , the locations only
76767,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Cleaning maintenance stuff had lack of English knowledge Not very friendly orientated stuff in the late evening hours , Reception and welcoming stuff was very friendly and helping at the time of arrival 
76768,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Bit of a wait at the bar for drinks, Our bedroom with balcony overlooking the Eiffel Tower it was amazing The staff at front of house were very pleasant helpful and professional l
76769,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The check in is totally disorganised A bit chaotic with a central desk and nowhere to line up so people just mill in the foyer and fight for attention The garden view is of a weed bed It s expensive for the standard of room but big enough for my cot and baby , The restaurant was fabulous staff helpful Really lovely 
76770,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, I have no complaints , Great location and view of Eiffel Tower Beds were very comfortable and housekeeping was excellent Staff was exceptional Highly recommend 
76771,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, The only downside was how they wash the cups and glasses in the room I have no idea what they did but they were aways left with a grimy maybe soapy residue and I had to re wash the cups everyday several times to get rid of the film that would float to the top of my tea , Fabulous The staff were al extremely helpful and pleasant The room was very comfortable although the showers could have been a little hotter The location was brilliant and surprisingly quiet 
76772,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Very slow and unreliable free wifi the breakfast selection was average and too long a wait if you ordered any kind of omelete, Excellent location and friendly and efficient staff especially at check in and check out I would definitely recommend it to others 
76773,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Room service food wasnt good at all, The view of the room is the best ever and the location is great everything was close to the hotel and the champs elysees was 30 min away by walking 
76774,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Food taste, the location is splendid we loved every bit about this place the staff the service rooms and the VIEW can t get better than this We have a dinner outside and it got cold the staff got us blankets 
76775,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, View of the Eiffel Tower was partial not full as expected Reception does Not answer the phone most of the time And three times house keeping perspnnel just opened the door too quickly while we were in the room , Junior sweet is good enough for a family of 5 Well equiped and nicely furnished 
76776,Pullman Paris Tour Eiffel, Shower wasn t working when asked if we could get it fixed it took four hours when I complained they wouldn t give me a refund the espresso machine was faulty and the decor was not modern, The view was amazing of the Eiffel Tower
