35808,Ashburn Hotel, Rood was not clean Someones old sock left on the floor Toilet didn t flush properly Air con very noisy TV had very limited channels and they didn t all work Double glazing was not very effective in keeping out noise We were not greeted at breakfast a guest explained that you helped yourself and find a spare table to sit at Once we found a staff member and asked for drinks i asked for a decaf coffee that turned up in a packet at our table This hotel needs to understand how to look after its paying customers On checkout we were not asked how our stay was which says it all We will not be returning , Comfortable bed but that s about it

35811,Ashburn Hotel, One bath robe had a hole in and stsined belt, Not a very large room but very ckean and comfortabke thick carpets large comfy bed and lovely shower room Air con most welcome 
35812,Ashburn Hotel, Wifi was down for about 1 5 days a few minor issues but they were promptly addressed , AC worked well comfy bed quiet room reception Sabrina concierge and bartender were lovely
35813,Ashburn Hotel, The room was either freezing or stuffy they were having trouble with the AC they said A scenic view of the Hooiday Inn stairway lights and the drapes although effective were hard to pull closed This was not done at turndown , The bed and pillows were very comfy and the staff extremely pleasant and helpful It was nice to stay in a renovated townhouse for r first London stay Lots of character
35814,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, The proximity to the Gloucester Road tube station was excellent We used the Gatwick express to get from the airport to Victoria station From the hotel we walked to Harrods and then to Kensington High street in the other direction There were lots of attractions restaurants bars within walking distance too Even though the hotel was fully booked it was so quiet there were a few other people in the bar when we arrived back at teatime for our free prosecco but we really didn t see anyone until breakfast Continental breakfast was really fresh with a great variety and good coffee You can order a hot breakfast if you want and pay a bit extra We requested a late check out and this was extended to 1 pm which was fantastic as we had to get dressed to attend the Queen s garden party I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would like to go back 
35815,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, Great location just minutes from the tube line Great variety of grocery stores and restaurants in walking distance The tour bus comes this way so easy to do a bus tour if you prefer Staff was very friendly the rooms were big and comfy Breakfast was continental and worked perfectly for my family The bar was nice to visit in the evening bar tender very nice The location is beautiful and we really enjoyed it My husband thought the bed was not as comfortable but I thought it was just fine 
35816,Ashburn Hotel, In the basement first time for that Did not think when I booked that I would be there plus someone was smoking near our room when I specifically said no smoking , We were below the pavement which I am not used to would rather above street level
35817,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, The receptionist on arrival was so friendly and informative Our room was very pleasant and fabulous location The continental breakfast was good and there was a nice range of food and drinks We would definitely stay again and recommend to others It was about 20 minutes walk to the Royal Albert Hall which was ideal for our needs 
35818,Ashburn Hotel, Because of the shall we call it heritage style of the hotel there is a fair amount of filigree work around the mirrors and cabinets which attract dust and in the room we had they hadn t been cleaned in some time Not a big thing for us but finicky people might take issue Also there was one of those plug in room fresheners in our room what s the matter with just breathing the air that s there In any event the room freshener is on a switched circuit which can be turned off or like us you can remove it and bag it in plastic for the duration of your stay , Our third stay at this hotel appreciate the price compared to other London properties Short walk from Gloucester Road tube station Although refurnished in 2006 showing some signs of age Continental breakfast good although those staying for any length of time will find it repetitive A C WiFi TV all worked well Moderate noise from subway line which is below ground but open across the street but window glass does good job of mitigating and we haven t found it to be an issue Those who are noise sensitive should ask for a room away from Cromwell Road Haven t noticed any room to room noise transmission on any of our stays Good location for Double Decker bus to downtown if you re planning to use buses highly recommend downloading Citymapper s summary of the most frequently used downtown bus lines very useful Great array of highly ranked Trip Advisor restaurants within ten minute walking distance but note that reserving is becoming more necessary due to the popularity of the TA website we found this to be the case throughout Europe 
35819,Ashburn Hotel, Toilet not workin properly battery s in tv remote were flat shower not workin properly breakfast was continentle only you had to pay more for cooked but not explain when booked , Linin was clean and crisp

35821,Ashburn Hotel, Way OVER RATED WOULD NEVER SAY THER AGAIN From no power points to power points not working Rooms very small messages not delivered , Hard to find anything other than the location
35822,Ashburn Hotel, The room was excellent but the bed mattress for me did not have enough comfort layers above the very firm springs First night was not good but for the second night I put the duvee above the mattress and slept on the duvee with dressing gown and blanket over me much more comfortable and slept well , Excellent friendly and helpful staff high standard of cleanliness and excellent breakfast We will happily go back to this hotel again and it is very close to Gloucester Rd underground station and many local attractions 
35823,Ashburn Hotel, The noise in the room was excessive It must sit above the tube line as you hear and almost feel the tube trains going underneath Access to a plug to use the hair dryer is as far away form the mirror as you can get ok if you don t need to dry your hair Bath towels very small, Good location staff very friendly Facilities in the room were good with water dressing gown and usual tea and coffee Decent size room
35824,Ashburn Hotel, The continental breakfast lacks variety There needs to be more choice especially for a highly rated hotel If you re into processed meat cut into tiny cubes and mini bread rolls it should suit you fine If you like to break fast like a king save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else The breakfast room is so small I felt like I was sitting on someone s lap and table cloth was damp We asked the lady on duty for a full English extra cost at 7 95 but food came and was a rationed toddler sized portion Hotel in general needs an upgrade It looks old and dated floor boards creak Our king sized bed was made up of two single beds pushed together There was a clear gap in the centre which was uncomfortable and could have been concealed better Bathroom water temperature needs to be looked at My partner and I both had cold showers It s winter Sort it out Overall experience was very average I like a boutique hotel but this one is crying for a revamp , Hotel is in an extremely good location Everything is on your doorstep Good food restaurants train station Royal Albert Hall museums etc 
35825,Ashburn Hotel, Nothing , Very nice continental breakfast included Complementary glass of prossecco from 7 00pm and happy hour from 6 30 to 8 30 which is very good value when compared with local pubs and bars

35827,Ashburn Hotel, The only little complaint I had was the room was really warm , Found this to be an excellent location with really friendly staff Bed was really comfortable 
35828,Ashburn Hotel, Nothing, The rooms were very comfortable and clean hotel was quiet and welcoming We were three couples travelling together and they gave us a complimentary glass of prosseco each also free newspaper in the morning and the price was really good for London Wouldn t hesitate to stay here again Breakfast was continental and was perfectly acceptable Staff attentative and very helpful 
35829,Ashburn Hotel, Not really up to its four star rating Rather faded heating very unreliable breakfast very basic poor attention to detail For example complimentary in room refreshments consisted of a small gift bag stuffed with sachets No sweeteners on Day 2 and no coffee on Day 3 Two Wilco coffee mugs on a paper napkin This is hardly four star luxury , Location large room

35832,Ashburn Hotel, Looks a bit dated The outside front of the building does not give a good first impression as you walk up , Good location Only a 2 minute walk to the nearest underground station Clean reasonable size rooms Friendly staff Good continental breakfast 
35833,Ashburn Hotel, Not enough power outlets in the room had to unplug lamps in order to charge our phones Did not think of asking for an extension cord and or extra plugs though Also not much of a wardrobe The room was large enough to have a suitcase on a stand instead and there are a few drawers but a wardrobe and or some shelves for clothes would be useful , The location is excellent the room quite large the bed very comfortable the bathroom very good we had a shower would have been nice to have a bathtub as well but no complaints about the shower The staff were very helpful The continental breakfast was quite good and we added on eggs one morning very nice 
35834,Ashburn Hotel, No dislikes, Cleanliness was excellent Continental breakfast was a proper continental breakfast and also excellent Room was superb and staff most welcoming Best stay I have had in a hotel for a long time Excellent value for London 
35835,Ashburn Hotel, No tomato juice in bar Shower difficult to operate Three pin plugs obselete for mobile phone etc , Liked the victorian drawing room view from the room General cleanliness of the property 
35836,Ashburn Hotel, 1 Check in is rigid at 3pm This is difficult especially if you are flying in from Asia where planes tended to arrive very early in the morning One cannot just dump the luggage after a long flight have a shower and get to work This is where big chain hotel are more convenient for business travellers 2 It is not a major issue but wardrobe space is severely limited One have to fight to find some space among the clutter of fuse box kettle tea making top safe to try and hang a couple of jackets in my room I was in room 303 My suggestion to the owner is that when they next renovate the room move the fuse box and th kettle safe etc to the same side of the wardrobe then at least you have half of a wardrobe for your guest to hang their clothes rather then none at all at the moment , 1 Central location near the museums and Knightsbridge shoppping 2 Small boutique hotel but will a lot of nice touches which you don t find in some of the big chains 3 Staffs are friendly and very helpful 4 150 yards from Underground station 5 Wifi connectivity and signal are good 6 Bed is comfortable
35837,Ashburn Hotel, Breakfast very good but slightly chaotic as small room and no seating system Lovely breakfast items but not replenished often enough , Very friendly staff Lovely room and bathroom Got complementary prosecco in the cosy bar 
35838,Ashburn Hotel, Perhaps a little more choice at continental breakfast especially bread but nevertheless good value for money , Excellent location and easy to find Room was well appointed and the bed and pillows very comfortable Clean and fairly recently decorated There were plenty of eateries nearby and Gloucester Road tube only 3 minutes walk away making it easy to get into the West End in particular 
35839,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, The staff were very friendly we were made to feel very welcome the room was very comfortable there was a good selection of food for breakfast which was regularly refreshed There is a tube station a few minutes away and it was walking distance to the Royal Albert Hall where we were going We had a very enjoyable stay and would go back again 
35840,Ashburn Hotel, The room and decor were a little shabby and the bed was rather hard so I didn t get much sleep , The staff were welcoming and the continental breakfast was great The location is excellent with amenities on the doorstep We were put in a quiet room as requested 
35841,Ashburn Hotel, Very small breakfast space Not everyone could sit people had to wait in the hallway English breakfast was not included in the continental breakfast 8 extra pp Spring mattress was not very comfortable , Great location close to Gloucester subway station Clean rooms 
35842,Ashburn Hotel, Generally we had a very disappointing experience at the Ashburn Hotel We made the choice due to its location some good reviews and the look of the hotel in photos on line But were sadly mislead We have stayed in much nicer hotels for a lot less money At nearly 160 a night it is way over priced for what you get At first everything seemed fine and acceptable But the longer we spent in the room the less we were impressed There was damaged furniture in the room arm chair had a slash right through the fabric on one arm with attempt to repair it there was loose plug sockets on the wall the entertainment system controls did not work in the bathroom the bath robes were old and worn looking the vanity unit in the bathroom had been poorly repaired with gaps between all the mirrors the carpets generally throughout the hotel were worn and dirty looking the TV and music entertainment system was basic and limited the breakfast room was cramped the breakfast staff were unhelpful and not very cheery the reception staff on the other hand were very polite and helpful We expected a lot more from a hotel in this area of London and at this price My advice stay in the Crowne Plaza or Radisson across the road At least there you what you are going to get This was a special trip for my wife s birthday and was slightly tainted by the experience we had at this hotel However the rest of our weekend was excellent and we were thoroughly spoilt and well treated at every other place we went , The Location The bed was very comfy and the bath and shower were very good 
35843,Ashburn Hotel, Had a bit of a wait to be seated in the breakfast room but would just allow more time if I stayed there again, On checking in we were upgraded from a double room to an apartment which was a very nice surprise Beautifully furnished and very clean Location great Staff very helpful and friendly
35844,Ashburn Hotel, Liked everything Their system could have told staff that we have stayed there four times before it would have been nice to be welcomed as a returning guest , Location room light breakfast all round a good hotel

35849,Ashburn Hotel, The letter in our room said enjoy what was in the fridge which was empty lol lovely to be upgraded as was my birthday treat, Lovely location staff All excellent
35850,Ashburn Hotel, Would it kill them to shampoo the carpets once in a while Not that this would keep us from coming back , While this hotel is showing its age even though it was refurbished in 2007 it s a reasonable choice for a stay in London Close to the tube on direct line from Heathrow close to several major museums with any number of restaurants within easy walking distance Breakfast was more than adequate and although it s hardly necessary they do provide the option of a full English breakfast for a surcharge A C works fairly well wifi strong TV good Staff helpful and friendly This was our second stay here and we ll be back again space available

35854,Ashburn Hotel, A lift or alternative enterance ramp would be perfect for disabled clients, Lovely stay at a lovely hotel with fabulous staff The location is absolutely perfect for shopping or west end exploring 2 minutes from the tube and 30 mins in a cab to Heathrow Good size rooms for London and free wifi and complementary prosecco was a bonus Will be back 
35855,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, Individual Character Comfortable Small stylish hotel Great location Excellent breakfast Attentive welcoming staff So nice to be away and sleep well in comfort Will certainly book again 
35856,Ashburn Hotel, The Italian restaurant opposite could not accommodate us two couples on A Saturday evening at 9 00 o clock when half the tables were empty Very poor show Found a good place down by the tube station very good food , Great location Got a free room upgrade 
35857,Ashburn Hotel, Lobby area was a bit depressing Shower was strange to figure out , Location was good and room was fine but it does feel slightly like a budget property 
35858,Ashburn Hotel, Tv reception for Bbc 1 was frustrating as it kept cutting in and out Particularly frustrating when watching key points at Wimbledon , Friendliness of staff from start to finish The complimentary pro secco was a nice gesture Room requested quiet was appreciated 
35859,Ashburn Hotel, Room service food was not good We ordered on our first night as we arrived so late and would not do so again Also the bathtub sides were very high great for a nice soak but difficult to climb in and out of for a shower , The hotel is centrally located the tube museiums and excellent resaurants were within walking distrance The staff was accomodating and helpful and the breakfast was good The rooms were very comfortable the beds and pillows especially so We would definitely stay at the Ashburn again

35867,Ashburn Hotel, The breakfast buffet could offer more variety but that s nitpicking Also wifi quality was quite poor from time to time , The hotel provides luxurious spacious rooms and superb service including very friendly staff and your newspaper delivered to your room each morning The location is very convenient many interesting sights restaurants shops etc are nearby as is a subway station Gloucester Road 
35868,Ashburn Hotel, Breakfast room was cramped and we arrived there at peak time and had to wait for a table No pastries as they had run out, We liked the room comfortable beds
35869,Ashburn Hotel, The hotel room was way over priced considering and completely misrepresented by its description The bed was described as a queen which by no means it was My boyfriend was woke early by sunlight through the curtains which wouldn t shut properly The breakfast was poor and pastries provided stale But by far the my biggest dislike is the poor way of charging for room rate the hotel ended up charging me twice I wouldn t recommend staying here and felt disppointed for my boyfriend who I had booked this stay as a Christmas present , Wasn t much to like about this stay the roo was over priced and misrepresentation by its description on the website 
35870,Ashburn Hotel, Nothing though it did occur to me that the breakfast staff could have been a little more animated without being chatty or over friendly at that time in the morning , A bijou hotel as in the brochure Front of house staff particularly friendly and helpful about a special request to find a venue in London Also very interested in listening to the reason for my visit to London 
35871,Ashburn Hotel, Poor choice of food for breakfast There was nothing much to eat bread ham cheese yogurt buns Basically it all felt dry and cold Any type of cooked eggs was for extra charge The toilet didn t flush very well The wifi was not so good Plus you need to contact reception every morning because they change wifi password daily In case you want to book any tours avoid doing that through reception book them yourselves , The location was good proximity to the center to the stop of Big Bus tour shops restaurants metro station 
35872,Ashburn Hotel, There was no one in the bar and some areas of the hotel were a little run down but overall value for money, Location was great and the breakfast in the morning was very nice
35873,Ashburn Hotel, Wifi connection was unpleasant That was really annoying For some people room design might be old fashioned but for me it was fun , Close to metro close to supermarket nice cafes and restaurants free breakfast everyday many small complimentary things helpful staff I stayed at 407 which was almost like big suit room Two tv s in the room Bed was located in a way that you can see the sky I was very happy with my room The room was unique and facing to the street but it was quite I felt that I was in London hotel Bed was very comfy 
35874,Ashburn Hotel, The bed was very hard and the pillows were of poor quality so we re not comfortable The room temperature was only 16 degrees on arrival so it was quite cold The basement room where breakfast is served was absolutely freezing another guest complained to the waitress but she wasn t very helpful In the end the guest moved to another table Apart from the receptionist I didn t see either the waiting staff in the restaurant or the barman smile at any time We ordered a pot of tea at breakfast and was presented with a pot of hot water we were not told that we had to put the teabags into the pot Tea needs to be made with boiling water if the bags aren t put in at the time the water comes off the boil and the tea doesn t brew properly The tea was not good Capital radio playing in the bar area was not welcome we did not want to listen to rapping in those grand surroundings over a glass of prosseco , We were upgraded on arrival to a larger room on the ground floor The room was quite spacious and very clean The bathroom was very nice also with a very wide bath and shower The location of the hotel was excellent as it was within walking distance of The Royal Albert Hall where we were going that evening 
35875,Ashburn Hotel, Rugs were spotted worn out which made the property seem less than clean It WAS actually clean just didn t look it , Room was spacious with lots of storage Nice breakfast 
35876,Ashburn Hotel, Far from all London airports Closest is Heathrow 35 minutes by car taxi 50 minutes by taxi to Luton at 4 am Not a 10 only for this reason , We came to UK for a honeymoon and stayed at the Ashburn Hotel for 9 nights Very good place for a vacation Very good staff very helpful upgraded our room for a delux room for no extra payment Very clean place Close to Gloucester Road underground station 
35877,Ashburn Hotel,No Negative, The lady on reception was lovely but I tried to order room service one night it was clear they couldn t be bothered Said it would be well over an hour for 2 pizzas Also the hotel in general is tired The holiday inn across the way is much nicer a similar price

35882,Ashburn Hotel, Though in a convenient location the surrounding area was a little depressing The views werent fantastic , The shower was incredible The bed was lovely and soft 
35883,Ashburn Hotel, Security deposit plus room rate taken at check in plus room rate taken again on check out therefore I have been overcharged and 4 days later am still waiting for a refund Hotel staff very unhelpful in resolving and have not called back with an update As a result this has dampened my experience of the hotel and I would not recommend , Location good for visiting Royal Albert hall 
35884,Ashburn Hotel, Breakfast room bit chilly and easier set up for the breakfast tea milk would be much better , Lovely bedroom and hotel decor Great location for the V A and tube

35888,Ashburn Hotel, Decor is a little dated and tired , Very close to Gloucester Road Tube 2 minute walk from the hotel Reception staff and concierge were very welcoming and helpful Feels more like a Guesthouse than a hotel which in itself is pleasant Some nice touches in the room bottled water complimentary newspaper and a complimentary bath oil All in all great value for a London location
