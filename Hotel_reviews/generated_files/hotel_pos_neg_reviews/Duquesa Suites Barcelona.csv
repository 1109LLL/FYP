411549,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Nothing major noisy due to its location but closing the windows sorts this out and bathroom is small so if travelling with small children it can be a challenge for us it worked fine , The location the space in the rooms the proximity to sites entertainment pool deck and staff 
411550,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, If breakfast could have been available on the roof or at least a coffee machine fridge with water etc at the roof pool , Excellent valet cleaning services linen and towels fixtures etc were fab Kind friendly helpful staff Proximity to everything
411551,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No Beakfast, The Bed was very comfortable Very good location of the hotel We got a suite that was ocean facing however trees were blocking our view The staff were extremely helpful in helping us plan out our activities The hotel accommodated our request for a late check out 
411552,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The hotel is not a hotel in the true sense of the word I would rather call it self catering apartments When we arrived at 15 45 in sweltering heat after a long journey our room was not ready and the person at reception was neither apologetic nor helpful at all , Perfect location Beautiful and comfortable room and bathroom 
411553,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, price quality no breakfast facilities poor cleaning tiny rooms no mineral water in the room, great location 15 min walk to the beach and 20 min walk to the center The room is new but very tiny So is the bed There was no space to put the suitcases Why would someone need a kitchen in this full of restaurants and cafes area We had nice view over the harbour The staff at reception is vey friendly and helppfull Our low rating is due to value for money issue Not worth EU 250 per night In general we enoiyed our stay 
411554,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The price was a little high for a room with no view , The bed was very comfortable The location was excellent The view from the rooftop was amazing The staff was extremely helpful and friendly 
411555,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The only thing that we found slightly inconvenient was that there was one sink in the bathroom and very little counter space for toiletries etc , We stayed 5 nights at the end of May in the suite on the 5th Floor facing the street with the view of the harbor We were a little concerned about the noise at first but it was no bother The room was very nice and spacious We did not use the kitchenette much but it was well equipped Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful Excellent location We were able to walk to the beach and many shops and restaurants in the Gothic Quarter All together it was a pleasant stay I would definitely recommend Duquesa Suites to anyone traveling to Barcelona 
411556,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The bathroom always had a bad odour The room only had one soap bar for three people The room allocated was on the lower level was extremely noisy The cost of the room was exorbitant At 2500 Australian dollars for four night no breakfast a very small bathroom It was vastly too expensive The hotel has no foyer or sitting area The room did not get cleaned each day until after 3 Pm so there was no point coming back to the room for a break We travel each year using booking com at this was the worst value for money for all the four star accommodation we have stayed t I would consider it a 3 star accommodation at best I feel let down by bookings com the hotel is using the booking com rating to vastly inflate the prices I will be a lot more cautious before booking next time Caveat emptor, The Bed was comfortable
411557,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent hotel with a great location allowing an easy and rapid access not only to the beach but also to the city It was prefect for our familly with 2 kids The staff were very helpful and nice The view from the roof and the pool is very nice 
411558,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, There was no room to store the baggage We had quite a bit of luggage as we were going on a cruise from the hotel so we had to use the kitchen table to lay out the bags Aslo the only thing I found bad and a bit dangerous was that there were no grab bars in the shower nor was there a shelf to place the soap and shampoo also the water ran out of the shower area on to the bathroom floor, All of the above The view from the roof top was spectacular a great place to rest after a long day 
411559,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, We asked for early checkin as we arrived at 08 00 We received a message that they will try finally we got the room at 13 30 There is no cafeteria in the hotel The rooftopterrace has no bar , The room is big and beautiful 
411560,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, I tried many times to correct a problem with the air conditionner dont Know if its only room 104 that the air conditionner doesn t work properly every time they would come up to the room to see if the unit was functioning and of course some cool air would always be venting but not efficiently yet in the hallways it was freezing low and behold since this review i am sure the problem has been found , The staff is very friendly and helpful the apartment clean the only problem was with the air conditioning I tried many times to get them to correct a problem with the air conditionner dont Know if its only room 104 that the air conditionner doesn t work properly every time they would come up to the room and of course some cool air would always be venting but not efficiently yet in the hallways it was freezing low and behold since this review i am sure the problem has been found 
411561,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Cant think of anything, The rooms look exactly the same as they do in the official pictures Lovely clean and modern decor Location was excellent Close to Barceloneta beach Las Ramblas and the Cathedral A lovely neighborhood with lots of shops cafes and boutiques to explore 
411562,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Could do with some refreshments available by top pool terrace and some TV channels in English, Friendly and great staff Nice clean rooms in good location for the older part of the city near harbour front 
411563,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, For customers who want a large formal lobby this is not the hotel for you However the rooms are very nice larger than the norm in this section of city and the hotel is in the middle of the very old section of town where there are numerous bars and restaurants within easy walking distance The reception desk service to facilitate check in print boarding pass reserve taxi etc was great 
411564,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Check in time stated 3pm but room wasn t actually ready till 3 15 20 A small annoyance when I d been out in town walking for 5 hours but no massive deal and wasn t a put off , Amazing view of the marina off the roof top with a nice pool area Rooms were spacious and mine had a little terrace off it and a small kitchen area unexpected Staff were fabulous and helpful Particularly when I had electric go off during the night and man at reception was more than happy to help at 2am Could also use the facilities past check out time Felt it was overall good value for money 
411565,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Not much a little noisy being on the main street but you use to that as Barcelona is a vibrant loud city I m not cure you can escape it wherever you stay , Perfect location on the edge of the old town Gothic Quarter and Born and only 200 hundred metres from the harbour with vibrant bars to be sort Rooftop pool deck offers great evening views with a glass of Rose in hand and or for some sun tanning during the day It is a short walk or bike ride to the beach The Gothic Quarter being so close offers a great cobbled maze of streets to get lost in and experience some of the local restaurants and bars And the local Bodegas all within in a very short distance with in a 2 5 min walk served great local cheap cuisine better than you get at the tourist traps just ask the reception staff for recommendations A great place to stay if you have a young family the apartments have kitchenettes which makes life easier with very small children I would stay there again 
411566,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Amazing Hotel with the Location Staff Cleanliness and Price Rooftop pool is a must for breakfast and to relax at night overlooking the harbour Will definitely return
411567,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, There is no Restaurant room service Swimming pool wasn t clean enough The suites rooms isn t space us enough There was very noise outside at night even the windows was fully closed , The beautiful view form the room and from the top of the Hotel Very close to the Barcelona aquarium and other city attractions Around you can find very good restaurant s as Arcono 
411568,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Not a bad point and the only tiny problem we had but as quite short people we did find it hard to reach some cupboards plates and the storage for the kettle etc it this was of course cured by climbing on a chair but for those who might struggle to climb on a chair it may be a problem , As everyone who reviews the place says The staff are fantastic very helpful and friendly Fantastically placed for everything 
411569,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, We had a problem with the dish washer , This is an excellent location for visiting Barcelona Not far from the port and beach or the gothic quarter and metro stations 
411570,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The weather on Friday was terrible I cannot blame Duquesa Suites for that however as we spent more time in our room than we anticipated we were left watching TV Only 3 channels are in English and all are news channels This could be improved , The location is excellent with everything on your doorstep The room is a very clean modern and a good size bed is extremely comfortable Staff at the property are friendly and willing to help with any requests 
411571,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The room was small and barely fit the bed Thank goodness it was a suite so we could spread out into the other room The HVAC system didn t work properly and kept cutting off We were right above the dumpsters on the road and when the restaurant nearby closed they dumped all of their bottles Very noisy and right at bedtime , The bathroom was well appointed and had radiant heat behind the mirrors so they didn t fog up The staff was super helpful 
411572,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, USB charging ports in the room would have been great but we just bought more adapters at a local store and we were fine , We loved everything about this small but wonderful hotel The staff were so friendly accommodating and helpful The location was perfect for walking all over the many great areas of downtown and old city Barcelona The views from the rooftop solarium were gorgeous we could have spent more time simply relaxing up there And we had plenty of room for a family of 4 and it was clean and comfortable with great amenities We didn t want to leave We will be back 
411573,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Kettle lead not long enough to reach wall plugs whilst the kettle is on the floor or worktop had to balance on chair Complimentary tea bags coffee would be nice too , Staff were possibly the best I have experienced at a hotel They couldn t do enough for guests The rooftop is brilliant Location perfect 
411574,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The room was a bit noisy you could hear the passers by and the traffic as we were on the first floor The TV had no remote so we couldn t change the channel or volume , We loved the rooftop terrace The kitchen was well equipped and the cleaners did a great job they even washed up for us 
411575,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Nothing I can say everything was perfect, Staff are super friendly nothing was too much trouble Although only one mirror when asked if they had another we could borrow within 5mins we had an amazing mirror which they let us keep for our duration
411576,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No full length mirror Utensils in cupboards too high to reach without standing on a chair Minor details though , Excellent location friendly efficient staff roof terrace with view No noise at night executive twin no view so didn t face onto road Would definitely return and recommend 
411577,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, the elevator p modern but this touchitouchi is not working well yet , the staff at the reception was very very friendly 12 pioints they have earned a boni this month we think appartements were top roof top was great super fast wifi 
411578,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, the kitchenette has nothing totally useless The staff is mixed two bad ones one good one No reception 1 person in a 2m space This is NOT a 4 hotel it does not have the requisites for a 4 stars hotel, location was ok there was no caf no coffee shop no reception NEVER AGAIN
411579,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No breakfast but could of recommended a couple of places for Breakfast when checking in , Rooms were amazing staff very effiecent and polite Would stay again if i was Barcelona 
411580,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, All was really good but too noisy to rest well I stayed at room number 404 with views to the port Windows didn t isolate well the traffic noise I think that would be a very important thing to solve The fan from the bathroom was also very noisy , The room and the whole hotel were really nice Beautiful place and great location Staff were very helpful and friendly I asked them to change my room to an upper level floor and they quickly did it I also asked for extra pillows and they were pleased to gave them to me Great views from the rooftop
411581,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Early check in would have been good Booking com needs to improve their communication regarding this , The room was beautiful comfortable and the staff were very accommodating I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
411582,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Missed a bath and was sorry there was no bar facilities even just for a coffee on the roof But let s be honest this visit was all about getting out to see the city Plus we found the most wonderful place for breakfast Milk It was so good we went both mornings , Loved the view the space the kitchen facilities and the comfort Staff were really nice and extremely helpful The view from the room and the beautiful roof terrace was gorgeous Sitting up on the roof was lovely especially when the sun was shining 
411583,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No Breakfast available would like to see drinks snacks available on rooftop area , Excellent location nice clean rooms with good facilities staff friendly and helpful beautiful rooftop views and seating
411584,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The room was just a little bit airless that s all , The room was so useful kitchen bathroom toilet bed Employees are always helpful and comprehensive From now it s my new home at barcelona 
411585,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No breakfast Problem with the heating system which did not operate properly and need to change room, Polite staff Very nice location with a very nice view
411586,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, We booked for 5 nights The first night in 405 was disturbed twice by the electricity blowing It could not be fixed so we were moved to 205 405 also had bathroom smelling of drains We would have stayed in 205 but were told to move the next day to 601 said to be a penthouse upgrade So we had to repack and return at 2pm The room was not finished but was also worse than before as the bathroom was not on the same floor as the bedroom The kitchen and bathroom were both smaller and in older condition It had 2 terraces in direct line of extractor fans from restaurant next door I had said that I did not think we should pay for the first disturbed night but was told that management had decided on the upgrade instead We had no choice , Room 205 was comfortable and worked well 
411587,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, nothing it was amazing and great value for money And even though no breakfast on site great range next door, Great little place to stay if you want quiet but central with style Exceptional customer service Friendly helpful staff where nothing was too much trouble Amazing suites superb fittings and super comfortable beds We will return again and cannot recommend highly enough kerry Australia
411588,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, This is more a reflection of me than the hotel but I really missed having a workout room Then again most hotel workout rooms are heavy on treadmills and bikes and light on anything useful anyway , Location was perfect We had a beautiful view out over the Mediterranean and were right on the edge of both the Gothic quarter and Born so we could wander both and visit the myriad museums cathedrals and Tapas bars with ease The staff was also great Super friendly and very helpful 
411589,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, They do not have a Restaurant or at least the possibility to offer tea or coffee in the morning At our request they gave us a bag of tea and 2 bags of coffee You must request slipers from the reception because they aren t in the room apartment Every morning at 09 30 they rang at the door for cleaning until we put the do not disturb cardboard They have cleaned the apartment daily but not very well Considering the price 170EUR night for the apartment without any meal it doesn t worth It is an old block of flats transformed in block of apartments for rent, Good location near Port Vell Rambla Aquarium Great window view A lot of space for the Loft Apartment 
411590,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, A fantastic place to stay Lovely location right by the marina The staff were great they made us feel really welcome and were always happy to help The room was really good spacious and modern with our own kitchenette But best of all was the rooftop overlooking the port We would recommend Dequesa Suites to anyone and will definitely be staying here again 
411591,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, na, The location and view is fantastic the staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean quiet and comfortable The staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable The hotel is definitely family friendly Highly a recommend the corner suite So many places in walking distance including many metro stations 
411592,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, It s difficult to find something which is not perfect The street between hotel and harbor is very busy and loud in case you like to sleep with open windows but ok with closed windows , Very nice hotel with excellent rooms located direct opposite the harbor Rooms even equipped with small but functional kitchen Very nice and friendly staff For the next visit we will choose this hotel again 
411593,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, What was rather dissapointing was that our room had no real access to natural light While it is stated in the description no view that is not only no view but really no natural light , Perfect location and nice restaurants and tapas at proximity Perfect for family with one kid for a 3 person 1 bedroom appartment with two rooms Very clean rooms and very good facilities and perfect stuff 
411594,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, We had a wonderful stay in the corner suite One recommendation is to give additional mirrors in the bedroom full length and living room because there was only 1 in the bathroom Also shouldn t be charged for a child since it s a suite and the main purpose of a suite is to have additional beds for children ,No Positive
411595,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Black soot in the bathroom from the heating vent , Location was perfect staff were helpful and friendly room was large enough large shower instead of those scary high European bathtubs 
411596,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Only small downfall and this is me being mega picky maybe think about adding breakfast , Staff and location both incredible hats off to Silvia and Antoni They set up a surprise I requested as it was my wife s 30th Birthday present to go to Barcelona Antoni gave some excellent suggestions on places to go and eat All in all a great experience and the staff really made this place seem amazing
411597,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, The location is great Barcelona is not very big so it is easy to get around Stayed here for several days prior to our cruise should have arrived even earlier in order to see more Our reserved room was being renovated so they upgraded us Very quiet and pleasant good communication 
411598,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, I expected to have a living room or a small sitting area since we booked a suite hotel and not a regular hotel In addition the dinning table was tall with stools and therefore not very comfortable to eat on , Perfect location very clean and very pleasant stuff Very nice decor Attention to details mirror in bathroom had a heating to prevent condensation after shower 
411599,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Extremely strong bleach smell forced us to keep all windows open to become sustainable We couldn t get another room since it was fully booked Bad night due to the smell , Very large suite with kitchen and awesome view over the yacht harbour Cosy sleeping room living room and kitchen are too minimalistic and with cold led lightning
411600,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, maybe they should sell water additional to the complimentary one you have to step out to buy water from a market , reception staff is amazing they were very helpful with everyhing thank you all 
411601,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, A bit noisy from the road also in the night Double windows would help Airport pickup was a ripoff, Great location View from the room Very nice terrace pool on top floor Rooms are big and there is also a kitchen Great place overall 
411602,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No issues , Lovely modern clean property Well equipment rooms for self catering and great location Stunning views from roof top pool area Helpful and friendly staff 
411603,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The pool water is unheated, Awesome service we where initially unable to get the room we had booked due to an error in their IT system However the staff was really quick to give us an upgrade to their penthouse room as well as an substantial rebate Through the entire trip they where extremely helpful 
411604,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The furnishing were very basic The bathroom too small Bedroom with window closed still very noisy Sofas in living area just single beds with covers so not at all comfortable, The staff were excellent so helpful and friendly Location great Kitchen well equipped 
411605,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Our room faced to the main street so you hear a bit of a city noise It is only brelevant if you are SUPER sensitive to noise otherwise you will not even notice, Spacious room very nicely designed it has a small kitchen if you want to cook Very close to the beach in a cool and lively neighborhood The staff was very kind and helpful we got a great recommendation for dinner it was so good we came back the day after 
411606,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Basics for cooking were not supplied Had to buy salt olive oil coffee sugar etc in much larger quantities than we could use in the five days we stayed , Fantastic view room overlooking the harbor 
411607,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Street noise audible even if windows are closed but this has to be expected at this location , Excellent location well equipped apartment comfortable beds 
411608,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Our suite was at the corner facing the main street so the street traffic was very loud If a fan could be turned on it could provide a nice hum to drown at the noise , Bed was very comfortable 
411609,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, New facilities with large rooms comfortable beds and very friendly staff Conveniently located within the city with easy accessibility on foot or via public transportation 
411610,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, the pool is too shallow to actually swim in and there was no bottle of cava on arrival because we booked through booking com and not with the hotel and we had to ask for bathrobes the television was a bit on the small side and it would have been nice to have a TV screen in the bedroom we had a great stay though these are only minor niggles , we had a corner suite which had a lovely high ceiling and loads of light The young man on reception was utterly charming and helpful and kind when i broke my ankle we slept well due to excellent soundproofing despite the noisy location it was clean comfortable and spacious and a tremendous view from the roof the kitchen is fully equipped and the furniture was all in good shape we would happily stay there again 
411611,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, It could be a bit noisey at night with traffic sirens and the occasional late party reveller if you had the windows open , Location was excellent great for the Barri Gotic area and the Marina The corner suite was roomy modern and clean very comfortable The staff were all very friendly and helpful The rooftop pool and sunbathing area was great in the Barcelona heat and had great views of the marina We travelled as a family of four and I would recommend the Duquesa Suites to anyone 
411612,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Its not a negative side and has nothing to do with the hotel but I would recommend you to get the taxi to the airport outside the hotel because if you order it from the reception it comes with at least 7 10 euros on taximeter even before you get inside the cab and then they add some extra charges during the ride thus in our case I was very surprised when we got the extra charge of 17 euros apart from the cost of the airport transfer which normally is around 30 euros, Everything was perfect starting from th location just in the port and 10 minutes walk from the famous Barcelonetta beach with all the restaurants and night life Close to Rambla and the Gothic part of the city We were staying in the deluxe room with a wonderful view over the port with its yachts and lunapark In regards to the hotel I must say that its nice and clean and there is a kitchen inside the suite The room was cleaned every day The personnel is very helpful and polite The terrace on the top floor with an outdoor swimming pool is amazing The suite is absolutely noise proof The bed itself is very comfortable The linen pillows and blankets are supersoft and comfortable What else can I say We liked our stay a lot and will absolutely recommend it to all our friends Vladislav and Giulia
411613,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, NOISE The noise is ridiculous Both on the street side 3rd floor and the square side 5th floor the noise of the traffic is incredible It s a shame since the hotel is fine but if one cannot sleep the entire visit to Barcelona is ruined It s incomprehensible since many highway hotels manage to insulate the noise just fine If you want to enjoy your stay in Barcelona stay someplace where you will actually be able to sleep Otherwise bring some sleeping pills ear plugs and drink lots of coffee the next morning And put up with intolerable noise , Cordial staff Clean comfortable modern room 
411614,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Not sure if it was because of the rain we had during the day but there was a strange smell in our rooms if they remained closed up all day Not offensive but you were aware of it when you came into the room Other than that it was fantastic , The beds were comfortable and the location was great It was clean and the staff were very helpful Easy walking distances to most places and the metro was only a 5 minute walk 
411615,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, It was a little pricey Lovely to stay for sleeping and eating but not a hotel that is big or with a bar etc , Great location and the room was really big with a kitchen and shower bathroom was lovely Roof top pool is stunning although is small 
411616,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The pool is very small but nice I didn t get in the water because it was very cool during our visit There were absolutely no condiments in the kitchen so if you plan to do any cooking at all breakfast for example be aware that you will need to but salt and pepper etc , I liked the location and the set up of the room The shower was great 
411617,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No bath I love baths but that s just me being picky, Staff were amazing and far friendly I think it was Laura and pau a guy So helpful nothing was to much Couldn t get a better view or location Bed was amazingly comfy to Just perfect in every way 
411618,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, 1 Great location just in the center near the port and Rambla 2 We have booked a two floor suit There was a kitchen and three private terraces with an amazing view Can not be better One of the terraces is on the top floor so in reality we had three floors for us Perfect for three adults 3 Very clean and friendly personnel Well done 
411619,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Perfect location very good standard We were worrying about where to have breakfast but we were advised to go to a nearby hotel of the same owner 2 blocks away very close to our place and the breakfast buffet was perfect there 
411620,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, The bed was fantastic the rooms were finished very well and the staff were very friendly and helpful Lovely to have access to such a nice rooftop terrace and the pool is an added bonus Overall a great hotel in a great location 
411621,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, To be selfish a bar on the roof next to the pool would have been top , Situation on the edge of old town near aquarium and zoo for the kids is excellent Nearby cafe has terrace in front of apparthotel where breakfast can be eaten And more later Staff is very friendly very helpful Traffic noises are minimal in the room 5th floor Nice view on the yachts haven 
411622,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, There needs to be a bathroom on the roof area , Loved the amazing views from our suite and also from the rooftop Fabulous value for money Modern kitchen area Could sleep 4 comfortably Lovely dipping pool on the rooftop Fab place to sit and watch the sun set and all the lights of Barcelona come on It is in an excellent position to reach Gothic quarter Ramblas Port Vell ect ect Also very helpful staff on Reception 
411623,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Almost no service no bar no restaurant The pool is not a pool just a little square with water and the pool sorroundings are not organized neither neat Room is big but empty no decoration, Space of the room
411624,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, a little bit pricey for what it is no breakfast bar seems a shame with that roof top , excellent view location rooftop pool friendly staff clean very quiet lots of sun loungers and towels
411625,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, We had 4 rooms of 4 and they were perfect for the stay Very spacious and comfortable Perfect location within walking distance of pretty much everything Would highly recommend
411626,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to assist us They were very friendly and helpful The location was excellent and we were able to walk to most areas 
411627,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Nothing Everything was perfect , This place was PERFECT for our stay in Barcelona Such nice modern rooms Everything was super clean and the staff was very friendly We had an interior room so we didn t have a view but we were always up on the roof deck anyways The roof deck is so nice and you have a beautiful view of the marina We were up there every night of our three day stay The location was really nice Only a 5 10 minute walk to La Rambla We were also really close to the stops for both loops of the hop on hop off bus Would definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to Barcelona 
411628,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, nothing major, it s very convenient for longer stays Location is good it is within walking distance of La ramblas beach and nightlife Also immediate access to public transportation My superior room view looked great And loved the Terrance and pool on sixth floor
411629,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Quiet suite nice views Roof terrace and small pool Excellent staff Great location close to old town Born and beach Lots of bars and mini supermarkets Nice and safe for teenage children going out on their own Discount parking close by 
411630,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, The location is brilliant close to the beach and the medieval downtown Loved the concept of being in a lovely hotel but making and having breakfast in our room 
411631,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Really really noisy from the passing traffic The staff did move us to one of the executive suite though , Great location nice rooms and fantastic staff 
411632,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Fabulous location allowing us to easily visit the beach Ramblas Gothic quarter and marina with metro stations close by to easily travel to other parts of the city The apartment was a corner suite with great double aspect views of the marina and beautiful old post office The roof terrace with a plunge pool was an added bonus 
411633,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Only slight criticism there were no bowls in the kitchen for cereal but made use of everything else and great to have the facilities as eating out was quite expensive, Great location helpful staff and perfect few days away Really liked the sun spot terrace and pool was perfect to cool off in between sunbathing 
411634,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, Best choice I made for me and my family I travel to barcelona 3 4 times a year for buisness and stay at great hotels but this one did it for me Location is perfect 
411635,Duquesa Suites Barcelona,No Negative, We were able to relax in comfort The staff were very obliging regarding the storage of our luggage after our stay and the offer of the use of the pool 
411636,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, We weren t advised that there was coffee tea available for our mini kitchen and the air con in the hallways was too cold always a mad dash to our room especially once out of the pool , Bed was huge and super comfortable rooftop pool was excellent especially for my 6 year old Staff were very helpful and welcoming Hotel is spotless 
411637,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, I asked the staff to help me order food from the restaurant next door to our room because we were arriving very late after the closing of restaurants and travelling with a child But they did not I was a little disappointed with that because it should not have been hard for them , Perfect location Very nice big room corner suite with kitchen Great view from the room Wonderful pool on rooftop 
411638,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, Television stations all in Spanish Would be good to have a couple of American channels for tourists Would like it better if they had food available at this hotel , Great location Very nice sized room with a full kitchen and lots of amenities Staff are very nice and helpful Place is very clean Pool area on roof top is great 
411639,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The kitchen equipment was very basic and not made to cook a whole dinner , Fantastic location and breathtaking view from the terrace The pool is not that big and not deep but enough to cool down Even an outside shower is available Both close to old town Rambla and the beach 
411640,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, No breakfast at hotel Suggested breakfast at neighbourhood restaurant was worsted quality I ever had Swimming pool deep 50cm Pillows should be better we re uncomfortable And no extra pillows at the room , View from the roof Nice looking rooms Great Localisation Shop just behind the corner 
411641,Duquesa Suites Barcelona, The room was actually quite a bit smaller than I had anticipated for the price Our room was not what I d consider a suite but a standard sized room We tried to sit by the pool in the afternoon and there were not enough chairs so we had to leave This was really disappointing as we chose the hotel based on the location and the amazing rooftop pool The hotel doesn t have any other facilities or services like a restaurant which is why I figured I d be getting more room space for the price , Beautifully decorated new rooms with excellent city views Location can t be beat You are 5 minutes from El Born which was my favourite area 5 minutes to the heart of the Gothic Quarter and only 15 minutes to Barcelonetta beach The pool is beautiful as well
