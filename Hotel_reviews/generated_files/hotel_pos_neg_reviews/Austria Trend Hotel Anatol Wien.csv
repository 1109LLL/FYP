501878,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Low on staff it seems so you have to go and get all yourself in reception though really minor probmem , Good location quite but anyway close with underground to centre of city Rooms at least ours modern big and clean Friendly staff and good breakfast though perhaps not biggest selection but good for our family Good with parking garage 
501879,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Great location just a 5 minute walk to the metro and a shopping and dining promenade Comfortable beds nice size room and bath Hotel is on a quiet street we never heard any street noise Good air conditioning good WiFi Ivan at the front desk was especially kind and helpful in getting us settled in to our room after a minor glitch which resulted in a room change 
501880,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, nice fit out very comfortable and clean room size is quite large center location few mints from subway nice staff good details I had my family traveled with me and was very kids friendly Small gift at the reception to the kids made a huge difference I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and I will book this hotel the next time in Wien 
501881,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Narrow door to the shower cabin maybe not in all rooms but was in our one It was not a big problem for us as we are slender , Perfect location close to the centre but on quiet street many restaurants and BILLA supermarket nearby Shopping street and metro station is just in 5 min walk from the hotel Quick check in and check out Polite and helpful personnel with excellent English A parking garage Everything in the hotel hotel looks new including the furniture Clean and well furnitured rooms with comfortable beds By the way they provided an extra bed for our 9 year old child free of charge Air condition and Wi Fi worked good Will stay here again when next time in Vienna 
501882,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The chemical extremely perfumed soap on the common WC on the ground floor , Excellent hotel The room was super comfortable and the inner yard was super quiet The breakfast was certainly good but should be more vegan friendly with less meat and animal stuff More vegan options One of the few negative things was the soap in the common WC on ground floor it had strong perfume that stuck to the hands and thus was very chemical A bad choice for a hotel that otherwise had at least some eco friendliness 
501883,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The bed booking a double and getting two single beds pushed together and two seperate duvet s , Ease to get from the property to all the attractions in central Vienna public transport also only a short walk
501884,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, This is our 3rd stay in 4 years and they finally have air conditioning in the rooms a god send as Wien can get hot and muggy Staff were always available to help out with questions taxi bookings restauarnt recommendations etc 
501885,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Kettle and cups are available on request on additional cost Shower room is small for me couldn t move easily and I am large, Super clean very quiet room near to metro modern and thoroughly renovated
501886,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, We had ants in the room They weren t everywhere initially spotted them in the bathroom and I figured housekeeping would notice but they were still there when we returned to the room No slippers or bath robes in the room even though it s a 4 star hotel Only 2 towels per person one for body and another for hair face hands so you have to pick No electric kettle unless charged 5 Euros and the one we got smelled like soup probably because someone thought that s how you use an electric kettle I have to drink medicinal tea in the morning and I didn t really feel like paying 25 Euros for 5 cups of water Biggest inconvenience is that there is no iron in the room You have to get one from downstairs Even if it s free it s annoying to have to ask for it every time or spend an hour ironing all your clothes at once I also hit my head pretty hard on the bed frame because it s very low It makes for a nice ambiance with the lights but it s not very practical The minibar was very small even for a minibar with 2 bottles of water The TV had maybe 5 channels in English and Italian but by now I m used to this in Vienna Families traveling with kids might not be so happy though All in all it s good for a short stay and the minuses were not very hard to overlook but things could be better , Excellent location and very helpful staff especially at the reception I don t remember his name but the man at the reception who also speaks Italian and checked us in was very friendly and helpful The room was clean and housekeeping came every day but they could ve replaced the shower gel and tissues in the bathroom sooner than the last day The bed is very comfortable of course this is a matter of preference The room is quiet even on the street side the windows are very well isolated Breakfast is satisfying even if repetitive It s convenient and well stocked The AC worked very well The closet is large enough There is an incorporated baggage holding tray that you can hide when you re done unpacking The room was large enough for two people We liked staying here even if there are things the hotel can work on 
501887,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Room was very comfortable after the A C was fixed Got there on Saturday fixed on Monday , Surrounded by great restaurants and hotel restaurant was good too Room was roomier than most hotels in Europe for the cost Fast wifi 
501888,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, The location was perfect 15 minutes away from the city centre There is a very nice underground parking garage The room was spacious and clean Staff helpful and friendly 
501889,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Shower very small for a big guy like my husband , Staff very friendly and helpful especially in a medical emergency Very near a U station so we could go any where we wanted needed Breakfast was not fancy but sufficient Provided me with more pillows when I requested them 
501890,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Very good hotel in lovely neighbourhood Very close to the best shopping trip in Vienna Hotel had a lovely room and excellent breakfast Not far from the hotel to centre of town
501891,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Not careful cleaning of the rooms service Almost nothing around works after 7 8 p m But it s not about hotel it s about Vienna working hours of the shops Even grocery store closes mostly at 8 p m So if you need some snakes or drinks in the room think about it from the morning , Hotel is not bad for its money and stars There were some small problems with electricity in the rooms and with cleaning the rooms but nothing too much critical Staff is really helpful and kind Always try to explain and help with any your request questions and problems It s close to metro station and not far away from the center of the city you can even reach it by food over big shopping street if you prefer walking Breakfast is simple and every day the same but food is good and you have enough choice to eat up However it s good choice for its money if you gonna look beautiful Vienna not just to stay in hotel 
501892,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Nothing, Executive room was spacious and well equipped sofa armchair table provided Tea coffee making facilities also unusual in continental hotels and complimentary soft drinks in the minibar Good choice and quality of food for breakfast in a bright and spacious dining room Close to shops U bahn trams and train station 
501893,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, You can hear the noise of people entering and exiting other rooms and their conversations the morning cleanibg service starting at 8 Our room had a small shower , Big confortable room nice modern furniture lighting and decoration Very well located 2 minutes away from shopping and the metro line that connects with the city centre and the train for the airport We will come back 
501894,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, This was our second stay within a few days at this hotel see previous review This time we were in a Standard room which not surprisingly was a little smaller than an Executive room however the room was still big enough for our needs and not cramped We didn t notice much if any difference between the Standard and Executive rooms except for the space Nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities Staff were friendly and spoke good English which was useful as our German language skills failed us sometimes U3 line is about 5 minutes walk away and the Westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the U Bahn The area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on Mariahilfer Strasse 
501895,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Nice modern clean hotel in a good location for transport and local amenities We were upgraded to an Executive room which was spacious There was an option to pay an extra 25 Euros for use of the mini bar which we declined to take Staff were friendly and spoke good English which was useful as our German language skills failed us sometimes U3 line is about 5 minutes walk away and the Westbahnhof is a little further in the opposite direction from the U Bahn The area has many shops and restaurants nearby too on Mariahilfer Strasse and there is a useful supermarket on the same street as the hotel 
501896,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The double bed was simply two singles pushed together We knew from other reviews that the hotel has mattress toppers and since we d indicated in our booking we wanted a double bed we assumed this would be used It wasn t and when we arrived they said it wasn t possible to fit one on our first night Stupid ,No Positive
501897,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The food and hotel in general needs to be more child friendly for non Austrian children Children have their food tastes based on their home country and require in general more variety The room service was superb but with only ham or cheese options with stale bread was not good , Clean hotel lovely beds and very helpful staff
501898,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The internet connection was very slow The manager of the restaurant for breakfast need to be more polite with the guests ar 10 15 am we asked for boiled eggs and her answer was that is very late and the time for breakfast was finished The brekfast was until 10 30 am , everything
501899,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Fridge colding very weak looks like a toy , Very close to Mariahilfestrasse big spacious room they don t hace double beds but they put the over matrass on because baby was sleeping between us Great breakfast and children corner to play at the breakfast room great idea Love it 
501900,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Breakfast was pretty poor Day after day the exactly identical menu was served For a Germanic city there was no bacon and no sausage And no beans grilled tomatoes or potato in any form In the fact the only thing slightly warm was scrambled eggs which came in single portions inside glass tumblers Apples were the only fruit I had asked for Gluten Free meals and got GF bread but no cereals This was quite annoying because GF cereal is not costly a box providing 10 servings costs 5 Euros but I had to buy my own from a local supermarket I would not stay for more than a weekend in this Hotel as I would be bored to death with the monotonous breakfast We had asked for a double bed but we got two singles pushed together with a gap in between When we complained they said all rooms were kitted like this but instead arranged for a topper sheet which was quite comfortable The taxi fare from the airport was 45 Euros which is expensive The metro and train system would have been much cheaper , The Location was a huge plus It is exactly 3 minutes to walk to the metro station and 3 stops to the city centre The Hotel staff were friendly and courteous The room was of average size but had all the basic facilities and comfortable beds The windows opened into the backyard The bathroom had good facilities plenty of hot water but only liquid soap dispensers There is a supermarket just up the street and a major shopping precinct with plenty of restaurants of all flavours near the metro station The superb Gluten Free restaurant Zum Wohl is within walking distance
501901,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The bathroom in our room was extremely small especially the shower Location is nice near a very busy pedestrian street with many shops but you need more than 30 min by foot to reach the city center Breakfast could be a little bit better , Everybody was very helpful and polite The room was very clean and quite 
501902,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Very cosy hotel unlike many hotels in Wien Wifi is working very good and heating is actually enough it was a nice stay very clean bed is confortable and the hotel staff left a good impression Compared with other hotels in the same price this one was the best choice Breakfast could have more variety but all in all it was very good Location is near to the shopping street and you can get very easy in the center by U bahn or walking 2 km 
501903,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The only issue was that the frame above the bed is too low I assume that the designer of this frame never actually tried laying on the bed It s just too easy to hit your head when you want to read something or watch the TV , The location is great and so is the hotel itself Fresh rooms comfy beds spacious enough the staff was eager to help 
501904,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Poor selections at the hotel s bar, Excellent breakfast internet coverage all over the hotel cleanliness of the room and bed s comfort is a plus 
501905,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, i I could not made tv more quietly than Vol 10 , I was very pleased with the hotel The location is perfect only 2minutes walk to the U bahn employee was very friendly The garage is under hotel so you dont have to walk outside Room is very comfortable and nice i like the breakfast very much 
501906,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Excellent location 2 min from metro station superlative organic breakfast with everything you can wish for very silent at night stuff very friendly and efficient 
501907,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Parking is not the easiest however they have a garage where parking costs 21 EUR night , Good location city center 5 10 miuntes by car delicious breakfast comfortable room 
501908,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Most of the hotels pensions I have tried in that area of the city in the price range of EUR 60 80 per night had either too small rooms or were too old or feeling cheap or were not so comfortable in general so I did not expect a lot from this hotel and was very pleasantly surprised It was indeed quite modern very clean the room was adequately spacious and facilities and services were good So it s my definite candidate for another stay 
501909,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Nothing to dislike , Another excellent hotel from austria trend chain clean close to the metro station and big shopping street good wifi All in all superb value for money 
501910,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The beds were very thin and could have been softer , The hotel is fantastic and walking distance to most of the sights we walked from the central train station which took about 1 hour The room is very clean with all features The room was very quiet Good value for money compared with Bern Paris etc
501911,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, like a couple we didn t like the hole between the mattresses it was uncomfortable and very noisy street in the morning but when the window is closed than was it ok , Great wifi and very tasty breakfasts 
501912,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Everything was very good Most of the staff was very friendly and professional There was a misunderstanding regarding the purchase of the Vienna pass or the transportation card I think the staff member who checked us in could have explained it better When we questioned our final bill charges another staff person quickly brushed us off saying there was nothing she could do for us A little more professionalism was necessary We could have per sued it further but chose not to , Location breakfast atmosphere 
501913,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, This hotel is very well located just a 3 min walk to the closest subway station and to the Mariahilfer strass Good breakfast Simple but nice rooms 
501914,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, The most amazing part of the hotel is the absolutely outstanding breakfast It s really various delicious and served like in a very expensive 5 stars hotel Metro is roughly 3 minutes walk We will definitely come back

501916,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, No A C in the room, The staff on all shifts were very friendly and helpful We also enjoyed the short distance it was to the shopping strip and U Bahn terminal It was on a quiet street 
501917,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Nothing really , I loved this hotel Everything was great and def will come back Good location close to metro very comfortable and cosy room friendly staff Thank you a lot 
501918,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Cleaning of bathroom could be improved toilet bowl was dirty , The beds and sofa were realy confortabile Breakfast was also good with lots of options 
501919,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, breakfast should be more variate no air conditioning few European TV channels most of them being in German, good location right next to a metro station clean and quiet room comfortable bed
501920,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, I booked a double bed and got a twin bed instead It was very uncomfortable I don t know which person could imagine a twin bed being romantic We did not ask for another room as we had no time to deal with that but this mistake should not happen to a 4 star hotel in Vienna The painting in the room is terrible , Asked for a quiet and romantic room it was like that but the main request was a double bed which we did not get The staff were very sweet 
501921,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Room was a little hot stuffy but it was the middle of summer , Friendly helpfull staff superb breakfast great location for shops trams metro
501922,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, This is a small perhaps a boutique hotel so facilities outside of the room were limited eg restaurant wasn t open in tge evening any of the days I was there My biggest complaint was the lack of air conditioning It was summer so this was a problem An upright fan did just enough to enable me to sleep but if it had been any warmer and for a few days the fan would have been useless , Good location clean and well organised The hotel is only a short walk away from the Mariahilfer Stra e which leads to the Hofburg palace and St Stephens Breakfast was very good with a wide variety of food to choose from 
501923,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Good tourist hotel which fulfill the basic needs for a good vacation Central location and very easy to use the public transport which is in a short walking distance from the hotel Breakfast is worth the cost 
501924,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, One member of staff at reception was very unfriendly and unhelpful throughout our stay There was no air condition in the entire building so we barely slept In relation to facilities the bar is connected onto the reception desk very small area that we certainly wouldn t consider to be described as a bar , The hotel is located close enough to the underground The guests can avail of the use of a computer and printer 
501925,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The bathroom was not very good plumbing problems No air condition in the room , Big rooms The hotel is close to main shopping street Close to metro station Nice breakfast
501926,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Very hot in the rooms There was a small fan but it did not help much Also there was a party all night long in the courtyard below , Excellent breakfast buffet Great location near the Westbahnhof and subway station and an easy walk to the Ring 
501927,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Everything The hotel was near a metro station quiet street room clean throughout our stay we just enjoyed it really so much that we would love to come again 
501928,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, For me the bed was too soft of course this is a matter of personal preference A pity the hotel description says the staff speaks Italian but we were not lucky with the receptionist Perhaps other colleagues But these are just minor imperfections , Excellent location in a quiet street U Bahn stop just round the corner Caf s shopping and dining opportunities in the neighbourhood Clean and practically furnished room big enough lots of storage space for personal things 
501929,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, The tea was not brilliant they need to provide a breakfast tea Darjeeling and EarL Grey too weak , quiet area with good transport links to airport Schonbrunn Palace and centre of Vienna Excellent breakfast lots of choice all organic The standard rooms mainly look over a courtyard which is very quiet the executive rooms overlook the one way road outside Supermarket just across the road closed sundays and plenty of choice of restaurants nearby Very helpful and friendly staff

501933,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Not so great with speaking english No kettle in the room , They had eco friendly products in the bathroom and were accommodating to my bed request the buffet breakfast was a good start to our day 
501934,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, Great breakfast with variety and organic products Choice of pillow was a big extra Spotless clean Very polite and helpful staff Near a very busy market street with lots of shops and restaurants Metro station U3 near Just a few stops from the center frequency of trains is very good every 4 5 min A very reconmended stay 
501935,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, Nothing Everything was fine , Extremely nice and cosy hotel in a perfect location next to the main shopping street and few blocks away from Westbahnhof Spacious and elegant room in a very good condition very friendly and helpful stuff 
501936,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien, One girl in the reception with orange hair and freckles i dont remember her name but she had the most horrible attitude She didnt smile one bit and whenever we asked her anything about directions she would reply back with a very frustrated attitude Shes a bad reflection for the hotel All the other hotel staff were fine , The location is perfect near maria hilfer strasse a main shopping street in vienna and near the underground Rooms r not necessarily small like other rooms in europe Clean hotel Good wifi
501937,Austria Trend Hotel Anatol Wien,No Negative, The front desk was extremely helpful and friendly going so far as to try to make reservations for me and my wife at nearby thermal baths in Baden bei Wien my German was not up to the task arranging airport transportation and being otherwise of assistance In particular the young man at the desk was extremely pleasant and helpful I believe his first name was Dominic The location on Webgasse is superb and with the U Bahn station entrance just a short distance up that street the Zieglergasse stop on Mariahilferstrasse the main shopping street unless you want to pay 1st District prices getting around in the city was effortless and quick This was about the 3rd or 4th year we have stayed here at Christmas and it has never disappointed
