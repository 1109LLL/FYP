87052,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Location is far from the popular points of Paris 15 30 minute cab ride to most spots My adapter for the wall outlet disappeared after my room was serviced My room was overcharged incorrectly and now they want me to supply my bank account information for a refund Sloppy, The indoor and outdoor pools are fantastic perfect for both lounging or serious lap swimming There is a park nearby for walking biking or running The food is pretty good Friendly staff 
87053,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The fact that guests can only use the pool until noon the day of their departure is unacceptable considering the expensive price tag of the hotel, The pool and the resort feeling
87054,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The first morning the power went out which included AC to room Basically the only reason I was staying there Elevators didn t work The only thing that functioned was room keys Staff was clueless although nice and no extras offered as consolation Luckily they got it sorted in a few hours but I was disappointed in the inconvenience , I live in town but Booked a 2 night stay during a massive heatwave Enjoyed the AC when working and pool 
87055,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, We had a really bad experience and do not recommend the hotel at all It s only advantage is the large pool in the middle but everything else is horrible designed and highly overpriced Please don t stay there if you want to have a quiet and relaxed holiday experience You will not get it ,No Positive
87056,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The shower room my husband had to wipe up the water from all over the floor after every shower as it was totally unsuitable for a disabled person with walking balance problems , The friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff food very good 
87057,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The personal belongings disappear from the room The party in the restaurant went till 0130 AM and the sound proofing in the room couldn t handle it There is no clear info warning how to get to the hotel on the day of the local sporting events due to closure of the local roads , Two big pools choice of parking staff
87058,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, too warm blanket was replaced by the service on request very small table wrong position of the lamp over the table one strikes his head against the lamp over and over again and the reading lamp over the bed which was very difficult to switch on and off , 2 swimming pools with good length and the possibility to use them from 7 a m to 10 p m 
87059,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The location was perfect for me near where my meetings were but if you re visiting purely for sightseeing the classic Eiffel Notre Dame etc there are better closer locations , Swimming outdoors in the winter in the middle of Paris No problem There is a massive warm swimming pool and the indoor one is really good too There s plenty of art all over the hotel The food was amazing 
87060,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, You always need a taxi to get there It is far from the metro and the bus does not have a great route for tourists , The rooms are great the staff very helpful the brakefeast excellent and the swimming pool exceptional 
87061,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, incompetent staff no access to the lounge chairs at the pool 3 days in a row chaos at breakfast, beds architecture size of the room restaurant on the roof top
87062,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The only small niggle was the air conditioning that we didn t manage to set to a comfortable temperature , Fabulous pools both inside and out Beds were very comfortable and we loved the room decor which was a mix of modern and art deco Staff were welcoming and friendly and we would definitely stay again 
87063,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, no chance of getting a propper chair at the swimming pool overcrowded with the club members from the neighbourhood who get priority complete chaos at breakfast arrogance of the team lack of management, roof terrasse restaurant good food and excellent service incredible view comfort of the beds size of the room
87064,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Awful circulation in the hotel Confusing mix of members clients external visitors No quiet space for hotel clients only Rooms very small Mood around the pool nervous people to get a decent spot and show of Long wait at restaurant for ok food only Very poor breakfast experience , Definitely not a 5 star hotel More like a club med for blas Parisians but friendly staff Beautiful swimming pool 
87065,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The service Often poor with the odd exceptional member of staff but overall not of level expected for class of hotel , Great pool and hotel facilities Comfy rooms excellent bathroom and lovely view of pool 
87066,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, 10 00 breakfast finish On departure day after 3 days it would have been nice to use pool beyond 14 00 flight at 21 00 , Great hotel immaculate cleanliness smells Clinic fabulous rooftop restaurant and staff fantastic Breakfast finished at 10 00 an extra 30 minutes would have been better for those on a relaxing break
87067,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, The hotel did not have the extra bed prepared on check in for our son even though it was in the booking It was also very expensive would have liked to be recognised as returning guests we stayed there at the same time last year ,No Positive
87068,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, breakfast needs an upgrade very simple , luxurious hotel with perfect spa and swimming pool I stayed there just for relaxation few days from everything and it did the job perfectly 
87069,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, I completely enjoyed the experience , Loved the location good to be out of central Paris but we could get to any place we needed very easily Love the decor Restaurant is very nice and the staff is very courteous I don t speak French unfortunately but the English skills of the staff are very good 
87070,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, it is far from city center and with paris traffic it takes a bit more than 20 minutes to reach s mam to the center and because of it s location next to football stadium when there is a football match it will be crazy ,No Positive
87071,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Room service was very disappointing cold uncooked 1h15min but problem may have been just that night , Amazing pool swimming outdoors in February is just amazing 
87072,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, coffee once again the French get this wrong prices in the bar that we couldn t stay forever, night swimming in the pool bedrooms and showers in one room sounds bad but works perfectly views of the pool from every room breakfast service

87076,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Private function meant access to rooftop area was limited Making it difficult for regular guests , Pool and decor of hotel trendy Close to metro station Helpful staff Pastries at breakfast yummy not so keen on portion size 
87077,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Restaurant and food options are very poor for such a nice place Staff has a good attitude but has not the experience nor the reactivty of a 5 star hotel We went to have dinner on the tapar bar on the terrace they had no more meat left and it is supposed to be a grill bbq tapas bar The service was also very slow and unorganized Drinks come after the dishes i ask for an ash tray and the waiter points me the next table and says you got it there Anyway with some simple training and internal organsation everything can be resolved The place is really nice and great things to offer considering its location , The facilities and equipement is very good quality 
87078,Molitor Paris MGallery by Sofitel, Wish it was more inside Paris can take a long time to go from there to the heart of Paris, The place is unique and the room facing the swimming pool are perfect If you like architecture you will not be disapointed If you want to visit and relax it is wonderful
