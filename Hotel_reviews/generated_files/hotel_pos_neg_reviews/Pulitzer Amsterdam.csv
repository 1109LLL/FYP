420491,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Would have liked some more indoor seating sofas , Lovely garden courtyards perfect for summer weather Good restaurant pleasant bar and cafe Very helpful and friendly staff 
420492,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The rooms are well decorated and the hotel is a wonderful maze of art and glass covered walkways waiting to be explored The kind of place where you want to make sure to actually plan some vacation time to be in the hotel and slow down to enjoy its wonderful gardens amazing bar and or just have a coffee in one of the many quiet corners and watch the world walk be 
420493,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, This unusual luxury hotel was a pleasant surprise with an interesting history The initial room booked was not large enough for all our luggage and it did not have a Canal view for which we had asked On paying an extra Euro 50 per day my husband and I then had everything we could want The various courtyards where one could sit drink eat were very nice indeed 
420494,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was a bit small but very efficiently furnished The beds were very comfortable The breakfast was amazing and the staff were friendly Lovely gardens and outdoor dinning area We had dinner in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good The location is perfect Everything was just great and can t wait to be back again 
420495,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Overall we were unimpressed with our deluxe room which had a view of a wall It was large about 28 square meters but the space was more rustic without luxury touches We were very surprised that this 5 star hotel had no evening turn down service We travel light having one carry on each for a 2 week vacation even so we though the storage was poor consisting of one small wardrobe with 3 small drawers plus enough space to hang 4 or 5 articles The only place to sit was on the one very uncomfortable settee An awkward corner writing desk had just enough surface for the kettle french press cups saucers etc A Nespresso would be much better suited for the space We value quiet so noticed that the soundproofing between floors was poor Heard furniture moving and normal conversations On the other hand the soundproofing was excellent against outdoor noise , The location is perfect The garden area is a lovely sanctuary in the city Check in out was well handled service was correct The bed was very comfortable and we liked having a walk in shower rather than a tub We also appreciated the USB charging stations which meant we didn t need to use converters to charge our electronics 
420496,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The concierge were amazing and gave great advise I also lost an earring and they found it and were so efficient in making sure I got it back Such a fantastic hotel Great food at the restaurant and wonderful location We ll be back 
420497,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Quite expensive Although this is relative to Amsterdam , Beautiful sanctuary in a busy City Lovely quiet Beautiful breakfast Nicely refurbished very clean 
420498,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Please explain security to guests The lounge is open to the public which is nice however I felt everyone other then guests could walk up to my hotel room , Nice staff great location and rooms Fun dining at Restaurant Janz Had the best salad nicoise ever 
420499,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The guest relations incharge would hv a stsndard snswer to all my queries saying she would call back Sometimes she would and most times not call at all, The location the decor
420500,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Very very small bedroom view out of the tiny window was of a drainpipe no bath difficult to plug in the kettle and make a drink in the limited space strange smell on the landing shower leaked water all over the bathroom floor so was a slipping hazard Not much hanging space told there was a free boat but it was booked up in advance Nice hotel but overpriced for what we got Have stayed in better 5 star hotels and at less cost in other European major cities , The attendant in reception let us park outside whilst we checked in and took our cases to the room very friendly
420501,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Clean in the room however public area such as restaurant could be more clean The table and chairs , Nice location room and service Came for the shampoo brand Love it I informed the hotel that the trip was for my mum s bday when I booked the hotel and they gave us a small cake Thank you 
420502,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, An outstanding hotel the service was excellent great breakfasts friendly and helpful staff Loved the way the old buildings had been utilised in the design of the hotel 
420503,Pulitzer Amsterdam, it is a bit overpriced but to be fair all hotels in Amsterdam are overpriced Breakfast is way too expensive 28EUR per person is way too much for what it has to offer , the hotel has been just renovated so everything is fresh and new Very customer friendly and customer oriented service Great facilities for meeting rooms conferences staff is very friendly and always willing to help The location is amazing though very close by to all touristic places but the gardens of the hotel are very quite and peaceful for you to relax and chill Quite paradise in the middle of hectic Amsterdam 
420504,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Room for 3 was very small but ok , The avocado brioche was amazing Lovely gardens and nice respite from the busy city Perfect location The boat ride is a must 
420505,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Such a comfortable and beautiful room the staff were lovely and the gardens were the perfect place to hang out We loved everything about this hotel thank you for a wonderful stay 
420506,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The F B is far below expectations Service is underperforming as well as kitchen performance does not match with the prices , Location beautiful inner courtyard nice interior design vivid Bar
420507,Pulitzer Amsterdam, A couple of times there was quite a bit of congestion getting up and down on the elevators Other than that I have no complaints , Not your average hotel Beautiful comfy room Lovely art throughout the hotel Excellent breakfast with lots of really good coffee Staff is very helpful Walking distance to anything you will likely want to do see in Amsterdam Be sure to take the canal tour via the hotel boat It was lovely 
420508,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Reservations are not correctly handled Checkin process is superslow cleanliness just average like wise food quality is also just about average , Location
420509,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Mouse in the bar and pour response when complained No access to money an in house atm would be useful, Bed very comfor table nice courtyard to sit in Own canal boat great
420510,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing, Always thought about staying here as move up from my usual hotels in Amsterdam Glad I did Staff was usually helpful Would stay here again but not by myself 
420511,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Some staff is not fair I asked a good room but he gave me not a good one Someone came after then they got better rooms So I asked for a change Then Kerry front office found a better foom for us Thanks a lot So I don t know whey they don t give better rooms to earlier arrived customers It is not fair Another problem was about storage room They brougt us only one right suitcase the other 3 were wrong , Beautiful garden location
420512,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Room on second floor and above the bar so noise travels up Small but adequate bathroom Bad lighting for dressing table use, Room size Comfybeds Decor
420513,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing, What a fantastic hotel stunning interior and the bedroom was beautiful The bed was so comfortable and bedding Room was well stocked with proper hairdryer lovely toiletries and complimentary water tea and coffee The staff were all very friendly and helpful Hotel bar was great and well stocked Will defiantly return 
420514,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Very noisy and noise complaints weren t handled professionally Rooms were only made up after 4pm in the afternoon some days after 5 30pm, Beautiful building with stunning decor Brilliant location Great restaurant
420515,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, We loved this hotel It was beautifully designed the location was perfect the staff was very friendly the breakfast included in our rate was delicious and the hotel bar was fantastic We d stay here again and again 
420516,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful hotel though pricey Location could not be better Busy sometimes during the day with a lot of people checking in and out but lovely location really made it worth it 
420517,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The rooms are a bit pricey I stayed in room 310 which was right next to the service room I could hear noise through the walls in early morning , What a fantastic hotel Aside from its amazing location the rooms are beautifully designed and very cosy Would stay there again in a heartbeat
420518,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Because my room was next to the door to garden and to the next building hotel staff walked by all the time making noises from shutting the doors It will be nice if the staff traffic could be reduced , Room was comfortable and came with french press good coffee and tea Colour pencils were useful to mark the map The room gave such welcoming feeling that I felt at home 
420519,Pulitzer Amsterdam, On booking com the room included the VAT Tax of 6 and the City Sales tax of 5 They added another 5 City Tax on to the total price Then when they put the total amount on my credit card they charged me an extra 100 on top of that Unbelievably very shady Booking needs to do a better job monitoring the hotels ,No Positive
420520,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Found the check in chaotic and rather uncaring it was so odd to be given a map of the property by the front desk instead of being escorted to the room I only say this as the hotel is made up of many different old homes and is a bit of a labyrinth to the jet lagged and newly arrived They are so busy I can t help but think the customer service is under pressure With so many other fine hotels in the area I do hope they work on this as in the rest of the hotel we had excellent service , The room was very clean with lots of natural light from the large windows super shower and toiletries The hotel has a lovely internal garden with excellent service and afternoon sun Location is perfect for the 9 streets Jordan area 
420521,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had a lovely view of the Canal the first room we had offered was on the top floor and covered two floors it was really nice and quirky but we asked if it was possible to have a room all on one level and that was sorted out within 10 minutes of the request the staff could not have been more helpful 
420522,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing we didn t like or would wish to change, Our room was huge and had a beautiful bathroom with LeLabo products The hotel has an unusual quirky layout due to it consisting of a whole block of typical Amsterdam canal buildings this made for an interesting stay though we did get lost a few times Very friendly staff great breakfasts what more could you want We managed to walk everywhere too as the location is very central A lovely location to be based 
420523,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The service is fine but not great for a 5 star hotel The hotel is made of several townhouses that were merged into this quaint yet fancy hotel Some rooms are located in between floors which means you may have to go up and down some stairs to reach yours Considering this in a 5 star accomodation I would expect to have a bellman to carry my heavy luggage and not have to do it myself The bathroom is not equiped with a bath only a shower The breakfast was a disappointment to us and so was the bar , The rooms are nicely appointed clean and super charming The room and bathroom are really large for a town hotel and well lit which is great for makeup The delicious tea and coffee as well as some Dutch cookies are a pleasant surprise All the necessities are provided umbrella water maps etc The hotel is located in a nice neighboorhood 
420524,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Early check failed and no backup room for change The twin beds room is too small bed is narrow to sleep well , The location is excellent The hotel design is fantastic with beautiful garden restaurant 
420525,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Breakfast much too expensive Free city maps MUCH Too small scale no good at all this should be remedied immediately Reception staff a little slow, Ambiance and decoration Bar was very comfortable and friendly Food was good quality but expensive Bathroom small but well designed Bed very comfortable
420526,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The breakfast menu could have maybe been rotated a bit Other than that no quibbles , We had a lovely view from our room of the pretty canal The hotel had beautiful gardens with hanging swings and outdoor seating areas Breakfast was great Croissants were particularly good had a nice crunch when you bit into it We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne as well for our week long stay which was an unexpected lovely touch Also loved the little touches stroopwafels bottled water everyday A candy platter in the lobby Very kid friendly too 
420527,Pulitzer Amsterdam, I was expecting a charming boutique hotel until I found out that they have 200 rooms I was surprised It s till charming but less personal than expected For the rates they apply I think the standard room classic room are rather on the small side especially the bathrooms , I appreciated the interior design in this mansion It s very nicely and stylish decorated I would recommend the bar Excellent location if you want to be in the middle of the city center 
420528,Pulitzer Amsterdam, There is absolutely nothing that I didn t like about this hotel The only thing I don t like is that i can t go back more often as I live in Florida and that was a long flight I didn t like that I couldn t afford one of the amazing suites , This hotel is unbelievable They took the charm and warmth of 25 17th 18th century homes and seamlessly connected them Then they modernized them perfectly and added in all the luxuries of a 5 star hotel As I explored this stunning hotel I discovered beautiful little nooks and crannies around every corner I highly recommend a visit to the Pulitzer Bar It has a chic speakeasy vibe and is perfect for a hand crafted cocktail I really liked the Paloma cocktail and went back for it several times during my stay The cafe and restaurant are also fantastic The location is also wonderful as everything is so convenient to walk to and also gives you the authentic Amsterdam feeling The outdoor space at the hotel is really enjoyable as well I seriously loved every single thing about this hotel and would love to stay there again 
420529,Pulitzer Amsterdam, We were there for 6 nights there was no place in the bathroom to put your personal toiletries and is small for 2 people Also very little drawer space so we had to live out of our luggage for the 6 days No shelves or space to store your clothes but the room is pretty , The location is excellent the service is outstanding the decor is beautiful 
420530,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The view from the room was not great a roof of an internal courtyard but we were not in the room that much so it wasn t a big issue You had to pay more for a canal view and we decided not to take up that option even though it was offered If you love a view it is probably worth paying the extra , The bathroom was really well designed and the products were luxurious 
420531,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Our stay was fantastic The garden and glass hallways are so beautiful and romantic but I was especially impressed by how attentive the staff was We asked for more complimentary cookies because they were soo good and the concierge brought us like four packs 
420532,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Gorgeous rooms thoughtfully and tastefully appointed Spacious and elegant The staff was incredibly professional and restaurant and bar were phenomenal
420533,Pulitzer Amsterdam, rooms are not very sound proof you can hear the neighbors some times , location was great hotel had great character and very friendly staff nice rooms good value for money
420534,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Floor plan is a maze too difficult to access rooms we felt we were in basement Room above had timber floor so you could hear noise from upstairs , Great coffee in room comfy bed
420535,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Hotel was recommended to us by friends who live in Amsterdam and what a wonderful recommendation it was The location is fantastic and within walking distance of most tourist attractions We stayed in a room with a view of the canal which is definitely worth the extra money The size of our room and bathroom were great and special mention must be made of the shower which was fantastic It was big and roomy with an amazing shower head The decor is great and the attention to detail impressive All the staff were polite and extremely helpful I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again 
420536,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Awesome hotel filled with character right on the canal and close to the centre of Amsterdam Great neighbourhood with lots of quirky little shops and restaurants nearby 
420537,Pulitzer Amsterdam, I had to think really hard about this The only negative was we were called at 7 30 a m to be told our taxis had arrived In fact the caller had got the wrong room number It really did not matter as we were up anyway but I suppose if we had been asleep it might have been a little annoying , The rooms were extremely comfortable and well serviced The staff could not have done more to ensure our stay was a great one Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly We didn t eat in their main restaurant but the breakfast was excellent and their 24 hour food and drinks bar served delicious snacks and lunches which we enjoyed on two occasions 
420538,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Room was too hot and temperature controls appeared to make no difference , Excellent location with very friendly helpful staff Room and hotel was what you would expect for the price 
420539,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The only downside to our stay was having to complain as our bathroom kept smelling of cigarette smoke despite the property being non smoking The response from the hotel was speedy and could not have been more polite , Location of the Pulitzer is perfect The staff everywhere in at the hotel are wonderful interested and responsive The aesthetic is lovely The bar is a relaxing cool place to while away a few hours down time the food is great at Janz and our boat trip on the tourist was special not least being the envy of all the larger boats meandering around the canals 
420540,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Timeliness of service response could be better Sometimes I had to wait a long time for service request , Food was delicious Front desk staff great New gym is good Location is great Lovely place right up there with the Dylan at a lower price point All the small touches are great and well considered such as Santal personal care products complementary coffee tea and water in the room Nicely appointed and comfortable 
420541,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The Queen Deluxe Suite didn t match it s name No balcony no view small room Dont name it Queen Deluxe has nothing royal in it , Pulitzer offers you an unforgettable experience Building ornaments paintings decorations dating from the XVII century give you the real taste of Amsterdam 
420542,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The cleaning person wasn t very thorough She didn t restock the toiletry items or the Kleenex And the sink was VERY slow draining through out my stay It s a 5 star hotel so I would have thought small issues like this would be taken care of immediately This is the one area they definitely need to improve on , I LOVED this hotel Even though I didn t have a canal view room extra my room was still VERY lovely and over looked a courtyard The room was spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable 
420543,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Only that the duvets were really thick and I was boiling hot And as rooms with a view are few and far between they will cost extra , Gorgeous place lovely peaceful location but within 15 20min walk of everywhere Helpful staff 
420544,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The style and design of the hotel which was characterful and beautiful The comfort of the bedroom was particularly exceptional The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful 
420545,Pulitzer Amsterdam, I loved it all, The location was fantastic the staff in the hotel were so nice The concierge was great in helping us find tickets to museums They provided us bikes The hotel was a 10 plus
420546,Pulitzer Amsterdam, there was a problem with the heatring and we were very chilled after walking around all day, the whole ambience and the way it fitted in to the city canals the quirky decor all superb
420547,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Great job, Wifi was very good Staff were very responsive Breakfast was wonderful with a lot of choices really liked the hot and cold options Location was perfect Extras like toiletries and caffe were wonderful Very quiet Very clean We had two rooms for our family and they were both very quaint Although check out was crowded there were plenty of staff to handle the rush Door people were hospitable and very accommodating as we left our luggage at the hotel hold on our last day 
420548,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing all lovely , It was all really perfect one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in All staff were so friendly and helpful the decor is amazing lovely outdoor space great breakfasts and a great bar And the location is perfect 
420549,Pulitzer Amsterdam, 1 A five star hotel normally has two chambermaid visits per day as opposed to a four star This one had only one visit 2 The room was slightly ugly due to dark grey walls a porthole which could not be covered between the bathroom toilet and the room no privacy a hard to close door for the bathroom drafty windows too narrow curtains which could not mask the streetlight properly strange shapes of furniture 3 The hotel has a funky feel rather than luxury feel which might be good for a three to four star hotel but not for a five star one , Excellent service and breakfast 
420550,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful hotel and architecture using old row houses and architectural details Great location by the canal and 9 streets Staff was very friendly and helpful
420551,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Small bathroom with annoying door in room 344 kept getting in the way , Staff all friendly would always speak to you Lovely classy hotel great bar and eating facilities 
420552,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Although we booked a superior King room the room was still quite small We were travelling for four weeks and found it hard to store all our luggage not enough space in the wardrobe no space to store our suitcases Other than that everything was great , Beautiful rooms Pause Bar is fantastic for coffee and crispy croissants pastries and the Pullitzer Bar is great for a pre dinner drink Stunning looking bar with super drinks list The bed is comfortable and the pillows are great Location is the best 
420553,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were extraordinarily helpful and friendly The concierge team under Ron were marvellous in the way they were willing to help us with whatever we wanted to do in Amsterdam 
420554,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Can t think of anything , Great location lovely and spacious room amazing staff always trying to make our stay even more special Loved the restaurant too 
420555,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing, Room was super comfortable and felt luxurious with great attention to detail and high end products Breakfast was amazing especially the croissants Staff were so welcoming and helpful throughout from reception to bar staff Great cocktails being mixed in the bar 
420556,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, We always stay at the Pulitzer when we visit Amsterdam and were very pleased to see it been recently redecorated The room is big spacious and bed is extra comfortable Love the new art work that s all over the hotel as well

420562,Pulitzer Amsterdam, nothing i didn t like even the coffee which is notoriously bad in Amsterdam is GOOD , everything the staff the service the hotel the food The location is amazing the hotel is absolutely gorgeous if you are going to Amsterdam do not stay anywhere else 
420563,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Loved this hotel Very classy hotel in a very nice neighborhood The room was a bit on the smaller side but still very comfortable The gym was much bigger than we expected and was a godsend in the frigid Amsterdam winter as we were able to avoid running outside We took the hotel s boat for a canal cruise It costs 38 Euros per person but is worth the extra cost 
420564,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, the breakfast is very delicious and the staff very friendly and always helpful make our trip in amsterdam a delight couldn t have chosen a better place to stay 
420565,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Warm environment on cold days, Staff at hotel were very helpful and friendly Always available with suggestions to improve trip to Amsterdam as well as recommendations to other locations I will return to this hotel in the future 
420566,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Everything was great but I forgot to ask for a room with bath which I love though it did have a good shower , The bed and duvet were superb staff friendly and helpful breakfast divine 
420567,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Exceptional hotel A great welcome from all staff from the minute you walk through the door Well deserving of a 5 rating Interesting layout with rooms in the canal houses surrounding a central courtyard Everything was of a very high quality 
420568,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Twin Room was very small beds were small and the lighting in the room was diabolical Not really very practical Packing and unpacking very testing in the very small space available Would be ok for overnight but not as we were for a longer stay Room disappointing Rest of hotel and break very enjoyable , Staff all well informed pleasant and polite
420569,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Guests smoking and chatting on a walkway right outside our room at 6 30am , Pricey but nice The hotel rooms and whole complex are really individual The Pulitzer Bar cocktails were gorgeous 
420570,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was very helpful The hotel is beautifully designed and super comfortable The tourist boat ride organized by the hotel is amazing 
420571,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Spent 250 a night and that didn t include breakfast , Smelt beautiful when you walked into the reception area Room was a lovely size and very comfortable Hotel was visually pleasing on the eye
420572,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was as expected from hotel of this calibre thoroughly enjoyed our stay Location was superb close to many attractions without being in hustle and bustle I will stay here again 
420573,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The insulation is terrible We had a room where we could hear all the conversation of our neighbours whilst chatting at 2am The staff changed our room and upgraded us but we could still hear all the movement from the floor above us It s an old house and the insulation is bad , The location is ideal and the decoration is warm and cozy Excellent restaurant faculties 
420574,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Some improvements were needed in our room One bed lacked a reading light and the telephone didn t work Both were quickly put right, The Concierge team was particularly helpful The food and service in the restaurant were excellent
420575,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing A top experience all round , Very warm and attentive staff Excellent cuisine Amazing room And the interior decor out of this world Such amazing attention to detail in even the little things 
420576,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Very set 4 course meal in Janz restaurant Christmas No choice in it Very fatty rib eye steak Expensive bad value And I was made to pay in full in advance Unimpressed Slow service for such a simple meal to produce I repeat everyone in the room had all the same meal , Cocktail bar
420577,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location beautifully restored and decorated fantastic view of the canal from room and friendly staff Great food and drinks The Pulitzer s boat tour in the 1909 salon boat was a unique experience 
420578,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Very friendly and stylish Le Labo toiletries the divine smell as you enter the lobby comfortable cosy bar with excellent cocktails Very well located for Nine Streets boutique shopping canal side walks and proximity to Anne Frank house 
420579,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The extra bed in room could have been sturdier it felt a bit flimsy and under threat of collapse Some bigger extra pillows too on the extra bed There was no turn down service either so coming back to the room in the evening to find it was not prepared for sleeping , Location was perfect Breakfast was great Room was very nice and cosy Staff were friendly and very helpful we had excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants Wonderful bar and delicious cocktails recommended and expertly made by the bar man 
420580,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Took an age to get served breakfast and then they forgot about it Great food when it finally turned up though, Got upgraded to a suite Nice friendly staff
420581,Pulitzer Amsterdam, pillows very soft no space in the room for luggage felt like a transit camp with people coming to look use the lobby bar cafe and restaurant perhaps there should be an area for rescients only a buzz is good a transit camp feel is not , staff ambience
420582,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Although our twin room was clean comfortable and had nearly all necessary facilities it did lack armchairs For over 200 per night I expect a room with a comfy chair or two not just a chair at the desk Also extras like drinks breakfast 28 euros and the boat trip are very expensive So mostly very good but questionable value for money as so expensive , Great location and most interesting and unusual layout Standard of hotel environment was exceptionally good Loved the walk in shower and the excellent TV with three BBC channels Staff were all very professional pleasant and helpful 
420583,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The shower is tooooo low cant fit underneath but now we re really being pedantic I suppose , Awesome place there is a buzz from when you enter reception through to the excellent bar and the courtyard Service is almost un European best we have ever enjoyed around Europe s major cities Couldn t fault it Quality of the food from coffee to cocktail is 
420584,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, one of the lovely hotels that i stayed in its a historic 25 connecting Golden Age canal houses which has been totally renovated last year great service great staff highly recommended
420585,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The website indicates that the hotel has an airport shuttle this is NOT the case They will call a taxi for you but there is not shuttle Any hotel will call a taxi this is falsely advertised Be sure to factor the additional transportation costs to and from the airport into your trip ahead of time , The staff was friendly and the facility was clean and updated 
420586,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Bar staff were not super friendly, Fantastic location Walking distance to almost everything The bed and down comforter were amazingly cozy There were special dutch cookies in our room upon arrival Concierge staff were extremely helpful
420587,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The obnoxiously loud German ladies hooting and hollering in the bar , The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly Breakfast was delicious The bar was active and servers were very attentive The boat tour was an extra treat Capt Tony knew his stuff and gave an excellent and very interesting tour 
420588,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Room service lasagna was not good at all , The location can t be beat In addition this is a terrific value for the price The beds were comfortable room was nice newly renovated All of the staff were friendly and very helpful 
420589,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Breakfast was quite poor Food was cold when it was received and plates were not topped up which meant if you were on a time scale you ate little to no breakfast, Hotel was in good location
420590,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Loft room for 3 with sofa made up all the Time no where to sit in the room during day or eat room service of a night, Great Location quiet part of town yet close walking distance to everything 
420591,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Our room slightly dark and lighting can be improved More power plugs will be good to have Not a broad TV channel selection to choose from , Recently refurbished and nice contemporary decor We booked a spacious room for 3 with the extra roller beds and we are given a room on the ground floor which is good size for us Originally i thought it will be noisy but it turned out to be acceptable Room is comfy and clean with helpful staff Nice neighborhood and we had a very pleasant stroll around the beautiful canals surrounding the hotel The complimentary stroop waffle is a nice touch Breakfast is included and a good selection to choose from 
420592,Pulitzer Amsterdam, heating ventilation it the rooms was a little noisy, the hotel is refined very chic very well decorated a warm atmosphere at the lobby Location is excellent beautiful neighborhood would recommend the tour by the hotels beautiful boat the personnel was attentive great experience
420593,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything about this hotel made me smile The interiors the incredibly comfortable bed the absolutely superb breakfast delicious cocktails in the bar and super friendly and helpful staff to name but a few I will most definitely be back soon 
420594,Pulitzer Amsterdam, food was only average and expensive however there are a good selection of restaurants nearby , A fabulous hotel in a great location all the staff were so helpful room 480 was fantastic everything was perfect however the upgrade was an extra 50 euros per night We took a cruise on the vintage 1910 hotel launch it was excellent 
420595,Pulitzer Amsterdam, To be perfect there should be the possibility to link your modern technology to a speaker or have even a radio HiFi facility in the room rather than playing of the TV Room service menus not available In the room at arrival And hair dryer was missing But that s just to be picky and push for the perfect score which this hotel certainly deserves , Great location great service
420596,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The rooms are on the small side and housekeeping wasnt very good room wasnt vacumed and i found black hairs, The staff is what makes this hotel great And location The breakfast is amazing And take the boat trip from hotel it was really great 
420597,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The old staff was better and more helpful and respectful Reception was very sneaky and radical valet was very aggressive they over do it and almost beg to be tipped I was asked for 3 different identification means at check in and I been there 3 times so far booking com can attest to that Maybe they just don t like me , The location and bath tub
420598,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Our suite had a door to the outside and people kept knocking on the door to get in to the hotel Also too much space wasted on the corridor of the suite so useable space was small for the price, Location and atmosphere
420599,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The price is a bit hefty considering that we had a room without view no bathtub and no breakfast included On the other side top hotels in Amsterdam are just crazily expensive , Location right on one of the most emblematic canals in walking distance to all attractions in the city center Very atmospheric interior nice combination of materials furniture and natural light Staff was very friendly an helpful Beds were extremely comfy 
420600,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Problems with key On each day key wouldn t work in room Waited 40 mins of get in on Sunday Had to change plans as a result , Location character 
420601,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Bar space gets very busy and noisy in the evenings , Great location on a pretty canal within walking distance of Dam Square and in the other direction the great museums delightful canal boat trip in the Pulitzer s own elegant boat very restful garden areas excellent staff 
420602,Pulitzer Amsterdam, I expected turndown service in the evening from a five star hotel but the Pulitzer does not provide Also only two hangers and bell man gave wrong room number to housekeeping so hangers never arrived Why can t luxury hotels provide two luggage racks in the room since all double rooms will have two suitcases , The character of the building and the quiet interior courtyard The library is a nice feature Concierges are all excellent The canal trip on the hotel s boat de tourist was splendid way to start out a stay in Amsterdam and is well worth 38 Euros 
420603,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Everything was amazing the breakfast first class Dinner first class Staff first class and very friendly just couldn t do enough Location first class the hotel first class very interesting place made up of 24 different houses amazing
420604,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Beds were not very comfortable although bedding excellent room service for cleaning was rather sporadic having to call to the desk to have room cleaned , Breakfast was very good Room service for personal items was excellent Very promp and lovely staff 
420605,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Not suited to travelers who have difficulty with stairs As the hotel is comprised of twenty plus canal houses that have been connected into one hotel there are a lot of stairs and for our room we had to walk through an outdoor passage way Each room is unique and that is what makes this property so charming , Lovely hotel with all the luxuries but none of the pretension 
420606,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Enjoyed everything about our stay and a bonus was grand opening party we were invited to A great time was had by all Would definitely stay at the Pulitzer again 
420607,Pulitzer Amsterdam, No negatives at all , This is a truly marvelous hotel It is centrally located beautifully appointed brilliantly staffed and ever so much fun Our room was so charming and comfortable and the view of the canal was just gorgeous We have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is our absolute favorite We can t wait to return 
420608,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautifully situated view over canal yet central Great staff Excellent food ina pleasant ambiennce We have stayed in many hotels over the years this was one of the best and surely deserves its 5 star rating
420609,Pulitzer Amsterdam, We wanted to watch the movie there was no pay TV plus in our bedroom second TV didn t even have TV channels , Very hospitable and professional staff Amazing design and ambiance of this hotel It is not cheap but definitely worth the money Very charming drink bar Breakfast deicious and interiors of the restaurant amazing 
420610,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Standard rooms rather small sized for the cost especially if on the ground floor facing on to the pavement outside Thus the relative luxury is compromised Expensive breakfast chaotic with staff struggling to cope with the volume and inevitable inadequacies as to maintaining supplies far from a serene charming start to the day , Service of high standard friendly staff who are keen to help Front desk concierge services very professional Good public spaces Free Wifi works well It is the staff who make the place appealing Fine location too 
420611,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing it was perfect , Location was excellent so centrally located and in front of a main canal Had breakfast every morning in the hotel because the food was so good Hotel just recently renovated so rooms were so nice even if they were quite small The lobby was just adorable and the outdoor caf in the courtyard was so pretty Everyone was so friendly and helpful from the wonderful lady serving us during breakfast every morning to the doormen who helped us arrange our transfers 
420612,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The choice at breakfast was pretty good but the buffet could have been replenished in a more speedy fashion A lot of staff but no one keeping an eye on the levels of choice available , Great location lovely d cor and very relaxing The reception staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and happy to help Not full of hen or stag parties
420613,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing really Only slight criticism was the service at breakfast could have been more organised Tea and coffee should have been served in pots and not just a cup of tea coffee , The brilliant staff very attentive and friendly Great location and beautiful building tastefully furnished 
420614,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Nothing It was perfect , The hotel staff are extremely welcoming cheerful and helpful The hotel is stunningly beautiful and located I loved the flowers at the entrance The gardens and outdoor areas are very pleasant and surprisingly expansive for a city like Amsterdam where space is generally tight My room was very comfortable and appealing and had lots of little extras like complimentary biscuits tea and coffee bike repair kits and proper coat hangers It s by far the best hotel in which I ve ever stayed on my many visits to Amsterdam 
420615,Pulitzer Amsterdam,No Negative, I loved the concierge Ron Stoevelaar who took care of me 100 the best concierge in many years of travel around the world He got me gala symphony tickets that otherwise were not available and made numerous excellent suggestions about sites and restaurants to visit He was patient friendly and an expert 
420616,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Not much unless it was free , Everything about the room was perfect right amount of comfort and elegance The restaurant was excellent both for breakfast and lunch and the entire staff was friendly and helpful The boat ride on the pulitzer tourist was a delight Can not wait to come back 
420617,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Very steep stairs to room but what do you expect in a way from an old property and it was little snug for the price 469 euro for one night but then again it was IBC time , Staff and location were great 
420618,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Loved everything But one point that I have a comment on is that there was no turndown service Would have been nice to have a turndown service given that this is a 5 star hotel , Loved everything about this hotel It was recently renovated in August 2016 Its set in a beautiful area in the nine streets We were close to all the trendy shops and cafes We stayed in a queen size room At first we were given a somewhat small room and when we brought it up to reception they were so helpful in moving us to a bigger room in the same category A special thank you to Emanuela from reception for her help The bedroom design was lovely 
420619,Pulitzer Amsterdam, Breakfast was a disaster The service staff were inattentive rude and really not interested to make the experience an enjoyable one Not at all what one expects from a 5 , Beautiful remodeling Comfy bed 
420620,Pulitzer Amsterdam, There was renovation works going on which were not announced in advance either by booking com or by pullitzer hotel The room was noisy we could hear everything from corridors Staff poorly prepared for a five star hotel , Location is spot on 
420621,Pulitzer Amsterdam, The first room 234 had problems with the electricity it turn of every 15 minutes The next day we changed the room The second room 311 was perfect with a canal view but we can t sleep because of the construction works on the canal they were building a stage for some concert starting from 6 in the morning till 11 in the evening Then they start to prepare for the concert sing song and playing music all the time till 11 in the evening It was awful We called to the Guest Service 10 times but they told us they can t do anything with the noise , Great interior luxury hotel
