292181,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, The closeness to Harrod s, All the staff are professionals that know that their job description 1 is to make your stay an unforgettable experience and they succeed with honors I have been staying at the Carlton since 1974 and will do so to my last visit 
292182,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Spa therapist a bit rude Didn t wax well and gave her a large tip only to notice afterwards it wasn t done properly , Very nice service room service room cleaners friendly Lovely room interiors High class hotel
292183,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, The most amazing hotel I ve ever stayed in Very beautiful Very friendly staff Amazing spa amazing swimming pool Wonderful gym There are not enough stars to rate this hotel It s a 10 star hotel On the first night got upgraded to the 2000 executive suite for free having only paid only 299 for a superior room on discount I love this hotel Definitely gonna come back and bring more people with me next time Love it Most amazing experience ever , Everything 
292184,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Nothing, This is the best luxury hotel in London the staff are peerless and always attentive and professional Excellent rooms and top bedding make this a must stay option
292185,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, bathroom is design in a wrong way also the sink wash basin water tab is placed in a way that when ever i wash my hands my hands touch the basin again and get dirty so at last I have to use tub to wash my hands, It was all ok but the bathroom
292186,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, No nice view The breakfast restaurant was small with no view but the food selection was nice and tasty and the staff was great and friendly The room decoration was almost standard , The staff were quick to respond to any of our request The room was comfortable and they every day cleaning was ok The location of the hotel is great quite and safe 
292187,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Wasn t as close to the underground station as it was advertised and not too many restaurants and cafes near it had to walk quite away or take taxi to get to most places Also room service menu could be improved with more options, Hotel is very nice and clean as usual jumeirah hotels and close to harrods and near the Hyde park
292188,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Spa is very bad no room for relax 2 place only near staff room every 2 min somebody going to there No privacy Sauna is very small , Food in 9 th floor is very healthy nice 
292189,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, The food was not fresh and heated up and the water in the pool and jacuzzi was very dirty , The food was heated up and not fresh so much not worth the money and ever far for being of a 5 star hotel or a jumairah standards 
292190,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Breakfast on our last was unfortunately a disaster Cold toast dumped on a plate no butter my wife s meal came out first and was suppose to have duck egg but was chicken my meal had been forgotten and by the time it came out my wife had finished Although it came out late it was well cooked and well presented It was an unfortunate finish to what otherwise had been a great not good great experience in the restaurant on the previous days , The service was excellent staff were friendly and amenable even though they were very very busy 
292191,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, it was a bit of disappointment we booked a junior suit and it was small and had smell the furniture is very old i was surprised that Jumeira had this kind of facility there was not even a welcome fruit platter as you might find in other hotels for the amount of money we paid it was not worth it , only the location
292192,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Staff at reception made wrong transaction done another one to correct things took all my balance from credit card and ruined my shoppings plans Neighbors were so noisy felt like the room has no insulation system , Cleanliness

292194,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Tiny room we stayed in 340 tiny bathroom we had an early flight on sunday am and bfast area was only opening at 8am Or at least thats what the consierge said almost 400 ponds a night will never stay there , Location bed 
292195,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Noise of staff including housekeeping outside our room slamming doors from 6am knocking loudly on neighboring doors from 9am , Fantastic location very attentive staff Great shower 
292196,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Very noisy rooms Dirty Smelly towels and I asked them to change it n they didn t Then I called again n they did But still they had a bad smell The room was very noisy u can hear every door that open n close N everyone outside Really bad experience n I don t recommend it at alll Hated the stay I tryed to be out most of the time and use the room as minimal as possible The worst experience ever, Location
292197,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Phoning front desk for luggage help was 15 mins to get an answer Housekeeping banging on the door at 08 30 after heavy night before I could have done without , Breakfast lady was so lovely as we re all restaurant staff Superb location and good facilities etc
292198,Jumeirah Carlton Tower, Very Noisy and staff don t listen to complaints very small room compared to money value expensive far from Oxford and main shopping areas , View to the garden clean and walking distance of 5 10 minutes from nice places and shopping Housekeeping is great great conceirge very helpful team
