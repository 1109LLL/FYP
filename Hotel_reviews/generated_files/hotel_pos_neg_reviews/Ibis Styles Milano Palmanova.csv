485009,Ibis Styles Milano Palmanova, Decor is outdated there was only one bath towel even though we ve booked a double room for 2 My friends were located in a single bed room even though we ve booked 2 double bed rooms for 4 persons Luckily they have managed to find a double bed room however that s not what you wish at 1am at night after tireing trip Breakfast was not great either Will never use ibis hotels in future , Pretty much nothing
485010,Ibis Styles Milano Palmanova, There is no fridge in the room and the toiletries are not very diverse just a bottle of soap for the shower and one for the sink , The room and bathroom were clean towels changed daily metro station very close to the hotel 
485011,Ibis Styles Milano Palmanova, Sower floor is very slippery and not safe for children at all Both of my children were showered supervised by my husband and I and both fell each time in the shower as the floor is so slippery Breakfast was very minimal and oftenfood ran out of items if attended breakfast around 9am inspite of being advertised that buffet breakfast is served until 10am Friends rooms ariconditoon was leaking and didn t work Also lift door got jammed and wouldn t open couple of times , Majority of staf were very friendly and helpful 
485012,Ibis Styles Milano Palmanova, The lift is too small only enough for two people and two luggages The lift is too slow to each floor and the staff gave me a wrong key to us When I opened the door someone else already lived in this room We had to ask for changing the key The bedroom is too small only allowed one person walking in the room and the space for bathroom even had more spaces The breakfast is pastry it s a simple breakfast and not much selection , The location is good the metro station is less than 1 mins walk If your are going to the Milano central like us to transfer to another city it s straight line in the metro station only 20 mins 
485013,Ibis Styles Milano Palmanova,No Negative, We had an awesome experience at this hotel the room was very nice with modern furniture and a really big and comfy bed Everything was clean they changed the towels everyday and was happy to see that we even had a hair dryer in the bathroom The temperature was perfect in the room as the heating was turned on which was unexpected but a big plus for this considering that we went there in April The hotel it s really close to the metro station so 1 minute max of walking The breakfast was excellent you can chose from a variety of foods omelette cereals jam butter cheese yogurt salads fruits pastry and coffee of your own choice juices water All in all I would not hesitate to come back here
