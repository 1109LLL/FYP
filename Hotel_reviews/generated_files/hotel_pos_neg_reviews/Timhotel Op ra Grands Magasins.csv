159994,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, No refrigerator in the room and double bed was queen size The rooms at Tim Hotel Blanche included nespresso but this one doesn t , Goood size of room and toilet 
159995,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, One suggestion is the Breakfast could be better with a bit more choices, Nice location and friendly staff room is quite clean and bathroom is very good
159996,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Just a tad disappointed in the room there wasn t a lot of counter top space in the bathroom to put out toiletries other essentials necessitating the need to use the minimal space on night tables and shelf under the TV With 1 armoire and nothing else for clothing and 2 gal pals traveling together it was a tight squeeze for storage The room card for opening the door was also the card you must use to turn on the electricity While this is energy saving knowing in advance would have forced us to bring multiple adapters instead of 1 to recharge all devices at night you can t recharge if you re not in the room While the front desk did have adapters to loan out unfortunately they weren t compatible with my devices , The beds were extremely comfortable which is very important to me Loved the 2 chairs with small table to sit while reading or watching the TV and the in room kettle was great While there is satellite TV the majority of the channels were news programs and all channels were in French Since I speak Fr that was not a problem but if you don t you won t get much use out of the TV The location was quiet in a more residential section of the city However if you want to be closer to a lot of activity when you step out your door choose a different location of Timhotel 3 metro stops within walking distance about 5 minutes away and the front door was always locked The front desk opened it when you buzzed in a nice touch for security The staff especially Farrann were always helpful 
159997,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Room was not clean hair on the bathroom floor from previous guests that was never cleaned Garbage was not emptied daily Extra pillow was stained with no pillow case Carpet not vacuumed for entire 3 day stay , Big elevator balconnet wifi was good

159999,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, I didn t have breakfast myself but breakfast was served at the lounge next to the check in area I wouldn t like that Also i missed bathrobes I had towels but i expected robes aswell, The design the bed and amazing shower
160000,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Location was a bit further away from the subway than I hoped for A mini fridge with drinks in the room would be welcome , Great hotel and great staff Really good value for money 
160001,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, No heating Freezing in Paris when there and my room was literally freezing Heating did not work at all When I alerted reception at check out their response was v poor I don t feel the cold usually btw Receptionist said sometimes they turn the heating off but she didn t know and that heat not good when you sleep , V comfortable bed Clean room with nice decor Good size Good shower 
160002,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, The only fault was some peeling paint on the bathroom window hard to miss in an inspection , Location was great as were the staff The room was very modern and had a nice balcony 
160003,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, There was no attention to detail the towel rods had dust over them they weren t clean and when the rooms around us flushed we could hear that loud and clear It was so annoying to say the least The planning of the hotel is crazy , The hotel was close to Montmartre and hence if you would like to visit there you won t lose too much time in travel 
160004,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, The staff specifically the afternoon evening staff person was not informative could not suggest a place for dinner nor provide directions to one of the cafes listed in their directory Also I had booked an airport shuttle through the hotel for 7 a m and at my 6 a m wake up call was informed it was coming at 6 30 and in my haste left a couple of articles luckily not of any value just annoying given the circumstances , The room and bathroom were nice and clean the decor is basic but it ft my needs
160005,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, We didn t have breakfast but it looked a little expensive , Light airy room with small balcony very romantic Central to Pigalle area for restaurants and fabulous jazz bar 
160006,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, The staff were so laid back they kept missing important moments of customer service They said they would upgrade my room as it was my partners birthday they didn t They told me I hadn t paid my accommodation I had Housekeeping never came and the facilities were awful , The room was lovely Everything you need and very modern and fresh 
160007,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Would have liked a restaurant and bar, It was very well located and the staff were very helpful in attending to out needs particularly Farrand Top class finish to the room and bathroom a 4 star establishment in a great spot Only thing missing was a restaurant and bar 
160008,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, No slippers the shower room is slippery its like it was not properly washed after someone used it before us , All staff are very helpful kind and polite The room always clean when u come back from the hotel Good location Very quite you can rest and sleep easily without noise from the city crowd My daughter of 2 years old enjoyed the huge room 
160009,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Breakfast was good but small not much food to choose from , The room was very clean and modern The bed was super comfortable The neighborhood was pretty quiet overall Overall the hotel looks clean and modern perfect for a one night business stay 
160010,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Rude night staff, The first room I was allocated Room 12 was noisy and the wifi kept breaking down I went downstairs and mentioned it to the night staff who couldn t cared less Told me he wasn t an IT expert or in customer service evidently The following morning I mentioned it again to Pierre immediate action moved rooms and confirmed several times if all was OK a real champion 
160011,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins,No Negative, I regularly stay in the hotel The staff is very friendly professional and accommodating The rooms are all very complete refreshments toileteries a super comfortable bed and clean Design bathrooms Size of room depends on booked room type but even the smallest is okay for Paris The area is lovely very central but in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of nice typical restaurants 
160012,Timhotel Op ra Grands Magasins, Leaking sink in bathroom Solution for staff was to provide more towels none were provided in the room upon arrival Temperature in the room could not be controlled in the room but I had to contact the reception The breakfast is very small and definitely not worth 13 50 Also the price of the room which is tiny is ridiculously high Finally all rooms face a noisy busy road , Close to business location
