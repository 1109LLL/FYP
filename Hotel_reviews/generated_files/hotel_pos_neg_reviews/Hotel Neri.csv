439256,Hotel Neri, Given the location there is some street noise pedestrians The buildings are very close together with small walking streets in between , To be honest the whole thing was amazing Staff are very accommodating Property is in excellent shape 
439257,Hotel Neri, We liked everything My only suggestion is even though they provide a map listing where they are located I would have a more detailed map with walking directions from Juame Square possibly even listing stores and streets you must turn down The area is a little maze like and can be confusing , We rented the apartments that they now offer Loved the location apartment cleanliness and overall experience I highly recommend 
439258,Hotel Neri, Nothing , The decor was amazing modern renovation inside several hundred old building which retained much of old construction Staff was extremely friendly courteous and helpful Apartment was spacious immaculate and in perfect shape when we arrived Dinner at Hotel restaurant was fabulous outside in a medieval square Incredible location inside Gothic Quarter 
439259,Hotel Neri, Late check in at 15 And early check out at 12 For the price they should facilitate their international guests that fly in early and have late return flights ,No Positive
439260,Hotel Neri, They were painting the hallways in the AM The repairman did his best to open door to vent fumes but you could smell the paint anyhow That sort of repair to the immediate access to premises if ongoing during a guest stay should be something the hotel notifies you of in advance of your reservation or at check in The building w the suites which is separate from main hotel doesn t have staff watching the doors and the front door remained propped open Perhaps it wasn t a security concern for them but I walked in the front door seemingly undetected unless the entrance was being monitored by security camera that I didn t see so that raised an eyebrow from me , The staff were wonderfully friendly considerate and accommodating which makes a big impression when traveling w a small child Great beds Nice that they had the pullout bed set up for our daughter Stocked kitchen was great We were able to prepare meals for our little one and have access to her snacks The layout of the suite was efficient and well planned out separate TVs in bedroom and living area meant we could relax and our daughter could watch her cartoons The elevators were in great condition and had more room than what we were accustomed to in BCN But for slight snafu w the painting in the hallway the next AM it was an ideal stay 
439261,Hotel Neri, The two recommendations for dinner were not great one very expensive and ok and the other recommended for the paella was not so great The hotel breakfast is very pricey so we opted to eat in the neighborhood The location is very challenging The taxi driver did not know where it was and dropped us off at a nearby main street which required us to lug three pieces of luggage and a guitar through a rabbit warren of winding narrow streets until we found the hotel They do suggest a pickup transport from the airport but it cost 90 euros , The Hotel is lovely as is the staff a great aesthetic and very comfortable The restaurant is excellent We found their recommendation for tapas at Portalon around the corner a real find The hotel s rooftop terrace a garden sanctuary and retreated there on several occasions with guitar for yummy snacks and great sangria 
439262,Hotel Neri,No Negative, This is a hidden gem Everything about Hotel Neri was exceptional I am very pick when it comes to hotels but there was not a single negative aspect here From the start the front desk was so nice and warming It is a little trick to get to the hotel since it is hidden behind the Cathedral in a pedestrian street but Daniel waited for us and helped us with all our bags The building is a dream impeccable in every detail The rooms so clean quiet cozy and comfortable The decoration amazing And the location Oh my God We were right in the middle of everything within seconds of walking Safe neighborhoods great places to eat including the hotel the breakfast was delicious great for shopping and within minutes of the famous places to visit Transportation available super easy We really felt sad to leave 
439263,Hotel Neri, , We had an appartment which was spacious to relax in and the best we have ever stayed in anywhere We told them so We were there when BA s computers crashed The staff could not have been more helpful They even put our room aside for an extra night in case we could not leave Barcelona that day We texted them to say our flight was in service 
439264,Hotel Neri, see above, The location and the hotel facilities were excellent The staff was very friendly but unfortunately they were not very competent Reservations were not made taxis were not called and we even received a 4 30am wake up call when we requested a 4 30pm taxi to the airport I suggest some older more mature and experienced management would good a long way 
439265,Hotel Neri,No Negative, It was so beautiful I adored that the architecture was from the 12th century Then they gutted the interior and made it modern The play on styles was fabulous This may be one of my favorite hotels ever 
439266,Hotel Neri, For this price breakfast really should be included , I had lived in Barcelona for four years and it had been my dream to stay at Hotel Neri for a while You can t beat the location The square is not only stunning it s one of the most poignant reminders of the darker chapters of the city s history The apartment was beautifully decorated and had all the comforts you d need The staff were lovely 
439267,Hotel Neri, Directions were VERY hard to come by as we walked from a public parking area to the hotel even the taxis don t reliably know where it is when given the address the hotel could do a better job of providing directions Frankly for the same cost or even less I have stayed in other places in major cities and other Relais et Chateaus sites that offered more amenities and more luxurious rooms , The location is terrific for exploring the Gothic city once you find it the lobby reflects the ancient origins of the place although the rest is fully modernized The restaurant is also absolutely excellent we had a light dinner the night we arrived and decided to return for a full dinner another day Staff were very helpful 
439268,Hotel Neri, Fun to be in the old quarter but not easy to find Recommend having taxi driver call hotel to get directions , Wonderful ambiance interesting lighting Loved the stone bathroom 
439269,Hotel Neri, We walked for an hour trying to find the place as the taxi driver wouldn t take us to the hotel as the streets were too narrow , The decor and ambiance were fabulous and it was very handy to museums shops and restaurants
439270,Hotel Neri, The prices were high for what was expected for 500 a night We have stayed in a Relais etChateaux hotel before and expected a more sophisticated setting In all we enjoyed our stay and appreciated the helpfulness of the staff , Loved the location in the Gothic Quarter The sense of history was so palpable The staff was helpful and accommodating 
439271,Hotel Neri,No Negative, The location is excellent easy to walk everywhere it s in the historic area of Barcelona It was my husband s birthday and the treatment was outstanding 
439272,Hotel Neri, Room was small but enough space for a two night stay View from the room directly onto the buildings opposite but this what you would expect in the gothic quarter , Excellent location Lovely bedroom and fabulous bathroom Nice little touches with free soft drinks in the room Very helpful staff 
439273,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Everything was wonderful it is a little gem The breakfast could have been less expensive but it was delicious We would love to go back to hotel Neri it gave us a unique perspective of Barcelona by being in the gothic quarter I can not imagine staying anywhere else in Town
439274,Hotel Neri,No Negative, The Staff were all very friendly helpful e g they served us drinks in the library even although the bar was closed The breakfast was lovely although slightly expensive it was well worth it We had Room 102 which had its own balcony overlooking Placa Felip Neri The Gothic Quarter itself was really interesting 
439275,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Fabulous boutique luxury hotel with excellent facilities and location The staff were lovely and very helpful Had a delicious dinner in the restaurant We stayed in room 102 with a large window view over the beautiful little square musicians playing and heaters to keep guests warm if you want to sit outside 
439276,Hotel Neri,No Negative, The location was superb The food was excellent The pairing of the hundreds of years old townhouses with modern accents was inspired And the staff in particular Ignacio were gracious and helpful A wonderful experience I highly recommend it 
439277,Hotel Neri, Bathroom had a leak in the shower and that created a smell but otherwise the room was very clean, Really good location great ambience and staff could not be more helpful
439278,Hotel Neri,No Negative, The staff were so helpful and approachable the atmosphere was calm and restful a haven from the bustle of the city Our room was excellent with every comfort provided 
439279,Hotel Neri, Absolutely nothing , The hotel s architectural design and decor are breathtaking If you really want to experience Barcelona you must stay in this hotel The staff are so helpful and welcoming Words can t describe how great this hotel is 
439280,Hotel Neri,No Negative, The room was lovely and so comfortable The staff outstandingly helpful I didn t bring the right adaptor It was no problem they had one We needed to eat breakfast quickly to make a tour The staff was wonderfully flexible 
439281,Hotel Neri, For the price expected tea coffee to be available in room not from room service Didn t know school was located so close a bit noisy , Comfortable bed fab bathroom and great staff Great building and lovely roof terrace 
439282,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Loved this hotel Perfect location to walk to many things Very pretty hotel nice rooms with balcony good breakfast and restaurant for dinner Great staff friendly and helpful 
439283,Hotel Neri, Tiny criticism the roof top bar would benefit from a spruce up and a decent wind break, The staff were wonderful The bedroom was luxurious The food was very tasty 
439284,Hotel Neri, Our room overlooked the courtyard which was very picturesque but was a little noisy at night with people gathering there and loudly chatting This is only a tiny negative and something to be aware of when booking the room Saying that it certainly beats a room overlooking a busy noisy road , What a find Fabulous boutique hotel in an excellent location From the minute we arrived the staff at the Neri were friendly and helpful The room was lovely clean and comfortable We were within walking distance from the main shopping area and there were some great restaurants near by Our favourite by far was the PLA it is a definite must the food was gorgeous I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will stay there again when visiting Barcelona 
439285,Hotel Neri, If we should have dined at the restaurant for dinner the card should have been a bit more diverse Now there was a set menu BUT at a very reasonable price considering its 5 star hotel , Everything was so finely balanced in this beautiful ancient building that is transformed into this secret gem of a hotel The staff is very friendly helpful and speak a large variety of languages Serviced minded in a way that seems genuine and makes you feel at home straight away The rooms are bright and airy mainly because of the insane high ceilings and the decorations are finely tuned to suit the ancient buildings Food and drinks are excellent and the service at breakfast is very quaint Breakfast tray very nice and the a la carte is small but a delicate selection I will be back again for more secret luxury 
439286,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Myself and my partner traveled as a couple for a romantic break at the end of January and what can I say Our exceptions where definitely surpassed Extreme elegance with a modern twist Exceptional attention to small details from the hotel scent the candlelight reception to the surfacing on the elevators made every aspect of this small hotel endearing and charming The staff were very welcoming accommodating and friendly They even provided is with an iPad and phone chargers for some work we had to do The balcony in our room overlooked the Placa Sant Felip Neri and each evening we had the pleasure of hearing local acoustic musicians playing through our balcony doors The roof top terrace was also a favourite of ours With a perfect location in the heart of the Gothic Quarter we would recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning a trip to Barcelona We are already planning our next visit 
439287,Hotel Neri, sometimes I felt communication problems led to misunderstanding but the staff were excellent and very helpful the towelling robes were a bit worn and as it was expensive I felt there were no little luxuries to make me feel indulged Also there was no real lounge to sit in or really a bar as such except attached to the restaurant which seemed empty most of the time But obviously got busy in the evening The views from the bedroom were nil as the curtains had to be closed the whole time as the balconies opposite were just feet away , I loved the Character of the Gothic area which was full of winding streets leading to beautiful squares and tiny shops The whole city has a vibrance and warmth about it and seeing the Picasso Gaudi and Miro was a great treat and of course the superb La Bouqueria market After England the weather seemed like heaven 
439288,Hotel Neri, Travellers should be aware that this is an inner and ancient city location so the streets are very narrow taxis have trouble but the walk to the square isn t long and the neighbours very close So no big views Light sleepers should also note that small cobbled streets equal a bit of noise with late night revellers and early morning deliveries although the windows do damp a lot of it , Stunning property in fabulous location Loved the interiors with quirky art installations the Boa Sofa was quite the hit with the boys The staff were truly world class ultra helpful and kind staff Little touches like the chocolates on the bed each night and the hammocks on the roof garden where my husband and I got to sample the local fortified wine each night go a long way to building good memories 
439289,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with a great location and a historical past Walking the streets and neighbor hood is like being transported to the past when the shops are open the area is a vibrant district 
439290,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Excellent Extras provided at no additional charge Upgraded us because when we arrived in the early am no room was available Help was courteous and most helpful Great location in the old gothic jewish quarter near los palmas and the market 
439291,Hotel Neri, I didn t like the fact that for 750 per night there was a huge crack in my bathtub The attitude of the young hipster front desk staff was appalling They all look great but have no idea of the concept of service and how to deliver this in the real world Such a shame not at all an authentic experience , The location of the hotel is terriic very central and very easy to get to every where 
439292,Hotel Neri, The outside noise of people talking very late at night early morning in the narrow street below our room , The quiet elegant ambience of this beautifully restored property The staff were understated and professional yet very friendly and accommodating 
439293,Hotel Neri, THE standaard rooms were A bit small for A 5 star hotel and THE curtain before THE closet mat be modern but not fitting A 5 star hotel, Location and intimacy of hotel Although we had nobdinner al THE hotel THE restaurant and bar looiend cosy 
439294,Hotel Neri,No Negative, Wonderful experience right in the middle of the most fascinating part of Barcelona Amazing rooms brilliant atmosphere Truly remarkable stay extremely friendly staff fabulous breakfast Recommended if you want to have a unique stay in Barcelona 
439295,Hotel Neri, Breakfast was expensive and not anything special they have a strange coffee maker and you make your own coffee and it is not good The beautiful central market is two blocks away and offers a much better option for breakfast at 1 5 the cost , The staff is great the location is amazing and the hotel is lovely
