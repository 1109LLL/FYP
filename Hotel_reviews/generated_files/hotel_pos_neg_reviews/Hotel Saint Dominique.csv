225672,Hotel Saint Dominique, The lift was broken down when we stayed which was a little awkward when lifting our luggage up the stairs I did also expect the room to be a little bigger considering we were staying for a week , Good location and close to everything in Paris The staff were very helpful and friendly The beds were comfortable and the bathroom while small was clean and nice 
225673,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, Person at the reception was very friendly and we received a welcome drink Room was exactly as displayed on pictures and the bathroom was very nice with a large and good shower The bed was very comfortable Unfortunately there was no parking offered by the hotel but there are multiple underground parking lots within a 15 min walk 
225674,Hotel Saint Dominique, I had no complaints but did overhear at bfast one morning a guests room was facing the street and the pub opposite dosn t close til 2am so he was abit sleep deprived , Staff friendly and obliging breakfast not included but reasonably priced bed was comfy and I suffer from back issues loved the coffee machine in room location was great and the lift was a bonus 
225675,Hotel Saint Dominique, Definitely way too small of rooms for the price you pay Nothing is included and they nickel and dime you for everything The toilet is in the shower so if you don t take the toilet paper out you are in trouble Room was not big enough for 2 separate beds Definitely a room for 1 , It was a nice hotel Very nicely designed 
225676,Hotel Saint Dominique, Rooms are somewhat small and the bath was tiny But all was clean and modern with cold a c , Good location in more residential area not far from Eiffel Tower and close to 2 metro lines Staff was helpful and breakfast was yummy with crepes and assortment of breakfast items 
225677,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, A very pleasant unpretentious design super quiet rooms free soft drinks mini bar offered Location is great if you want yo explore the left bank I come to Paris every month and this is a good find 
225678,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, We absolutely loved this charming little hotel Although the room was small it was beautifully decorated and the bed was so comfortable The view was down into the charming little courtyard All the staff was super friendly and helpful during our stay We loved that we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower by simply turning our head Oh and you simply must try the bakery right next door Heaven 
225679,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, The staff were amazing very friendly and helpful especially the lady on the reception The hotel location is perfect No need to take any transportation to see paris just walk It worths every single euro paid I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone 
225680,Hotel Saint Dominique, Breakfast could have been better More EN channels on TV You have to call the front desk to get your room temperature changed , The room size is pretty decent if you re traveling as a couple or alone The location is close to everything only a short walk to Eiffel tower Staff was extremely helpful and polite 
225681,Hotel Saint Dominique, There was nothing to dislike, The staff were lovely so friendly the hotel was clean beds were very comfortable bathroom was lovey and had an amazing shower There were umbrellas to use at the entrance which was a really good idea really good location close to local shops and some lovely cafes the metro was just a short walk away The view at the end of the road was of the Eiffel Tower 
225682,Hotel Saint Dominique, chambre sombre rez de chauss arrangement de la r ception pas tr s accueillant heureusement compens par le personnel manque salon, accueil personnel situation d coration chambre propret originalit salle de bain petite cour int rieure calme
225683,Hotel Saint Dominique, The fact that it is located right across the street from a pub The smoke and the noise carried up to our room Even with our windows closed it was very loud , The location Is great for walking all over Paris except that right across the street is a pub I love being on Saint Dominique and being just down the street from the Eiffel Tower The pub is so noisy at night It makes it very hard to sleep The pub customers come outside to smoke so the smoke carries up into the hotel rooms across the street When the pub closes at night people are outside talking while waiting for uber rides The pub and other businesses get many deliveries during the night so it ends up being a very noisy place to stay 
225684,Hotel Saint Dominique, It is a bit expensive but realistically you d spend the difference on travelling to the locations and the perks of this hotel is it easily accessible from everywhere and has so much stuff nearby that it is definetly worth it but I m only a student so to the average person it s reasonably affordable Aswell as this they provide free mini bar etc so in all honesty there s nothing I didn t like , Hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Paris Less than a 20 minute walk from the Louvre and 10 from D Orsay Stunning views of the Eiffel Tower can be seen along the street and I recommend getting a hotel room with the view of the street as you can see the spectacular light display on the Eiffel Tower The hotel is located near metro stations which are easy to use considering I can t even get around London Underground got from eurostar to the hotel within 25 minutes Furthermore the hotel has loads of nearby bakeries and local shops which are reasonably cheap The hotel receptionists were very helpful and provided me with an iPad during my stay they were very informative and allowed us to bring back food when we didn t fancy going out for dinner The room was very clean and they provided a dressing gown towels slippers and other everyday essentials which you probably wouldn t take on holiday Overall the hotel was brilliant and was definitely worth the money being that it was in the middle of everything and this was great overall Highly recommend La Terrasse which is a lovely little place to for evening dinner Overall the hotel was lovely and the views was magnificent highly recommend 
225685,Hotel Saint Dominique, Not enough hanging height in the wardrobe Difficult to do proper English tea , The staff were excellent We loved the location and we liked being on the ground floor next to the courtyard a pity it rained 
225686,Hotel Saint Dominique, It states the wifi works ever where but my self and my friend had a lot off difficulty getting connected and using it on the 2nd floor especially in our room if we wanted to use wifi we had to go to we re the food is served to sit although we found it worked perfect everywhere else We did find it disconnected it s self a number of times so we had to constantly ask for the wifi password as it is different each time I also found on the website it states a price you pay at hotel once we arrived we didn t it until the end and it was 20 extra which was for the cleaning of the room and bedroom tax which I thought it should ve been inclusive in the price as it doesn t state anything on the booking confirmation , Staff were very friendly and very helpful especially if you don t speak French I found the hotel at a fantastic location 15 minutes walk from Eiffel Tower close to shops bars and restaurants I loved how there was an Irish Bar across from the hotel Makes it feel like we didn t leave home Rooms were very clean and tidy beds made everyday I like how if you arrive early before check in you can leave you bags at hotel same goes for check out if you have a late flight you can leave your bags and collect later on There is some fantastic shops beside the Arc De Triomphe good for shopping Food restaurant and places around the hotel are cheap enough you just have too look around I also liked the fact there was a late check out 12pm it s fantastic as it gives you a chance to relax while finishing to pack instead of stressing getting ready by a certain time Can t wait to return 
225687,Hotel Saint Dominique, We had asked for twin beds in quiet area of hotel We had a room opposite the irish pub at the front and a double bed , Parisians like their heating on high We don t We re very helpful in turning off heating as far as that was possible Kind staff Rooms are small but which room isn t in Paris 
225688,Hotel Saint Dominique, toilet and shower together odd set up asked for quiet room at back room was ground level from walkway so curtains on window needed to be drawn to have privacy meant no daylight, comfy bed room has everything very helpful lady at reception safe upscale area good restaurants amazing bakery next door 
225689,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, The location was perfect we walked everywhere Our room was small but cozy and the staff was very helpful and nice I would definitely stay here again 
225690,Hotel Saint Dominique, Nothing , Great location Nice bars and cafes close by with views of the Eiffel Tower from the street Modern finishes and very clean We booked the smallest room which was still a nice size The bed was huge and comfortable Good price compared to other nearby hotels 
225691,Hotel Saint Dominique, No bar in the lobby to congregate in before after evening work things Or to meet in , Quite off street room convenient to work event site and most central Paris locations 
225692,Hotel Saint Dominique, No lobby where one could sit and wait since early check in after long overnight flight was not available Terrible room No shower enclosure everything soaked if one took a shower no surround to washbasin so nowhere to put, Location
225693,Hotel Saint Dominique, Having informed the hotel about a special wedding anniversary it would have been nice to recognise this for us A little customer relations goes a very long way , The bed was super comfortable Rooms were a good size An excellent location only a few blocks for the Eiffel tower and minutes from the chic Rue Cler with its cafes and restaurants 
225694,Hotel Saint Dominique, No complaints everything fine, Staff were very friendly and helpful Room very clean and comfortable the location was perfect for me for business reasons and would appeal to tourists as very close to the Eiffel Tower 
225695,Hotel Saint Dominique, Duvets are far too hot at times , The reception staff are wonderful Everyone was so helpful Beautifully appointed stylish rooms A gem of a small hotel 
225696,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, Bed was extra comfy Staff very friendly Excellent location Love the nespresso machine and free use of the iPad and umbrellas And the stay was hassle free 
225697,Hotel Saint Dominique, WiFi in room 10 was very bad For English only speakers the TV channels BBC etc didn t work most of the time All the French language stations came through fine When we were moved to Rm 31 across the courtyard for a different issue reception was fine , Staff was very accommodating helpful They were very responsive to a problem that popped up with our room Nice quiet left bank location 
225698,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, Cute hotel very quiet even though our room faced the street the noise was minimum I loved the little extras that were included that most hotels don t have like a small sewing kit and a shoe horn 
225699,Hotel Saint Dominique, The rooms were a bit on the small side but in a city with so much to do that s not an issue , The room was clean comfortable and quiet and the hotel was in a brilliant location around 15 20 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower and hop on hop off boat The staff were very friendly and professional and willing to help with any problems The nespresso coffee machine in the rooms was a nice touch too 
225700,Hotel Saint Dominique, There was no hairdryer in my room and I had to ask twice for one Also our air conditioning stopped working in the night and it became really uncomfortable and it wasn t even that hot If this does happen to you make sure you ring reception as they can fix it from there I wish we had known this sooner , The lady who worked reception was really helpful and friendly I thought the interior was very modern and the bed was really comfortable All in all we had a lovely stay and would go back 
225701,Hotel Saint Dominique, The Room is small and well designed though we have organised our suitcase to fit the room The value for money is bit expensive for two nights in Paris Daily average 180 euro during our stay , The location is very great There is free internet The style is unique My partner I loved it so much The staff are friendly support us with substation from where to go and how to reach and the room has been cleaned very professionally We arrived on 11th June 2016 The day of France match with Portugal The staff were there all the time and support us in every aspect 
225702,Hotel Saint Dominique, Too small and pokey to deserve its rating I m afraid Air conditioning was necessary because even though not particularly warm weather the room heated up very quickly and became stuffy without it It was fine but nothing to get excited about we won t stay there again , Extremely polite and helpful staff nice breakfast good position in 7ieme Comfortable bed 
225703,Hotel Saint Dominique, When we arrived the room we were given was small and dark and smelt strongly of disinfectant We had to upgrade to a bigger and better room The receptionist was lovely and very helpful on this aspect The room we were then given reached a 4 star standard but cost an extra 80 euros per night Because our room had not been ready on our arrival the receptionist reduced this amount This is the first time we have been so disappointed in a booking com hotel , The location was excellent and there were a large number of shops nearby It was close to a metro station and there were lovely pastry shops in the street and one next door The receptionist was extremely helpful on our arrival 
225704,Hotel Saint Dominique, No parking but if you drove just down the road there was underground parking for a reasonable amount of money, Rooms modern and although petite it was definitely worth the money
225705,Hotel Saint Dominique, When I first arrived the entrance was locked as nobody was at the reception But when she did arrive she was very friendly and helpful , very welcoming receptionist comfy rooms which were clean sophisticated comfortable quiet and suitably warm Location good with charming bakeries local shops and restaurants all around An easy 15 minute walk to champs elysees 60 minutes to gare du nord or Bastille 
225706,Hotel Saint Dominique, Closet space a bit limited , Nice rooms friendly staff excellent location great view walking from metro to the hotel nice interior courtyard lots of restaurants nearby
225707,Hotel Saint Dominique, Lack of space on bathroom counter No room to place my cosmetic items Why can t you add a shelf for personnel items in the bathroom Like a shelf for toothbrush tooth paste makeup deodorant etc etc , Location
225708,Hotel Saint Dominique, complex coffee machine I wanted a simple tea ha, staff where friendly helpful checked in earlier without a problem room was compacted but comfortable good use of space available and an amazing view

225711,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, The front desk staff are super friendly and very helpful They helped us to find the best way to have public transit to the airport and print out the map they also helped to print out my sightseeing reservations The room is small which is quite normal in Paris but they make best use of it had everything I need 
225712,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, We were in Paris when several terrorist attacks took place the hotel management reacted very well by arranging a car at their expense to take us back to the airport the day after Much appreciated kind gesture We will be back at our next visit to Paris 
225713,Hotel Saint Dominique, I did not like the food for lunch or dinner but the breakfast was great I also could not get any other channel in English besides BBC , I like the location and the employees It is easier to get to anywhere around town and the employees do their best to make you feel comfortable

225715,Hotel Saint Dominique,No Negative, The staff were great nothing was too much trouble Very clean and comfortable located on a lively road which had some great small shops and bakeries Room also very quiet a lovely stay overall Very strong value for a hotel in Paris 
225716,Hotel Saint Dominique, Although the room was beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean it was very small indeed not much room for manoevre and nowhere to put away or hang up clothes fine for a weekend but for a longer stay a bit claustrophobic The lift is also tiny only enough space to send up a suitcase , The ambiance of the surrounding area is lovely You don t feel like a tourist there The street and surrounding area has a very normal familiar feel to it which I really valued especially as a solo traveller Also being able to walk everywhere was a great bonus 
225717,Hotel Saint Dominique, I know hotel rooms are typically small in Paris and even though all has been beautifully renovated there really needs to be somewhere to put your stuff in the tiny bathroom just some shelving would be great If we didn t have the ground floor with the courtyard it would have been very claustrophobic in the tiny room , Great location a walk to all major attractions lovely view of the Eiffel Tower from the hotel We had a ground floor room so loved having the courtyard and we met and chatted with several other guests Friendly and helpful staff we didn t have breakfast so can t comment on that Extremely quiet at night great cafes and restaurants near by

225719,Hotel Saint Dominique, Didn t have any complaints , The staff were very friendly and helpful our room was lovely not the largest but as we really only slept in it it wasn t a problem There was a coffee machine available although we didn t use it and the mini bare had free soft drinks in it The bed was lovely and comfortable The location was great 5 minutes walk to the Eifel Tower 
225720,Hotel Saint Dominique, Toilet cleanliness was disappointing wasn t as clean as I clean my toilet at home , Amazing location comfiest bed stayed in at a hotel best sleep Quietest hotel ever stayed in too Very friendly staff gorgeous view of The Eiffel Tower from right outside the hotel 
225721,Hotel Saint Dominique, Upgrade the pillows guys , I m a bit of a curmudgeon about small Paris hotels I m here all the time but I LOVE this place Charmingly small nice staff very well and newly renovated rooms which some will find on the small side but very well engineered 
225722,Hotel Saint Dominique, Shower could of been less open to avoid water all over floors Wifi should be from check in to check out and not expire night before check out , Location and various shopping around the area Pub right across the road was good Staff were good and helpfull and lots of great places to have breakfest lunch and dinner around Close to many great sights and things to do in paris Not far to walk to major attractions
