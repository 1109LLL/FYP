312955,Mercure Vienna First, Nothing to dislike , Excellent location in small courtyard in Old Town close to a couple of bars and restaurants Hotel staff on arrival were extremely helpful and polite Hotel extremely clean and tidy All main attractions within walking distance Situated close to underground station if required 
312956,Mercure Vienna First, Nothing in particular The bathrooms are small as is the case with many European hotels , Clean rooms Decent bed Good air conditioning Supportive and easy to deal with reception staff We preferred to have breakfast outside the hotel so can t comment on breakfast Outstanding location just a couple of minutes away from grocery shops restaurants and subway and tram stops And for those who like a McDonald s nearby there is one just 2 3 minutes away 
312957,Mercure Vienna First, Nothing bad at all Superb, The staff were excellent and so friendly The breakfast very good The room perfect The bathroom just right Had been in two other hotel on this break and one in Vienna a five star was not a patch on this Would highly rate it 
312958,Mercure Vienna First, Room was mis sold Size configuration no separated wc sliding doors to bath WC indicating how cramped the accommodation is, Helpful Staff who rehoused from a rabbit hutch to the Sofitel
312959,Mercure Vienna First, One minor criticism the wardrobe is very small really only holds four to five hangers , The rooms were a good size with comfortable beds a small desk and a lovely bathroom with rain shower Perfect for my business trip but I would also stay here on leisure without any issues It is not a luxury hotel where you would spend hours lazing in your room but you wouldn t expect that for the price and who would want to travel to Vienna to stay inside Breakfast was all you need the coffee is great and the omelette big enough for two 
312960,Mercure Vienna First, They overcharged us for the parking The daily ticket is valid 24 hours not only on the date when you park They told us that if you park over the night you have to buy two daily tickets what was a lie If you park overnight just buy one daily ticket and if you stay longer than 24 hours just pay the extra hours in the garage , kind personel nice modern hotel very good breakfast convenient location near the city centre
312961,Mercure Vienna First, For those travelling by car the Hotel is situated on a pedestrian street so Sat Nav may cause a difficulty There are no other negatives , Lovely Hotel situated 5 minutes walk from Stephansdom in the city centre Good breakfast choices Room was clean warm with Tea Coffee facility Mini bar and TV with over 100 channels Staff were super friendly and very willing to assist 
312962,Mercure Vienna First, 1 The restaurant was closed during my stay which was something I didn t know until my arrival There are many places to eat close to the hotel however one of the reasaons I made a reservation was the great reviews of the restaurant 2 The room could be bigger especially considering the room rates , 1 Great location close to the city center but at the same time away from the main streets in a very safe road 2 Modern decorated rooms 3 Nice breakfast 4 Friendly staff 5 Good wifi connection speed
312963,Mercure Vienna First, Only thing for me was I felt the room was a bit small , Hotel was clean and comfortable Well placed between the 2 underground lines 1 4 Lots of places to eat and drink and if you want to shop there are plenty of designer names to spend your money in 
312964,Mercure Vienna First, The lobby seems a little dark with furniture that s too low for those of us with replacement knees The red halls and dark carpet also seem a little too strange and different from your usual hotel , A friendly helpful front desk crew added greatly to the enjoyment of my stay The shower in the modern immaculately clean bathroom had easy to operate controls and lots of hot water Just up the street and a set of pedestrian stairs in a pedestrian zone the hotel is within shouting distance of a second Mercure hotel the Mercure Vienna Zentrum Both are convenient to trams and the metro 
312965,Mercure Vienna First, For two people the wardrobe was too little Two wintercoats in the closet resulted in very limited space to put other clothes which have to hang , The location of the hotel was excellent It was very quiet The breakfast was healthy with a variety of food The staff was very friendly and helpful 
312966,Mercure Vienna First, rooms are made of like from paper you can hear everything from neighboring rooms and even from the entire corridor restaurant was closed down for the entire new year holidays i guess the hotel decided to make more holidays than the tourists , location is great staff is very helpful and doing their best
312967,Mercure Vienna First, Nothing at all, The hotel is very comfortable There is nothing we wanted and wasn t there Staff is very friendly and the location is very good Just 5 7 minutes walk to graben shopping street Breakfast is outstanding You have eggs smoked salmon several kinds of cheeses croissants cake yogurt sausage turkey all kinds of coffee and tea Staff is fluent in English and very helpful 
312968,Mercure Vienna First,No Negative, Very friendly people at the reception and very helpful Genuine smile on their face Felt extremely welcome The room was very clean with perfect temperature despite the cold and rainy weather that night our friends who stayed in another nearby hotel were extremely cold that night in their room The breakfast was amazing Everything was perfect Looking forward to coming back to Vienna and staying in the same hotel 
312969,Mercure Vienna First, Nothing, The staff the restaurant attached that provided an excellent high quality breakfast Made you omlettes on demand as well as any coffee drink you want The location was centre city yet quiet Lots of cafes and restaurants and walking distance to practically everything 
312970,Mercure Vienna First, Cars cant park near the hotel so you have to carry your bags to the hotel , Location near the center Friendly staff Rooms I forgot some stuff in the room and the hotel team was very helpful and they ship it back to me 
312971,Mercure Vienna First, Some English Channels on television would have been great , Great breakfast always smiling chef to cook our eggs the way we wanted them The front desk always helpful and smiling was a great start to each day Very close to city centre walking distance to most places and close to two stations Surrounded by cafes bars and restaurants Very vibrant neighbourhood 
312972,Mercure Vienna First, The hotel did not have a feeding chair for small children but apart from that flaw which is an easy fix it is great , The breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I have had We also liked the bathroom very modern and elegant 
312973,Mercure Vienna First, Rooms are rather too small It was difficult to move there when two large suitcases lay on the floor , Pleasant hotel in the centre of Vienna great location Friendly and helpful staff delicious and rich breakfast Nice modern design and comfortable bed 
312974,Mercure Vienna First,No Negative, Location Location Location The staff at the front desk was wonderful and very helpful The room was clean and very nice The Panaroma Restaurant on the river was the best We ate there twice 
312975,Mercure Vienna First, Mirror near the writing desk so it could be used as dressing table as well would be ideal , Staff were great from start to finish Breakfast is really good one of the friendliest breakfast rooms I ve ever been in 
312976,Mercure Vienna First, Kitchen staff were rude especially the middle aged lady wearing black who seemed to be in charge Flies were landing on the fresh meats and cheeses so we alerted the staff but instead of throwing away the food and replacing with fresh food or even just trying to get rid of the fly they looked annoyed that we d said anything and said in German not realising we understood that they d just leave it there for tomorrow s guests This is disgusting as who knows what else that fly has been contaminated with Also we requested a hard boiled egg when we were the only two guests in the breakfast room There were several staff members and still it took them 20 minutes to make it , Reception staff were helpful and friendly Room and bed was nice Location was good Breakfast was tasty Shower was modern 
312977,Mercure Vienna First, There was no closet in the room and no bath if its important to you , The stauff was very kind and helpfull location is fantastic wifi worked perfect 
312978,Mercure Vienna First, A little noisy at night time due to pubs clubs close by Bed was not very comfortable , Great location Very nice staff Room was well equipped and relatively spacious 
312979,Mercure Vienna First, The only thing which is not so convenient is parking On booking is written that hotel is providing parking to guests but actually it is public garage which is not so close takes you 5 min walking distance and if you have to carry luggage it is not so easy also it is not possible to approach hotel entrance by car as it is pedestrian area so guests should be informed before arrival for safe side and not to lose too much time on searching the hotel Also room was a little cold and staff couldn t help with that unfortunately but I guess it is because of season end of March Still these are just small recommendations but we would anyhow return back as it is very nice hotel , Great location very polite staff Breakfast was excellent lots of variety for a boutique hotel Clean nice room and decoration 
312980,Mercure Vienna First, Hard to get the a c to lower temperature for comfy sleeping , Very friendly and helpful reception and serving staff Good central location Comfortable room Thoroughly recommended 
312981,Mercure Vienna First, Staff at breakfast weren t very attentive but when you ask them they would help no problem , Location and room were perfect for us Easy to walk and see the sights 
312982,Mercure Vienna First, It was a shame there was no bar available to relax in after a hectic day of sightseeing apparently closed We were told of a bar available in an adjacent Mecure hotel and enjoyed a complimentary drink , Friendly and helpful staff and location just perfect 
312983,Mercure Vienna First, We could not sleep good because of the heat in the room a c wass off and when we opened the window it was too noisy because of the night clubs in the street Breakfast is ok but it s just a few selection of food , The room was very good and clean beds are very comfortable And the bathroom was excelent and also very clean The room was modern 
312984,Mercure Vienna First, wifi unacceptedly slow presumably to incite buying of premuim wifi , nice designed sufficently large room excellent rain shower very good breakfast in nice environmemt 
312985,Mercure Vienna First, I like Mercure Hotels design and especially fuchsia colour in the logo and design after latest renovations some of the hotels are getting more darker For compact hotels this design makes them look smaller , Central location good hotel 
312986,Mercure Vienna First, The air con does work well it is too hot in the room we have to open the window, The location very good near to the city center Staff very friendly 
312987,Mercure Vienna First, Everything was really nice in the hotel the only little thing is that room service is until 22 00 but this isn t a deal breaker If you re hungry at night there are loads of placed around open until late , I loved my stay in this hotel it was great coming back to the hotel after long hours of walking around Vienna The hotel design is beautiful It s a beautiful space both in the room and in the common areas cafe reception hall etc Staff was super nice and very accommodating of every request providing me with good information when I needed and just generally being so nice and friendly I had a few chances to eat meals in the hotel other than breakfast and it was very nice The food was great and they had a nice selection of wines Moreover the cafe staff as well was very nice and welcoming Location is another plus it s in the old town and a few minutes walk from all the major attractions such as Stephan s dome etc If I come to Vienna again I ll definitely want to stay in this hotel
