483312,Hotel Mentana, An iron and ironing board in the room is important for business travellers, Very friendly staff on reception and conveniently located just a 10 minute walk from the metro and bus routes 
483313,Hotel Mentana, No gim , The room even though small it was really confy Breakfast was very good but litle variaety amazing prosciutto The staff was relly friendly
483314,Hotel Mentana, The breakfast offering was a bit dismal and added to that no gluten free bread pastries biscuits or even crackers were on offer I had to bring my own , The reception staff were very welcoming and friendly fun to chat to and very helpful 
483315,Hotel Mentana, Nothing, Staff are so friendly my single room was is basic but very clean and comfortable room Everything was great to stay in a great location in the heart of Milan with a walking distance to main sightseeings Nothing was luxurious but was just what I needed for a city tourist I would defiantly stay there again
483316,Hotel Mentana, Shower SMALL 15 mins walk from Duomo Metro station hard work with a suitcase, Tremendous buffet breakfast They recommended Hostaria borromei for my evening me Excellent Staff very friendly and helpful
483317,Hotel Mentana, There is no safety box there is not A C the wifi is slow in the high floors the items in the room chairs bed desk ect is is old and bot that clean And in the night especially the weekend is noisy since it s located front of the party yard , His location is not that close and not that far but i don t recommend it for the families the staff is extremely perfect especially the lady called Alein i guess she is really made our stays polite and professional 
483318,Hotel Mentana, There are really no negative aspects Of course considering the price one should not expect a high end luxury hotel , Excellent position in the true heart of Milan Courtesy helpfulness and discretion of staff Free wireless connection perfectly working My single room was quiet and tidy It will definitely be my go to hotel for next weekend in Milan 
483319,Hotel Mentana, For an international hotel displaying 4 stars a breakfast with no warm food is not acceptable Last renovation over 30 years ago Shower was chalked and no place to hang it up Otherwise ok comfort, excellent location 
483320,Hotel Mentana, Narrow room bed and bathroom very ancient facility, Milan is a city of fashion so every thing here couldn t be cheap Location of this hotel is not bad you could walk to Duomo for about 10 mins Not far from this hotel there s a very good restaurant delicious food reasonalbe price 
483321,Hotel Mentana, Didn t feel like a 4 star hotel The location was great and maybe that justified the price but given the discount I thought I was getting and it being 4 stars I expected more Poor quality bedding cheap toiletries no water or drinks facilities at all in the room No english TV channels And the promo photo on this site is not even accessible unless you are in the suite , Great location and breakfast was OK
483322,Hotel Mentana, Toast for breakfast but there was plenty to choose from , The staff were very helpful and pleasant at all times The room was kept exceptionally clean and the location was perfect 
483323,Hotel Mentana, Bathroom was tired with cracked floor tiles and mouldy shower Room decor dated and tired No aircon and only tiny TV Never a 4 Star hotel as is claimed it s more like 2 Star the only thing 4 star was the price I was very disappointed ,No Positive
483324,Hotel Mentana, The shower It was only a hand spray which you had to hold while having a wash It was not fixed to the wall or no hook to hold it This hotel was classed as 4 star on the sign outside but I dont think it was 3 star at the most The breakfast was very expensive for what they had on offer at 8euro each No cooked food It was only on the last morning that we eat there Just as well The safe in our room did not work either which I was very disappointed as most hotels these days have a safe It could be that we were just unlucky with our room, It was very close to the center and the Dumo The hotel itself was very clean and the staff at reception was very nice This hotel is Ok if you just want somewhere to sleep for a night The rooms were basic but clean and comfortable Close to some very nice restraunts The hotel could do with a face lift to be honest but on the whole our stay was ok 
483325,Hotel Mentana, There was no price list for the mini bar Some power points didn t work which made charging mobile devices a bit tricky , Most staff were very helpful and friendly Location was very convenient Room and bathroom were surprisingly spacious Wi fi worked very well Breakfast variety was ok for a small hotel Very clean Very good value for the booking com price 
483326,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, I loved staying at this hotel The hotel is very nice the room was stylish and new clean with new clean bathroom TV and air conditioner the shower worked well and there were enough towels Breakfast was nice including the vegan option Most of all I liked the staff they are extremely friendly and always ready to help they are really doing their best Would love to stay there again 
483327,Hotel Mentana, Rooms extremely small Breakfast extremely poor no meat salami no eggs no vegetables For people who do not eat sweets for breakfast it was almost nothing to eat except of some small traces of cheese cream No proper map of the town and staff s directions not very useful , Position Clean 
483328,Hotel Mentana, The breakfast is very limited no Italian meats or sausages no fresh croissant no egg The bed is very firm The tub is not very convenient , The hotel staff is very friendly the location is very nice between the Duomo and the Navigli District
483329,Hotel Mentana, You have to keep logging back into the wifi when you leave the hotel but when online connection was good Lift was slow, Older little boutique style hotel Staff were very friendly There were 3 gentlemen working at the front desk while we were there and all 3 went above and beyond when we asked for any help They even helped us book train tickets to france Rooms are small but thats not unusual for europe however they were very clean Breakfast was free and the selection was nice Facilities like a good iron and a hair dryer that you can actually dry your hair with was great If you re looking for a cheaper option in a good location 5 10 minutes walk to the duomo and not too fussed about old decor i would recommend it 
483330,Hotel Mentana, The staff was rather cold the rooms are difficult to access with a steep ramp to get to a very small elevator Meal options were very expensive Room was dark and a bit outdated , The location quite close to the city and main attractions
483331,Hotel Mentana, Booking a single room is always tricky this was stated to be modern If by modern they mean imported from a house of ill repute that is more or less correct Very odd lighting arrangements in the bathroom that I could not turn off with a peephole window to the bedroom Piece de resistance was the large round bed that took up most of the floor space Breakfast was included but not of a good quality , The bed was comfy Walking distance from the Duomo and centre Fine for one night not longer 
483332,Hotel Mentana, Some staff don t speak English very well but you can manage to understand each other Indeed the breakfast may not be very diverse but the contents are very good and served in a nice area , Comfortable room clean great location very efficient visit for tourism and I imagine business The square in front of the hotel has a small outdoor bar with a terrace that is great for an evening out meeting friendly people 
483333,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, Very conveniently located in the center of Milan Six blocks from the Piazza Santa Maria Della Grazi where the Last Supper painting is and the cathedral Duomo 
483334,Hotel Mentana, We thought the terrace was available to all the rooms but it now is only for the top floor suite I think that the advert for the hotel should reflect this , We upgraded to the top floor to have the terrace
483335,Hotel Mentana, The hotel is undergoing renovation and much is made of the style of the renovated rooms so I imagine that the experience of staying in one of these is much better than the one I had in an unrenovated room very old fashioned and a bit stuffy Still given the price I paid it remains a good deal , The location the helpful staff 
483336,Hotel Mentana, A nice hotel but not really a 4 star Breakfast is very basic not at all commensurating with 4 star standard Over priced , Centrally located in the heart of Milan in a small Street Very caring and helping staff Neat and clean rooms though all rooms are not of same standard 
483337,Hotel Mentana, Would have preferred if the hand shower could have a hook on the wall and sometimes the water was only Luke warm While the wifi was free the code had to be reinterred each logon and only free for 2 devices , Location was an easy walk midway to the main Duomo square and the canals restaurants A small supermarket Simply very close and great Patesserie breakfast eat and Go close by in Via Torino Good to have a lift as we arrived with large suitcases and were tired after a long flight 
483338,Hotel Mentana, Small dingy room and bath Hard for us to find the hotel from the train station got conflicting directions from the front desk , Staff was very nice and helpful 
483339,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, Staff were extremely helpful and made us feel very welcome Location is in a quiet area but just a short walk from the Duomo Room was a good size as was the bathroom 
483340,Hotel Mentana, It is always the same in Milano 4stars hotel that would be a 2 stars In any other city in the world Very limited breakfast small and old room just one very narrow and old elevator Very basic bathroom It urgently needs to be refurbished, Really good location to see the main attractions Very helpful staff 
483341,Hotel Mentana, The only two hiccups I can point out are connected to the bathroom Although there were enough towels shampoo shower cap etc instead of a shower gel there was one of those small hotel soap bars that are difficult enough to wash one s hands with let alone one s whole body I don t quite understand why they have invested in everything else but not into shower gel The other thing was the rather tiny shower which even to me I am quite thin was a tad small , Located less than 10 minutes away from the Duomo on a small quiet square next to the La Scala Academy The hotel has gone through a complete refurbishment and the rooms look much better than a look form the outside might suggest I had a single fairly small room which was nevertheless very comfortable and had everything I needed The bed was good pillows and linens were soft and clean there was enough light in the evening The bathroom was refurbished nicely as well Very good hairdryer Wifi worked ok enough considering the overall quality of Italian Internet The staff was nice 
483342,Hotel Mentana, Old bathroom , Very good location Cadorna train station and the Duomo are just 10 15 min walk Comfortable bed good breakfast nice staff good wi fi connection 
483343,Hotel Mentana, There was not enough staff for breakfast therefore me and other guests had to wait as there were not enough tables , The hotel is central located and the staff was very helpful 
483344,Hotel Mentana, The staff just give answers or recommendations by request they don t seem to be interested in doing more than giving the key to the guest , Excellent location good breakfast and clean rooms 
483345,Hotel Mentana, You ought to change username and pw wifi everiday although it is free On the 7th march in the morning we asked pw by phone in the room and someone in the desk answered NO possibility to provide it by phone 15 m later the waitress knocked at the door and kindly gave it to us ,No Positive
483346,Hotel Mentana, Very limited and low profile breakfast old fashioned and small rooms mini bathroom looks like an old dormitory internet access is very difficult tv and channels are limited This hotel could have been a good 3 star but not 4 star for sure , central location
483347,Hotel Mentana, The old types of rooms are old fashioned and not so nice but fair value for money , The staff is super helpful and friendly The modern rooms are really nice and original The location is great excellent value for money 
483348,Hotel Mentana, strange and dishonest staff klaustrofobic room and walls so thin that the snoring from neighboring room might keep you up all night I wouldn t say a nightmare but not far off , Location 
483349,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, Its in the brera zone which is the heart of the luxury brands and nice restaurants Only 5 6 min to duomo square and vittorio emanuele by walk The staff was friendly 
483350,Hotel Mentana, The bath was a bit not adequate for having a relaxing shower , The location was really good almost a 8 min walk from Duomo easily reachable by Via Torino a famous shooping street The hotel was not a modern one but everything was functional and clean The staff was really helful Working wifi really good breakfast 
483351,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, It is not 4 start in a sense that there is no restaurant or a snack bar But there is a coffee machine so you can drink some coffee or tea late in the night we didn t knew this It is 10 minutes from the main church The street is not noisy It is located on the remains from Romains path 
483352,Hotel Mentana, Nothing really It is a little dated but not enough to make it an unpleasant stay , the location is excellent the man at reception was very friendly and helpful
483353,Hotel Mentana, Since it said the hotel is near the station we didn t ride the cab anymore Bad choice as we had a challenging time finding the hotel upon our arrival , Boni the front office staff was very friendly helpful and accommodating He showed us where to go and what we can see in Milan 
483354,Hotel Mentana, I did not expect much so I was not disappointed in anything , Great location to discover the city center I only needed it for having a bed breakfast for one night and this was exactly what I got for a great price 
483355,Hotel Mentana, Poor breakfast The furniture should be renovated Non functional electrical outlet , Clean room and comfortable room The sheets were changed daily Friendly staff Good location 
483356,Hotel Mentana, You only get 1 nights free wi fi so if you are a heavy internet user this is worth bearing in mind , Friendly and helpful staff ready to greet you when you go to the hotel Good location and close to a few bespoke shops and restaurants Excellent value for money 
483357,Hotel Mentana, No bad experiences at all Suggest a bigger refrigerator and should have ironing facilities in the suite Shame that the hotel does not offer laundry or room service , We stayed in the top Suite for 5 nights The bed was excellent along with the bath room and the furniture was very comfortable Very little to no external noise and plenty of small restaurants within walking distance Good wifi but annoying to update every 24 hours 
483358,Hotel Mentana,No Negative, Hotel Mentana is the best deal in Milan Set just off a usually quiet square you re in old Milan just a couple of cobblestoned streets away from the main streets and a pleasant 15 minute walk to Doumo Sure the hotel isn t the newest or flashiest but that s part of its charm Doors open with big keys the lobby is full of polished wood and features the sort of little bar you might find in a movie from the 1950s and the breakfast well it s ok and enough You haven t come to Milan for your hotel breakfast Stay here sleep well have a coffee a croissant then head out across the square and go sit in one of the many cafes in the area for another coffee before your day of exploration For currently under 100 Euro a night for a single room right in the center of Milan seriously you can t go wrong with the Hotel Mentana Friendly helpful staff too 
483359,Hotel Mentana, air conditioning not working not comfort so disappointed with this because i have chosen the hotel consoder it have AC , Very strategic location very clean The philipino guy the reception very helpful
483360,Hotel Mentana, Very hard uncomfortable mattress pillows which meant interrupted sleep unable to work out how to work the heating system so had to keep the window open to avoid overheating , Well presented quite modern room and bathroom The rooms were cleaned to a good standard We also enjoyed the breakfasts particularly the croissants 
483361,Hotel Mentana, Only complaint was not hotel s fault Wifi network was out We ll be back though , Nice location right in the middle of things We were in Milan overnight so location was important Our room was clean comfy with two full length mirrors and hooks to hang coats We had a desk chairs and a good closet Bathroom was good with a shower in the bath tub like I prefer I can t rate breakfast as we had to leave too early to catch our train Also if you are not a stair person there are very few stairs for you to navigate I would definitely stay here again 
483362,Hotel Mentana, The breakfast could be a little bit more diverse, It is great price and location for Milan free wi fi bathroom is new The staff is really nice and helpful 
483363,Hotel Mentana, nothing interesting in the vicinity of the hotel absolutely nothing to do after the shopping area closes not sure how this hotel gets a 4 star appropriate maybe 30 years old smelly furniture one particular staff receptionist a south east Asian guy was extremely rude as I asked for check in and the room was not ready he said Go find yourself another hotel just like that he then back peddled and offered the wifi password which btw didn t work during my entire stay as to search for another hotel wont stay there again , Location is few minutes away from the shopping area
483364,Hotel Mentana, Very small single room but renovated and comfortable, Good hotel extremely central 5 min walk from the Duomo Nice renovated rooms great staff and very quiet 
483365,Hotel Mentana, The lack of a proper duvet was palpable Being from northern Europe you need a duvet when it gets a bit cold , Nice location close to the center of Milan and close to my conference 
483366,Hotel Mentana, didn t really have a bad experience, The hotel staff were very friendly and helped us find accommodation at our next destination Also the location was not too far from the Duomo 
483367,Hotel Mentana, the bedrooms were a bit tatty Old fashioned Dusty bedroom and air con didn t work , The location was great for walking into the centre of the city Nearby restaurants and a good bar on the square Close to attractions
483368,Hotel Mentana, I gonna agree with most of the negative comments here they should at least have some devices to make our breakfast hot , Locations and helpful staffs The hotel facilities looks like 80s but all maintained in a pretty clean and comfort state 
483369,Hotel Mentana, The room was very small in an angle and had no wardrobe or chest of drawers The shower was also very small and the hand basin was at an angle and when you turned on the tap the water spilled out over the basin , Location was very central 
483370,Hotel Mentana, the slow moving lift, the fast interactivity when e mail requirements before coming the availability of the staff when staying the cosy comfort and the perfect location in the middle center town
483371,Hotel Mentana, The breakfast was great if you wanted a cold breakfast with a large range of options but there wasn t a hot breakfast option There was a mini bar in the room but no kettle The area the hotel in doesn t really have any little shops for buying your own cheap drinks or snacks which meant it was difficult to get a drink in the room if you re scared of minibar prices which to be fair I never checked , This hotel is literally a five minute walk away from Milan Cathedral which is the heart of the city This makes it really easy to have a relaxed late night walk around the main square which was great The room was clean quiet and comfortable Despite it being very warm outside the temperature in the room was very pleasant so that was a bonus The WiFi was very good and despite being advertised as being paid it was provided for free which was a nice bonus for me Often free WiFi is slow but this was very fast 
483372,Hotel Mentana, I would perhaps improve the breakfast , I really enjoyed the location Tucked away in a small quiet block away from the main streets It s a quick walk over to the Duomo At night there s a great caf just steps in front of it and a supermarket right around the corner The staff was very accommodating even gave free wifi codes 
483373,Hotel Mentana, Decor a little dated but nothing a lick of paint wouldn t cure , Staff really friendly Location great and hotel although a little dated was incredibly clean
