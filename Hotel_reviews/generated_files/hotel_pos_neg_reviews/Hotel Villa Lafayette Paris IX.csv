193516,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX, Breakfast is too simple and canteen seats are limited For cosy family room the size of the room is a bit small , The staff in reception desk is really friendly and helpful thanks a lot The mattress is super comfortable clean room The nearest subway station is just 2 mins by walk so we are able to travel around Paris just by subway 
193517,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX,No Negative, Good sized room and very comfortable and clean Hotel was walking distance to several train stations Was also walking distance to quite a few cafes and bars Breakfast was great fresh and varied Staff were friendly and helpful 
193518,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX, Nothing everything was perfect , My family and I loved this hotel it s in a good location the staff were fantastic A C and Wifi worked good and the breakfast was delicious will stay here next time in Paris 
193519,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX, Unfortunately the internet was down 4 out of 5 days and breakfast room is tiny sometimes requiring guests to wait a few minutes , Very bright and clean place friendly staff in central location You receive a mobile for the duration of your stay nice idea 
193520,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX, There was no downside All good , The room was exactly as the photo The young man on the front desk was so helpful and cheerful as was all the staff Most spoke English There was a laundromat close by which was very good Walking distance to Gare de Nord and right on Cadet Metro 
193521,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX,No Negative, Excellent location 10min walk from train station Staff were fantastic always friendly and very helpful Especially impressed with receiving an email from the manager prior to the stay asking if there were any special requests or information required to make our trip easier All requests were followed up Highly recommend 
193522,Hotel Villa Lafayette Paris IX, There was nothing that we disliked at all As far as my little neutral face rating for the view goes If you re hoping to get a beautiful view of Paris from your window you re not going to get one from most hotels in this arrondisement unless you pick one on one of the major thoroughfares like the Rue de La Fayette the largest street by our hotel in which case you trade off a decent view for road noise But from the 9th arrondisement it s not like you re going to be seeing the Seine or Sacre Couer or anything like that We actually requested a room away from a main road because we prefer it quiet so our window just looked out on the quiet little Rue de Trevise , We had several expectations that were all met within walking distance from Gare du Nord 15 minutes and it never felt unsafe close to a Metro stop one minute from Cadet near restaurants enough space for a family of four and quiet at night I had not stayed in Paris since my honeymoon 16 years ago so the modern feel and the relative size of the room and bathroom surprised me compared to my memories of the other hotel I had stayed at One nice touch was USB ports along the bed frame for charging phones Breakfast was included and had a good variety of hot and cold items and it was very filling My wife is a self described poor sleeper who wakes up at the slightest sound or if the mattress pillow is uncomfortable and she slept through both nights so that s got to be saying something Our room was by the elevator which we never heard at night and if there were occupants above or below us we didn t hear them The heating AC system was very modern and was quiet not like units that clunk on and off and whir loudly in a lot of American chain hotels I ve slept at The desk staff spoke English to varying degrees of course and were patient with my attempts to converse in French We were able to leave our luggage after checkout so that we could explore the city before our train departure at 6 00 P M The most unique feature was that we were sent a survey prior to check in to learn a little about us and ask whether we had any special needs or wishes i e suggestions of restaurants that served gluten free meals and the response was quick and detailed My wife and I have probably stayed in over 200 hotels between us for work and pleasure and have never gotten something like that We had a good feeling about the hotel from the beginning and it was a good experience until the end
