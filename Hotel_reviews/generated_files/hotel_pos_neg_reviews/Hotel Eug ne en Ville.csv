220249,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, hotel is in great location however we had a suite and its very black interior was too dark especially at night time you couldn t see anything so maybe a little more lighting would be good ,No Positive
220250,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Room size is very small Strange bathroom design where they separated the toilet seat from the sink and shower by a wall so you have to step out of the toilet seat room walk across your room and enter the other part of the bathroom Just doesn t make sense Also the receptionist working during my departure was not friendly and seemed bothered when I inquired as to why I wasn t getting my full pre autherization back so I asked for an invoice and figured it out myself Totally unacceptable behavior , Location You ll be a minute walk from a metro and surrounded by Cafes food joints mini markets and pharmacies Safe area at night 
220251,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Amazingly friendly ladies at the front desk Very comfortable room looked great also Good rate and great location Next time I go to Paris this place will be first on my list 
220252,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The elevator was out of order in the evening on two days in a row The bathroom was not separated from the rest of the room and the shower was separated with a normal glass so that one could have no privacy while in the shower The toilet was separate from the bath but there was no sink inside so that one had to go to the bathroom to wash his hands , Nice location very central and close to the metro station 
220253,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, there was no fridge in the room, the bed was comfy and the decor was nice the hotel was close to restaurants and shops and the walk to all the tourist attractions was manageable 
220254,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, We received a strange mid level in between floor room Very little light Dark walls make the room even darker Small room but that is I suppose expected of Paris Stains on the carpet though these were not expected and that was very unfortunate to have to walk over Bring slippers strange safe where very little fits , Great location perfect for walking around to find bistros nearby Fantastic access by all transportation options Nice lobby restaurant looks stylish but did not try breakfast so unsure of quality of meals Nice shower amenities Good closet space
220255,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, I feel very conflicted about this hotel Unfortunately ultimately I wouldn t recommend it because with our experience the bad outweighed the good The fire alarm went off late on Sunday night 11th July on the first night we stayed so naturally everyone evacuated and stood outside It was absolutely pouring so not the best start Eventually a member of hotel staff came to the front desk and the alarm was silenced I would say the alarm had been going for about 10 minutes at this point though and there wasn t a staff member to tell us if it was a false alarm or real or anything She explained in a really aggressive manner that there was a fault with the alarm and heavy rain sometimes set it off She seemed irritated we had bothered to evacuate and said that it was not the first time it had happened No apology or further explanation of a fix or anything Fair enough though It was close to 1am and we were all a bit moody We arrived back at the hotel on our first day and the girl at the front desk informed us the lift was broken We were on the top floor which was a pain but being able bodied it was hardly a big deal However it was not fixed for the full 4 days of our stay Again no apology offered at any point They did however offer to help getting luggage downstairs which was a godsend No idea what they would have done if they had disabled guests All in all the staff were unpleasant to deal with when we returned to the hotel in the evening We arrived home late from Disneyland on Tuesday night and asked for some milk sachets for the room and we were told no milk is available by an exasperated girl on the front desk who was busy making a personal call We walked up the four flights of stairs and found some milk sachets on a cleaning trolley on the landing so I think she just had no interest in being helpful Also just a word of advice our room 405 had the WC seperate then a shower in the middle of the bedroom , The rooms are very unusual and the hotel is in a great location closest metro is Le Peletier about 4 mins away It is in a typical Parisian street so lovely views out of the front rooms onto other side of terrace with beautiful ironwork railings Bed very comfy rooms were cleaned each day to a good standard Day staff were friendly and gave us a map of the area and offered to research musical shows for us as we were unsure which to see 
220256,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Room too small Hotel difficult to find by taxi because it s on a tiny sidestreet with not enough room to even get all our luggage without landing on water along the sidewalk No lobby for people visiting you to wait Bed okay but not much room to move ,No Positive
220257,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Well located in the second arondissement Staff was friendly and bed was comfy Rooms were on the small side but perfect for a quick night in Paris Bonus Great hairdryer 
220258,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The bedrooms were very dark the lighting was inadequate for putting on makeup and the decor was dark with lots of black which didn t help , Breakfast was good the beds were comfy 
220259,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, 1 The key was broken Had to ask stuff to open with special tools till they fix the key They told me the time to come and fix they never come They fixed when I out But That s kinda uncomfortable and unsafe for me 2 The bath booth are kinda skeleton even it has cloths to cover You can see the whole naked If you re staying by yourself should be fine but friend awkward , They have normal plug and USB Good access to everything 
220260,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, We love try new boutique hotel but this hotel is far from what we expected The worse room ever we get for this category and happily we were upgraded we can t imagine the room we booked Room are dark no well maintain We request for a quiet room and they give us a room with no view to the back of a restaurant so that we can hear the kitchen from late evening and early morning We won t recommend this hotel for a luxury traveler , Breakfast was nice and correct despite one male waiter who was not friendly at all 
220261,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Lighting in the room was very bad would have preferred for the room to be better lit Room on the small side , Small enough room but to be expected in Paris Comfy beds Fabulous shower facilities in the room Right beside the metro which is very handy 5 minutes walk to gallerie lafayette Not an overly crowded area at all Could not hear any noise from the street in our room Couldnt check in upon arrival but they held our luggage for the day Air con worked well so did the wifi 
220262,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Didn t like the NO refund policy It was the only hotel I came across that had it, Found the room a bit small But have been advised that it s the norm in Paris Staff very friendly Location was very good Overall we were very satisfied Thank you
220263,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Some rooms lost wifi signal completely Rooms are too small even for one person only, matress is good for the people who has back problem Location is the shining point
220264,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Property was located in a convienent spot with shopping restaurants and attractions within walking distance or short train ride Room was very comfortable
220265,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Our room was extremely dark and very small The door on the toilet did not lock the bathroom was not separate from the bedroom The toilet was black the walls were decorated with black wall paper and the floor had black tiles The lighting in the actual bedroom was not great and it was hard to do hair and make up because of this The room did not have dressing gowns as stated and the tea making facilities were very limited with plastics mugs plastic stirers only one teabag The bath was very narrow and short which made it hard to bath the shower was attached half way up the wall and the tiles did not go up to the ceiling so showering whilst standing was not an option There was no mirror or in the actual room only in the bathroom area which meant if one person wanted to dry hair and get ready while the other was showering you could only achieve this if you were both in the bathroom allowing no privacy , The hotel was very clean and the bed very comfortable 
220266,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, I think the room was a bit smaller than I expected Not necessarily a bad thing but maybe the photos could be clearer , The staff was lovely and it s an excellent location The receptionists were knowledgeable about restaurants and things to do and really helpful with check out at 5am I didn t eat at the hotel but the dining area looked great and the whole place had some quirky decorations which I loved My room was lovely shower was great and I had an amazing view as well Would recommend especially as it s so close to the whole Montmartre area one of my favourites and you can easily walk to loads of nice areas It s also really close to public transport 
220267,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Nothing that could have been better, I just loved everything The room was amazing good bed big showerhead very clean and you were able to close the blinds so it was very dark when you would go to sleep The staff was super nice and helpfull One of them told me about this amazing restaurant that I went twice to Everyday day they would bring water to the room which was super nice there were fresh towels everyday There was a market close by that I went to everyday to buy strawberries and more water really nice shopowner This was a great location for everything shopping and more I will go again to this hotel when I visit Paris again 
220268,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, This is a great Boutique Hotel in a nice area not far from the Department stores The decor is original and stylish the rooms are very comfortable and quiet with coffee tea facilities and the bathroom very nice The beds were perfect and we slept so well The staff at the reception were very welcoming friendly and professional We will defenitely come back to this Hotel The Hotel is perfecly located just 1 Minute Walking to Le Peletier Metro Station In the area you have some nice bars Restaurants and supermarkets We loved it 
220269,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Bed a little too firm but I guess this is something the hotel can not please everyone with , The Hotel is ideally situated Le Peltier and Grand Boulevard stations are very close and have great links all around Paris We had a Superior room and by Parisian standards it was a decent size The bed was huge albeit a little too firm for me We loved the boutique feel about the hotel and the Staff were so helpful I d like to thank Victoria in particular She was always happy to help and always so patient in finding the best Metro routes to the destinations I required There are countless bistro s bars and cafe s within walking distance If you are looking to shop there is the Galerries Lafayette which has every high end brand you can imagine as well as shops like Topshop etc There are also supermarkets and lots of local bakeries to pick up some breakfast from If you are looking for a non Parisian lunch check out Fonzarelli Pizza it is outstanding Bar M has fantastic Tapas with a great local vibe at all times of the day sitting in their covered outside area watching Paris pass you by If we were to return to Paris we would defintely look to stay in the Opera District again and would recommend Eugene to any couple looking for a quaint boutique hotel 
220270,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Nothing about it was as portrayed on their website The entry and check in was extremely sub standard The room was only accessible by numerous stairs and extremely small with the toilet and shower in the bed room in full view no walls the view out of the room was to a very close brick wall The entire hotel was VERY dark We were told by the staff that it was an hour from the Eiffel Tower yet it comes up under the heading of Hotels in close proximity to the Eiffel Tower We were charged an extra 30euros to be put in an only VERY SLIGHTLY larger room that was accessible by lift with the toilet in its own little room Again with an awful brick wall view When I requested to take photos of the original room that we were given they refused to let me have access The only attractive thing about both rooms were the bed linens The staff were very rude when we voiced our disappointment, NOTHING
220271,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Internet is virtually non existent Works extremely bad It is unacceptable for a 4 star hotel , Decorations style Nice hotel nice comfy bed sheets Good position
220272,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Really great design Although the tiles you see on the room photos are not actual stone Subway station and great pubs and karaoke are just nearby 
220273,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The only thing I would change is adding a darker curtain for the shower I was traveling with my mom and the curtain was sheer so it felt very awkward when we had to shower as there was no privacy , I really enjoy this hotel The staff is prompt and very helpful the proximity to the metro and shopping areas is fantastic it is surrounded by nightlife the rooms are clean and spacious the beds are comfortable Highly recommend
220274,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Shower and bathroom were separate Room on the small side Breakfast nice but not much choice for continental option , Very funky boutique hotel Rooms are all unique mine had a huge private terrace surrounded by rooftops of Paris Amazing rainfall shower Great location near Gare du Nord 
220275,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Can a Manager please call me as I have been double charged and I am trying to get refunded Thanks in advance and would highly appreciate someone getting back to me as their is no direct contact info or website Regards Manar E 
220276,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, one has to pay 50 bucks for the deposite WiFi is very poor and don t expect it works expensive with low C P ratio, location is excellent very close to Subway 7 Le Pelepier a safe area with lots of shops and restaurants around nearby a Supermarket Carrefour City Paris comfortable bed
220277,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, A lack of natural light in the bedroom it felt a bit dingy at dusk , Excellent service staff extra friendly and courteous less than 2 minutes walk from the Peletier Metro station 
220278,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, We didn t have the breakfast as that was extra and a bit pricey , Lovely room quiet and cosy Well located for the metro and railway station so everything within easy reach 
220279,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Building was very hot both in lobby and the rooms Location wasn t that great for us We ended up spending most of our time on the Champs Elysees and Louvre area and would have preferred to stay over there , The front desk gal Moyan was very helpful She was also very accommodating and patient 
220280,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Housekeeping in other rooms was very loud in the morning although I especially asked for a quiet room At the arrival I had to bring my luggage up to the room without any help German TV channels did not work at all Wi fi is very weak The free drinking water was not refilled after two days in my room just as the shower gel in the bathroom , Good location polite staff Coffee tea and water is served in rooms for free which is a new feature Everything is clean in the hotel 
220281,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, We had several problem with the credit card and the deposit as they charge us twice before arriving and the day of arrival We came back home the 4th of October and today 15th we still don t have the money in our account 600 euro We ask them the day of the check out and they said there would be necessary 48 hours to give our deposit back We are still waiting in Addition I ordered the breakfast with the service room every day and every day there was something missing and different from the description Maybe you can find something better , The hotel is nice and the position is good even if you are in paris to work or for leisure 
220282,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The mattress was quite hard to my liking , Lovely room suite wonderfull breakfast friendly staff close to metro station with good connections very little noise from outside to be heard inside the room
220283,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, First the people manning the service counters are not consistent The team during day time are quite pleasant and accommodating But at night the lady was quite irritable and impatient I approached her to ask for help on translating a french website as I was trying to purchase museum tickets and instead of greeting with a smile she growled what s your room number and the way she acted condescendingly as if I was an inconvenience and she couldn t turn her back fast enough after giving me 1 to 2 word responses I just attributed it to her having a bad day but that wasn t really a great reflection of the the Hotel Second the wifi didn t quite reach my room I had to go to the hallway to get a working signal but I should have called the hotel s attention for that so that shortcoming is also on me , Beautiful little boutique hotel The beds were comfortable and the location is quite accessible to the Louvre 2 3 stops from the Metro 
220284,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, It s one of those hotels that has fancy photos but when you get there you realise that you are tricked honestly it was one of my worst stays all the interior of the hotel is black and it feels more like a stripe club the receptions were so mean and rude so everytime when we were entering the lobby they wouldn t even bother to look who is this not smile and not even saying a simple hello it was like we have done smth bad and we own them we wanted to extend our stay in paris for 2 more days and asked the reception for extera 2 nights as it was too much hassle to find another hotel they said you have to pay 100 euros more for each night plus your normal rate we were happy to pay something sensible but they though we have loads of money so they were trying to rib us off later on there were this nice blond girl at the reception and she said you don t have to pay anything extra as we have loads of free rooms so we went with her offer what I am saying is that just be so carefull with this hotel and ideally stay away from those people something about the rooms the rooms are so tiny and with black theme of colours it feels like a cage , There was one blond girl at the reception sorry I don t know her name that was really nice and helpfull rooms are clean 
220285,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Rooms only just large enough to function satisfactorily , Helpful staff close Metro good restaurants in walking distance Good quality Hotel and value for money Our second stay
220286,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, I specifically emailed and asked for our room to be ready between 8 9 a m and paid an additional 50 euro to check in early since our flight landed at 6 45 CEST and I knew we would be exhausted and tired from traveling for almost 24 hours straight with the time difference Our room was not ready we had to wait until 11 CEST The staff was initially not very helpful and kept repeating at me that check in is at 2 p m Eventually one of the other staff members overheard and took over and worked to get our room ready After that the stay was fine We would stay here again , Cute little hotel in the 9th arr of Paris Within walking distance of The Louvre Place De La Concorde Opera and the Seine The 7 Metro line is one block from the hotel Overall the staff was friendly and the hotel is very clean 
220287,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The shower head I could not work out how to hold it up without doing it manually but this is a tiny thing that was probably my own fault the rest was perfect , Location was fabulous the room was more spacious than I imagined and very clean bed was comfy and room was dark for a good sleep free water in the room Staff were immensely helpful and friendly the whole time let us keep our bags there for the day after check out and use the bathroom when collecting our bags Let us pay the city tax by cash or different card 
220288,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Breakfast options are a little expensive , Really friendly staff Good location not quite the centre of all the attractions but this is good cause it had a less tourist feel and is still close Close to Cadet metro Very comfortable and spacious beds Quite rooms 
220289,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Rooms were very spacious for Paris standards and decor was quirky and interesting Front desk helpful and the location is great walkable distance to Gare du Nord and many metro lines close 
220290,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The Lift was faulty and dropped 1 floor while we were in it the door opened between floors which was concerning The staff knew about it but didnt inform us The rooms were small and packed with useless furniture making the room inpractical and difficult to manuvour around The Toilet was seperate to the bathroom with poor lighting black walls and sanitaryware so it felt like you were in a torture chamber when using it The coffee wasn t replenished daily and we had to keep phoning reception to ask for more On one morning i had to ask the cleaner in the adjacent bedroom to stop banging around as it sounded like we was trying to break through into our room , Good location 
220291,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, I think they could have told us about the accommodation tax on the room It wasn t much but would have been good to know about before hand , The bed was really comfy and the food fantastic I really liked the 24 hour front desk as well Our plane was delayed and we didn t have to worry about checking in 
220292,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The front person were overall nice and kind But some front person called an expensive Mercedez in stead of a taxi to the airport The room was chic with dark colored decoration but quite dark and felt moody , Great location near two metro stations and walking distance to Opera and Lafayett 
220293,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The room was really small so if you have more than 1 big luggage you might have difficulties to open them Normal 2pers room is really only a bed wc and small bathroom , Very well located Metro just across the street and with one change you are on the metroline 1 connection to all tourist attractions 15min walk to Sacre coeur Very very clean and modern hotel Nice personnel Everything worked well Breakfast 8 was good options are 8 14 19 breakfasts

220296,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, There was no minibar into the room They did not change our towels And the guy from the reception was saying to many times Thank you sir ,No Positive
220297,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The rooms are small which is typical of Paris and they could have done with emptying the bins and replacing the soaps , The staff was great and the location good as well Really close to a metro station and close enough to walk to Opera and Gare du Nord
220298,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Wardrob like most Paris hotels was impractical and silly Early morning corridor noise, The decor and the modern day technological comforts next to your bed in the room was great and beyond expectation Closness to Gar du Nord a comfortable walking distance and closness to Gallery La fayett Good quality breakfast and coffee
220299,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The weather , Very cool rooms each one with a different design Rooms were clean Staff was very friendly and helpful Hotel had anything you need for a city break even free umbrellas to take with you when it s raining 
220300,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, As with most boutique hotels the dimmed ambient lighting within the bedrooms makes getting ready for a night out a bit difficult thankfully my kind partner pointed out I d overdone the blusher Maybe a bit more light near the dressing mirror would be good , Very cool boutique hotel Great location close to Gare du Nord and various attractions within reasonable walking distance Lot s of lovely bakeries cafes and food shops nearby 
220301,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, What a delightful surprise Our hotel was situated in the most perfect position central but quiet We navigated our way around the city quite easily with a little help from the fantastic staff especially Salone on the first day Close to everything that you would want to see the metro is quite easy too Many beautiful shops Cafes surrounding the hotel also But the room ahhh magnificent wonderfully French with a fantastic large balcony Everything was beautiful recently renovated Absolutely lovely Thank you 
220302,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Wi fi is not very powerful in the rooms The tv signal was intermittent breaking down from time to time The carpets in the room require a bit more cleaning than the daily one Nothing that would prevent me from coming back to the hotel of course Not all the staff spoke English even though it was visible they were making an effort to communicate efficiently Was a bit shocked when I spotted additional charged in my final bill and a new member of the team at check out told me the charges were fine Thank God Ida appeared and sorted everything out including the crediting of the additional 140 eur Would recommend to train new staff members in a way so they can spot errors at check out efficiently , Location is superb Two subway station within 100 metres each Walking distance to Galerie Lafayatte and Opera Garnier In room cafe facilities in Deluxe rooms Great toilets including toiletries to die for by The White Company London In room safe and flat screen tv Really nice decor in black gold a bit of silver and lots of mirrors Ida and Solene have proofed to be the most helpful staff members I have seen in years They accommodated every single request we have had with a smile and proficiency even when the situation would have gotten a bit tense Highly professional The staff at the breakfast room was all very nice as well as the guys helping out with our luggage stay away from the new ones though We will be back 
220303,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Some rooms are very small We had to upgrade at extra cost because our allocated room was so small despite emailing in advance asking for a larger room One of the porters told us that we had been allocated the smallest room in the hotel , Location is fantastic 
220304,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, There s no water boiler or coffee tea in the room , The front desk staffs are amazing We got enough information from them including place of interests restaurant transport and weather It s our first trip to Paris they made us felt like home There was heater in the room wonderful that it wasn t cold at all even it snowed outside The location was a major benefit so many good restaurant at walking distance and 2 mins walking to 2 metro stations 
220305,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, We asked for an iron with ironing board unfortunately the iron leaked water and stained our clothing the ironing board was broke and didn t stand up , The terrace was very good and the shower
220306,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The walls tend to be a little thin so we could hear people moving about and at least one screaming child that bothered us a bit , The staff were friendly and eager to assist We didn t eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that The room in terms of size and facilities suited us well This was our first visit to Paris so we cannot compare it to any others hotels 
220307,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Buffet breakfast was a little expensive but very good selection , Staff was very friendly and always wiling to help I stayed for 5 nights and then decided to stay for another 2 
220308,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, I stayed in a deluxe room but there was no fridge or kettle or iron Although I paid everything up front I was told another 50euro would be blocked on my account in case I order food I would prefer to be billed only if I order food other services For the price and being a 4 hotel I expected a little more , The location was excellent it was close to the metro supermarket restaurants and the main shopping centre The staff were helpful and the room had unique decor Robes were provided
220309,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, Excellent helpful and friendly staff that was willing to assist in various matters Building is on a quiet street but very close to two metro lines with quick and easy access to all parts of the city Great Hotel 
220310,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The wi fi was slow and worked unpredictable , It s a very nice hotel on a very good location Everything you need is available the stuff is very kind and helpful The cleanness which is more than important for me of the whole building and the rooms is unexceptional In general we had a great time there 
220311,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Booked a superior twin room expecting a bit more space than standard room but this was still pretty small the single beds were super small which led to uncomfortable nights sleep We ordered room service one night the food wasn t the greatest and didn t come as described It would have been good to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Nice boutique style hotel nice decor fairly convenient location friendly and helpful staff 
220312,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The bedroom is too small with 6 feet bed We would appreciate a kettle in a room , The staff is really nice and service minded Location is also great just a few steps away from metro 
220313,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Extremelly small room if you are along and just need to sleep perfect price quality I got 66 discount offer Full price I would not pay But with discount it is perfect choice , Design of the room was really good Quite and clean little room 
220314,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, all the room lights were a dull light A bright light would be good the full breakfast option was a little pricey for what you got , reception staff were friendly and helpful the shower was great size and water pressure good train line to be on Easy access to everything 
220315,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Had trouble with Wifi connection although the staff did their best to fix it Black wall in the room was bit too much for me I know it was the ambience but it was bit too dark to read , The staff were extremely friendly and nice and location was excellent 
220316,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Breakfast seemed a little pricey considering what is available nearby , Great welcoming and optimistic staff I m an interior designer and the hotel s design mood exceeded my expectations Comfortable bed and the room was a pleasure to be in 
220317,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, The original room we booked for two people is extremely and awkwardly small i know and have been in european small hotel room but this was way too much it can fit only one person so we upgraded to an okay small room for two people and we ended up paying around 150 euros extra ,No Positive
220318,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Since I travel to Paris at least 6 times a year for work I booked as a single traveller a double room since I have terror of Paris Hotel single rooms The room I was given was tiny and not more than 11 square meter In their booking page they claim a room size of 16 square meter When I complained they told me straight into my face that I was wrong and that the room size was exactly as on the web No change of rate or at least a free breakfast was offered to compensate Hospitality of the lowest category So I paid for a double room got a small single room with a tiny bathroom where they had to fix the sink outside because it did not fit into the bath I feel cheated The money of course was deducted before my arrival First two pictures are the room I got and the third picture is from their booking com site for exactly the same room category I booked, The location
220319,Hotel Eug ne en Ville,No Negative, It was a very nice hotel more like a boutique one The stuff was very kind the 3 options of breakfast were excellent and the room was in a quite area
220320,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, It would be nice if there was a mini fridge in the room to put a drink in for the night or a complementary mini kettle to have a tea or coffee in the room in the morning , Such a beautiful hotel The decor was amazing and the staff were so friendly 
220321,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, we ve booked a superior room but the room we stayed is a classic room for sure there were just the room facilities of a classic room and the room was soooooo small than it s written they insist on that it was a superior room but it was not we ve checked from booking com and hotel s website too superior and classic rooms must have been quite different that s why we ve paid an extra 40 euros but we regret our stay at this hotel we d be better to stay at the hotel that was also 4 and with higher rating and 100 euros cheaper ,No Positive
220322,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Our shower leaked onto the bathroom floor slightly which overall didn t cause a problem but if I had to pick a fault this would be the only one , We checked in with no problems and were shown to our room We booked the superior double room via booking com Once in our room we received a phone call from reception to say there had been a mix up and we d been given the wrong room We were then shown to our new room which was even better I wouldn t have known the first room was not the room that we booked The rooms are of good size and nicely decorated The bed and the pillows were very comfortable and there were full black out curtains which created a great nights sleep after long days of sight seeing The bathroom was big enough with a huge shower head There was also a proper hairdryer provided so no need to bring your own not like other hair dryers provided in a hotel A selection of shower gels soaps and shampoos were also available as well as lovely white bath towels All staff were very friendly and did a lot to answer questions and help They even arranged a shuttle bus for our return trip to the airport which would cost only a few euros more than getting the RER train from CDG airport We had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back to this hotel for a return visit It s in a convenient location and metro stops are near by for getting around with a lot of sights within walking distance as well 
220323,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, They cannot change the location its noisy streets all around the hotel But they could change the windows Breakfast at 19 Euros is obscene It may be good I didn t check but it cannot be this good , The overall impression is efficiency They are good at that The hotel is also very close to a Metro station so you get around very quickly

220325,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, None, Easy to find Staff friendly and helpful Room very comfortable Quilt and pillows beautiful I would recommend this hotel for its price and location A short bus ride from Gare de Nord rail station and very near metro station Walking distance to Montmatre and Sacre Coeur area if you are a walker 
220326,Hotel Eug ne en Ville, Wi Fi more English TV channels, Great staff Loved the style of the hotel Room service and breakfast was great I didn t like the sausages at breakfast though
