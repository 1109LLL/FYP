311000,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Having to leave , Rooms very clean and the bed was so big and comfortable Air conditioning Quiet Room made up very quickly each day Big room and large bathroom with lovely fresh towels each day Hired bikes which were great for getting around 
311001,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, there is no mini bar in the room where you can put things that you buy only a machine of drinks , there is a trem number 2 just infront of the hotel very convenient the staff were sooooooo nice anf helpful the room was clean big and comfortable the breakfast for 12 5 euros was great free coffe machine in the room takes 10 15 minutes walking from the train station which from there you can take a train to the airport about 10 minutes by train
311002,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit far from the City centre bit but the fact that there is a tram right in front of the hotel it doesn t cause major issues Lack of restaurants near the hotel , It s a fairly new hotel 3 years so everything is shining clean attractive Breakfast is truly amazing The staff is very helpful It has a tram right in front Rooms are fabulous Net net my family enjoyed their stay Free wifi It is really good and after a long tour u can watch movies in your room
311003,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The receptionist on the arrival was neutral till negative At the end They tried to charge us with 2 peanuts and my friends for 1 peanut and 1 beer from refrigerator We left from the Hotel with tram at 09 30 and they said that we took these things at 10 15 The girl from the reception checked if the system works and she told us that works perfect I insisted and finally we didn t pay ,No Positive
311004,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Guard rail in car park upper levels it would have been very easy for a small child to fall through Room could have been cleaner hair n lots of dust around ,No Positive
311005,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The place is perhaps a little bit more modern because you have to do many things by yourself Machines cannot replace humans at the lobby and at the parking There is a lot of confusion at the check in Also I have to criticise the cleaning of the room They always forgot to wash change the glasses , The hotel is nice and modern The room is wonderful The location is quiet and close to the park We couldn t find some nice restaurants nearby but there is LIDL close to it The beds are comfortable and the bathroom is very modern There is also nice coffee machine at the room with free coffee every day 
311006,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel design was cold and staff were distant The exception was a lovely young hard working man working in the restaurant at breakfast from another country , Enjoyed the hotel facilities The food was excellent The hotel was well maintained and very clean The location was excellent You could even walk into town however transport was close by to the town 
311007,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was very comfortable Very good breakfast in the restaurant Having the tram line just outside the hotel was very handy We were able to walk 15 minutes to the train station to catch the train to the airport Also I left my prescription sunglasses in the room The hotel shipped them back to my home after they located them 
311008,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, If the hotel location had been around 4 tram stops closer to the city centre it would have been perfect , Luxuriously furnished Comfortable beds and warm feeling decoration 
311009,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We don t have any complaints one day thewifi was going on and off for some time but othervise it worked just fine , We were thete for a week It was very comfortable and private the staff was friendly and helpful Also the tram number 2 stops right outside the hotel and is very frequent A perfect place to stay if you re planning a trip to Amsterdam 
311010,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hotel a bit further out than we realized Noisy at night with windows open traffic roadworks and sirens ok with windows shut though , Easy to find by car and free parking a bonus Tram stop outside made travel to center easy Clean and comfortable and staff friendly and helpful 
311011,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Some of the staff are a cold and non friendly of course not all of them firstly when arriving behind the counter the receptionist didn t say welcome or anything he looks and says do your own checking in I proceed then I ask how do I pay cash to this machine he replies oh you can t I will need to do that so the whole processes was carried out again Out of five nights and six days the room was serviced 3 times One morning approximately 9 00am with the door locked from inside a service person walked in whilst we are sleeping I found it very strange the lock doesn t stop their cards and when I approached another female staff telling her about the incident asking if they can do it the next day she replies with false claims for the event rude lady There were some minor issues a blue cushion had white stain on it for the entire stay and it was never cleaned or replaced There was too much lints in the air all the shelves had lints and dust gathering up One of our perfume left on the table was used up on daily bases to a finishing point really sad but true Both staff specified here were non native Dutch , We liked the room and the bathroom a lot it s next to tram 2 stop makes it convenient to downtown it had a Nespresso machine in the room very happy to see that loved the space and view nice view spacious and overall well maintained location is far out to the west of Amsterdam but on average it takes about 30 minutes on the tram to get to central station the lounge is spacious and well laid out 
311012,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room and bathroom was perfect Regular trams to the city centre located just outside the hotel A metro is 10 minues away with the main railway around 15 minutes walking time Breakfast is an option we chose not take as there are charming places to take breakfast around 10 minutes away if you follow the tram route towards the city centre The staff was very friendly and helpful 
311013,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, All was fine The Dinner menu can be more tailored to include international cuisine , The rooms were very spacious and elegantly designed The View from the room on the 9th floor was excellent and enjoyed every bit of our stay at the hotel There was a Tram station just outside the hotel and we were able to get to any part of the city using the tram 
311014,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The room was a good size but the dark interior decoration made the dustiness of the room quite visible , Great location for number 2 tram straight into the city centre 
311015,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, You can not buy alcohol at the restaurant this could be a drawback for some that love to drink a glass of wine during a dinner The throne in the bathroom is hung too high , It is modern hotel rather than vintage in general Self check in check out procedures are very useful and time saving Spacious rooms with comfortable beds Nespresso Coffee machine in the room is very nice option since the coffee is relatively good Train station about 10 min of walk so easy to get to from the Schiphol airport Tram line 2 takes you to the city center if you don t like to go there by foot 
311016,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Major disappointment was that there was no chance to have a beer or two In the restaurant The fact that it was no alcohol hotel should read somewhere clearly , The staff was excellent very kind and helpfull The tram stop was very close and the neighbourhood was quite quiet It was the cleanest hotel I have ever visited 
311017,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The absence of an openable window maybe A mini fridge would have been nice just so we could keep our water bottles Free bottles of water should have been provided daily not jist on the first day It really feels icky to drink the water from the bathroom even though it is filtered , Perfect location for those who want to be a bit away from the city The tram stop is rrrright outside the hotel making it very convenient to get around 
311018,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No fridge in the room was the one downside didn t detract from the stay at all , The bed was lovely and the staff were all fantastic We will probably stay again 
311019,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The fitness room Always smelled bad Not like sweat tho Like blocked sewage Yuck , Loved the location and facilities Very nice staff and accommodations 
311020,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing , Besides what I have said the restaurant is quite good and so is breakfast It was a pleasant surprise to me used to some quite bad experiences in Amsterdam This is a new and very high tech hotel To get to the center you get the tram just in front and you re in the middle of everything in 15 minutes I highly recommend this hotel 
311021,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There was no bar and it was an alcohol free hotel which meant no wine with dinner or beer if you just wanted to stay in, Good location just outside the city 10 minutes on the tram Nespresso machine was a big plus 
311022,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel and nearby restaurant closed at 10 pm too early , Love the tram stops so close by love the nearby river and the Lebenese restaurant And the neighborhood is quiet Very friendly staff and one of them was particularly enthusiastic 
311023,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The location is fairly good A bit far from the City Center but there s a tram stop right in front of the hotel and this will lead you to the central station directly Close enough to the airport around 20 mins taxi ride Clean room and spacious bathroom Self checkin and out no need to wait in lines by the front desk Value for money 
311024,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The lobby was a bit odd not so obvious what to do on arrival when there s no reception desk And the dark wood everywhere made it a bit difficult to navigate the lobby , Brilliant room design plenty of easily accessible power sockets lots of light settings easy to use shower easy to find everything Self service checkin was fast There are a couple of shops bars nearby but there s tram metro to the city centre from near the hotel 
311025,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location out of city centre but very close to tram stop which will take you there and back , Helpful staff Spotlessly clean and modern Good choice of TV channels and easy check in out Recommended
311026,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Good value for the price automaded checkin checkout very efficient Tram station right next to it metro also not far away buy the tickets at the hotel or tram machines not at the airport Saves you a lot of money Day Ticket costs only 12 50 don t pay the almost 50 at the airport 
311027,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, scared me with an email saying they might be able to accommodate us but I still had to pay Distance from city center Beds looked like the sheets hadn t been washed still had hair on them , Location next to the tram station Spacious and secure 
311028,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t manage to find any negative points, Fabulous facilities good location right on the edge of the old city centre small free gym in the hotel awesome mattress on the bed fast automatic check in and check out
311029,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We did nt expect to be charge for parking But maybe we did not read the details closely, Hotel is strictly self help via computer terminal our stay was a comfortable one without any misgivings
311030,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Upon my arrival the check in system was a bit complicated and when I asked for help found the girl at the reception was kind of not happy to help just keep saying here is the machine and go and check in In another occasion when I went to have dinner at 9 30 found the restaurant was closed already and when I complained they let me in but saying that the last order is at 9 30 so I complained WHY you haven t mentioned this in your introduction paper In the restaurant I ordered a salmon salad and surprisingly was told pushed by Alessandro the waiter that there is no dressing for this salad and because he likes everything with vinegar I should just use vinegar for salad dressing very annoying Apart from a cold attitude of the girls at the reception and the restaurant issue all the rest were fantastic Ah and this place is a dry hotel so no alcohol or wine being served so be aware , Room scenery access cleanliness modern decoration breakfast fast wifi 
311031,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, N A, I will highly recommend this hotel to anyone who intends to travel Amsterdam The hotel is not located in city center but you can take tram metro train to everywhere you want to go It only takes you 1min to a tram station where you can take Tram 2 to city center and central station The value for money is excellent as well The hotel provides clean and comfortable environment the facility is highly advanced so you can boil water and make coffee easily In addition the hotel also provides a mini gym so you can do exercise whenever you want 
311032,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bathroom over heated Corridors to rooms were not clean you could tell the window panes on doors were covered with dust and the same could be said about the carpets , Comfortable beds Sound proofing was effective 
311033,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Twenty minute tram ride to centre of town and major attractions , Good value hotel Good size room Transportation right in front But nothing close by the hotel other than two small grocery stores and one restaurant 
311034,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It seemed that the hotel has lost a bit of its initial flair I stayed here a couple of years ago and the bar was beautifully arranged and open Now you can only get softdrinks there and the lobby seems a bit faded , This is a nice hotel with spacious rooms good and firm beds in a calm area The connection to the city is excellent with the tram 2 stop just in front of the hotel Breakfast became cheaper than it used to be a vouple of years ago when the hotel was forst opened I would totally recommend staying here especially while on a business trip It is calm and has great wifi 
311035,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Tram station at the front of Hotel beautiful interior fully clean hotel looks like a new staff also very helpful and hotel breakfast also good location also is good 10 15 minutes by tram to the central station all over its perfect 
311036,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Uncomfy pillows Need bigger mugs for tea drinkers, Everything was provided the place was spotlessly clean and the staff couldn t do enough Felt very welcome and service was always with a smile Breakfast was the usual but in abundant supply Airport was 15mins away by metro and train Tram stop is literally outside the hotel A 3 day pass for 33 euros covered travel to all of Amsterdam including the airport and the windmills
311037,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They do not serve alcoholic drinks not even a beer The minibar was not working in my room and after I advised the receptionist nothing changed He just told me they also have drinks available in the main hall The fitness room defective machines and depressing atmosphere Service was awful , The parking directly at the hotel The room was nice as was the bathroom as spacious as a squash court 
311038,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They had a check in machine which was quite easy and fast but I think it s a bit impersonal Didn t have much dealings with staff no one said hello or anything in mornings evenings, Modern hotel shower is fab
311039,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They did not sell alcoholic beverages , Not to far not to close to city centre There was a tram stop right in front of the hotel One of the best hotels to stay in Amsterdam 
311040,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, there was no refrigerator in the room Rather there was a closed system soda machine, very comfortable close to tram station not far away from city center not far away from airport big and comfortable bathroom high quality but not luxurious furniture everything is as it should be you don t pay more for things you don t want You don t feel the facility is saving from the things you need 
311041,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff was a bit distant and expected persons to use the self check in which worked well though A bit far 20min tram ride away from the city center and no real services or restaurants close by Gym was large for a hotel gym but with very limited equipment , Really nice new hotel with good tram connection to the Amsterdam city center Close to the park with good running possibilities Large room with good facilities Basic ok breakfast 
311042,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I was surprised how far it still was from the centre but it had everything you needed close by so not a real issue at all Plus you pay much more in order to be closer and with the tram and bus system and its day tickets still not a problem and much cheaper at the end , Very clean modern and conveniently located at a tram stop straight going into town and the train station 
311043,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only thing I did not like was that a double bed means 1 whole bed not 2 singles joined together I more thing that did not make so much difference was that the mini bar in the room was not working , Location friendliness of staff cleanliness 
311044,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit pricy and extended stay was restricted to 3 pm for half a day Far from attractions but the tram in front of the hotel made transportation easier There is also a metro a few minutes walk away , Modern and spacious Quiet location Good for relaxing 
311045,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A tad expensive parking that closes early at night and automated function not always working very well , Great hotel nice location and service Extra service not known but much appreciated free coffee at the reception Staff careful of who they let in at night 
311046,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Housekeeping and room cleaning was very poor stains were not attended to bathroom cleaning very poor dust n crumbs were all not cleaned up despite lodging a formal complaint Espresso machine didn t work properly for first two days can dispensing Machine in room was not working No fridge in the room , Great location OPP tram stop very good comfy rooms good breakfast 
311047,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Mini bar out of order , Spacious clean comfortable modern great view very brigth corner room 12 minutes to the airport 12 minutes to city center 
311048,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location was listed as a airport hotel but it was not close to the airport and there was no shuttle 35 Euro cab ride That made it inconvenient for us breakfast was not included and expensive for just wanting a quick bite before heading to the airport , It was a beautiful modern facility 
311049,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Very comfortable beds The staff were very helpful and able to give us a lot of information about the transit system and how to get around Definitely my favourite stop on our two week holiday You definitely get a four star experience here 
311050,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Car parking for hotel guests should be free There are not many people on the streets in the back souronding of the hotel and it seems to be unsafe Walking distance 5 kilometers from the city center if you walk but has a very good tram connection , Comfortable and tidy room Comfortable beds Very good tram connection with the city center and with all sights of the city Pleasant cafes and neighborhood on the way to Vondel Park where you can have breakfast or refresh yourself upon return 
311051,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, 1 lighting in bathrom difficult to see when one is shaving 2 frigobar too commercial very computerized no possibility of keeping our own beverages to cool them, Blankets too warm no alternative ones
311052,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Onsite parking is pretty expensive Euro 2 per hour There is enough vacant parking lot but somehow hotel doesn t have any understanding to use the same , The hotel is complete Hi tech Self Check in including self Key creation and Self check out Automation made all operations very efficient Though we are widely traveled world over this is the first place I saw automated electronic mini bar It s thru a small vending machine in the room and gets automatically added to your room charges in case of any consumption The rooms very large with all necessary amenities including a wonderful coffee maker Beds were comfortable and bathrooms very clean and good Though the location is little away from downtown it really didn t matter as a tram stop is right opposite the hotel Within 20 25 minutes you are able to reach the central attraction points Being pure vegetarians we really didn t use the restaurant but was not a problem as there is a super market round the corner for all necessary daily needs 
311053,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t have the fridge There s a minibar but it can t be used as a fridge because it s basically a wending machine , As usual we enjoyed this hotel when staying in Amsterdam Living in a quiet neighbourhood enjoying large Lidl supermarket nearby and at the same time 10 meters from the entrance to the tram stop which takes you to the center of the city The hotel also has great facilities like toiletries and coffee machine 
311054,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Couldnt fault it , Perfect location to explore Amsterdam tram stops right outside hotel We got off at each stop on the way in to see different areas lots of great street cafes to watch the world go by Very helpful staff would definitely come again 
311055,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A fridge would have been nice in the room , The bed was massive Big enough for two bed hogs was an absolute delight to sleep in between the comfy bed and the pillows it was amazing 
311056,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Goin to the grocery store behind and around the corner from the hotel was a bit sketchy Some homeless and beggars and trash on the ground, The park across the street and tree lined canal
311057,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit far from the city centre No direct connection to the airport , Friendly and helpful staff Clean and quiet Bus tram station is very close to the hotel 
311058,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have liked the option to have a night cap in the hotel It isn t the worst thing ever but when you go on holiday sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy a glass of wine in the evening , Beautiful hotel with great tram service in the locality Was clean and staff were real nice The hotel is very comfortable and would recommend a stay to anyone who visits Amsterdam 
311059,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, In front of the Hotel there is Tram 2 stop which directly takes you to the center of Amsterdam in 10 15min It passes every 5 10minutes They lent us umbrellas and when we asked an extra service they were very helpful and we are very glad about this The room is comfortable and there is a supermarket behind the hotel 
311060,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, pillows may be changed , excellent location having a tram station in front of the hotel breakfast was good and restaurant for dinner was okay very helpful and kind personnel it was really nice to be able to buy a tram ticket from vending machine in the hotel 
311061,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, This hotel is conveniently located by a stop for the 2 tram which goes to the Centraal Station the train station for Amsterdam The tram trip to Centraal Station takes about half an hour and the trams run frequently The hotel also has a parking structure for those driving by car and they rent bicycles Central Amsterdam is very suitable for pedestrians and bicyclists and not so suitable for cars so it make sense to take the tram in and walk or bicycle The hotel s breakfast buffet is excellent It is slightly cheaper 12 5 euros instead of 15 euros if you book it in advance the night before Thus hotel s WiFi is excellent which is not true of all of the moderately priced hotels in Europe where I have stayed 
311062,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, On site restaurant was only open 2 4 nights we were there Price of breakfast was too high Off site restaurants were long walks away to find one we liked , The food was excellent in restaurant when we ate there 
311063,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The best hotel I have ever been to The bed was really comfortable and the clearness was excellent Java Cleaner did a great job The gym has a hotel with basic but good equipment to work out every morning at not extra cost The location on my opinion was brilliant it was not that close to the main attractions but it was really good communicated in terms of transport the tram stop was less than 2 minutes away from the hotel and you can also buy any travel card bus tram from the hotel and within 10 15 minutes you will be in the Iamsterdan sign and museums In addition the check in and check outs are done really quick To conclude I highly recommend it
311064,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t like being approached and questioned by a member of staff for wrapping up a roll I couldn t finish at breakfast Otherwise it would go to the bin Left us feeling dissapointed Breakfast price per person is high , Liked the deco and the facilities of the room Spacious and comfortable The en suite was great quality 
311065,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Quite expensive for the situation and the small room without breakfast No arrangement possible with the price no flexibility though I came alone instead with a friend Rooms for one person would have been much cheaper , Close to public transportations Clean Nice stuff 
311066,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Well the beds could be movable we booked a triple room with 3 separate beds but 2 beds were still fixed next to each other as if it was a double Coffee machine was moody at times just spitting the pads out Could not use the loyalty points card Other than that no comments , Beds were excellent loved the location direct and frequent tram the bf the coffee machine and that extra coffee pads were available We could even store the cheese in the fridge at the reception Parking is spacious and comfy 
311067,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Buffet breakfast was very good and if it had been free our rating would have been 100 in my opinion We stay in comparable Hilton hotels and breakfast buffet is included , Convenient to downtown and quiet neighborhood not far from airport Loved the modern design and Slick bathroom and nice amenities 
311068,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The coffee in the room was not at all good There were no tissues in the room , The food at the restaurant was very good The shuttle was convenient Without it I would not have gone there
311069,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Check in is automated so didn t really see any staff No welcome or interaction of any kind which felt odd Not a dealbreaker though , Great spot just outside the city and just by the tram spot Very clean and comfortable place 
311070,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No availability of food or an alcoholic drink after 10pm After taking advantage of the long daylight hours and lovely weather we returned to the hotel 25 mins by tram from the touristy Dam square a few minutes after 10 to be told that no meal was possible after 10 not even a beer We were given the opportunity to order from a takeaway but that s hardly what we expected We did discover a friendly local place that put together a meal and drinks for us though their kitchen was closed The mini bar in our room was also not working My partner did enjoy the gym facility though During the self check in process I would have liked someone to be around to address a query I had There was an unnecessary delay at check in following a long trip into Amsterdam , Room was big comfortable with ironing facilities and access to the gym Located next to the tram stop
311071,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not a fan of the shower style overhead shower only with a wand Nothing within walking distance , Checking in was easy Location was close to transit 
311072,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There are some changes being done in the rooms so our room ended up being without a safe and a refrigerator The staff installed a safe but for the refrigerator we were just offered to put our stuff in the refrigerator in the reception which was not that convenient , Overall good hotel clean and modern rooms Good to stay at if you don t need to be in the very center of the city Very good public transport connection to the center and can be reached quickly yet the hotel is in a quite area For Amsterdam it was a good value for money although hotels in Amsterdam are generally more expensive than other similar cities 
311073,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Explained above, The bed and linen was good The amenities in the bathroom should be enough and more The water bottles they provide are too small not even sufficient for One time drink Although hotel is nice overall and gave us the room at 12 45 whereas the checkin time is at 2 pm 
311074,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The staff were very rude and unhelpful and ignored you at reception Very impersonable and came as across as annoyed if asked anything Extremely bad customer service , Good location as just a train ride and short walk from the airport and located in front of the tram line which goes into central station 
311075,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s a little far from the center but there s a frequent tram line 2 that runs right past the hotel and the distance from the center is reflected in the room prices which make up for the tram journey , The rooms are very comfortable and much larger than most European hotel rooms with the bonus of a king sized bed The staff were very friendly and helpful and the prices were very reasonable for Amsterdam 
311076,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, N bit far from the city and train stations , Nice room with aircon and a expresso machine wifi business centre 15 euro breakfast was not include with the accommodation Complementary fruit 
311077,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although the hotel clearly specifies there is a no alcohol policy and has an empty mini bar in the room it would be helpful if the mini bar stocked non alcoholic drinks, Room was very spacious and extremely well soundproofed given the close proximity to a motorway
311078,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing , There was a tram stop right outside that took us to Amsterdam centre in less than half an hour There was a Lidl and a number of different restaurants 5 minutes away Very friendly and helpful staff Free use of computer and printer which was good for checking in for flights Massive bed really comfy 
311079,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Water should be given each day of the stay in the hotel not only for the first day You could have possibility to meet not really friendly staff , A tram stop next to the hotel and You need 20 minutes to get to the city center Check in out easy using the automatic machine 
311080,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel does not serve alcoholic drinks It wasn t too much of a problem for us as we spent a lot of time in the central area but would have been nice to have a quiet drink in the evenings , The room was a good sized as well the bathroom with underfloor heating Coffee machine was a fab addition to the room The location was perfect with a tram stop right outside the hotel to get to central station There is also a Lidl near by for any shopping needs 
311081,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The eco friendly bathroom if the timer for the sensor lights can be extended to run for maybe at least 15 minutes before they switch off automatically it would be perfect Not all rooms come with the eco friendly bathroom though only a few do The upside though is that this bathroom is more spacious compared to the one in another room we booked we booked the same type of room Having said that the normal bathroom is still spacious P s This is only a minor flaw compared to all the other good points this hotel offers , The staff were awesome Very friendly helpful and informative This was a major plus point for us so thank you to all staff at Best Western Rooms were immaculate room service team kept our two rooms tidy all throughout our stay The hotel is modern and beautiful I liked the idea of the common area in the lobby It was a very comfortable stay 
311082,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Staff very friendly and attentive Room clean and modern with a very comfortable bed and large bathroom Possibility to leave the luggage free of charge in a storage room and the hotel is 15 mins away by train from the airport Bonus Nespresso machine in the room 
311083,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Check in out was fully self serve while it was not a bad thing makes things faster it feels a little impersonal Also if you don t pay attention to the receipt that prints out at check in you probably would not know that you have to insert the key card in a slot by the door for the lights to work , Great location outside of the city center Hotel itself was nice and clean and fairly quiet Line 2 tram arrives every 5 minutes or so and takes about 25 minutes to get to the Centrum Easy to get to from airport by tram 2 and transfer to bus line 69 less walking schlepping luggage than taking the train 
311084,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hotel situated in some new district of Amsterdam and is only accessible by tram 2 or metro which is 700 800 metres far which ends its job approximately after 00 30 Walking to center can be approached but still it will take more than 1 hour , Hotel is very nice clean and modern with the large smart tv in room and fast wifi which was also accessible from tram station during the waiting for the tram itself Room and all the facilities are super staff was very helpful 
311085,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Only one thing I noticed was that the toilets in reception was not very clean but apart from that everything was excellent , Alll staff were very helpful on arrival and throughout our stay The rooms were beautifully presented and good in size Love me the bathrooms Decor is very modern breakfast buffet it a plus for the hotel and every morning has lots to choose from I liked every moment staying the best western couture and will decently book again if I was to come back to Amsterdam 
311086,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit to far out Sometimes long journey on tram if you hit it wrong It would be nice if it had a bar Breakfast first morning was cold The next two days were hot , We had the comfort room very good
311087,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing , Modern clean and comfortable Hotel with all the little luxuries of a 5 star Good location small drive from Airport and Tram Stop right outside so easy to get into Central Amsterdam 
311088,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s out of the center in a quite area not much around but with 20min you are in the city centre, the stop of tram line 2 it s just in front of the hotel Staff super helpful nespresso machine in the room 
311089,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The restaraunt did not have enough staff to accommodate the clients and turned us away as they would be slow , It was quiet and transportation to town was excellent 
311090,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The reception staff is polite but it could be friendlier would be nice to see a smile sometimes Apart from that there s really no complaint to be made , The area is quiet but the tram n 2 stops just in front of the hotel and takes you to the city centre in less than 15 minutes bonus point it will take you next to all the main attractions It s also pretty easy to get there from and to the airport train metro The room was very clean and tidy with all that you need including hair drier slippers and ironing board I particularly enjoyed the possibility to select from inside the room if we wanted it to be made up or we were resting I also appreciated the smart TV and the good wi fi I d recommend it even for a business trip We had the possibility to store our luggage for free after the check out Note this is a smoking and alcohol free hotel 
311091,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I very recommend this hotel for me it is high class hotel It is beautiful big comfort and you can enjoy a free cafe Nespresso in the room Bed is super comfortable Very clean rooms and I appreciated calm room and location Specially in Amsterdam it could be noisy during the night in the centre you appreciate a calm location of this hotel really Near are two big supermarkets On the end there is easy connection from airport 
311092,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast could be better with wider variety or at least a couple dishes that change Otherwise it becomes too monotonous if you stay for more than a couple days, View was great from my room also quick check in and check out kiosks easy tram access to the dam Also a great coffee maker in the room that Brew your morning late night express 
311093,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We paid to check out later and was constantly interuptted in that time by cleaners and also reception locking the room , I liked the extra touches put in place ie nespresso machine in the room
311094,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Staffs are very nice and helpful Hotel is clean and modern Underground parking is safe It is a bit far from the city center but it was fine if you have a car 
311095,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The bathroom had a floor heater suitable during cold days We got a room on the hook so it was perfect It was fully self check in Shortened the line You can take the tram 2 directly to the Amsterdam city passing Rijksmuseum to Dam Centraal it was right in front of the hotel The hotel environment was very quiet yet peaceful we really had a great experience with this hotel Definitely will stay at this hotel again 
311096,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing boutique about it but not necessarily a negative for us Obviously you don t get to be right on the canals but it s a small price to pay , Tram stop literally next to the hotel 10 minutes to the museums buy a couple day transit pass right at the hotel and save yourself hundreds by not booking in the museum district Excellent amenities including Nespresso machine in the room A short walk will take you into a neighborhood with shops and plenty of restaurants 
311097,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I knew the hotel location is not in the city center but the tram stop is just few steps away the hotel area is very beautiful and calm the rooms were nice and clean nice hotel design

311100,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There is no refrigerator in the room and no bar in the hotel not that it bothered us too much we do like a minibar fridge you can put your own beer in , The room is large and very comfortable The trams are just out the front making it easy to get around Love the way you self service check in 
311101,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The safe in our room didn t work Hotel staff were not able to fix it yet did not give us another room Our bed only had a duvet both days No top sheet between us and duvet , Close to groceries and great tram line 2 to get to main tourist attractions 
311102,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It claims to have a minibar but there was no alcohol in the hotel at all bit of a shame as it gives you the option to hit alcohol but is none and it stopped working for us thats really the only thing was wrong with the place ,No Positive
311103,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the bed despite the fact that I ve mentioned when booking the room that we want a matrimonial it was a twin one We have requested to change it but the woman from the reception said that it s not possible at the moment because they don t have any other available no fridge in the room, the hotel was located near the train station and only 1 stop from the airport the bathroom was big and with all facilities good wifi connection
311104,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Did not like the automatic check in system lots of people were having problems but the reception is understaffed and it took ages to check in Breakfast was bad and the rooms were stuffy and hot All in all very bad value for money , Close to tram that goes straight into center 
311105,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I would have liked complimentary bottles of water in my room for the coffee machine everyday not just the day of arrival , The complementary fruit was an added bonus 
311106,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff was generally helpful but some appear standoff ish , Tasteful decor modern amenities and clean rooms toilets Direct tram to points of interest stop right in front of the hotel 25mins to the city 
311107,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Of note is that parking will run you an additional 15 euros per twenty four hour period so plan around that I m not sure why I had this curious impression that parking would be complimentary it isn t , A plush clean outfit with all the trappings one might expect from a hotel of precisely this calibre I found it quite worthwhile for the price I paid The photos attached to this listing are very accurate and paint a perfect picture of what to expect for the nights Of especial note is that the restaurant downstairs was at least when I stayed in May 2017 staffed by at least one very capable chef I went in expecting standard hotel fare but the food I had was startlingly robust and warrants praise I think it s making me a little hungry even now P S I was also assisted by a very cheerful courteous and originally Indonesian member of staff from whom I forgot to ask a name but I felt his work ethic deserved a little vocal acclaim so I ll mention it here in post script 
311108,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It takes about 15 25 min until the centrum but still it was a nice ride by the tram , Very nice clean room Easy to find by car Tram before the door Was a great stay 
311109,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We were not greated well at the check in the reception lady was neither friendly nor helpful that was a bit disappointing, The property was clean modern and very comfortable excellent breakfast and very close to the centre just a short tram ride
311110,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hotel a bit far from central Amsterdam 30 minutes trolley ride that can be crowded , This hotel met our need for a triple room traveling with our adult daughter Clean size good along with bathroom size Easy check in and check out Quiet Close to trolley 
311111,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, All equipments brand new Big size and confort apartment Efficient and polite staff With tram 2 is very easy to reach the main atractions Very good restaurant inside 
311112,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They needed more silverware and plates for the busy breakfast crowd Not sure if they hadn t hired enough help yet or if they just needed more inventory Still great though , perfect location away from all the hustle and bustle of downtown but with the 2 tram right outside the front door great breakfast and everyone was very helpful and nice clean and nice beds 
311113,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Indian staff who greeted us was terrible His smirky comments are not appreciated at all, Good distance from city center Area is quiet but close to station
311114,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, breakfast could be better not much options coffee is terrible, really handy to get to tram to town 15 min walking to train goes to airport but taxi is only 16 with tesla through booking com
311115,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location way out of the city however the tram stop right at the front of the hotel , New and modern property friendly staff close to public transport and airport 
311116,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Alcohol free hotel was a surprise , Self service check in was very easy Staff lovely and friendly Breakfast excellent and plentiful Convenient for tram stop which runs every 7 minutes into the centre of Amsterdam
311117,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t appear to be much to do in the local area, Tram stop right outside hotel great for commuting into Central Amsterdam Self service check in and out made it very quick and easy 
311118,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not all but one of the receptionists was quite rude which I did not note her name unfortunately When you are asked questions politely I do not think that it is nice to give very cold and judgmental feedbacks to your customers Plus eye contact and smiling does not kill anyone ,No Positive
311119,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, One staff is not so professional When we are asking her for helf via self check in She is talking to someone not about working issue , Bed is not too soft shower is good There is a Nespresso machine in the room Enough tea and coffee is provided also Shower gel and lotion is provided too 
311120,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, nothing very happy with everthing , Property was excellent great value for money lovely large bedroom and bathroom with really good hair dryer iron and toiletries We managed to get an earlier checkin as well so quite accommodating Breakfast was 12 50euros which was really good a choice of hot and cold food to set you up for the day Also no charge to use computer and print off booking itinerary The hotel was about 20mins by tram from Central station but the tram was right outside the hotel and in fact it only took minutes to get to museum place and the start of all the attractions in Amsterdam Really enjoyed the location as the homes around the area and Vondelpark were magnificent so also a lovely walk into central Amsterdam Nothing too far at all and area called Cornelis Schuystraat had nice restaurants and just lovely to walk around and can enter the Vondelpark from there 
311121,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, That I only stayed two nights , The hotel was excellent Rooms had everything you need plus more The convenience of the tram outside was certainly a bonus I would definitely stay here again 
311122,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, The hotel was fabulous staff very friendly and the room was immaculate We really enjoyed our stay here we can t comment on the restaurant as we didn t eat there 
311123,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The restaurant and bar do not serve wine beer or other alcohol However the food is good The gym is very small , Nice and comfortable room with excellent bed 
311124,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We didn t know and weren t informed that the hotel didn t have a liquor license and there was nowhere local available to avoid going into the city for food and drink Albeit the hotel was wonderful and transport right outside close to other commercial buildings there was no other facilities Just a small thing we all noted and we figured out The beds are very comfy but in no time you feel sweaty This we think is due to the protective hygiene under sheets and pillow slips that prevent moisture entering the bed A great idea but ready to shower in the morning , The arrival was excellent controlled car park electronic modern book in system and internet work stations available everywhere The whole hotel was very modern inside including the room and bathroom facilities Loved the shower Staff went out of their way to be helpful 
311125,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Price a bit high as for me but it s everywhere in Amsterdam Hotel located close to the tram stop but it might take up to 40 minutes to get to the city center because of traffic If it is an issue look for a hotel near the subway No cafetieres restaurants nearby , Clean big cozy and good equipped room Very good breakfast City view Free tee and coffee machine in the room 
311126,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The pattern of the carpet is really tiresome It takes a long time to get to the city center by tram There are no coffee places restaurants close by , Room was very comfortable clean and had all necessary facilities Easy to reach from the airport Self check in lets you save time Quiet and clean neighborhood better considering this location during the summer when the center is full Tram station in front of the hotel metro station is reachable in 5 minutes walk 
311127,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Realized that the room was quite dusty One of the side chair was broken and not fixed I almost fell when sitting on it Had informed the reception but nobody came to remove the item Not only when a house keeper came to ask if my room needs cleaning that he helped me to remove the chair The safe box was not functioning well The mini fridge bar doesn t seems to work , Location is quite good with easy accessibility to public transport 
311128,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Self Check in and Check out sometimes the PCs are returning errors No alchool you cannot find a beer here i think that they don t have license for selling alchool , Tram number 2 is 50m from the Hotel so is very easy to go into the center of Amsterdam with it around 8 stops With uber around 12 The hotel looks great clean with large rooms and a very nice bethroom equiped only with villeroy and boch 
311129,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although the room and bathroom was clean above average cleaning could be improved further, Great Location rental bikes room size helpful staff perfect hotel for the money
311130,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although the room and bathroom was clean above average cleaning could be improved further, Great Location rental bikes room size helpful staff perfect hotel for the money
311131,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff not very helpful in new checking system towels could do with an upgrade , Large room with very comfortable bed great size bathroom loved the rainfall shower Good wifi plenty of breakfast options Tram stop across the road making it easy to get to the main centre about 15 20 mins away 
311132,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, As it was cold in Amsterdam during our visit we did not like the fact that the cleaning staff was leaving the AC on 21 degrees cold Unfortunately the hotel did not have a wellness center spa However those are really minor things that were not alright and cannot change our excellent overall perception for the hotel , The hotel was great Excellent value for money especially compared to other places in Amsterdam The room looked like a 5 star hotel room There was complimentary Nespresso coffee in the room which was refilled each day The shower was perfect and the bed was really comfortable We used the automated check in which was very convenient The hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful when we had questions or needed something 
311133,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t realise there wasn t a bar that served alcohol at the hotel Would have chosen somewhere else had I known A big minus when you get back after a day out and you can t sit and have a g t , Good value for money and the tram stops right outside to take you into town 
311134,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Everything was execellent nothing more I can say, Lovely hotel big rooms lovely bathrooms with underfloor heating the window opens in the rooms so it s not stuffy very good breakfast nice staff very clean the 20 min tram ride into the centre is very pleasant very very good hotel nothing to fault at all
311135,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Great room in a quite area not too far from all of the action in Amsterdam city centre If you don t mind a 20min journey into town then stay here 
311136,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The wifi needs real improvement as it is very slow Complimentary bottled water was given for the 1st day only I think it should be made available every day The coffee machine in the room was giving some problem sometimes , Location is good though a bit far from the city centre It takes almost 20 25 mins by the tram But the tram no 2 makes it convenient as the stop is just outside the hotel Room was nice but a little bit bigger room would have been better as it was a triple bedded room The other facilities were nice Front desk staff were really very helpful There are 2 3 supermarkets very close to the property about 3 to 5 mins walk from the hotel which is very convenient There are few restaurants also in the area again a short walk of 3 to 5 mins from the hotel Schiphol airport is about 15 mins by taxi 
311137,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, You should add peepholes to the doors of the rooms as this is an important security measure , Rooms are spacious and very well kept Modern bathrooms Tram access very good Close to the airport 
311138,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff at the reception desk they overcharged a friend who stayed there with me We eventually sorted out but the way the staff behaved was unacceptable , Hotel and rooms were very clean and well maintained 
311139,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, For this price breakfast should be in price at desk when you need assistance for your side is some peoples for other side only one and its take a time , Quiet clean well supplied quite big room Location is close to tram stop reaching city center take a time but connection is good 
311140,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I have travelled around the world and I am not sure if this is the case with all hotels in Amsterdam but the reception staff weren t the most welcoming bunch They didn t smile much at all I asked for a spoon to have dinner which I had bought from town centre because I couldn t find one in the room and the receptionist said we don t have any right now and the restaurant is closed Hospitality can definitely be improved Also the taxis that the hotel books on behalf of you are very expensive Its a rip off I d say They even recommend it which I thought was very unprofessional because an Uber costs half as much at times , Very nice hotel well equipped with everything one needs for a comfortable stay The hotel is located about 20 mins from central and there is a tram right outside which is very convenient and trams run very regularly For the lazy bunch best to take an Uber I would definitely recommend this place to anyone for leisure and business Laundry service was good and on time 
311141,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I d expect better breakfast for that price Overcooked eggs bad coffee poor selection of fruits Lack of drink bar at the hotel was a disappointment too , Room was spacious and clean Comfortable bed Staff friendly and helpful Close to the train station 
311142,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, AC a bit too noisy breakfast OK but it could have been better for 15 euros , Private parking available I highly recommend an upper floor room on the corner for having a pretty nice view tram station in front of the hotel 20 min to city center max coffee machine in the room 
311143,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No water juice to buy inside the room I read there is no alcohol but no water juice is strange for a 4 stars hotel The TV channels were blocking all the time 2 minutes working 2 3 minutes not and I was watching Champions League games Inside the room there is no bar you receive 1 small bottle guest but can t buy inside room another , In front of location with no 2 tram you can go in town very fast and easy from Airport you can arrive in arround 9 minutes with the Train very cheap and easy you walk like 600m till the Hotel I liked the printer and 2 PC in the reception room you can easy print your check in tickets The auto check in check out is easy too is a little strange you have little or no contact with other persons just with robots The room is clean the bad is nice the room is quiet you sleep very well The breakfast is normal nothing special 
311144,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Couldn t have asked for a more pleasant stay Location was beyond perfect tram right outside our door Bedroom were very clean spacious bed was so comfortable although we didn t spend much time in the room it is always nice to come back to comfortable relaxed space to chill out We arrived earlier than our check in time but the staff gladly took our luggage so that we could make the most of our extra few hours to sightseeing prior to check in Will definitely be coming back and will definitely be recommending this hotel to anybody who will listen to me 
311145,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No alcohol sold in hotel which was surprising We ate in Amsterdam centre which I was glad about as had we decided to eat in the hotel we would not have been able to have even a glass of wine with our meal , Clean and check in very easy 
311146,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I didn t like the fact I could not stay longer , I ve stayed here before 2015 that why I booked again The breakfast is value for money the rooms are very clean 
311147,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Almost nothing , There was not much to not like Almost everything was too good Especially the rooms They were just too comfy and had the best suitable facilities I don t think I would have wanted anything else besides what I got It was the best room I got for my stay in Europe Truly Best Western indeed 
311148,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Aircodition heating , Very good hotel Clean pretty good location It has car parking in the hotel with acceptable price in Amsterdam 15Eur per day Stuff very polite and let us pass with bycicles through the hall 
311149,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No bar to have a drink in the evening only coffee , Modern hotel very comfortable and great if you are travelling by car Park in the hotel carpark and catch the tram that stops right outside stops at the museums and city centre Very good breakfast 
311150,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Constructive shortage of the shower door water pours out In the evening of April 2 the restaurant did not work There is absolutely nowhere to have dinner , The room was clean and comfortable We asked for a room with a view of the canal not on the road view of the photo The tram is not audible the street can not be heard when the insulated glass unit is closed Ventilation is good It is convenient to get from the airport one stop on the train and 10 minutes walk Right next to the hotel there is a tram station 2 It goes to the center about 12 14 minutes Rent a bicycle at the hotel 15 euro per day Bicycles are quite new and good There was an automatic check in and a check out in the terminals it is very comfortably The staff is good The room had water capsules of coffee tea a kettle an iron and an ironing board We liked that place 
311151,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Excelent hotel modern style beautiful room excellent breakfast Location at quiet area but very comortable to get to the center because of trump number 2 in front the hotel With trump it took 10 miniutes to get to museum area and 20 minutes to get to dam area I warmly recommend this hotel to my friends
311152,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, , The room was very nice and very clean Bed very comfortable The hotel is accessible via tram 2 station in front of hotel and is 25 30 min from Central Station depends on traffic The free Wi fi works good 
311153,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Excellent staff They are very friendly polite and eager to help They are all really nice people Easy access to the tram There is a stop right in front of the hotel and with at least a 3 minute ride you can get to many places to eat breakfast lunch and dinner or go all the way to the city center Simple but nice gym It has a pull up bar dip station dumbbells up to 24kg if I recall correctly both an adjustable incline bench and a flat one and although it doesn t have a squat rack you can do a full body routine if you know what you are doing It also has treadmills if that is your thing 
311154,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was spacious and comfortable In a cold weather the toilet floor with heater is definitely a thumbs up to us Like this hotel and is out from crowded area 
311155,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Minibar dosn t work it s very hard to get a drink after 8 staff are not attentive even in emergency situations , Classy corner rooms have very nice view 
311156,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Alcoholic option Not everyone is teetotal, Hotel looked good Room was very well decorated and modern looking Bathroom excellent I hadn t read anywhere that there was no bar facilities When realising there was no bar we thought we would use the minibar in our room which happened to be a vending machine with about six options The only two alcohol options on the machine was beer and a gin and tonic mix When trying to purchase it said sold out so we contacted reception to be told there was no alcohol permitted for sale on the premises I wish I had known that before booking the holiday Disappointed is an understatement considering we are so far out from central Amsterdam Staff were friendly Tram is less than two minutes from front door of hotel and run frequently enough Overall a nice enough stay although pricey enough for what we got with no options for an alcoholic beverage at the end of the day 
311157,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I asked for three consecutive days for an extra pillow and was told by three different people that there were no pillows Not one The pillows were terrible small The mattress was very uncomfortable The blanket was small The shower door leaked on the floor I was hungry slightly after midnight and went to the front desk to order food They could not accommodate and were nice enough to order food for me from apparently the only place open The burger and the chicken nuggets I ordered for 20 euros was the worst thing I ate the entire time in Amsterdam , Water pressure in the shower was good The breakfast buffet was decent The vending machine was stocked It was reasonably close to city Centre The wifi was good 
311158,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There were two small soaps in the bathroom and two of us struggled to take shower with these for 4 days The soaps were not replenished On the last day we asked for checkout at 1300 instead of 1200 and we were asked to pay 10 per hour Normally where ever I have stayed will give complementary checkout until 1400 hours Beware of taxi from the airport we were charged 97 while the normal charge is 35 to 45 maximum We were ripped off by Netherland Don t go with anyone standing in front and asking if you need taxi , The location is excellent The tram was in front of the hotel and it took only 25 minutes to get to the city like Dam square and Central Station We purchased a 72 hour tram pass for 17 each and we used this multiple times each day for 3 days This is very economical 
311159,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing particular Just a shame that I didn t try the gym there , The hotel and the rooms are what we expected Staff were nice and cheerful Though a bit far from the city centre the GVB is just in front of the hotel and it is only 30 mins away Joanne was the one checked me in well done lady your service was excellent 
311160,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Parking is available on sit but a bit expensive at 15 a day , We drove to the hotel which was easy to find 5 minutes off the motorway and the parking on site had plenty of spaces Definitely make use of the tram station station just outside the hotel which brings you straight into to centre with no changes its much cheaper than 20 taxi each way
311161,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast ok not great but expensive No eating places in the local area , Hotel located out of city but tram very well located to travel into Amsterdam centre Also well located to travel from airport Nice room excellent bathroom comfortable good decor Clean hotel Staff friendly 
311162,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, we could not have wine with a meal or chill out at the bar and as the hotel was in a residential industreil area there was very little close by, every thing was good except no bar
311163,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Could not get minor requests fulfilled Hotel is half an hour from town Housekeeping didn t do as good a job as they could ve just the basics Not bad just a little careless Room seemed a bit worn for the cost , Hotel is located at the 2 tram stop Breakfast staff was accommodating and the food good Room was ready and upgraded upon arrival thank you Front desk lady checked us in and out nice and competent I would stay here again 
311164,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Even though it was close to the tram line it was a little inconvenient getting the tram in and out Nothing to do close to the hotel , Comfortable modern property Close to tram line and airport 
311165,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Very limited activities and shops in the area around the hotel , Tram stop was right outside and about 15 minutes into the centre Hotel was great and staff were very helpful 
311166,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, If the had some food available over night not just the vending machine, Me and my boyfriend loved the whole of the hotel everything was immaculate and the staff were so friendly and helpful 
311167,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Food Service was only available for breakfast and dinner no midday service There didn t seem to be any other food service within a block , The staff allow us to check in early prior to 2 00pm The tram to the central city was right across the street from the hotel Tram passes were available in the lobby The desk ordered a taxi to the airport and called us when the taxi arrived 
311168,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Location is quite far from city center but they have tram stop exactly infront of the hotel so quite helpfull to travelling around thr city just take tram no 2 to take you to ththe city center and museum area room quite big and comfortable They also have bike rental and helpful staff 
311169,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, AMAZING hotel Amazing room super comfortable and beautifully decorated Good wifi Nespresso machine in the room with free coffee big space Very nice view as well We knew it was not in the city centre but it is indeed very easy and fast to get there by tram Staff super nice 
311170,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We requested late check out and it wasn t passed onto the maids and someone walked in right as I got out of the shower but easy mistake they re only human,No Positive
311171,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Our main complaint is that the restaurant uses way too much salt on the food We like salt and even we are sort of blown away by the amount that the restaurant uses , We just generally like this hotel The parking is good the neighborhood and the hotel are quiet Tram 2 takes you directly to all the things we want to see or do in Amsterdam the staff are helpful we can park there even after we check out if there are a few more things we need to do before leaving Amsterdam 
311172,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We would have liked a queen bed but availability was twin put together The mattress was also not as comfortable not as soft , The room was large enough clean and comfortable Facilities like free wifi and TV channels in the room was also great Getting to the hotel from town was very convenient the metro stop is right in front of the hotel 
311173,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Entrance lobby had bar and coffee facilities but manning was limited , Good access by tram to centre Easy to get to from airport Modern In house restaurant served well cooked unpretentious food at a reasonable price 
311174,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There is nothing I dont like about this hotel whatsoever and I am far from easy to please when it comes to accommodation , Very stylish modern hotel with excellent and comfortable facilities wonderful views helpful polite staff and a frankly awesome carpet that reminds me of space invaders No problem getting more coffee pods for the room at any time and special room requests always honoured Great location right next to frequent trams right into the city centre with several supermarkets just a few minutes walk away 
311175,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, slightly out of central we expected to be closer the journey was 30mins on tram but the station was right outside the hotel which was great, the staff were lovely and great feel to the room
311176,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, This hotel was a little too far out from the city for us despite the tram stop being so close Its built in a residential area not a very pretty location Sorry we didn t like the area We also felt that the hotel lacked atmosphere and i feel that the lack of a bar no alcohol is served meant that there wasn t a buzz where people could gather and socialise We wouldn t stay here again , Excellent breakfast offering lots of choice including hot food rather than just cold continental choices Tram stop into city centre right outside the hotel Rooms were very comfortable clean and a good size The hotel is close to a Lidl and small food shop 
311177,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I couldn t get hotel Wi Fi to connect with my laptop and had to use my cellphone for a hot spot Could be my technical problem Very limited availability of restaurants You You need to go to City Center, It was great location for the purpose of my trip but if you a tourist then you need to use the train to go to City Center cause there almost nothing is around to see or dine 
311178,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Two singling beds pushed together was not really idea for me and my partner as it was easy to fall down the middle of the bed, Lovely room and hotel beds were comfy and view from the room was gorgeous
311179,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The eggs at breakfast were powdered That is terrible It disgraced the rest of the meal , I loved the room bathroom Keeping the temperature balanced was a small problem other than that everything was excellent 
311180,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, it was faultless location was 15 20 mins on tram 2 we were their of a weekend but run till early morning This didn t bother us and we rather preferred that it was not in the centre and was separate however some might not want to do the travelling but was perfect for us , This was just fantastic beautiful decor comfy bed modern bathroom stylish just amazing Lovely views Will 100 be staying here again memorable trip 
311181,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Staff very friendly and helpfull Rooms very fabulous and extra comfortable I really liked this hotel and enjoyed my stay Great views from the bedrooms 
311182,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Lovely clean room bed was large and comfy and the bathroom heated floor was nice Tram stop round outside the hotel about 15 mins to Dam Square and the metro was only a 5 minute walk down the road 
311183,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, we stayed for three nights and the staff and hotel were excellent The staff were excellent they helped us get into dam square by letting us know the correct routes etc Would totally recommend and the cherry on top was a nespresso machine in the room 
311184,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast a little pricey , Excellent location as tram stops right across the road 10 15 minutes to the centre by tram number 2 Also getting to and from the hotel to the airport was easily reachable by tram and then a bus Hotel was comfortable and clean Room was modern nicely decorated and the bathroom was lovely We felt that the breakfast was a little pricey at 12 50 Euro per person but there was a quite a good choice If we return to Amsterdam in the future we would definitely consider staying here again 
311185,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, To be very picky the wifi isn t great but that is all I can say I didn t like Great hotel , The room was a great standard nice design The location is ideal tram stop directly outside the hotel which is just 10 15 minutes into central Amsterdam 
311186,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel was further out than I would have liked but good transport links Would also have liked a bar to have a relax in after a full day out As a alchol free hotel Ididnt realise this when I booked we were not even allowed a glass of wine in our room , Beds were very comfortable
311187,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, , Very close to the tram that takes you to city very Easy to go to and from Shiphol with public transport Clean room and comfortable bed nice bathroom Not so big breakfast but still all you need

311189,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have liked a fridge to chill a bottle of wine as hotel has no bar but got some ice from a member of staff, Beds were fab slept well coffee machine a nice extra Easy to get to by public transport spotlessly clean large room lovely staff especially Linda 
311190,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the extra help in the check in for the luggage to facilitate service since it is our first time at the property, bed cleanness fruits at the reception and staff who has been very friendly

311195,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The location is great Although it is relatively far from the city center you can take the tram 2 which goes there in less then 20 minutes Moreover the Amsterdam Lelylaan train station is just 10 minutes walking from the hotel and after 7 minutes more on the train you are in Schiphol airport The neighbourhood is nice Nespresso coffee machine with complementary coffee is such a basic thing but only a few hotels really provide it Staff is perfectly hospitable and helpful The payment is much more easier then in many other hotels You just pay what you expect no deposits or anything like that 
311196,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Front desk staff that checked us in was very rude when my husband asked her to change the room as it was facing the motorway and we could hear noise She was annoyed that I used the bathroom to wash my hands We did get a change of room that was quiet but a downgrade as she said that was all available The room was dirty and dusty There was chewing gum on the duvet strange gross marks all over the wall and dirty glasses in the room We dare not complain again When we checked out we got the same member of staff who looked at me with disdain and never asked how was the stay she just took the keys This was definitely not a comfort room or a 4 star hotel Horrible The breakfast was awful too very tasteless , The shower was very good and the breakfast staff very friendly There are really nice cafes and restaurants about 10 minutes walking distance from the hotel Tram outside the hotel that takes you into the city centre 
311197,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the complimentary shampoo was pretty hopeless it didn t lather up at all , all in all a very comfortable stay this was our 2nd stay here so it must have been good

311199,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Only problem for me was there isn t any refrigerator in the room , This is one of the nicest looking hotel that I have ever booked for myself What you see in the pictures is what you will get Very clean very comfortable nice staff great facilities Loved it very much How I wish that we stayed longer 
311200,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s halfway between the City Center and the airport which means you have to leave very early and get a taxi if you have an early flight , As far as going into the City Center it was very convenient to catch the tram just steps out side the hotel Plus the hotel sells tram passes get one and handles scheduling taxis making dinner reservations etc 
311201,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No alcohol served Temperatures in room and open area is unbalanced could be uncomfortable The self check in and out doesn t function fully, Good located hotel with all needed facilities

311204,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, For those guests who would like to live in a city center this hotel is a bit far For us it was a benefit and we liked the neighbourhood, Everything was really great Nice bed cofee bathroom location for us it was cool but it s a bit far from city center Just right the corner there is a tram stop with route 2 that goes directly to the center
311205,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, it was too from Amsterdam central and for that reason i wouldn t go back it was also a little disappointing that the restaurant and room service was closed the weekend we were there so no idea what the food was like The shower was brilliant but freezing cold on the first morning , The bed was really comfy and kingsized Fresh sheets and towels everyday amazing rainfall shower i liked that the housekeeping never knocked on the door in the early morning there was the option to display electronically a do not disturb please make up the room sign on the main door from inside the room 
311206,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The coffee machine in the room does not work properly every time but that is Nescaf fault not the hotels also you do not have restaurant or coffee shops near but all that you need is offered by the hotel Fresh fruits Coffee Food So you can just take the tram and go get it easily, Great hotel Big rooms Huge bed A real 4 star with modern utilities Love the place and its location In front you have the tram station that allows you to go every where you need from the hotel Also there a lot of parking spaces if you travel by car 
311207,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bit far from the centre the Dam square is 20 minutes by tram not the nicest staff , Elegant hotel nice spacious room and comfortable beds and we could leave are suitcases there for the day after we checked out The tram stops right in front of the hotel 
311208,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A non alcoholic hotel was a bit of a let down but can t have it all I suppose Gave me a reason to drink plenty of water after the heavy nights , Property is very modern and decorated very well there is a tram right outside that takes you to all the places you need to go around Amsterdam and is so easy to get around on Staff at hotel were all very friendly food also very nice and room was amazing This hotel is awesome would come back here again and again 20 30 minutes away from major attractions and centre situated in a quiet location but didn t ever seem to far away 
311209,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bar area and service could be improved e g more on offer for evening activity , Room very comfortable Bathroom very spacious Loved the espresso machine Transport links to the city and proximity to city centre excellent 
311210,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Drafty windows No alcohol sold at hotel Mini bar not stocked No dressing gowns No gym facilities, Room was spacious and very clean Bathroom was very good size Breakfast very good with wide selection
311211,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was absolutely stunning and the staff were so friendly and the location was perfect not in the city centre but the tram right outside brings you everywhere will definitely be back so accessible and easy to find especially after getting off a flight definately avail of the tram tickets sold at reception they are so handy and save all the hustle of looking for change
311212,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not advertise it was a non alcoholic hotel and woukd prefare face to face contact on checking in, In the brochure you advertised bathrobes none in the room 
311213,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Room could be bigger At night when the wind was strong the windows made a loud buzzing noise , Decor was excellent Bed was comfortable and the room was clean 
311214,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast was too expensive no flexibility to choose on the spot if you wish to enjoy breakfast as one had to pay more if just walks in far from downtown extra cost on top of the overpriced room for parking, Room was great big and comfortable housekeeping was amazing fast and discreet
311215,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No alcohol license Breakfast 15 is a little on the expensive side , My 3rd stay this hotel Once with parents 2nd with boyfriend and this time with 2 girlfriends We had a triple room which had 3 large single beds so we were comfortable Tram stop no 12 straight to Dam Central directly outside the hotel Takes 15 20minutes 
311216,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location is convenient but not particularly attractive , Everything was fantastic The staff were polite and helpful and booked us an extra night as our flight was delayed 
311217,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s pretty far from the centre and from restaurants although very well connected by tram and metro , Room was pretty big and bathroom luxurious the coffee machine in the room is a definite plus usually coffee facilities in the room are disgusting but this is an amazing nespresso machine with great tasting coffee Very nice hotel for the price and great views from the higher floors 
311218,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hairdryer broke but did offer us a room swap Was a little far out from the center for town but was very good having a tram stop right outside , Very stylish clean rooms 
311219,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, nothing, i like everything on the hotel from the staff to cleanliness room very good service everything was great we are returning this hotel if we coming back for holiday in amsterdam 
311220,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Housekeeping didn t change my sheets There was clearly makeup on them and they made the beds with dirty sheets Considering I rejected service the first day and only received service the second day I was not happy to see this when I returned to my room The mini bar wasn t working and there was no refrigerator or microwave in the room , The pizza and breakfast was delicious The hotel was very well decorated The parking garage was nice The location was super close to public transport which was awesome 
311221,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I was so impressed with the standard of this hotel it exceeded our expectations greatly The room was beautiful and modern and the bathroom was so luxurious The cleaning staff left the room looking spotless every morning and the reception staff were more than helpful with anything we needed Great transport links with the city centre tram stopping right outside the hotel and about a 10 15min journey into the very heart of Amsterdam central really reccomend this hotel if you don t mind staying out a little from the main square but still want to experience everything
311222,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast over priced for what was on offer and hot food was cold didn t really cater for young children ie my 1 year old didn t have many food options,No Positive
311223,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The pillows wee absolutely awful both me and my partner had quit a hard time getting to sleep on them and got sore backs from them as well The restaurant looked amazing but the menu was lacking so even if we wanted to stay in the hotel for dinner we couldn t really and the breakfast was very overpriced , Loved the room it was so comfortable and spacious The coffee machine in the bedroom was an amazing bonus The bathroom was gorgeous and the refills of the toiletries every day was lovely The map the hotel provides on entry is brilliant and even though the hotel itself was outside of the main centre the tram is right outside the door and the map definitely helped with getting around 
311224,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There was nothing they didn t like about the hotel , Everything about the hotel was perfect It was my sons first trip abroad on his own with his partner and Liverpool fed everything about the hotel and would recommend it to friends and family The staff were highly professional both whilst booking it and during their stay 
311225,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The fact the tram was right outside the door was a bonus Our flight out of Amsterdam wasn t until late we were able to store our bags after checking out to explore more freely 
311226,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A little out of the way if you want to be able to step out into the city but that didn t bother us because of the tram right outside the door of the hotel , Close to tram that gets you to the heart of the city 
311227,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Absolutely loved the hotel its got everything The staff were very helpful and the room was gorgeous we had a lovely breakfast buffet in the mornings The tram stopped outside the hotel which took us into central everyday Highly recommend this hotel and will be returning
311228,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We had a lot of holes in 2 of our windows blinds which was extremely annoying because the morning light was still coming though we mentioned it at the check out and we didn t get an apology or nothing at all staff wasn t too helpful to be honest our room vending machine didn t had any products in it most of the time tried to order 3 orange juices and we ve been charged without actually getting the drinks I didn t like the staff there not helpful Not once we asked about how our stay was Checking out took 2 seconds not sure if I will come back or recommend at all , It was easy to get to the centre teams stops were right outside the hotel Hotel was really nice looking and really clean
311229,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, None at all , The room is exactly what I was hoping for whenever I booked a hotel or accommodation Very tidy and pleasant Great value for money I enjoyed our stay in this hotel and will be staying again when I get back
311230,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The light sensor for the bathroom was a little temperamental, The hotel is ideally located behind a tram stop giving easy access to the entire transport system Staff are friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable and a generous size with an enormous en suite bathroom Breakfast was great wide selection of hot and cold food very reasonably priced
311231,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Powdered cream no good for making tea , Modern facilities especially in the bathroom Extremely clean All staff who I dealt with were professional and courteous Proximity to tram stop Luggage store very useful facility 
311232,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We wanted to get room service Saturday morning for breakfast as my partner was feeling sick the girl Who answered was rude and just hung up didn t like that, Staff were very helpful and friendly and very good and English
311233,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, When we first arrived and checked in we got given a room so up we went to the room let ourselves in and there was still a gentlemen in the room in bed The staff did apologise but that should never happen not nice for myself let alone the poor guy in the room Also stayed fri sun and sheets weren t changed and rubbish wasn t taken but other than that everything else was brilliant, The hotel was stunning not too far out from Amsterdam square Staff very helpful 
311234,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, For the price we paid I would have liked to have had breakfast included not instead asked to pay more money per person each day And restaurant menu could have a bit more options they were very limited , The staff was very friendly and helpful The rooms were lovely and very clean bathroom was splendid and very luxurious Tram stop right infront of the hotel which takes 15mins to go to centre Very good hotel and location There s a LIDL and action supermarkets literally 3 mins away 
311235,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not to advertise that the hotel has lost its alcohol license was not good We planned to have a short meeting and drinks with one of our clients and couldnt , Modern and clean
311236,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Hospitality and comfort was amazing A sort young man black hair and green eyes on the reception was awesome really helpful with how to transport in Amsterd 
311237,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Fab hotel the staff were lovely and the hotel is super clean takes 15 minutes to get to the dam square but the tram stops outside the hotel looking forward to stayin there again 
311238,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location isn t amazing The Tram stop is very close just in front of the hotel however is takes a few good minutes to arrive to the city center The staff did not communicate with us at all we are used to be greeted when we enter or leave the hotel however the staff does not engage much Our room wasn t cleaned for one day not sure why and this is ok but when we called the front desk and asked for clean towels we kind of expected the housekeeping team to bring also soaps and shampoo they brought only towels And when the room was cleaned on the following day the left the empty shampoo bottles in the shower room which is not that nice, Here goes The hotel is modern room is very nice and spacious Nespresso machine and all the nice shower stuff that really gives you a good and pampering feeling Breakfast is great too 
311239,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, 3 bed room was in fact ordinary double room with added bed no additional space in comparison with double room, Great location very good price considering 4 and location quiet and comfortable Only few minutes in one tram to the Dam square 
311240,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Our double bed was made of 2 separate beds a little inconvenient and not very comfortable for a couple , Wonderful staff very nice room beautiful bathroom very clean excellent breakfast 
311241,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing for dislike Just if you like to walk around citycenter it s 20 minutes to museumplein by tram but for business trips it s best with the value of the money, Excellent hotel big reception can be relaxed or work also a bar for drink something Big markets just 2 minutes walk Tram stop is at the very front of the hotel
311242,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Almost perfect hotel but I probably wouldn t book again because they didn t serve alcohol in the restaurant or bar If you re staying for leisure it s quite far from the city centre , Very friendly and helpful staff Beds were very comfortable hotel was very clean modern and well kept Honestly couldn t find many faults 
311243,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, N A, Me and my mate appreciated the fact of how modern the hotel was and how nice our room was We also loved the fact that there was a tram stop on the door step of the hotel 
311244,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, check in out is via automated machines which make it very impersonal and more like cheap hotels On the other hand it is efficient easy and avoids having to queu So for me no problem , Located next to major traffic roads but very well insulated and rooms are quiet Modern and clean and with excellent wifi connection Good breakfast and good parking facilities Good straight connection to major places to be in downtown by tram 2 stopping right in front 
311245,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The restaurant and the hotel is unlicensed We couldn t have a drink and we needed one after a long day travelling, Rooms were were quiet and comfortable
311246,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Restaurant is closed between 11 00 18 00 room service is also closed until 15 00 some Tv channels give signal lost error very often 30 mins to the city center but the tram stop is right in front of the hotel pillows and mattress were not so comfy, Big and nice bathroom breakfast restaurant and room service is good nice and helpful staff fair price cleanliness is fine free apples at the reception were thoughtful 
311247,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Got a bad back and bad neck from the mattress and half sized pillows that we received When we asked for proper pillows we got told they didn t have any The rooms were uncomfortably cold even with the air on turned to heating And our tv safe and mini bar machine were all broken Ok hotel but not worth the money and very far out from dam centre Wouldn t book to stay here agen,No Positive
311248,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The hotel was comfortable and very clean everything we needed was provided Not that we used it but there was a fully equipped gym and games room too Convenience of the tram stop just outside the hotel was an added bonus took on average just 20 minutes to get into the center of Amsterdam Would definitely use the hotel again 
311249,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No bar room carpet seemed a bit dusty dirty In my previous stay the room was in better shape in terms of cleanliness , Staff kind good service Good location 
311250,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff ignored my requests 3 times in the end I gave up asking Hotel is quite far away from town centre Mini bar didn t work And hotel doesn t serve alcohol , Beds were very comfortable And hotel was pretty 
311251,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only thing this hotel has a no alcohol policy and although it advertises a bar they do not serve any alcoholic drinks and I feel their hotel description is quite misleading about this I would ve liked to have known this before booking this hotel and feel this fact is somewhat hidden , Overall an excellent hotel Beautifully furnished and decorated extremely clean and hotel staff were lovely Lots of things I often expect to pay for were complimentary e g in room safe use of computers and printer iron board Lots of channel choice on smart tv wifi signal was strong and the rain shower was gorgeous Hotel is a 20 minute tram journey from Dam Square the centre but there are lots of lively areas with shops bars and restaurants on the way to the centre within 10 mins of the hotel aswell The tram stop is a 20 second walk from the hotel door literally exactly opposite Trams are every 10mins at least if not more often This hotel was perfect for us in all aspects 
311252,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The hotel was just as it was described The staff were very pleasant and helpfull Great communication even before i arrived I would recommend to others and I shall be going back in the future 
311253,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We had powdered milk instead of normal pouring milk which was strange so couldn t have a cup of tea after a cold day out , The beds are double comfy Not much noise very good service and beautiful room and views 
311254,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It isn t near city center but you can catch public transport right outside of the hotel and be there in 15 minutes , This place was great It was super clean updated nicely with modern accents and facilities the room was a good size and the restaurant makes a pretty dang good steak 
311255,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The mini bar just didn t work We were not given fresh towels at any point on our 3 night stay The local restaurants were extremely poor standard Mainly though loads of other guests were smoking cannabis right outside the main entrance to the hotel which meant the stench was lingering inside the hotel at reception etc Very nasty first impression I understand the coffee shops are a huge part of tourism in Amsterdam but as far as I m aware it isn t legal to smoke cannabis in public and I was especially astonished that none of the staff at the hotel seemed bothered by the fact they reception area stunk of it , The room was very stylish Location was handy for travel to and from the city center and also Schipol 
311256,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit far out no alcahol served at hotel not many near by restaurants hotel restaursnt limited menu reception staff werent very helpful, Nice room as pictured and comfortable bed nice bathroom and clean tram stop right outside hotel Breakfast expensive but good quality of hotel restaurant food good and with good service 
311257,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Comfortable and it is in front of the tram station about 10 minutes of the centre and they sell the tram tickets inside the Hotel Very nice breakfast 
311258,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, TV channels tended to scramble , Quiet room even though the hotel seemed quite busy Lovely bed and shower Easy for the tram into central Amsterdam Staff very helpful 
311259,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not licenced to serve beer or other alcohol beverages not introduced in advance before booking Had to relay on room service due to flue while staying with great disappointment Minibar at the room out of order but still charged to the bill , Good breakfast Wifi and connection to trains 
311260,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The televisions can be a little finicky , The hotel is one tram away from the centre yet far enough away to be peaceful and quiet all through the night 
311261,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel was slightly further out of the centre of Amsterdam than I would have hoped Plus the breakfast wasn t included and thus we didn t elect to eat breakfast within the hotel , The staff were very friendly The location of the hotel was safe and quiet It was within very close proximity to the tram into central Amsterdam Also the television had great channels in English such a bonus 
311262,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Worse bed I have ever slept in My wife spent two nights sleeping on the floor before having to find a Chinese massage to help with her back pain, Staff location cleanliness all fantastic
311263,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The room could be cleaner I had a dirty towel that left on the floor as indicated and when i returned they had hanged it and din t not replace it with a clean one Also there was some dust on the furniture , Great room very confortable bed The wc is very good excellent shower with heated floor The breakfast is well worthed the 12 5 Very close to town tram stop right in front of the hotel 
311264,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Minor point but there were no diet cokes in the automated minibar but it did try to charge for 3 of them Once I pointed this out though they were removed from my bill without quibbling , The room was spacious and very comfortable The bathroom was well appointed and in particular I liked the heated mirror which prevented the mirror steaming up when I had a shower Checking in was quick and easy with the automated system Also the hotel is only 100m from the no 2 tram stop so gettting I and out of the city is really easy 
311265,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t realise how far away from city centre it was but was good to travel by tram and see the rest of the place, Staff were very helpful and we got an upgrade on arrival
311266,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I like that even thought is not in the city centre it s right across the street from a tram that takes you directly to it A very good hotel for a good price 
311267,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Really nice and helpful member of staff who told us about nearby bars and how to get to the airport Free wi fi Amazing shower Lovely clean room
311268,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s just a shame there is no alcohol available at the 1am bar and no mention of this until you re at the hotel asking for a drink , Beautiful Hotel with lovely and very comfortable rooms 
311269,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast was a bit pricey and because there s a tram literally right outside it was cheaper to just get up and go into the city for breakfast , Liked the way I didn t have to talk to anyone most of the time and the times I did they were very nice and succinct
311270,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only thing that bothered me was when asking about the availability of uber in Amsterdam one of the staff tried to make a point that the best option we had was using the taxi service that the hotel had an agreement with , The room was really big comfortable and well decorated The floor heating in the bathroom was great for the winter period The hotel per se was far from the city centre but just a couple of meters away there was a tram stop to the city center central station Good value for money coffee machine for free in the room 
311271,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Can t complain but only things that would have given 10 10 is I found the room too cool for this time of year When you set the air conditioning at a warm temperature it then automatically jumps back to cooler Room not warm enough Also for such a modern luxury hotel we would expect decent toilet roll Minor matters that would have given a perfect score , Easy check in The hotel have excellent communication with the customer They CARE about you Room spacious and excellent Rain shower an extra bonus Room cleaned daily Peaceful sleep Comfy beds Tram right outside hotel 20 mins into town I wouldn t hesitate to return here or recommend to others Looking forward to coming back here You won t be disappointed 
311272,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing special great impressions , Comfort in Amsterdam is very difficult to find Great room nice clean perfect Location is only 2 8km from Museumplain and 4 km from Central Station trum 2 is stopping next to the hotel and you can go everywhere Great value for the money i will come back for sure 
311273,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, More attention to helping guests on restaurants and places to visit Staff not trained properly to help out people who have never been to Amsterdam before They needed a full time concierge and trained well The room was spotless and very comfortable Staff were also very pleasant 
311274,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Instructions for getting to hotel There was an easier way Train airport to central station the No 2 Tram to the Hotel, Everything Staff friendly and helpful facilities superb 
311275,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Shower controls were not very intuitive and there were no instructions This might be less of a problem for a European I saw similar arrangements in other showers during my trip to Europe but they befuddled this American Wifi was pretty spotty Mattresses were too firm and the coverlet too heavy I think this may be another European American difference , Location near a tram stop lovely view of one of the canals staff helpful and friendly breakfast appearance of shower very classy 
311276,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I specific request a double bed in the room 3 months in advance because of course we are a couple and when we arrived they say that was based on availability and they told me that was possible to change from the next day before 12 o clock What was strange is that the day after we woke up very late so we asked to change for the next day and they told me yes it is possible just we had to show up in the reception before 12 so that s mean that they have rooms dbl bed available everyday but they just don t care about the request but they just try anyway to give you a separate bed room that s a shame I think for a 4 stars hotel, The tram station is in front of the hotel the room was perfectly clean and also the Nespresso machine in the room top up every day
311277,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not many options for food or bars close by but if you walk about 10 15 mins or get the tram you can find something , Very modern secure car park attached to hotel for reasonable cost 
311278,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location would have been better if it was closer to the town centre however still an excellent hotel , I liked the heated floors and the overall design of the bathroom and also the cleanliness of the facilities 
311279,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I was surprised that toothbrush and toothpaste weren t already prepared in the room from the start I asked at the reception and got handed two right away free of charge so this wasn t a problem in the end , What really stood out for me is the staff Always friendly helpful and eager to deal with any request you d might have 
311280,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Could have been a bit closer to town but that being said it took about 15 minutes on the tram so not too bad The breakfast could have been a bit cheaper It wasn t worth the money , The bed was so comfy nearly slept too much on the holiday Hotel was unbelievably clean with great facilities in the room such as coffee tea makers 
311281,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only downside to this hotel was that it doesn t serve alcohol after a long day walking around Amsterdam a beer and food would be great But the upsides overpower that so this isn t a major problem,No Positive
311282,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It would have been nice to have slightly more coffee and complimentary water in the room Note too that the entire building is non smoking and the hotel does not sell alcohol This is actually almost a bonus in my eyes but might be an issue for some travelers , I loved this hotel I was staying for a few nights around NYE and was looking for somewhere that would be close to the city but still calm and peaceful This was perfect it s right beside a tram line that goes to all the major tourist attractions but is itself in a residential neighborhood It also offers easy access to the airport which is always a bonus The room was a perfect size for two and boasts a Nespresso coffee machine comfortable beds a good sized wardrobe and a decent work space essential for those of that always have some kind of work to do I only bought breakfast twice during my stay as 15 seemed a little expensive but really it was worth it in terms of quality and choice 
311283,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Service was great Room was really clean and toilet was really really great Bed was really comfy Another big is the station that is right in front of the hotel 
311284,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s not close to the center but the tram is 10 meters away so is not a bad deal, Rooms are extremely quiet so it s perfect for a peaceful rest
311285,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, It s outside the city but there there is a tram stop right outside the door that takes you into the centre in 20 minutes It s only a short journey to Schipol airport also 10 mins Rooms were spacious modern and clean
311286,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location wasn t great we did wish that it was a little bit closer to the city center but with the tram stop right outside it wasn t the worst thing in the world , Extra friendly staff upon check in Rooms were a good size with a very large and comfy double bed English television channels were a bonus Easy access to a shop round the corner to get everything we needed 
311287,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, staff are young and cold some dust in the room, room 1103 was as I requested top floor quiet fascinatingly warm very comfortable bed one of the most complete breakfast I have ever had extra 15 EUR it is a business hotel tram 2 stop locates really just in front of the building perfect tonget to the city center in few minutes

311292,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The cofee maker in the room didn t work which was very annoying , The bed was comfortable the room was clean the staff at reception very polite and also offered to arrange wake up calls and a taxi for our return all on time 
311293,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A little further out of the main streets then we would have liked , Lovely stylish rooms Plenty of TV channels in English Breakfast was good value when ordering the night before 
311294,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The breakfast selection was disappointing and quality of food not great , Clean comfortable hotel with a bit of flair Located on tram line 2 running to Central station Supermarket around the corner The rooms are quiet and are equipped with a espresso machine 
311295,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Car parking for guests could have been a little cheaper , Rooms comfortable and clean staff friendly and helpful Breakfast good large range of food to suit all 
311296,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Everything was great no complaints , Decor was lovely and room was very clean new and modern large rooms with great facilities and lovely showers Hotel was very nice to be in with great lobby and felt social

311298,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing to dislike really Only problem was the location It s a bit too far from the city centre Took us an average of 25 30 mins to get to the centre by uber which obviously worked out a bit expensive for us You can take the tram though , Modern hotel with great interiors and fashionable fittings Loved the Nespresso machine in the room Sorted out our search for the perfect cuppa Joe in the Morning 
311299,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There were no bar facilities This was a disadvantage in the evenings , Breakfast was very good Location just beside the tram line which was very convenient 
311300,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hotel restaurant can t give you tap water for the table despite paying for an overpriced meal There s a games room which doesn t have any of the pieces no cues or balls for pool etc and is sized for children Mini bar in room which you pay for , Near the metro and tram stops Very close to supermarkets and fast food restaurants TV has channels from most European countries Coffee machine in room Free WiFi 
311301,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The tram station is just in front of the hotel and 20 min to the city center The staff was super kind and they borrow us a wheel chair for 3 days without extra charge it saved our vacations Thank you 
311302,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, More expensive than I would normally like but that s my fault for booking a holiday last minute There was also very minimal staff interaction especially as you check in out using a touchscreen system and there aren t that many staff around also you have to pay on card which was a pain seeing as we d converted extra cash to pay for the room Being said the staff we did interact with were very nice , As my partner and I normally stay in hostels this was the absolute lap of luxury The bathroom was incredible I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the rain shower every morning it was beautiful The bed was super comfy and the thermostat meant you could easily warm up cool down the room Overall it was a fab stay even if slightly more than I would ve wanted to pay Not in the centre of Dam but there s a tram stop literally right outside that takes you right to the centre and is very frequent 
311303,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, When two people are using the room they need more than three capsules for the coffee machine , The hotel fulfils our basic requirements clean quiet comfortable friendly staff and excellent local transport This was my second visit and I would happily recommend it to my friends
311304,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The location the tram stop was literally right outside the front door The staff were very helpful and very polite The quietness of the rooms and hotel in general The design of the rooms and the decoration was to a high standard Close enough to the heart of the city but far enough to be out of the noise and rush of the city when you wanted to retire and relax Not would you but definitely WILL stay here again
311305,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I would like to have had a bath in the hotel but was not to let down by this as the shower facilities were very good , I thought the location was excellent for what we were looking for also the staff very helpful on how to get around the Amsterdam centre Room was very wel kept and didn t have a problem my whole stay Also vouchers at the front desk for things to do through the day were a nice touch 
311306,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only downside was the location we didn t realise how far out of the centre the hotel was However there s a tram stop right outside and the Metro was a five minute walk away so not a problem really , The decor was great the bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel was all in all exquisite and lovely 
311307,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, 1 Overpriced rate of 100 when we booked in advance only to find out that the rate on the day of arrival was only 67 2 Overpriced breakfast for 15 3 The pillow is hard as hell not comfy at all 4 Hotel is kind of far away from main attractions ,No Positive
311308,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing to mention , Nice staff very easy check in check out conection to the city center was very good just few steps from hotel to tram station room was very luxurious and confortable Delicious coffe wich was refilled every day free of charge And Monta cleaned our room every day till perfection D thank you for everything we will definitelly come back again 
311309,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bedsheets weren t that comfortable , Tram stop was just outside Staff were friendly and helpful Building was beautiful and modern Room and bathroom was a perfect size and the decor wad excellent
311310,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room bathroom were marvellous fully equipped modern interior etc Also large garage with lots of parking spots and with enough space for most cars Perfect for everyone who travels with his car The staff is very friendly and polite and they really like to help you The only downside to the hotel is its location it is far outside the center and because there is no tram shortly after midnight you have to take the expensive taxi because driving around with your own car around Amsterdam is the horror and parking is 5 EUR per hour Since you know that before booking I won t add this to the cons 
311311,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The shower gel and shower cap have added after request by us in the reception The room service don t adding the shower gel and shower cap According to order we booked the double bed but we received the 2 beds was connected together The room is not includes the refrigerator , The staff of the Hotel are very good The room comfortable and wide The bathroom are very big comfortable and the shower are very modern nice and comfortable The room include the Nespresso coffee machine The room include iron and ironing board The mattress are soft and comfortable 
311312,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Unfortunately this hotel doesn t serve alcohol Being a young couple of brits this shocked us and was a bit of a deal breaker really but other than that facilities were good apart from the fact our coffee machine in the room didn t work which wasn t a huge issue as neither of us are really big coffee drinkers and I m sure if we requested it to be replaced it would have been as the staff were very helpful , Nicely located right next to a tram stop that is about a 20 minute ride into the centre really easy to get around and the staff at the hotel were more than happy to help in navigation Bathroom was lovely really modern and very clean the bed was comfortable and we slept well both nights with very limited noise considering it s located next to a main road 
311313,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only thing is that is not so close to the center it takes about 25 minutes to arrive to the central station with the tram and even though there s a tram stop right in front of the hotel unfortunately it only stops one line and we were unfortunate enough to almost miss one of our atractions because the tram was in delay happened to us more than 2 times , Everything was still good as new and the cleaning was very good Nice breakfast 
311314,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I loved everything I have no complaints , The room was lovely the beds where extremely conftable and it was really easy to find from shipol airport easy location I will be back already planning to come back on Feb 
311315,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No alcohol in the Hotel , Excellent room modern clean bright and spacious Good bathroom with walk in shower hairdryer and free toiletries Flatscreen TV with BBC news channel Free water bottles on arrival Staff helpful as regards dining and tram into City Centre 
311316,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, When you first arrive you can t really make sense if the area i e is it residential or business It s not city centre but that s not a bad thing as it s so quiet , Beds so comfortable room so quiet I had 3 of the best nights sleep out of the 3 nights spent there Great coffee machine lots of cupboard wardrobe space to spread out in Bathroom modern well equipped We hired bikes from the hotel cycled into town like the locals do It s an hours walk but just a 15min cycle Close to the fab Vondel Park Would definitely stay here again 
311317,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There was a blond lady working who appeared not to be happy to work okey not everyone loves to work but she wasn t that nice and I went to her for several times and all of that times she seemed to be in a bad mood Furthermore al the staff good job In general we had a really good stay at this hotel , The locaties of the hotel is fair enough regarding the rates Tram stop in front of the hotel is definitely a plus Also the room is really comfortable with a really nice shower and looks really cosy Most of the staff were really kind and nice Also the system in the room for do not disturb and clean my room is really nice The minibar in the room never saw it like this but really easy and good to use But didn t noticed enough space if you bought some stuff to keep it cool Breakfast is ok not special but fine 
311318,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing not to like , Absolutely stunning hotel Metro link just outside the door excellent secure parking The staff could not be more helpful Fantastic rooms and great choice for breakfast 
311319,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, We loved this hotel we felt it is our home great view very clean nice design comfortable beds spacious relatively to Europe hotels each room is equipped with Nesspresso machine and tea sellection the tram stop is just infront of the hotel s door and you could buy the transportation ticket from the front desk It is only 10 minutes by tram from the museum zone and very close to the airport
311320,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Almost nothing to dislike Perhaps a slightly expanded room service menu but even this is grasping for things to critique , Super clean fantastically comfortable beds and a great shower Breakfast was fantastic and very fresh as well Staff were super efficient and friendly and the facilities had everything one might need 
311321,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Being asked to pay for my total stay before I stayed at reception at check in I asked why to be told that the check out queue is usually very high so it is Hotel Policy to charge on arrival I came down at 12 Noon to check out to see this huge queue and was welcomed to a cold empty reception hall with no guests Being chased around the Breakfast hall by a waitress waving a bill for me to sign for the 15 euro breakfast I gave my name and room number at arrival Breakfast was offered at 12 if you book on the day of arrival A sore punishment for not knowing concrete plans on arrival The cleanliness of the room was very poor The Bathroom was not made up after me asking for it to be via the button on the wall My tea cup was simply rinsed in the bathroom with water and placed back into a dirty saucer that was forgotten I got into bed to find a mist of dust lurking all around me thanks to the light above the bed showing up all the dust It made me feel uneasy to sleep that night knowing i was breathing it all in The design of the room is really nice however was let down by the carpets not being hoovered bedding not changed bed simply made not changed and wash area s left dirty with water marks still left on the mirror from the morning before What is Room Cleaning Petty policies from the Hotel made me feel unwelcome as a guest and treated like a criminal for booking to stay at this not so cheap hotel I could have chose a chosen hotel to town for a fraction of the price here but I wanted a nice hotel where I could get some peace Having given my credit card on arrival I did not expect to be treated like this and also did not see any other guests paying in advance for their stay on arrival , The Bed was comfortable 
311322,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t have a pool lol, Room was lovely beds were comfy and the shower was real good As a bonus tram was right outside to get straight to the town centre 
311323,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Absolutely nothing , Arrived early after a long flight ad was checked in immediately it was such a relief to be abel to freshen up after a long flight I was so happy

311325,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and service oriented Our room was spacious the coffee machine was great and I wish we could take the shower home with us 
311326,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Ladies at the front desk could have been a bit more friendly , Great value for money with easy access to the city centre by tram Enjoyed food from the restaurant too 
311327,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, How far we had to travel to the train stop then realised tram was right outside and their wasn t a lot of information on the travel cards and tickets also maos in the city centre Did get lost a few times but asked the friendly locals to guide us in the right direction , Lovely bed
311328,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast is not included in the price You have to pay extra 15 euro per person , I loved the view from the window The room was very clean and you have the ability to enjoy a nice hot coffee Comfortable bed amazing bathroom and nice decoration 
311329,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff was not courteous If you want some info regarding the town they get a lil irritated Parking was expensive There are some public parkings around the area u can check the price there also Don t serve food after 10 pm and all other restaurant nearby close by 9 10 , Overall facilities of the hotel were good The tram station is just outside station and 20 25 min ride to city center Quiet and nice neighbourhood Clean bathroom and rooms are very comfortable 
311330,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, When we arrived at the hotel our shower was broken although it did get fixed the next day The next day of our stay while we were out our hotel room hadn t been cleaned or provided us with clean towels I was upset by this as i was really looking forward to our stay or even future stays at this hotel , I liked the design of this hotel I felt it was really modern 
311331,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not much around the vicinity of the hotel As this was only an overnight stay we did not have much time to look , Excellent location tram outside to get into the city The hotel even sold the tram tickets The staff were so good and let us park the car for up to 24 hours while we went back into Amsterdam Will really look into going back to this hotel 
311332,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I booked this hotel weeks ago but there are cheaper prices when I checked in it is very disappointing, location was good tram 2 is in front of the hotel and you can go to city center in 25 mins the staff is very friendly 
311333,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t try breakfast found it expensive 15 Euros per person , Great desing everything new Spacious room Huge bed Free nespresso in room Very conforable and pleasant lobby Tram just outside the hotel going straight to the city centre 20 mins passing outside the museums and Vondelpark Could book tram tickets and others at the reception Very close to airport there is also airport shuttle very convenient Free strong wi fi

311335,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Very friendly staff great breakfast choice and tram stop just outside hotel for travelling into centre of Amsterdam Rooms made up and cleaned every day while we were out 
311336,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It is a little outside the city center but the public transport is really good and stops right outside the hotel , The room was really nice Good bathroom with a big nice shower And last but not least a very comfortable bed
311337,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, it was too cold in the room they left all the windows open and set the AC to 20 degrees not able to set the temperature to higher degrees as they told us its too hot outside no alcohol in the hotel bar, tram stop right in front of hotel 15mins to the city centre good breakfast nice rooms great beds
311338,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The carpet was a bit retro for my taste and did not match the rest of the hotel furnishings , Shower and bathroom was lovely and hotel was generally clean and tidy Much nicer inside than on the outside Conviniently located next to frequent tram stop Would stay again 
311339,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Shower head was broken Tv stopped working after our 2nd night it had shut it self off and would not turn on again , Great customer service lovely hotel Staff where every helpful 
311340,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Location good as the tram to get into town is right outside the hotel and parking the car in the hotel car park was a plus Very good breakfast and the staff is most pleasant and helpful Comfortable and spacious room 
311341,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Restaurant No possibility to order alcoholic drinks Burger was good Grilled chicken was not what I expected But overall good Minibar in room didn t work didn t connect to server , It feels like it s brand new Everything is really clean luxurious etc You have everything in the room
311342,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast was not included The heating was difficult to figure out with no instructions in the room No way to refrigerate necessities , The personnel were extremely helpful and friendly The beds were comfortable Easy access to museums by tram 
311343,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel could be closer to the city center A free or cheaper breakfast option would be good , The tram station is exactly in front of the door Single tram is enough to reach to the city center We checked in via a computer and made the payment with no need of staff The room bathroom is outstanding I want that bathroom design in my apartment too 
311344,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nobody could help us to switch off the AC system in the room it was on all the time I am allergic to AC air and the staff members had to put scotch on the grid We had to ask for water it was not put in the room automatically , The location is very good direct tram 25 min to the central station 15 min to the museum block There is no need to pay 15 euro for breakfast as there is Lidl shop 3 min walk from the hotel where u can buy all the sandwich parts and tea and coffee you can make in your room 
311345,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Ther payment for the room in advance together with the check in The price of the breakfast but we didn t demand it , The silence at night the coffemaker in the room the good transport to the center 
311346,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No local supermarket around , The staff were excellent very helpful and friendly Hotel was modern hi tech and very clean Only a 15 minute tram 2 away from the centre and 10 minute walk from the train station 
311347,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Comfortable room with Nespresso machine qualitative and varied breakfast 15 in supplement good WiFi helpful staff and secured parking 15 per night 
311348,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The breakfast was not included in the final price 4 nights for a triple room booked at 582EUR This decision made due to the high internet price 21 5EUR per person although the price at the hotel was 15EUR At least the nespresso coffee machine in the room was a plus , Very clean and warm place Daily cleaning with new towels and rest amenities Free refill of the nespresso machine Cosy style and a great view with big windows Easy access to the airport and tram line to the center is just in front of the hotel 
311349,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The price for breakfast was a little high in my opinion for residents of the hotel , The hotel was very clean and stylish Very comfortable bed and an overall great location for transport links into the city center 
311350,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Expensive breakfast It takes 25minutes to get to the town centre but we knew that when we made the reservation, Accomodation was above expected We were amazed by how everything was clean Tram station a few steps from the hotel 
311351,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, When I ordered a taxi from reception they didn t order someone trusted so the taxi driver thought I was a tourist I used to live there and took 45 minutes to get to my destination which was 6 4km from my hotel If one asks a hotel to book transport one expects a reliable driver I would have got there quicker by bus The staff were so professional they came across and unfriendly No warm welcome or chat just wanted their money and to dispense a ket upon arrival even though I was the only one checking in and there wasn t a queue Breakfast was overpriced The coffee machine in my room didnt work half the time and the mini bar had no alcohol I won t stay again , Clean efficient 
311352,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, TV we tried to watch BBC channel but connection was very poor and it cut off every two minutes It was rather annoying but we obviously didn t go to Amsterdam to watch TV , The bed was very comfy and we had a proper coffee machine in the room Facility of regulating the room s temperature was very good as sometimes we get very hot at night 
311353,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It is isolated so if you want an evening meal or drink in a bar you have to get a tram back into town or use the hotel , We didn t want to stay in the centre of Amsterdam and this hotel is a simple tram ride on tram No 2 Free wifi meant we could keep in touch with home and download any programmes for the evening 
311354,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The reception area and some reception staff are not very welcoming in our experience The room was nice but the television scrambled repeatedly and the maintenance guy said it was not something they could do anything about as it was a signal problem Really frustrating trying to watch a programme that keeps cutting out every minute or so literally on two nights The nespresso machine was pretty useless especially if you wanted tea Although not a problem for us the hotel does not have alcohol available which is strange for a large chain hotel and a restaurant , The stop for tram 2 is right outside the hotel gets you to centre and museums easily The breakfast was good value with a generous choice Evening meals were really tasty Room was clean and modern Good range of toiletries provided and good yo have hair dryer and iron in room 
311355,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Terrible Breakfast No Alcohol Staff Rude Not able to sell refreshments to anyone that isn t a guest at the hotel You can not have people meet you there as they refuse to sell or supply refreshments to them,No Positive
311356,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have liked a bath as well, Friendliness cleanliness comfort Great shower Loved the coffee machine So convenient having tram stop right outside 
311357,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff is not super friendly but helpful A bit far from the main sightseengs and the center however manageable direct tram stop 1 minute walk from the hotel that can get you to the center in 15 minutes , Very good comfortable quite and clean hotel with coffee machine in the room 
311358,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, there should be more shower gel and hair shampoo provided to the room we were in a double room with 2 persons but only with one bottle of each it is obviously insufficient , I like the interior design of the room classic but still with a modern touch especially the bathroom design Excellent value for money
311359,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We asked for two beds and we got one big bed divided in half What hotelin Europe doesn t sell beer or other alcohol options , Easy transportation options to downtown breakfast was great and parking was huge convenience 
311360,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not that it s an issue but a little far from town BUT the tram station is right in front of the hotel, Great hotel with all the amenities advertised Spacious rooms Very clean Really awsome hotel just outside Amsterdam Central
311361,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not a lot of nice place to eat nearby better to take the tram and pick a nice place downtown , Very nice hotel comfortable rooms with very good service Easy to get downtown with the tram that stops right in front of the hotel 
311362,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It is not licensed ie NO ALCOHOL Not mentioned when booking or in marketing notes Not many staff on duty ever , Very clean comfotable room Quiet hotel 
311363,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I think the breakfast is way over priced for what you actually get it should be included in the price of the stay like other Best Westerns I was disappointed I Spending the extra money for a not so decent meal I would have been better going to McDonald s it would have been cheaper and better , I love that the tram is right in front of the hotel It is super convenient I also like that it is very quiet and out of the hustle and bustle of town 
311364,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Just become better than the best , If you arrive in and departure from Amsterdam by plane this hotel is the wonderful place for tourists Breakfast is excellent with 100 orange juice The check in can be 100 automatically The decoration of the room is perfect The bathroom is perfect The networks is perfect There is another austrilian restaurant nearby and their grilled ribs and bitter lemon drink is 100 recommanded 
311365,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing , Great comfortable hotel out of the centre of Amsterdam Came with a free parking deal which was ideal as this was our final stop on a week long road trip around Germany And definitely beat paying 40 to park closer in To get into the city centre was only a 15 min tram ride with the tram stop handily located just outside the hotel We would definitely stay again 
311366,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the breakfast area was small and didnt have much variety for 15, Bedroom came with a coffee machine including refills of different strengths etc the tv had lots of english speaking channels and the bathroom looked fantastic especially the powerful shower 
311367,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location It s a bit far from the city center so we had to take a tram 20 min ride to get to the city center , Rooms were modern and cozy Staff were very accommodating and breakfast was good 
311368,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They were unable to sell alcohol It would have been nice to have been made aware when we checked in as I would have liked a drink with my meal , Nice clean and bright The food was good Easy tram ride to central station town 
311369,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The carpeting was rather psychedelic , Top notch service and value for money mostly Modern clean and well furnished room The bed was very comfortable B fast was great too and not expensive the metro stop right outside the hotel was a major plus 
311370,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Tram was right outside the hotel which made the commute to the city okay the hotel is a fair distance outside Public transport excellent always on time and great value for money The room in the hotel even though it was small it had everything and the bed was very comfortable 
311371,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They over charge for bike rent 15 euro per day 9 Euro for 3 hr It should be part of the hotel service or at list at market price , Good value for money Close to public transport tram 2 is in front of the hotel and the metro with the connection to the train is about 500 m 
311372,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, poorly trained cleaning staff most of the days room was not cleaned properly and adequate towels and toiletries were not kept in the room although air conditioned it was off during the night and in hot days heat was unbearable in the room the windows could not be opened too , very friendly front office staff
311373,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We paid a higher price than what we was quoted on booking com which was a pain, Great hotel and location to a tram stop which makes getting about very easy 
311374,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location was slightly out from the heart of Amsterdam but I suppose the price is reflected in this and the tram no2 that runs from right outside the hotel is fantastic Just make sure you don t overdo the nightlife and stay out too late as taxi prices are a rip off tbh Also not sure why there is no bar in the hotel seeing as it is a little bit out of the way and a couple of quiet drinks would have been nice before heading out in the eveining , Great hotel clean stylish lovely big bed and great shower in the bathroom Coffee machine in the room is a nice touch as well and a nice way to start the day

311380,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location is kind of ok close to Hoofddorpplein 50m to tram stop But tram to the city centre takes 25 30min If you go to city centre twice a day that s too much sitting in a tram No fridge in the room unlike what we though while booking Room was tidy but not super clean Bike renting was too expensive Should be less for hotel guests or even free like in many hotels at Amsterdam Staff was ok but not really friendly typical dutch There is a restaurant in the hotel but we didn t really know whether it was open or not Altogether nice new hotel but I would expect more value for the money , Lots of space in the room also storage space Nespresso machine in the room is a big plus Bathroom was really nice great rain shower Good bed

311468,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I was very happy with the accommodation no faults at all everything was brilliant, The best hotel for location treatment was first class and cleanliness was top drawer most definitely will come back again beautiful city
311469,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel it s not located in the city center but with a tram you can arrive to the city center so quickly, I d a beautiful hotel comfortable and very modern The breakfast was rich and taste 
311470,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The reception could be better They make us wait for almost 1 hour we arrived there 5 minutes before the check in time There is no mini fridge just an intern selling machine so you can t put anything inside Even if good it could be cheaper because is not right in the city center and you will be very dependent of the Tram 2 , Very comfortable and well designed The room is quite and spacious Is more like a tiny apartment We really enjoy going there is our second time 
311471,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, For around 150 per night it would ve been good to have breakfast included in the price at least The internet connection wasn t great , The room was clean and comfortable there was a coffee machine in the room which was very handy There was a bus stop right across the road making it super easy to get to central Amsterdam The breakfast buffet was also great
311472,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No wine available for meal Evening meal a little pricey Evening restaurant cold and empty, The room size The cleanliness The quality of the accommodations The helpfulness of staff The breakfast
311473,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, If you are a smoker chose another hotel It s a long trek down to the reception and the smoking area if you live on the seventh floor , Very comfortable beds slept like a baby Excellent breakfast 
311474,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I had some work to do and the desk provided with lighting for that was perfect for the task The room was very spacious I had been in 5 star hotels and this is certainly very close to that standard even when it is still a four star My friend and I thought the price was very value for money 
311475,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Very good connection to the city main attractions there is a direct tram to the museums city center and central rail station with a stop just in front of the hotel 
311476,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing The staff were fantastic There was nothing to complain about Transportation back to the Hotel after midnight is only possible via Taxi or using the Nightbus This is not too bad as Taxis are readily available The Nightbus Schedule is posted at every tramstop This is not really a negative against the hotel as they cannot help it , Clean stylish modern We did not have breakfast there Although it was not directly in the city centre there is a tramstop in front of the hotel With the S2 Tram one can reach the centre within 14mins Perhaps a little to expensive for backpackers but considering what you get the money well worth it Am planning on visiting Amsterdam again and I am planning on staying there again 
311477,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No Sauna , Hotel is well connected with public transport the best way to move in Amsterdam If you are prepared you can walk to Rijksmuseum then Vondelpark and the centrum a lot of walking but you enjoy Amsterdam streets We used the hotel Fitness to relax at our last day Good breakfast fancy and clean rooms 
311478,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Could be more hospitable for long stay guests we had 2 rooms for one week and never saw or heard from any guest relations officer no amenities or gesture to thank us Staff are all pleasant but do not connect with their guests Seems almost mechanically efficient way of doing business I booked through Booking com as I am aware of the value of booking through Booking com and was surprised that there is barely any acknowledgement for a long stay guest Perhaps a B B would have given a family more personalised treatment so will certainly choose something else next time Bed linen was excellent however towels are definitely in need of replacement very thread bare and lacking in comfort and size , Very clean well kept convenient security conscious and good staff 
311479,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have liked a mini fridge in room , Staff was friendly helpfull Room was clean Tram stop infront of hotel so it s so easy to go to Amsterdam Centre 
311480,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, very good hotel place 10 15 min with tram no 2 to the dam station in the room there are safe air condition and nespreso machine the hotel has good gym club and parking that cost 18 euro per day we get a room in the 10 floor and you can see a good view

311482,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Staff were frendily and helpful The location of the hotel was great due to the tram stop right outside and the room had lots of space and was always clean
311483,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff should describe the hotel services at check in We found out by accident about transportation passes museum tix breakfast options Dark lobby and restaurant Slow service at restaurant , If you need to have parking this is a great hotel you get private parking at a good price choose the Stay Park option and a great location 15 min away from all the must sees in Amsterdam taking Tram 2 at the front door Buy transport passes at hotel 7 5E per day and also museum tickets Room was spacious and clean Best shower ever Excellent WiFi The hotel is in one of the best areas of the city and there are restaurants nearby on the tram route Quick access to highway

311485,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Self check in meant that during our 3 night stay we never actually spoke to a member of staff , Great Location next to tram stop and only 10 mins walk from Lelylann station
311486,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff especially reception was massive disappointment All throught Amsterdam we met really nice and helpful people on train stations on the road but this hotel had the most unfriendly unhelpful staff possible , Location cleanliness nice washrooms 
311487,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, While not in the city centre the tram line 2 bang outside the hotel takes you straight to all the key city centre places without any changes required Excellent breakfast and helpful staff with comfortable clean and quiet rooms Amsterdam is a little pricey but this hotel definitely represents excellent value for money Would love to stay here again 
311488,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, More staff at busy times Games room wasn t quite as good as I imagined, Great large room Amazing shower and comfortable beds Complimentary fruit 
311489,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Nice clean rooms and good location only 20 min from city center with public transportation It was our wedding night and we got upgraded to a bigger room on the top floor free of charge 
311490,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Excellent hotel and beautiful rooms Location was good as it was between the airport and city centre I would 100 return to this hotel for our next visit to Amsterdam
311491,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, May be the restaurant should consider that we may don t have the shaver along with us , We like the automatic check in machine We also like the environment We fell free 
311492,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location is a bit away from the happening parts of Amsterdam but the tram stop being right outside mostly makes up for this , Great facilities at a great price Everything is streamlined nicely and works together well for this hotel Location is right by the tram so very easy to get everywhere 
311493,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, self check in out was cool Near to tram and railways stop 3 food store and restorants a minutes away coffee machine in the room luggage storage We had a great time Great hotel

311495,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the automatic check in and check out procedure was very complicated the system found two out of three rooms reserved although i booked all of them under my name but couldn t find my name , the rooms are spacious and very comfortable 
311496,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Had to pay for parking when stay at the hotel , The room was nice and clean The employee s we friendly and helpful Really close to the train to take into the heart of Amsterdam 
311497,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There wasn t much food within walking distance of the hotel but since we were out most of the day it wasn t a problem Pillows were too soft and small , Room was a good size and extremely clean The hotel staff were friendly and helpful in advising us about the travel pass and places to eat The tram stop is right outside the hotel tram no 2 takes you all the way to the city centre and popular tourist areas in 15 20 mins 
311498,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The staff were not that friendly There was no security anyone could just wander in They did not have a licence for alcohol so couldn t even get a small beer , The rooms were spacious clean and well equipped 
311499,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, New and modern hotel Very nice and big rooms Also was clean 10 mins driving from the airport So very good to sleep there in the first or last night of your vacation 
311500,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Two things I didn t like although minor issues 1 That a hotel representative tries to charge you in your own currency instead of the local currency in some desperate search for profits through an extremely bad exchange rate for the customer 2 That a hotel informs you that they have a special arrangement with a taxi company with a fixed rate of 35 EUR and that the taxi driver charges 46 EUR while the taxi that brought us from the airport to the hotel the night before charged 28 EUR , We do like Amsterdam and spent a very nice morning there in the Rijksmuseum area in a transfer to another destination 
311501,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It was a little bit from the city centre but the trams were easy to use nevertheless , Very comfortable and pleasant stay the rooms were very tidy and the complimentary coffee was very good They were restocked and the bed was made up whenever you needed We could go out for the day and come back to a spotless tidy room The staff were very helpful and there was free luggage keeping for how long you need it for The tram stop was also right outside the hotel which was extremely handy Would stay there again it was fantastic 
311502,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We asked for a room in the morning because we had an early morning flight the staff said that there s no room and we should wait That s fair since there s a standard check in time We sat at the lobby when we saw two families arrive and check in successfully It surprised me so I went to ask the staff for a room pointing out that the families checked in before us Only after that we immediately were offered a room It was a bit strange to be honest , Very good location by the tram station great housekeeping cute and neat room corner room is great supermarkets and stores nearby AH lidl and an Action store vending machines downstairs 
311503,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Staff could not be more helpful they all had friendly can do attitude Nespresso machine in room a big plus Although a little out of town tram stop at front and supermarket and terrific Turkish Efem eatery very close by Tram at front door going away from city takes you to a quaint village and windmill 
311504,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location but again there is a tram located just outside the hotel , Amazing hotel fully equipped room comfortable bed tram was just outside the hotel We loved it 
311505,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The cleanest and absolute best hotel I have stayed in while in Europe Very modern and a great feel Shower was awesome and the view was a nice bonus Location isn t great however if you don t mind catching a short tram into Amsterdam then this a great hotel to stay at 
311506,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel has no liquor license so you cannot get beer or wine with dinner Because there are no restaurants close by you need to time your return to the hotel based on dining , The rooms are large and comfortable The staff was friendly and helpful Although the hotel is not close to the Old Town a tram stops in front running every 10 minutes to take you where ever you need to go The breakfast is good 
311507,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Didn t like having to self check in Didn t like the surrounding area Bar area more like an afterthought and considering you would not wander outside of a night it should be better suited to keeping guests satisfied in the hotel, Room very modern and comfortable Tram access very good right outside hotel
311508,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The fact that the hotel was advertised as having a bar and minibar which they did not Also failed to clean room on one of the days, Access to public transport
311509,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They did not sell alcohol and the mini bar didn t work, The staff were very helpful the bed was very comfy fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow the breakfast was very nice 
311510,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was great Clean comfortable Communication with staff prior to our stay also very good Had hoped to get into the room earlier because of an early international flight arrival and although no promises were made I think I should have been made aware of that as it became clear that the hotel was booked up and early access to a room wasn t going to be possible Loved the great quality coffee maker and coffee Bathroom needs more hooks to hang up garments AND towels 
311511,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Tram stop directly outside frequent service 15 20 minute journey to town centre Friendly helpful staff Located in a quiet residential area with supermarkets Chinese restaurant around the corner Decor in hotel was lovely rooms have all amenities needed tea coffee making facilities iron ironing board cable tv mini bar vending machine hairdryer 
311512,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The room s windows look to the highway which means noise of the cars Therefore windows must be kept closed p, Very clean and comfortable broom All the furniture including bed are convinient The whole unit including bathroom is spacious enough Nice espresso machine s
311513,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We didn t eat in the hotel preferring to eat at other restaurants nearby , The location was perfect across the street from Tram 2 making it easy to get virtually anywhere 
311514,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not a thing , The hotel had everything we wanted and more The concierge was absolutely the best Answers all our questions We rented bikes and explored the city 
311515,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Good location the tram is right across the street and only 20 min to the center of Amsterdam very goods beds and perfect breakfast not cheap but very comfortable hotel 
311516,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location is pretty far from the city center but the train is so close it staff should alert the visitors, The room is newly renovated the furniture is luxurious with extra closets I loved it 
311517,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, On a busy main road only one treadmill in the gym and out of the way of the main city so had to get a night bus back in the evening rather than walking But we didn t mind too much and the reception staff were gave us lots of information to help us get around , One straight tram line into the city and up to central station So so easy It s out of the way of the hubbub of the city and only 10 15 minutes tram in Couldn t walk it though and I wouldn t recommend cycling in either Staff so friendly and couldn t do enough Free weights at the gym Breaky was great but smoked salmon Would be a bonus 
311518,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have been nice to have a licenced bar , The staff were excellent and very helpful whenever we needed information and assistance Spacious rooms and a very good breakfast Very handy for the tram system 
311519,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have been better if the bar had an Alcohol licence but this did not spoil the overall experience , Public transport connections worked very well Nicely appointed and located in a seemingly pleasant and quite area 
311520,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location could have been better however there is a tram stop located just across the street and with the 3 day OV kaart we had purchased made it perfectly fine No alcohol is served on the premises due to some change in government legislation , The bed was extremely comfy and the buffet breakfast was great 
311521,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, to have a frigobar in the room and that the hotel could sell beer Wine and alcoholic beverages also that there was a restaurant open for lunch, the executive room
311522,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing this is our second stay at this hotel and we love it , The staff at this hotel are very helpful kind and professional they go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable Although this hotel is not located in downtown Amsterdam we consider that a plus Tram 2 stops just outside the door and that takes you to most of the sights and directly to Central Station We usually leave our car in the hotel carpark and use public transportation super easy since you can buy your tram tickets at the front desk The beds are comfortable the rooms a good size as well as clean bathrooms Breakfast is well worth the price everything from baked beans and roasted tomatoes bacon sausage eggs assorted breads yogurt sliced meats and cheeses cereal juices fruits coffee tea and it s open until 11 00 a m A great way to start out the day 
311523,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Prices rather high Receptionist not prepared to go the extra mile Booking com did not clarify all costs, Secure car parking Clean room Good breakfast but not cheap
311524,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Everything is perfect Thank you for consider my problem and free room upgrade Staff is always smile Transportation is so easy I absolutely recommend 
311525,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, This room was exactly what travelers expect from a room It had everything you could want or need A proper coffee machine Even bathroom slippers The Tram stop outside the door was the cherry on top I will stay there again It was fantastic 
311526,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Rooms weren t ready when we arrived after travelling from uk even though we arrived after check in time and when it was ready the key card didn t work, Easy accessible car parking Easy access to tram Clean
311527,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although there was a tram stop right outside the hotel we had hoped to be closer to the city centre and attractions , The hotel room was really nice and spacious the staff were very helpful and polite 
311528,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Distance from city centre was ok for us just slightly expensive given the location Breakfast expensive It s near the motorway we were up on 10th floor and couldn t hear it but maybe for lower floors, Very friendly and helpful staff told us how to get into city centre and bike rentals Immaculate room very modern and clean Powerful shower and comfortable shower Good facilities
311529,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Liked everything , Ideal for centre of Amsterdam with tram stop outside hotel Good secure parking Large clean modern room Excellent shower Good breakfast with plenty of choice Tea coffee making facilities Good wifi Good value 
311530,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Staying again within 10 days means we enjoyed our stay Excellent staff great facilities very clean and modern property swift check in and quick check out are some of the many positives about the property Location just a bit outside the city centre but then tram number 2 stops right at the door Our luggage was stored safely for 10 days making our trip to Scandinavia and Iceland lighter Shall stay here again on our next trip 
311531,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The trams doesnt go at nights you can use the bus at nights but it follows a longer route and it s only every half an hour or sth , Cleand hotel very helpful and friendly staff it s far from the city centre but there is a tram and a bus station right in front of the hotel and it takes 20 minutes to go to the centre 
311532,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The guys in the hotel things you are a money machine Every answer turned us as a money solution Also they didn t gave us free water , The room and bed was comfortable Clean and good hotel 
311533,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, sometimes a lot of people at the reception, good location the tram line 2 stops right in front of the hotel and takes you to the city center in 15 20 minutes is also close to the airport 10 15 minutes with a taxi which costs 35 friendly helpful staff also no waiting time at the reception luckily although it was sometimes really crowded really nice spacious rooms it even has a Nespresso Machine included supermarket Lidl is only a few minutes walking distance away 5 minutes approx nice lobby and reception area luggage storage room
311534,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing much not to like but some things to note Late check out is chargeable at 10 Euros per hour after 12pm but baggage can be stored at the hotel for free No food options or convenience shops nearby Hotel breakfast option was for 15 Euros but didn t try it Neither of these were major problems , Great location next to tram stop where you can take the number 2 to central You can also catch a connecting bus 69 to and from the airport from a tram 2 stop Easy self check in Beds were comfortable room was spotlessly clean nespresso machine with complimentary capsules and tea provided plus bathroom has a rain shower 
311535,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Crap area and hotel not very cosy outside your room Hardly any restaurants worth visiting in the surrounding area you need to take the tramp outside the hotel and go into city center, Absolutely fantastic room with own coffee machine for capsuls and a great tv Bed was really good and bath room super 
311536,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We have stayed 8 nights and the breakfast was the same every morning We ve had enough of it, Good location excellent public transport to the city center excellent area around the hotel very clean and green a very good choice versus city center good breakfast
311537,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Our room door was bad because if you wanna close to outside you can t so we need to play with the handle to close it was nearby 5 10 minutes When we went to reception to tell for our problem they are disinterested , It s really nice area Green and peaceful The hotel room was really beautiful and clean 
311538,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Asked for a double bed got two adjacent singles instead Also quite pricey not to mention 15 EUR parking and 15 EUR breakfast , Clean and quiet room comfortable bed good amenities The building is well maintained with modern furnishings Automatic check in and check out at the rows of computers in the lobby was a big plus very efficient 
311539,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, If check out could have been later than 3PM which we understand is difficult Also if there was more option at breakfast than what was offered even though it was great , The staff were very helpful Breakfast was delicious and the rooms were comfortable with a great bathroom Its in a great location it was very clean and the rooms were very modern with a smart TV and coffee machine Cannot express how perfect this hotel was and how it made our stay ten times better 
311540,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Only thing was that hotel does not sell alcohol and the mini bar in the room was not stocked Some staff were more friendly then others when we checked in lady was very helpful When we collected our luggage later in the day after checking out around 17 30ish staff was moody and not very approachable , The hotel is beautiful Bed comfortable The room had everything you needed loved the shower and Nespresso Coffee Machine was a bonus The location is good as was central to where we needed to go Ziggo Dome and one tram ride right into the central part of Dam Will defo be back 
311541,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Another excellent Best Western property Located quite far from the happening areas of Amsterdam may be the only negative otherwise the rooms are very modern and well furnished Overall a very good experience

311545,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There was nothing we could have complained about , Excellent location wonderfully decorated and modern great facilities within the room and lobby extra coffee amenities for the room were never a problem and staff were very helpful and friendly The TV in the room was a smart tv which meant we could use Spotify BBC iPlayer etc tons of storage in the room both air conditioning and heating was included which was great the bed was super comfy Definitely will be coming back 
311546,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Fridge did not tell you prices of any item you may want to purchase Breakfast pricey and you can find many cafes nearby to get breakfast instead , Stayed with 2 other friends in one room with three single beds Friendly helpful staff smart tv in your room spacious room for 3 friends to fit in comfy clean beds excellent location and safe area next to tram stop so easy to travel in and out of the main areas of the city Hotel is close to schipol airport and accessible via the train from schipol airport and a 10 minute walk

311552,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although the transport links are excellent it s a few miles from the centre and there s little near the hotel apart from a business park or two Breakfast is a little pricey 25 for 2 people and the continentals can t quite do a full English Bottled water wasn t replaced daily either These are minor quibbles though The Hotel is excellent , Scrupulously clean very modern quiet rooms staff were extremely helpful and friendly Great shower and bathroom with a large and comfortable bed 25 minutes outside the centre but right next to a tram stop which are fast and cheap

311555,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, But of a journey to Amsterdam square asked one of the staff at reception how to get to Amsterdam square and he pointed us the wrong direction, Bed was really comfortable the atmosphere in the hotel was good the shower was amazing
311556,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The facilities and staff we very nice Parking in site was very easy as well It s best to just park the car and take the trams everywhere you need to go wipe there because parking can be a nightmare and ridiculously expensive Restaurant was ok 
311557,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel did not have a bar Our mini bar was not working Staff barely acknowledge you Only food available for room service was pizza We had to wait until 6pm until restaurant Considering the location is a 20 minutes tram journey to Dam central this was most inconvenient , The location wasnt too badand the bed was quite comfy
311558,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I called the receptionist for slippers after checking into the room and the initial response I got after waiting and calling back was that they are running out of stock and there was break down of delivery service so won t be able to get anything within the next few days I expressed that this sounds ridiculous as an international hotel chain then the receptionist said she would try again and the slippers were delivered afterwards Btw the food quality was poor as a hotel breakfast and that coupled with the service didn t pump me up for a start of the day , Location was good as there s a tram station right outside of the hotel so that it s easy to go to the old town

311572,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Only the lack of beer , Very comfortable room Room service was quick and efficient Restaurant was clean staff were friendly and efficient The burger from the special menu was enormous and very tasty Only drawback was the hotel was dry due to changes in the licensing laws This was in the process of being remedied during our visit Tram stop was immediately outside the hotel for a 20 25 minute ride into the centre of Amsterdam 
311573,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, We had a wish concerning the location of the room we would get and the request was granted They have very competent and friendly staff especially at the reception quite unusual that front office staff also handle the bar but only for coffee and soft drinks Very practical access from the garage into the Hotel Excellent choice at the breakfast buffet To go to town Center there is a tram station right across the road no need to use your car 
311574,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Thin tired towels in the bathroom which were disappointing for a Best Western Hotel , Excellent location for our visit to Keukenhof Park and Amsterdam Good car parking facilities and Internet connection Tram station within 3 minute walk of the hotel entrance Helpful reception staff A couple of nice restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel 
311575,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Everything else I have already e mailed booking com as we were told the hotel was 10 mins from the main centre which is completely untrue we were a 30 30 Euro cab ride each way The website said there is a hotel bar this doesn t sell alcohol The staff were miserable and most unhelpful Not a good experience at all, The rooms were clean and pleasant
311576,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, The hotel was fantastic very modern and clean The tram shop is literally straight outside the hotel entrance and you can reach the city centre within 10 15 minutes The parking was secure and well priced in comparison to other hotels in Amsterdam

311580,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We had issues with our thermostat and had called the front desk Attempts were made to fix the thermostat and we were told it was going to be reset from company that provided them This did not happened and the room was very warm Not sure why we weren t moved to another room right away or offered some sort of discount for our discomfort , The rooms were clean and the location was great Happy that the Tram was just outside the door 
311581,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The site states that the hotel has a bar but this isn t accurate as they don t have a liquor licence , This hotel is located outside the main city centre so its in a quiet location so you will enjoy an uninterrupted nights sleep The tram into town is just outside the door so it s very convenient The beds are really comfortable and the rooms were clean
311582,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The staff was very unfriendly and we were not made to feel welcome Check in and check out is from a computer While this is convenient it s not the same thing as being greeted and made to feel welcome Whenever we needed to ask a question about anything during our stay the staff was almost rude and not friendly at all We are planning a return to Amsterdam and I doubt we would stay at this hotel again due to the staff , The location of the hotel is right next to a public transportation tram stop and very convenient even though it is a little out of the main part of the city The hotel was nicely decorated and fresh looking Our room was large and bed was comfortable All amenities in the bathroom were provided lotion soap shampoo etc 
311583,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I wish they had more amenities like an indoor pool or sauna or even a play area for kids I know the hotel is more for businesses but it would be nice to have for when people travel with young kids I was also aware about them having a problem with the alcohol license therefor they couldn t serve it I wasn t a big deal but would ve been nice to unwind with a glass of wine to end the busy day we had but at the same time it s nice because they weren t any irresponsible drunks around the lobby , Staff was great very accommodating even though they seem to be low in staff They helped each other out talking about teamwork I also liked that tram2 was in front of the hotel very convenient to get to the Rijkmeseum Van Gogh and Dam Square and takes you all the way to the Centraal Station Train to from airport is also close you can take the tram and metro but it would probably take longer by waiting It is only 1 1km away if you decide to walk great quick exercise Our room was great spacious and lots of storage and natural lighting Bathroom was very nice with the rain shower shower head and the heated floors in the bathroom and soundproof were a great bonuses Breakfast wasn t the best but I got my eggs bacon sausage and cappuccino and that s all I needed to get me through the morning 
311584,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Pillows are too high A little out of town It can take 35 minutes to get to the central station even with the direct tram , Rooms are very spacious new and clean everyone loved the bathroom Close to public transport Tramway to the center is right in front of the hotel and it s a few minutes walk to the Metro stop

311587,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location and little too far from the centre However the tram stop right outside the hotel made travelling so easy, Staff were friendly and knowledgeable Great facilities and comfort
311588,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The fact they don t have a liquor license The mini bar didn t work we couldn t even chill a bottle for wine , The extra we paid for the breakfast was well worth the money 
311589,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only thing that didn t work was the TV But that s it , The bathroom was stunning the shower was amazing the whole hotel itself was beautiful It was an amazing stay the bed was super comfy The hotel is literally 30 seconds away from a tram stop The staff were friendly and very helpful This is one of the nicest hotels I ve stayed in It cones highly recommended

311597,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location was rather out of the way and there are no restaurants or bars in the neighborhood and the hotel didn t have a liquor license so I had to go afield to find a good place to eat , The room and bed were very big and the bathroom was quite nice and well appointed Breakfast was excellent and varied 
311598,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Tip for improvement we were 3 people in the room and we hated to find our towels in different places than we left them i e they were mixed every time the room was cleaned and we couldn t distinguish which one is whose , Tram no 2 stops right in front of the hotel direct connection with centre and central station Staff was very friendly and helpful answered all the questions we had about sightseeing and even bought tickets transport Keukenhof for us In the room everything was great no noise and sounds from the neighbours at all 
311599,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The city tax charge that was added on at arrival I expected this to already be included in the price paid or at least notified of the charge when booking There was only self service check in very clinical , The location was great and the bedroom was a good size and comfortable 
311600,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Good hotel and accomodation is well done can recomend the hotel location if you take the tram 2 connection to the center Walking downtown is challenging by the road or vondelpark 
311601,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Shuttle service was expensive and took too long to arrive at the airport for pickup , Room was ready when we arrived even if it was early Fruits were available free of charge Staff was helpful

311603,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Disappointed that the bar did not sell alcohol Also when I booked it it stated the hotel was 253 and when I arrived they told me it was 270 as the previous price did not include tax this resulted in me not being able to pay by card as I only had 260 in it so had to pay by cash and then go and lift the money else where, the hotel itself was lovely Very clean and rooms were great 
311604,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Parking is on the expensive side although probably relatively good value for Amsterdam They do not yet have a licence to serve alcohol A minor inconvenience but if it could be resolved it would be the perfect hotel , Very nice clean and comfortable hotel Great value for money Although a bit outside the centre travel to the old town is easy with a tram station out the front Ideal for those travelling with car as parking is available

311620,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, I thought it would be far from the center but it was not that bad The tram line in front of the Hotel goes through points of interest like Museumsplein and Leidseplein 
311621,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There was a mix up at check in We were to get two rooms and the second one that was promised was given away after we waited 4hours The excuse was they checked in via machine and it was not synced with the main check in THe day person before 3 was gracious and told us we would have room The evening person did not listen to her colleague at shift chance which gave us a sour taste right from the start , The rooms are clean and the location was perfect for transit

311638,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel is fine if you re OK with taking rather busy trams to Center everytime And it takes more than 30 minutes to reach the Central Station Add another 30 minutes for the way back that accounts for minus 1 hour of your everyday time The price is fine to compensate for that , The staff is very helpful and friendly Breakfasts are OK a bit crowded nevertheless

311675,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The hotel was extremely clean and felt like a nice and homely place to be whilst having a very modern feel Staff all spoke perfect English and were helpful with everything such as getting trains to airports and how to pay for the trams 
311676,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Where was the bar Why was there a charge for parking Having stayed last week in a BW in UK which had a bar and bar meals which was very comfortable I was more than disappointed that after a long day in Amsterdam we were not able to return to the hotel and enjoy a drink in the lounge , Generally this Best Western came up to my expectation and reliable BW standards 
311677,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They should offer a shuttle bus or car to transport guests from the hotel to the airport , Very cozy hotel and modern Staff are very friendly and they serve very good breakfast 
311678,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hmmm breakfast was the same all the time and not so big though it wasn t a big deal for me Also city centre is pretty far but if you enjoy walking that s ok, Nice hotel nice place Beautiful park nearby Very clean and it s always good to have espresso machine in your room

311682,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and informative and on arrival the self service check in was very simple to use Hotel is located 15 20 minute tram ride from Dam Square and tram stop is right outside so very easy Hotel room was on the 10th floor and was very quiet and comfortable Would stay here again if I visited Amsterdam
311683,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A little distant from central Tram journey is recommended however trams stop running at 12 15am so this means you miss out on a lot of night life unless you re willing to spend 50 plus on taxi or walk for 1 hour, View
311684,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, First night put in a room with broken window room was freezing cold and traffic was very loud One staff member told us that every room was like that however when I persisted and maintainence came up to room we were told they knew about window and it was getting fixed the next day Had to spend the first night in a freezing cold room and we re moved first thing next day From there it was perfect , Absolutely brilliant hotel and location 
311685,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, THERE IS NO LICENCE FOR ALCOHOL This wouldn t have been a problem if you didn t advertise to say there is a restaurant and BAR There is NO bar and this is deceptive advertising This meant no glass of wine with my meal , The bed was comfortable and the room was modern and clean

311691,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was perfect up to date with technology had a safe for all the valuables and very clean Enjoyed breakfast very much however thought there would be more of an option with regards to eggs e g Fried poached soft boiled egg this is me being very picky Located perfectly the tram 2 stop was just outside the hotel which gets you into the centre very easily 
311692,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Unfortunately the service provided by the reception staff was quite inexistant very poor Upon our arrival we were approached with a negative attitude , Spacious and great clean room 
311693,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the hotel seemed a little understaffed because whenever i called reception to ask for something more coffee cups etc they said they couldnt bring it to my room that i should go to reception to pick the items up , good free coffee and tea in room hair dryers in room tram stop right outside hotel it didnt take too long to get to places of interest in the city center 
311694,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Very friendly staff always looking to help you through out your stay Very convenient as the tram stop is right outside the hotel Also must add the hotel looks very good inside and out There are some corner shops a little walk away from the hotel where if needed you can buy some tobacco or drinks 
311695,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It is expensive for the value Heating was not prepared The heating needed to warm up till the morning For close to 200 EUR night this is very poor ,No Positive
311696,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although the room itself was clean the narrow portion between the bed frame and the wall was full of dust clustered together with strains of hair For respiratory allergies people like myself it is a problem I ve forgot my phone charger in the room Cleaning team said no charger was found and that was that , The room was nicely decorated and overall clean nice view Comfortable bed pillows view The noise from the highway close by was present but the isolation was pretty good so no real disturbance from that Breakfast was good A bit far out of town but I found that to be a plus as it was quieter that in city hotels and going in and from the city was quite easy on the pleasant Tram 2 line I liked the hotel and I would definitely recommend it 
311697,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not at all, It was a quiet room and the staff were very polite The location is a little bit away from the actual center of Amsterdam but was closer to the museum of Van Gogh and Amsterdam sign where everyone was making plenty of pictures I would stay there again The coffee was very good I liked the wifi No hustle at all 
311698,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Expensive breakfast, We really liked everything about this modern great hotel with clean perfect modern room Good location the hotel is about 15 20 minutes from the center by tram There is self service on check in and check out The room was equipped very well Nespresso coffee machine comfortable bed The bathroom is quite big with good shower cabin

311708,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No bar and be warned they do not serve alcohol at all at this hotel , Great location if you dont mind getting the tram Its part of the amsterdam experience 
311709,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, I feel that breakfast should be included in the booking fee or at least optional should you feel like staying in to eat breakfast or go out Although it does force you to go out to the beautiful city and indulge in the local cuisine which I did everyday as the breakfast price was rather high , The location for me was extreamly well thought out The main tram 2 is a 1 min walk from the hotel which takes you to all the places you want to be in Amsterdam The hotel has all the amendaties you require I would for sure stay there again The room was well equiped and cleaned daily The hotel also offers discounted coupons on all major tourist attractions and they do your bookings for you should you require it for certain attractions 
311710,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The carpet wasn t the most appealing it was multi coloured and off putting , The lobby was really welcoming the rooms were big and had good storage facillities and a nice bathroom 
311711,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Staff was rude I have ordered room service breakfast for two Charge 35 euro for 2 orange juice 1 mushroom omlet which my 12 years son can make much better And 4 sliced bread I don t think that s fair to pay for room service Cleanles on first night I have seen realy dirty pilow case and blanket case I have report next day to reception they say no problem Restaurant waiter was rude she was realy looks pistof from work I have never seen that much unprofessional hospitality staff , Nice and modern hotel Dissing of hotel 
311712,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Obviously since 1 year the hotel is not allowed to serve any alcohol due to some problems with the authorities Nowhere this was evident before arriving A note in the bar apologizes for the temporary inconvenience Various other guests who had been there one year ago told that this is nothing new , very friendly clean well equipped excellent breakfast 
311713,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location too far from the centre you have to time your evenings around the timetable No bar It just felt very functional , The hotel was very clean I think it is fairly new The staff were friendly and helpful They sold tram tickets at the desk which is handy 
311714,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast could be a little better but not too bad , Great location with tram stop just outside Not far to walk to lidl and restaurants Tram journey 20mins into central station Very handy Staff very helpful and friendly Rooms and bathrooms beautiful Very clean Great food also Great place Definetly be back
311715,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location wasn t great The food in the restaurant was terrible Blonde receptionist was a bit rude , The room was spacious and enjoyable to be in Beds were comfy Having our own thermostat was great for coming in from being in the cold all day Taxi service was very good 
311716,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, If I had to be really picky pillows on the bed Small pillows not the average size No alcohol bar in the hotel either Also mini fridge thing in room is empty and does not work , Stayed here for 3 nights and got a really good deal in comparison to what other hotels were charging for 3 nights Was slightly cautious but had nothing to worry about Quick check in on self service machines large room with huge bed and a spacious bathroom with a nice big shower Quiet hotel clean room everything you d expect Paid for breakfast the first morning as it was 15 each and was unsure about booking for the whole stay seemed quite experience But was pleasantly surprised Good variety of cereals pastries hot food cold meats and cheese fruit yogurts etc Also breakfast was 7 11 so didn t need to worry about getting up early 
311717,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Hotel is new and clean Leidsplein square and museum area is only 12 minutes by tram number2 and tram station is just front of hotel Night bus 758 is at your disposal after midnight which is also passing through leidsplein two times in a hour So you will not be disappointed about location of hotel 
311718,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Coffe Machine was very useful Fruits at the reception Not always was big variety but it was winter tram stop just near the door Awesome bed Very comfortable baby cot with nice linen 
311719,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, no alcohol in the hotel because of not having yet the licence so forget about a glass of wine for dinner some of the gym machines were not working the wooden furniture in the hotel looks cheap, facilites parking tram in front leads directly to the centre close to the highway food tasty even though not too much choice
311720,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We did pay quite a bit for this room as it was new years The hotel have no alcohol O none Secondly the restaurant downstairs is awful as they got no staff receptionist who made our check in was partially working there with one other guy We were seated for no joke 20 min we did not even got the menus One tallish boy was running around but clearly unaware of how things done So we just left for chinese restaurant near the hotel Another thing rooms got no nice views and it is in the middle of nowhere in regards to lets say a shop bar or a restaurant Last thing was when new years eve reception called us a hotels cab company and the guy took 3 rides into one wagon and tried to rip us off that was awful, I did like that it was good size room lovely well working bathroom
311721,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Lovely modern hotel Hotel rooms spacious and comfortable The breakfast is amazing and well worth the money Even though the hotel is out of the centre you can get tram 2 which is straight outside the hotel and take you to the centre of Amsterdam

311726,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, My first room was looking out on the freeway Heavy traffic woke me up at 4 or 5 00 am I asked for a quiet room away from traffic and rail noise which was great, the distance from downtown Amsterdam and convenience of public transportation
311727,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, We do really enjoyed our stay in your hotel The staff were really helpful The room was very nice and clean We arrived early morning and we were able to check in early without extra cost I would recommend this hotel to anyone We also used car park which is safe and locked 
311728,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing , Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for 2 nights we had an excellent stay Staff were very very helpful as when we had a problem e g finding the English programs on the TV they were very helpful and helped us find the English channels The room we stayed in was very very modern and very clean it was gorgeous we was very shocked when we seen our room for the first time on how lovely it was The coffee machine was excellent for in the mornings and there were no rush to get out of the rooms in the morning The tram stop was a stone through away from the hotel door which was absolutely perfect to get in and out of the centre of Amsterdam Take tram 2 We also bought 3 day passes for any team busses train which was 17 each which we used the majority of trams to get to each destination we wanted to get too Overall our stay was absolutely fabulous and I will 100 be booking here again nearer in the future 
311729,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Fantastic comfortable hotel excellent value for money especially compared to hotels in city centre Very easy access to city centre and to airport 
311730,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s not downtown but you have a Tram station in front of hotel that take you to any part of the city in up to 30 minutes We had some problems with the staff because of missing clothes , A modern hotel in Amsterdam situated in a calm part of the city 
311731,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, nothing at all just little far from the centre , The stay was amazing and its one of the best hotels in Amsterdam a little off from the centre but you have a very convenient tram stop right in front of the hotel which made life easier But Best Western was unexpectedly provided an awesome room with a good space and all the facilities Neat and clean plush bathrooms I would re book it in a jiffy 
311732,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, we had asked for double bed and got a twin room so had to change rooms and the second was considerably smaller Decided against breakfast as seemed bit expensive when added to cost of the room, Room was clean and bathroom good size good shower too
311733,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No alcohol at minibar No transportation after midnight Taxi costs around 25 euro from city center Breakfast is extra , Tram 2 stop near Hotel directly goes to the city center covering almost all attractions Good for Touristic visits to Amsterdam region 15 mins to airport by shuttle

311735,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The services were not typical of a 4 star hotel Apart from one or two people at the reception the rest of the staff did not seem willing to help at times and disappeared quickly when they suspected that you need to ask something , I loved the accomodation super clean and modern 
311736,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Front desk staff not nice I dreaded going to the front desk seemed like we were annoying them and did not smile or show any warmth I was there for holidays in a good mood and that really made me never want to stay there again Especially a blonde tall lady Housekeeping cleaned our room 4 7 days we were there many times we left in the AM and came back by 4 or 5pm and the room had not been done It was also quite far from anything in an area filled with office buildings We spent new year s eve at the hotel restaurant which is the same cafeteria that they use for the breakfast They did not sell alcohol the waiter was overwhelmed and after an hour after we d placed our order he came to tell us that they were out of what we had ordered The waiter was really nice so no big deal however that coupled with the mean front desk staff and the lack of daily room cleaning it was not such a pleasurable experience overall , Room was comfortable 
311737,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the windows were directed over a main motorway even though they are isolated the car noise was audible all night , we got a very good deal for our money the hotel is new and is decorated nicely it feels high quality 
311738,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It s a bit outside of the city centre but the tram stop right in front of the door makes up for it, The personnel immediately responded to our demands and did everything with a smile
311739,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, there wasn t anything we didn t like, The rooms were very very comfortable Beds very comfortable every thing provided was good Only did breakfast Christmas morning but well worth the 12 50 euros 
311740,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, This hotel currently has no alcohol licence This was not mentioned on their website , Great hotel Excellent staff Menu reasonable but over priced 
311741,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We couldn t turn the tv off dead batteries in the remote but this didn t really detract from our stay It would have been nice to be a little bit closer to the centre , The hotel was lovely clean friendly staff great decor Easy transport links straight into the city centre directly outside the hotel Also good value for money 
311742,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel rates were a bit pricey We still got a great deal , The staff was absolutely astounding Very very friendly and helpful We felt right at home The view that we had was over one of the canals and it was just beautiful Getting to the city centre was pretty easy just take the number 2 which is right across the hotel till you get to Leidsplein Dam square Rijkismusseum Transportation was a piece of cake honestly and to get to the the central station we only went there once would be 25 20 mins and it was never boring everytime we passed by places in the tram it was as if we could always find something new to see Overall it was such a comfortable stay 
311743,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Comfort rooms Restaurant serving good food Friendliness at reception on our arrival Upgrade to comfort double room when standard was not available Close to tram connection to central city 
311744,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Tv in the room would sometimes lose signal and not work at all , Tram stop nearby was a plus Room was nice and clean and spacious The bathroom was very modern big shower head I think it even had a heated floor 
311745,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, We were impressed with the design of the rooms The staff were friendly and nice and we appreciated that they spoke to each other in English in front of the guests 
311746,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The staff were not very accommodating kitchen and checking out I am allergic to specific things and was unable to eat breakfast there and they wouldn t cook anything else so we want out instead which was fine but they didn t attempt to accommodate even when the place was quiet We also noticed that the cleaner hadn t done a proper job and left plastic bags on the floor and didn t clean properly Before checking out we wanted to keep the room for an extra hour as we weren t leaving for our flight until 1pm but the staff didn t even attempt to check to see if that was possible It was just a flat out no with no apology We love Amsterdam and had a lovely time but next time we won t book here I advise you to book in dam square or somewhere closer , We arrived at the self service check in was good and the staff member present was lovely 
311747,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast pricey , A brand new hotel with really comfortable rooms and nice city views just off the city with great commuting links A 20 minute ride from the hotel to the city centre on a bicycle and a 8 minute ride to Vondelpark and Amsterdam Oud Zuid Superb breakfast and dinner service Parking available and included in the price of my tariff 
311748,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No restaurants around the area The nearest shops is abt 8 10 minutes walk , Accessibility The tram is just infront of the hotel It gets you to the shopping area and places of interest 
311749,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Great room strong shower modern and quality furnishings Good breakfast When I had a misunderstanding regarding my booking staff helped communicate with booking com to resolve the issue Free wifi was strong and convenient so we could all go online without hassle Nice touch of having full access to Int l NYTimes online Tram in front of hotel very convenient Hotel selling 24 48 72 hr transports made it even easier 
311750,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Excellent value for money this was our second visit to the hotel this year and we will continue to stay here whilst in Amsterdam Tram into the city centre stops right on the doorstep and runs through all the main points of interest in Amsterdam Tram 2 Room clean and comfortable with good WiFi connection Close to airport 
311751,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Although there are staff close by to help the hotel is self check in which surprised me given that it supposed to be a luxury hotel It wouldn t stop me from booking the hotel again though and I would definitely recommend it to others , The hotel staff were attentive and friendly and were always on hand to help My room was very spacious and always immaculately cleaned I loved having the Nespresso machine in the room What a treat If you run out of Nespresso pods just pop down to the hotel bar at any time for unlimited supplies The rain shower head was a real treat after a day of cycling and touring Very luxurious My bed was super comfy and a joy to climb into every night I didn t sample the hotel breakfast but I would recommend that you try the hotel restaurant to sample their delicious evening menu I was impressed after the first forkful and would definitely eat there again Although in a slightly quieter part of town the hotel is easy to locate tram number 2 stops right outside which also takes you right into the city centre and Heemstedestraat metro station is a 5 minute walk away you will need to change at Amsterdam Zuid for the metro to Centraal station The lovely Vondelpark is about a 10 minute tram ride away I would highly recommend renting yourself a bike It took me a brisk ride of 25 minutes to get from the hotel to the centre of town and I felt like a true Amsterdamer I stayed at the hotel in November so it was OK as I didn t need to open a window but I would mention that if you plan to stay in the summer be aware that the hotel abuts the A10 so you will hear a lot of background traffic with the window open with the windows closed the only real noise I was aware of was the occasional siren passing by 
311752,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Wifi low signal but everything else was great , Nice hotel with helpfull staff near tram station no 2 cozy rooms good food breakfast and room service wifi in room coffee machine in room Good value for money Has parking

311755,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The breakfast was poor particularly for vegetarians at 15 euros each , The bedroom and bathroom were well equipped and comfortable A short tram ride took us to the city centre 
311756,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The room was great the breakfast was good the service was good and after a 10 min walk I got on a train that took me to Schiphol in less than 15min The nespresso machine in the room was an added bonus 
311757,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Everything was ok , Big clean and light room Even hotel is far away from city center you can get by tram near hotel and you can t find new hotel in centre as this hotel 
311758,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We brought the breakfast one day and was disappointed , Absolutely loved the room bathroom and coffee machine Also four lifts in the hotel was fantastic 
311759,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location is 20 minute away from the city center but the tram is just in front of the hotel The first staff that we talked to was very cold but others were helpful , The rooms are modern and almost have everything you need 
311760,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The only negative was the twin bed in the room It was inconvenient and we would have preferred a double bed , The the facilities in the room were good The size of the room was great The tourist support at the kiosk was exceptional 
311761,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Instead of welcoming we were warned twice that we should not smoke there and then requested to pay before we even get our keys , Very nice and clean place Tram right across the street 
311762,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Good location it s not far away from Schipol airport and the city center The GVB station is just around the corner and the parking garage is spacious Very good breakfast 
311763,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Don t get stuck here late in the evening if you want any type of food drink atmosphere local life transport reason to live There is no purpose for this hotel It is a room overlooking a motorway On a rainy winter s evening looking out from your room onto the concrete barren any European city hinterland that surrounds you it is like something from an 80 s John Le Carre novel Without the intrigue ,No Positive
311764,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The hotel itself is located a short distance from the motorway network and has a tramway stop directly outside giving easy access to locations throughout Amsterdam No need to use our car during our stay Unexpected room upgrade on arrival was appreciated for its large size and standard of furnishings and facilities Hotel staff were all very courteous friendly and helpful Made for an excellent trouble free start to our holiday travels 
311765,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No balconies no room service and I would have preferred to be checked in by a receptionist instead of the self check in , Great hotel although is located outside the city it was very easy to get around as the tramp bus station is opposite the main entrance The rooms are bigger than expected modern design comfortable bed good selection of TV channels affordable mini bar big bathroom with good quality toiletries All in all a very pleasant stay

311768,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, They don t currently have an alcohol licence so it wasn t possible to have a drink with dinner It would have been useful to have a fridge in the room instead of the vending min bar , Very quiet clean and comfortable stay The 2 tram stopped right outside reception so it couldn t have been easier to travel into the centre of Amsterdam 
311769,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Awesome hotel close to the tram station Very friendly staff Breakfast is just perfect AC in the room did not work and was fixed immediately after i informed reception

311772,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The minibar didn t have any coke but still charged us for trying to take one though none came out , Big rooms very clean modern comfortable bed
311773,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The staff were superb could not do enough for you It is in a slightly quieter area 20mins by no 2 tram from train station I preferred this but others might not 
311774,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A bit far from city centre you cannot go by walk have to take tram to get to the city centre There are only twoo restaurants beside the hotel in the neer neighborhood , Comfortable room big bathroom room has nice big windows comfortable bed In every room there is a nespresso coffee machine room is tidy and new 
311775,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Did not have a licence to sell alcohol A hotel of this kind should have this facility We were unaware of this and eat out on subsequent evenings , Booking easy Staff helpful Nice place generally 
311776,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Do not trust the judgment of the personel regarding the restaurants The chinese restaurant that is close to the hotel was below medium , Very clean very quiet nice location 5 klm from the centre but with tram just outside of the hotel Also you can rent a bicycle from the hotel All personel was very helpfull 
311777,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Sadly the hotel has no bar mini bar due to licensing issues although it appears still to market itself as having one , The ambience and peacefulness Well situated for trams and proximity to Schipol 
311778,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No bad experiences , I stayed here with a friend as we both took part in the Amsterdam Marathon Superb location being two train stops away from the Olympic Stadium Would definitely stay here again

311781,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location a bit off but tram stop 2 is tourist friendly and gets you around the city efficiently Not a problem , Hotel was great Good bed nice pillows great soundproofing Loved the rain shower Nespreaso machine Staff helpful Joanne Laudy Complimentary fruits a nice warm touch Daily rations of water would seal the deal
311782,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, There is hardly and staff besides the reception desk Bad uncomfortable pillows The restaurant in the hotel has a very limited menu option It is a check in sleep and check out hotel Good for solo business travelers , Close to the Tram line 6 which takes you through major tourist locations to the Central station 
311783,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The hotel was very clean with all expected facilities the staff were pleasant and helpful at all times the hotel was far enough from the centre of Amsterdam that it was quiet at night with no disturbances but close enough that the trip was only around 10 15 mins by tram
311784,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Modern smart and clean hotel Situated away from the hustle and bustle of city centre but with a convenient tram stop directly outside for a relatively short travel into town Full choice of breakfast 
311785,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Mini bar was not working Cannot connect to server was displayed the entire week Complaints at reception didn t lead to a change Really disappointing Receptionists mood is ok but I am used to more friendly staff at 4 hotels, Breakfast is good Fresh orange juice 
311786,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The staff was very friendly and helpful The rooms were comfortable and the shower facilities were awesome after a day of touring around No complaints but hotel a distance from city central easy enough to get around by bus The hotel area was quiet and stores within a five minute walk 
311787,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel is really far from the city centre and although the tram is just outside the hotel it is a long tram journey into the city , The overall hotel is lovely 
311788,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, 25 mins away from amsterdam central but no2 tram stopped right outside hotel and dropped you at central, loved this hotel food was lovely was updated to double comfort room as my room wasn t ready for me getting to site would stay again 
311789,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Hotel very clean staff friendly and welcoming Hotel a little out of the heart of town but right on the no 2 tram route so no problem getting into livelier parts Food in the restaurant excellent An enjoyable stay and would use this hotel again 
311790,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Hotel was really nice and friendly rooms very good all the extras you could need the team right out side takes you were ever you wanted to go was nice to be away from the centre more relaxing
311791,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The 30 min tram ride to and from town which was a bit long and usually crowded The self check in offered which makes the process rather impersonal esp since the hotel guest is greeted by a row of computers Nothing beats coming face to face with a real person and being greeted by a smile This would make the Best Western truly deserving of the 4 star status that it has been accorded I also think the LED lights in the room for the TV the Do Not Disturb and Make Up the Room indicators and air conditioning were disruptive to sleep as they were reflected in the room mirror to the person sleeping on the bed , Super comfortable bed and pillows terrific breakfast lots of fresh fruit and salad cereal options cold cuts and cheeses cooked options Location right next to the tram stop is a huge plus 
311792,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, 1 Very friendly staff 2 Hotel is located 10 mins from airport 3 There s a tram stop right in front of the hotel line 2 which goes all the way to Central Station about 30 mins this is the most convenient feature 4 Very comfortable room and we had our best sleep in a week 5 Convenience shop located 2 mins away with some eateries 6 Our room was 314 facing the tram line but the room was well sound proofed that we could not hear anything from the street 7 Breakfast is standard Western fare bacon eggs fruits cheese bread juices etc 
311793,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Attitude of staff very unhelpful too far out from city centre nothing around hotel location other than a lidl Directions to hotel very poor on website, Style of hotel
311794,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, For some reason our room smelt of cigarette smoke on returning one day all a bit strange as the hotel has a no smoking policy, Easy to access from the airport and then only a 15 minute tram ride into Amsterdam
311795,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Would have been nice to have breakfast included in the rates , This hotel is located in Amsterdam West Away from the hustle and bustle of the main center yet surrounded by a peaceful area and a little canal Tram station is just outside the hotel and would take you to the center in 15 to 20 mins We discovered a great bargain store a grocery and kebab restaurant around the corner Ask the front desk for the directions The rooms are spacious beautifully designed and very comfortable Great to travel with a baby There was even a coffee machine Very nice staff who also helped us with an early check in Great experience and highly recommended 
311796,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bar has no licence to sell alcohol but this is stated at reception not a big deal though plenty to do in the city centre , Hotel away from city centre but tram just outside modern hotel and nice and clean Staff very helpful and cheerful and breakfast was lovely 
311797,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast is quite expensive and not too much choicea of cold meat or cheese , Hotel is away from the city centre but can be reached easily by team tram stop right in front of the hotel Very nice leafy surroundings Room is quite big with a very nice modern bathroom 
311798,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast is a bit pricy at 15 euros although plenty of choice and very tasty Similarly secure parking at 15 euros is a bit steep nowhere else to park either but again it was good and easy access also , This is a good hotel well sited in Amsterdam It s better than the photos show it to be and is quite tasteful although the colour schemes are unusual Rooms are excellent with everything you could need Friendly staff secure parking as well 25 30 minute walk to Rijksmuseum 2 9 euros back on tram with a station stop just 50m from hotel door 
311799,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Nothing, Good sized rooms comfy beds perfect location Only 20minutes by the number 2 tram into the city centre Overall a great stay would go back
311800,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A little far out from the city center but that in itself is a good thing quiet location , Excellent food We enjoyed our meals there Tram stop just outside the front door where we could purchase multiple day tickets Best rain shower I have ever enjoyed Just a very nice Hotel all in all 
311801,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The staff were aloof and inattentive with the exception of a lovely gentlemen who worked the evening shift , The hotel is just outside of the center of town but is next to a tram station so it s very convenient getting around 
311802,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel advertises that they have an Airport shuttle leaving every 30 minutes however the morning I checked out they informed me you have to book it in advance How are the guests supposed to know this if it is advertised differently It took me then instead of 10 minutes almost 1 5 hours to get to the airport with public transport Secondly no one is there to assist when you check in and their automatic check in system doesn t work The bar doesn t sell alcohol And the rooms do not look like it does on the booking com website ,No Positive
311803,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location was further away from city centre than we thought , Hotel was very clean staff very helpful Tram stop to central area directly in front of hotel to offset locstion 
311804,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Cleanliness We received what seemed to be used towels with various strands of hair on them We notified the reception the issue was fixed but there was no actual apology for this situation Looking at the room price this situation was rather unpleasant and unexpected as having clean towels is a basic commodity of every hotel Room Centralized heating system not working as configured sometimes heat was delivered but we were cold on multiple occasions , Location Hotel is easily accessible from airport 15 min on foot from Lelylaan train station The Tram Line 2 Delflandlaan station is right in front which goes to Central Station Room Modern look functional espresso machine in room was nice to have 
311805,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not enough staff particularly at breakfast Long wait to check in and out Some staff were not helpful , Room standard was excellent as was the range of food at breakfast

311808,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Just a little too far out of the main area Though this did not stop us from a second visit , Hotel cleanliness A great meal in the hotel restaurant 
311809,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Disappointed on arrival very impersonal checking in to a computer I was surprised that one of the windows in our room was open on arrival , Breakfast was great 
311810,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Given a key to a dirty room no offer to help with bags or even show us to the room Then had to walk back down to the lobby to be laughed at by reception and then given a second key Still no apology still no offer to help with bags Pillows extremely uncomfortable No sense of hospitality by staff , Lobby and restaurant nice and clean spacious and big ceilings 
311811,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast was a literal bun fight the food buffet runs out quickly and staff were very slow to restock food cutlery crockery etc The lift got stuck and sounded very fragile , Brand new hotel A bit out of the city but close enough and a central city tram stop right outside Many of the Amsterdam hotels I have stayed in are old and crusty so this brand new place was a welcome change Super comfy beds I will certainly stay here again next time 
311812,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Found it odd that the mirror in the bathroom got warm once the lights were turned on for awhile , Lovely comfortable beds amazing bathroom free coffee refills 
311813,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Prefer a kettle to boil than the coffee machine the coffee capsules are environmentally unfriendly , Helpful reception good room and facilities good reasonable restaurant
311814,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Only drawback was that they were unable to provide wine at dinner I think there is currently some restriction on their licence , Clean modern spacious rooms including a UK power socket Smart ensuite facilities Breakfast OK 
311815,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Actually the hotel is more for just spending the night there than spending time in the hotel The lobby is combined with the front desk and bar more like a waiting area than a comfortable nice place to drink a beer , Hotel is pretty modern the design of the rooms is nice good view on the 10th floor Nespresso machine large bathroom with rain shower Breakfast even with fresh orange juice Tram is right in front of the hotel 
311816,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, During the breakfast the staff in the dining room declines to close the door so as to facilitate her colleagues to carry the sofas in But those guests sitting near the said door including my family felt clod in the wind , Friendly staffs spacious room and the facilities Fast wifi connection 
311817,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast wasn t included in our booking and it was expensive to pay separately , The hotel was modern and provided us with everything Tram station is in front of the hotel Some of the staff were super friendly and helpful but some were not

311820,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not quite a bad experience but I noticed some of the chairs provided in the room may not be of excellent quality The reading chair I had was shaky I also noticed something like a refrigerator which I could not access , I liked the serenity of the environment The Hotel is also very need with a fantastic ambience
311821,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location is abit further than expected from dam square and there wasn t many dinner menu s so had to wait sometimes, Good friendly staff nice comfortable rooms and a really nice utilities
311822,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, the insensitive late night staff whom did not welcome when i ask a hot water for my sick wife He kept telling me to fill the water tank in the coffee machine to acquire the hot water while i have been waiting half an hour to get the machine produced it Truly disappointed Didnt see his name well but he was a skinny receptionist that work at 6 oct 2015 Please learn to be more sensitive , The room size is so big that i need a couple of turns to put my luggage inside The location is super near from tram 2 stop Provide coffee machine and 2 mineral water 
311823,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Very disappointing that the bar wasn t open as we would have liked to eat and drink in the hotel had to go elsewhere , Very good location regular tram No 2 right outside hotel to city centre about 25 minutes to Central Station with lots of interesting stops on the way Excellent breakfast
311824,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No bar I had a fall and the hotel had a totally inadequate first aid kit no plasters and no antiseptic cream , Location room cleanliness staff were helpful 
311825,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Expensive taxi from Centraal Station in peak hour Catch No 2 tram It stops right out the front Unlicensed but we had room service so it was not a problem , Modern and comfortable Amazing value for money Staff very helpful Secure luggage storage Tram stop right out the front Train to airport only 6 minutes walk Good food from the restaurant for room service 
311826,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, no drinks in mini bar tried for a few Gin and Tonics with beer and only got pringle crisps so had a bit of attitude from reception when I paid 2 euro for crisps Lol reported broken faulty towel rail in bathroom, the ease of travel into city locations comfort of the room and lovely view over the city skyline
311827,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No fridge in room No alcohol due to license issues which didn t bother us at all , Nice clean and modern rooms quite spacious compared to older city center hotels Friendly and helpful staff Tram 2 stop is just outside the hotel and stops at all major attractions Journey takes 20 25 minutes Breakfast is good and if booked on arrival costs only 12 5 per person and less for a child Nice city and park views from upper floors Free coffee machine and capsules in room 
311828,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The location is not the best Though the area is pretty nice this hotel is quite away from the city centre Breakfast was also poor particularly for the amount charged I thought the hotel and rooms were good but really expensive though most hotels in Amsterdam are expensive , Spacious clean room The hotel seems to be brand new Staff was helpful and kind 
311829,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast was very expensive and had to be booked ahead to get a discounted price There was no wiggle room on this so when our plans changed due to poor weather the hotel was not willing to offer the lower price Then on checking out the people in front of us were given 2 free breakfasts which added insult to injury , The hotel was clean and modern Though not in the center of Amsterdam it was right on the tram line so access to the sights was very easy 
311830,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel did not change the bed sheets when I check in I found hair inside bed Its look like somebody use it before when I complain in the morning after stay for two night when I come back the bed sheets and pillow cover and duvet still the old one I do remember the mark at bed sheet that staff can t argue with me when complain for the second time it is the Standard of hotel to make a new sleeping set before the new customer is check in this best western premier hotel couture are dishonest to customer I m disappointed of this chain hotel , The design are chic modern bigroom
311831,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Amazing hotel Staff always happy to help Except one lady but perhaps she was having a bad day Otherwise it was lovely The breakfast was delicious 
311832,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The location was ideal We were very close to town but not right in the middle of it Reaching the center of town was easy on the tram and there were wonderful restaurants within walking distance 
311833,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The pillows on the bed were not comfortable one too hard and one too soft and though the bed was kingsize the sheet and duvet were not , The breakfast was really good lots of choice and everything we could want The evening meals were also good The hotel was out of town and therefore quiet but the trams into town were frequent and cheap and there was a tram stop just outside the hotel 
311834,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, A C keeps blowing cool even if you turn it off and it makes a constant noise at the room , Tram stop line 2 in front of the hotel Walking distance to the Leyllaan Station so it is easily accessible from Schipol There are two supermarkets Lidl and Albert Heijn just behind the hotel 
311835,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Room 410 very low wi fi signal so very slow internet If internet is important for you don t choose this hotel So you must to know that 1 way tram ticket cost 2 90 euro it is don t free to go to center , Big room comfortable bed Reception is selling tram tickets at official tarif Friendshipful staff 
311836,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No proper milk only creamer but we re British and far too into our tea so this is more personal than a genuine flaw The breakfast was not ideal and was sometimes cold and a bit mushy but it filled a hole , The staff were amazing when I rang up to tell them I d left my sunglasses in the room They ensured they came back to me immediately which I really appreciated as they were expensive glasses The hotel has a great location with a tram stop right outside of it so it s easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam and trams are so regular The rooms have everything you could need and was well worth the money 
311837,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The new hotel has no licence to sell alcohol and fails to make that clear This is at best disingenuous Also one pair of lifts was being serviced allegedly but curiously their controls looked an older style than the others It should be made clearer that the tram ride to the city centre takes 20 minutes , Modern D cor cleanliness Comfortable room good shower
311838,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Their licence to serve alcohol had been revoked some time ago This needs to be made clear before people book , Breakfast menu was extensive and good quality 
311839,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The staff was very kind and helpful The location was excellent with a tram stop to the city centre just a few metres from the hotel doors Lovely furnishing and luxurious shower 
311840,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The sound of the traffic as my room backed onto the motorway , The coffee in the room wasn t great also could do with standard tea bags A robe would be great as I travel very light when on business 
311841,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Pillows were a little uncomfortable Also sheets and pillowcases although clean had formed combs probably because of the many times of washing and drying , Location good 15min via Tram to Amsterdam Center station right outside the hotel 
311842,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Its a bit far away from the central station but quite convenient if you take tram no 2 no need to change , Awesome hotel with very clean and comfortable room to stay Strongly recommend to friends and would stay again Love it Definitely worth of money 
311843,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Breakfast isn t cheap and is extra but very rich , Very clean everything is new expresso machine and automatically filled without request capsules Definite recommended
311844,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Hotel has no drinks licence and omits to mention this Consequently spoils the ambience especially in the restaurant which showed as we were the only people dining at the time , Excellent rooms and facilities and quiet 
311845,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Had to take a tram at 15 euro per day for two days It rained like hell the l st day There is a big screw up where booking com took over 500 and paid nothing to the hotel so we paid the hotel , Nothing 
311846,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, The experience of Amsterdam was excellent the people we meet were excellent ambassadors for their city The Tram system we found one of the best in Europe We can highly recommend the hotel
311847,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The pillows were a little too thick and too firm so we ended up with stiff necks in the morning Maybe in the future you can supply 1 firm and 1 soft pillow for each bed instead of 2 firm pillows , Everything was better than expected except for the pillows 
311848,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Shame the breakfast was so expensive and the bikes should have been more reliable, Good stylish hotel accessible for the whole of the city airport and beyond
311849,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Understaffed and consequently those on duty were stressed and couldn t always cope Currently no alcohol licence so no drinks in the restaurant and the bar was dead , Beautiful new hotel
311850,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It was far from centeral but close to airport just 23 euro, I liked that team 2 was just in front of the door a big plus although the hotel was far from the center Cleanliness was very good
311851,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, only one thing we didn t like When we came to the hotel to check in the receptionist tried to charge us 300 euro more than we booked in booking com I told her it must be a mistake and after that she checked and corrected it But all the rest was perfect and we will definitely stay again next time we come to Amsterdam, The hotel was beautiful clean the room was gorgeous and equipped with everything we could ever need The location was perfect because it was out of the central city but was not far away at all the tram was right outside the hotel so it was very convenient The staff were helpful and informative
311852,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Needed two glasses for water in room , Loved the colour scheme everywhere Brilliant wifi computers and printer available Room and bathroom excellent and breakfast fabulous Everywhere very clean and tidy 
311853,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We had dinner in the restaurant downstairs one evening The menu is limited and the food left something to be desired , The location is great The room felt quite large even with 3 people in and the hotel is very quiet 
311854,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture,No Negative, Very modern comfortable facilities Tram line runs right past the front door and very easy and convenient to get around and into the city centre Staff very pleasant and amazing value for money

311859,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, location is not the best it takes 20 30min to the center by tram if you come from the airport it really will take you some efforts to arrive we had difficulty looking for the bus when we came out of AM ZUID , self check in service is very efficient room is very clean and the color of decorations looks nice we love it 
311860,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, they still don t have the alcohol license the staff only speak English and Dutch be aware if you don t speak the same language , Modern hotel with all the facilities you may need

311863,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The temporary problems with the Liquor License meaning no mini bar or alcoholic beverages served in the Restaurant , Tram to Centraal Station stops right out front 
311864,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, We lost our flight from London to Amsterdam and I send them a message to not cancel the reservation but they already discount the night from my credit card what is faire because is on the conditions but I would like to pay in cash at wasn t impossible , The design it s great you feel at home You can make coffee and tea in your room Everything it s quite comfortable and clean And is just in front of the tram stop so you can go to the airport combining tram 2 bus 69 
311865,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Not in the prettiest of areas but fine once you know where to go Almost charged too much for 14yr old access to museum but it was sorted out in the end , Good location easy to get into town and a nice walk through the park Very comfortable and v helpful and friendly staff 
311866,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, No fridge just a vending machine in the room Tram was full always but it s not the hotel s fault , Nice quiet and comfortable room modern and clean Great air conditioning Nice breakfast Secure private parking garage directly accessible from hotel 
311867,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Check in It was a bit of an unpleasant surprise to find out that we needed to check in with help of self service check in machine kind of like many airports have now But if in airport it s a bit tolerable in the hotel it sure feels like an impersonal service So it s a minus in our book In addition noone checks the passport We wondered really about security For basically it could be anyone who checked in Hotel is situated in a quiet area which is a plus but it s a bit boring area and quite out of city center It takes around 20 minutes to come to center by tram Sleeping quality The bed is probably a dream to those who enjoy sleeping on very hard madrasses For those who like softer beds it s a nightmare One of the worst beds I ve experienced in a hotel It felt like sleping on stones And the pillow was definitely the worst It was very hard and high For me just not possible to sleep on So I slept on my sweater instead It was a big dissapointment Next day I found a bit better pillow which was well hidden I must say We adressed reception about the madrass And they replaced it with a softer one Which unfortunately was close same hard as the previous one Aircondition is also harsh for our taste It blows too much even when the ventilation is off I came home with back and neck pain and a soar throat It s a pity because hotel is really nice But comfort is not completely up to our taste , Hotel is newly renovated Very nice fresh and well cleaned Nice room and bathroom Coffee machine in the room with selection of coffee and tea 
311868,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, may scare some Restaurant license to serve alcohol was pending thus none across Hotel bring your own , Very modern clean and nice Environment we felt welcome and home there Some park nearby and busy City is just a Tram ride away Free WIFI and convenient car parking on site Good Restaurant

311870,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel didn t have it s liquor licence yet and I was not forewarned There could have been more front desk staff they were very helpful but overwhelmed with requests , Nice clean quiet hotel right on the tram route to downtown 
311871,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, It is quite isolated in a part of town which is quite desolate The bicycles are available only in 24 hour increments Such a shame since Amsterdam rides bikes and not cars 15 euros for a bike ride Come on , Very courteous welcome Renovated rooms with special couture decor 
311872,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The pillows were not comfortable at all weird square shapes that were too tall and two decorative pillows that were rough in terms of their covering but were of a better height for sleeping on I ended up with a pulled tendon in my neck , The facilities and the internet connections were great The location was good with the Tram 2 right outside the hotel

311874,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Marked it down on location which is a bit unfair because everyone knows the location before booking so it s reflected in the price A no 2 tram stops right out side depending on which stop you want to get off at it s only 10 15mins ride it s sdo easy to get around so don t be put of by location , The Hotel staff were great nice size room we had one of the smaller ones 
311875,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, On our day of check out we had a very bad experience with the two ladies in the reception unprofessional rude treating us with no manners its a not expected from a name as Best Western hotels I hope a some one responsible conract us to take aserious action , The value of money is reaonanle

311878,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The hotel could improve on a few basic details such as provide mattress protectors one sheet between yourself and a mattress isn t sufficient The towels need to be a better quality ours were quite worn Provide soap dishes the bar of soap had to sit directly on the bathroom worktop which made a mess , A lovely hotel in a good location There is a tram stop directly outside the hotel providing easy access to the city centre The hotel provides good facilities in rooms including a Nespresso machine The triple room was spacious lovely and modern We enjoyed a great meal in the restaurant which was good value for money The car park was very convenient 
311879,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Bed and sheets pillow not very comfortable Hair dryer not good Body soap and lotions not good either , Located close to tram which takes you into Central Amsterdaam and close to train which takes you too the airport Wifi was good nice helpful staff all spoke English

311885,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, Location is a bit dead and sterile the local highlight was a Lidl supermarket A couple of things that would have adversely influenced my choice of this hotel if I d known before were Lack of alcohol sold in the bar due to a licensing issue Breakfast was not included in the price , Although some 3 miles out from the centre of town was located right next to a frequent efficient tram line service and if you buy a multi use ticket it s was very cheap Liked the nespresso coffee machine in the room nice touch and there was a well equiped gym in the basement Free fruit at the reception Pleasant staff 
311886,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The room service could work for a little longer The hotel kitchen closes at 10PM , Loved it Very modern hotel Great stay It isn t in the center but there is a tram station right in front of the hotel It is a 15 20 minute ride by tram to the center of Amsterdam

311889,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, wifi not password protected Breakfast is expensive so we just went in town to find bakeries , Perfect location With tram stop right outside the door it is well worth getting a 4 day pass Rooms and hotel was very nice and looked great Staff was very nice and helpful Would stay here every time I visit this beauftiful city Highly Recommended 
311890,Best Western Premier Hotel Couture, The lack of an alcohol licence means that the excellent food served at the restaurant does not have people experiencing it , Whilst the hotel is out of the main city the tram at the front of the hotel takes you into Amsterdam The hotel is great good staff good food nice room
