305498,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing I didn t like Although it would have been perfect if the price per night was a little less , The cleanliness of this hotel is impeccable The bed is super comfy and from the moment you arrive the staff is extremely nice and helpful the location is perfect near a lovely park a huge shopping mall many delicious restaurants and different kinds of entertainment There s absolutely nothing bad to be said about this property 
305499,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Bed was two twin beds shoved together but they were on wheels and they moved Very stark minimalist room If you wanted breakfast daily there was a huge extra charge daily , Cleaning staff was friendly helpful and trustworthy Quiet hotel Right by a mall and close to downtown transportation within walking distance of many landmarks and attractions Taxi pick up spot located directly across the street by entrance 
305500,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, They didn t mention anything that the parking is not included in the price and when we left they told us about that The girl at the reception realized it was not ok to ask money for that since there was no mentioning about it so they covered for it Also we paid the breakfast the day we checked in and every morning we had to wait at the restaurant because they didnt see our reservation , The hotel is nice and clean the stuff is professional The location is central there is a mall just near it streets with restaurants
305501,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Lousy ironing board Small and useless iron and board Creeking bed , Location and standard of facilities Close to everything modern part of Barcelona 
305502,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, it s a little far from the centre but you get a lot to compensate , in a city of crappy hotels and terrible staff this Hotel is an excellent choice Big beautiful rooms and a great little cafe just around the corner 
305503,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, The beds are firm and nice to sleep on and the air conditioner made the room comfortable The black out screens were also great for a dark cool room The bar food menu was good I especially liked the salads as they were large varied and delicious My favorite was to custom order a salad as you could basically put anything you fancied into it 
305504,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing, We liked everything about this hotel the staff were so helpful and eager to please The buffet breakfast was the best ever evening meal at Don Diovanni was amazing We would highly recommend this hotel
305505,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing, We loved everything about this hotel it was such a wonderful experience We arrieved at the hotel before noon to drop off our bags we were told our room was ready and we were Guest of the Day which was unreal We were upgraded to a Luzury Suite which was amazing plus Free Spa Free Cocktails also 20 off our evening meal which also was fantastic The breakfast buffet was the best ever We found the staff very helpful and eager to please Looking forward to returning to this hotel 
305506,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The traffic Going somewhere from the hotel can be a bit slow in the morning also very few other services and shops in the area Minor gripe though , Nice looking rooms clean and tidy Quiet location and very good room service 
305507,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, No English movie channels on tv No option of Netflix or connecting my own device to TV, The bed was very comfy Bathroom was modern and plenty of space
305508,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, Well situated for hop on hop off bus Shopping and supermarket next door Liked this hotel and would use others in the chain around city depending on where I wanted to be Away from the tourist areas so nice and quiet 
305509,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, We booked this hotel because it was advertised on Booking Com that there was an airport shuttle Unfortunately this turned out to be false The bathroom could have been a bit cleaner Also this is the first luxury hotel I ve stayed at that makes you pay for the spa , The bed was huge and very comfortable The decor is modern Good wifi connection The rooftop pool was gorgeous 
305510,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The sink was clogged and wouldn t drain sewer smell came from the sink and the bathroom didn t smell clean either Room doors don t close properly sometimes and 2 staff had opened and entered my room without knocking as I was getting changed When I alerted the front desk nothing happened The sauna spa is paid entry and there was no info about this when booking It was tiny not very clean people were getting romantic in the tiny pool and the staff would enter with their shoes on I would rather pay a bit more and go to a 5 next time , Wifi was fast Front desk staff were very nice at checkin checkout 
305511,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Hotel went out of the way to make you feel at home All good , Friendly helpful staff Convenient location to transportation tram and On Off bus Shopping mall and restaurants next door Very good Italian restaurant in the hotel Excellent breakfast Good underground parking Park your car and take transit Driving and parking in Barcelona is difficult 
305512,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, The bed had 6 pillows all different and I could easily find one that fit my comfort level The food around the area was amazing The breakfast was one of the best I ve had at any hotel Parking is attached to the building with a fee of about 25 euros a day 
305513,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, If you are business traveler avoid this hotel as they not mentioned that all extras are payed and the most irritating is constantly poor working wifi On the reception was lots of tourists who choose hotel because of swimming pool but it was closed when the temperature outside was 21 25 and stuff don t even try to cooperate , Excellent breakfast and design 
305514,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Only the fact that the hotel was too far away from a metro station was a thing that I didn t like but this is not something that can be solved by the hotel The rest was all excellent , The coffee tea in the room breakfast was excellent Staff was extremely helpful and kind 
305515,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, bed is very big but so light you can move him without problem little heavier will be better, great location very clean and comfortable room very helpfull staff nice things like nespresso machine complementary coffies water look great to me
305516,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Not much to say here but the blow dryer was VERY heavy made of steel and hard to use And there wasn t a shelf to put your stuff on in the shower First world problems We also weren t told about the back entrance that leads directly to the shopping center we walked around the entire building every day to get there only to see that entrance by fluke when we were at that end of the shopping center But truly nothing really to complain about This hotel is fantastic the staff make it top notch , The hotel is very modern beautiful love the waters treats for the guests in the lobby Very nice touch The staff were amazing so very helpful The rooms are spacious really well designed Very comfortable beds Lots of space in the bathroom to put your stuff Loved the carpeted hallways so it was very quiet The location is perfect It s in a business district very safe close to an amazing shopping center Great restaurants nearby as well Check out the rooftop incredible view from up there Really a great place to stay 
305517,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, bed is too hard for me and it gave me a neck and back ache This is unfortunately why I wouldn t go back That s a personal preference I think though the spa is small and the people rude If you don t have it included in the hotel stay they charge I think whatever they want to be honest I read here that some people paid 10 some 15 euro They wanted me to pay 20 euro for an hour we will give you slippers and a hair net there s only a little sauna and little pool jacuzzi it was raining while I was there so I didn t get to try the pool unfortunately, big room with good isolation big bathroom with bath and shower big bath as well nice staff near a Subway which takes you to the city center in 10 min or just walk for about 20 25 min next to a huge mall and restaurants Try brunchelona in the mall my favoriete restaurant caf in Barcelona 
305518,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The noise from the square behind the hotel When you opened the window the noise in the middle of the night was quit irritating Drunk people talking loud etc ,No Positive
305519,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Though I liked the hotel very much and would most probably come back soon there are still a few things that could be improved For example the WiFi is for free but the network quality in the room was very very poor And as the air conditioning is switched off during the cold season but it has been a sunny day the room was extremely hot and the only way to cool it down was to open the window with all the consequences what this means incl noise etc , Very nice hotel perfecly located in Les Corts Spacious rooms and delicious breakfast 
305520,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The room was very rundown and in need of remodeling The coffeepot fridge and bathtub hydro masaje didn t work In general I found the decoration to be cold and impersonal especially the florecent lighting which had a green hue to be quite bothersome , The staff were very friendly great breakfast buffet and nice details bottle of water pastries in room 
305521,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, 1 Took them five days to fix my aircon Technician came on day two and partially fixed it but every time I tried to adjust it aircon just stopped 2 Free wifi and business wifi was terrible and again they didn t ever really try to fix it Told me one day that there is a problem on level 5 and they ve called someone to fix it but it remained inconsistent at best They never rang me and asked if the wifi had been fixed despite the fact that I called them on three separate occasions days to report the issue 3 Woken up at 4am twice by noise outside on the street Suggest requesting a room on the other side of the hotel 4 No ironing boards in room and they bring you those crappy mobile ironing boards instead 5 Replaced my laundry bags twice without the form to fill in my details meaning I had to call them to bring a form to my room On their own each of these issues are minor apart from the wifi which is very annoying whilst you are on a business trip but when you combine them it made for a frustrating stay , Decent location Good breakfast Comfortable bed and bathroom
305522,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The location was a little bit outside of where you want to spend most of your time in Barcelona but it was an easy walk to Les Corts metro station and the L3 takes you right to the ocean end of La Rambla in less than ten minutes , The bed was very comfortable the bathroom had a full tub which is a rarity in European hotels 
305523,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing we didn t like but we will pay more attention when booking next time so that we include breakfast in the price , Hotel was excellent clean lines modern and in great location Sun terrace was a plus wish we had a longer stay 
305524,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, I would have like to be emailed rather than calling 2 or 3 times when my keys arrived , The staff was very helpful in providing information I was expecting a set of keys that of course arrived once I left I call back to check and I said that someone else will pick it up instead They asked for information to check the identity which is an excellent attitude Very good and professional By the way the breakfast is fanstastic also Very quiet and peaceful to relax and sleep Bed is firm and confortable And finally the swimming pool is so pleasant after a good business day 
305525,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing , The staff were amazing Augustine the receptionist made our visit extra special by awarding us customer of the day and our room was upgraded What a fantastic surprise Location was brilliant hotel was exquisite Wouldn t hesitate to book again xc
305526,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Location was a little far from the centre but not a problem , We asked for quiet rooms the place was silent Breakfast was terrific No complaints 
305527,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, We were not allowed to take towels to the beach The air con in the room was not very powerful and was quite noisy , There was a huge choice at breakfast the room was spacious with a big bathroom and very comfortable The pool was good but gets quite busy 
305528,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Worst beds ever Really noisy and rolled around the room every time you turn over Hotel was really nice but this ruined it for us, Really nice rooms nice design and very well thought out
305529,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, Excellent service water and sweets at reception underground parking very friendly and helpful staff lovely restaurant and cocktail bar a place to relax
305530,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Some staff could have been friendlier , Lovely modern hotel Smart bedrooms Spacious airy foyer Liked the drinks station at reception Great blackout in bedrooms 
305531,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Overall was a pleasant stay although the pool is very very small as well as the gym room So the pool was not an enjoyable experience , Very quick and efficient check in process Staff are nice but could be more cheerful but they were nice still Pastries at breakfast were really good 
305532,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Swimming pool is to small and crowdy only a few sunloungers on the very small terrace Inside pool and spa also too small for the number of guests , Very nice breakfast helpful and friendly staff Big bathroom with bath and seperate shower Rooms in modern style 
305533,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The location is inconvenient if your purpose is sightseeing Barcelona The closest metro stop is 10 15 minutes of walk with a relatively long metro ride to the city center There are not many nice restaurants nearby , The room was nice and spacious Bathroom was large with both a tub and a shower The staff is polite and professional The room was very clean Coffee tea was provided in the room 
305534,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The spa facilities and the outdoor pool had limited capacity and therefore difficult to use when convenient The air conditioning system was difficult to control The room was very cold and I slept badly Windows did not open Expensive rate for what it is , I liked the location and the breakfast 
305535,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The cost of parking , we liked the location with essy access to Barcelona football stadium Very comfortable bed Good parking facility but it costs Euro 25 00 per 24h Did not have breakfast as we were leaving very early The bed was first class and I wish I had one as good as that at home 
305536,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Nothing , We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in our honey moon We have received a room at a higher floor with view to the park The room was clean large with a nice view large bathroom and modern look Also location is great next to the Diagonal avenue and to the L illa shopping centre The service was excellent the breakfast was fantastic and the staff helpful We will recommend for sure this hotel to our friends and our next stay in Barcelona will be at the same hotel 
305537,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, There was nothing we didn t like , The staff were really friendly and very helpful they saved us buying a 2 day pass for the hop on hop off bus service They were right it could be done within a day The rooms were large clean and comfortable The location was ideal for us away from the noise and bustle of the more central areas and easily accessible by walking taking the metro or the bus 
305538,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The staff were all friendly and helpful I would definitely recommend and stay at the hotel when ever returning to Barcelona , The hotel is located central to everything you would need to enjoy your holiday 
305539,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Got auto enrolled into hotel s own reward scheme without my permission staff didn t mention I would get enrolled got an email a couple of hours later Cleaning staff ignored a do not disturb note and knocked on the door till I woken up and opened a door very annoying air conditioning was difficult to operate as this brand new hotel got a manual one it was also very loud and didn t work great Twice had to reset my key as it stopped working during my stay Also during peak times lifts are busy there are only four of them and they re relatively small for such a big hotel , Perfect location for my conference and walking distance to a night life areas There s a shopping centre next door with wide range of shops and places to eat Safe neighborhood Oh and breakfast was really good buffet style with plenty of options to choose from 
305540,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, I was not informed from the very beginning where i have access and how much time As 4 star hotel i did not have bath slippers either bathrobe Wifi is not working every time the rooms a little bit small than other 4 star hotels but ok 3 pm checkin, Cleanliness breakfast quiet very good area close to big Mall taxi right to the hotel baggage keep for in or out 
305541,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Far from the city centre and you have to walk around 15 min to reach the next metro stop or pay 15 euros for a taxi , I have spent a weekend at the hotel and had a great time Their staff is very friendly and the room was really nice and quiet The neighborhood is quiet and not full of tourists The drinks at the bar are very good I highly recommend their Mojito If you want to do some shopping you can go to the mall Illa Diagonal which is on the other side when you cross the park 
305542,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Pool and fitness room very small Far from the city centre and you have to walk around 15 min to reach the next metro stop , Very nice and comfortable hotel Awesome breakfast Stuff nice and friendly
305543,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Inconsistent service for rooms One room got bottled water every night the other room didn t get it One room had all the towels and the other room was missing the face towel , Water at lobby
305544,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Loud on 1 or 2 nights from the park outside but given that it was a football showing on The room service menu was more for light eating , Easy to travel around 5 minutes to the metro and taxi stand right outside Near a nice mall to do some shopping and quick bites Really good breakfast good wide choice and good quality food Helpful staff Clean and decent sized rooms 
305545,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The location was a little out of the way and it suffers a bit like lot of modern facilities in that they lack soul The floor plan of the hallways is a little odd and I think it could be a bit of a trap in a fire , Its a modern hotel with new facilities and a full range of services Staff are good helpful and friendly in a corporate way 
305546,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, A few clothing hanger hooks in the bath area would be nice , Heated bath mirror no fogging from steamy showers Hotel located in good neighborhood and close to subway Newly remodeled 
305547,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, rooms a bit smelly and air con not as effective No ventilation in the bathroom therefore humidity and smell after bathroom toilet use would linger around , breakfast location and staff roof top pool 
305548,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The gym was very small and limited equipment Would have liked a steam room in the spa and for it to be included in the cost of the booking , Smoothies in the morning were great and the spa very relaxing even though cost 15 euro per visit
305549,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The hotel is rather far from the center area Although there is a metro station nearby Maria Cristina there are still 10 min on foot to reach it The same applies for Sants railway station , The room was very spacious with a well served minibar very clean Also used the gym which is well equipped The personnel is very friendly welcoming and helpful 
305550,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Found it difficult to find rooms on first floor as went up stairs Had to cross through conference hall while it was being used which felt awkward , Great location wonderful variety at breakfast super comfy bar for cocktails Room great with very comfy bed and great shower in the bathroom 
305551,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, I had a problem with housekeeping my pajamas were accidentally placed with the laundry it took 2 days for it to be recovered all the stores were closed on Sunday I could not get a replacement and had to scramble for 2 nights which made my sleep compromised The staff did not offer compensation When I asked they took off small bar charges , Great breakfast clean rooms helpful front desk
305552,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, Location Walking distance from Camp Nou and from center ideal to watch Barcelona Match Breakfast was very good lot of choices and very tasty fresh Juice 
305553,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Gym is really small so don t expect much , Breakfast was really good but a bit pricey although children eat for free Friendly staff clean and modern facilities Really enjoyed the stay would stay again 
305554,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The location is pretty bad It s really far from the centre and you have to walk 10 min to get to the closest metro station A taxi ride to the centre is 10 15 euro per ride which is expensive for Barcelona The neighboorhood is very very quiet with not much to do in the area The check in was a very bad experience We waited 20 min before someone at the reception took care of us They first gave us a room with twin beds despite we had asked for a double bed when we made the booking We had to negotiate really hard to get a double bed it appears they automatically give twin beds to people who use Booking com be careful The room s decoration is pretty cold and does not have much personality We did not take the breakfast as we preferred to have it in the city centre , The room was clean comfortable and quiet room 640 6th floor The double bed is really big There is a gym and a spa although we did not try them 
305555,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Requested a double bed but was told on arrival that there were none left which was disappointing Also amenities such as pool breakfast etc were not included in price of booking which was not stated when making our reservation and were very expensive pool 20 pp to use and breakfast 22 pp per day I understand paying extra for breakfast but pool I think should be included Also I feel the staff could have been a bit more informative about our surroundings e g tram stops local places to eat shopping centres etc , Bathroom was gorgeous rooms were very clean and comfortable 
305556,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Everything was perfect , It was an amazing hotel greatly located Close to the bus stop that goes to the center also close to the Touristic busses Huge shopping center near by with playground for kids Amazing restaurants just outside the building Breakfast in the hotel was luxurious I loved absolutely everything Elevator never busy rooms are clean and specious Do not think twice Hotel is great 
305557,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, I do not understand why the number of people per room is limited to 3 I travelled with two young children under 12 yrs , Especially the staff in the Hotel Concierge and Front Desk is simply great 
305558,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, We were very surprised at the quality of all aspects of the hotel and service good value for money stayed at NH in Malaga and although good expectations were surpassed Add to this that the location for our purpose was perfect and it made for a great stay Would return and recommend 
305559,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, The staff were very unhelpful anything we asked for the answer was no even when asking for a taxi or advice on a day trip out they weren t overly keen on helping The air con didn t work and our room was sweltering I didn t sleep atall the first night we demanded a room change the second night and it was a better but still too hot Our rooms didn t get cleaned until around 6pm on an evening which interfered with our plans as we couldn t get a shower and get changed until they left , The bed was very comfortable and the rooms where spacious and modern 
305560,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Beds vere terrible like a hospital bed with Wheels on they vere not at all comfortable Parking very very expensive , Great breakfast Good location 
305561,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, Pros Big room good coffee machine clean big mall nearby restaurants and bars close to it Quiet neighborhood Cons needs to walk 10 12 minutes to cloest metro but it is fine to me
305562,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Checkin longest checkin ever I travel every week for business I ve noticed it last time I was at this hotel but if possible situation is even worse, Room
305563,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Not so close to main Barcelona sights and even subway The hotel was apparently in it s prime long time ago and both the rooms and the gloomy corridors need refurbishement , Conveniently located for shoppers and soccer fans close to a shopping mall and the Diagonal avenue Close to Camp Nou stadium Excellent breakfasts good service 
305564,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, It would be great if the shower had a door instead having to strategically aim the shower head to avoid drenching the bathroom , Great price for a 4 star hotel Friendly staff proximity to a good shopping mall Quiet location with easy access to the train station and popular bus routes I m sure that if I d actually ever made it up for breakfast I would be raving about that too 
305565,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, There was a smell if smoke when we first went into the room It is a very clinical business style hotel , Breakfast was fantastic Local to metro stations and to the main train station 
305566,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza,No Negative, Staff was wonderful Gorgeous property Our first NH hotel was in Florence if we had known about NH Hotels before coming to Europe we wouldn t have stayed any where else Can t wait to recommend your hotels to friends family traveling to Europe Thank you for such a great experience 
305567,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, We booked three rooms of the same type for same dates and on same date separately for each person but during checkout it turned out that mine is far more expensive The reception staff couldn t explain why Also it turned out that breakfast if added during checkin was cheaper than purchased via booking com which doesn t make sense at all There were no slippers in the room The staff at the reception said that they are only for premium rooms C mon guys This is a 4 star hotel Nowadays even 3 star hotels have throw away slippers Instead NH Constanza put individual coffee machines in each room What a waste of money The staff at the reception doesn t speak English fluently therefore checkin process takes too long , Huge room All kinds of options for breakfast
305568,NH Collection Barcelona Constanza, Far from city center but nice neighbourhood Very modern decorationbut a bit cold a lot of gray No bidet in the bathroom , Very modern hotel nice swimmingpool albeit cold gym very comfortable
