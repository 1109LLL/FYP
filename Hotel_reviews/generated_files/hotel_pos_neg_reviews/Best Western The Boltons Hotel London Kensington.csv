79923,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The neighbourhood was pretty quiet at night but not too convenient if you re looking for somewhere close to the coach station or sites The elevator is very small It s fine when you re my size and on your own but not so convenient for two women with luggage in tow We had to take it up one at a time to our rooms with our luggage and the elevator runs pretty slowly so it took a few minutes to go up and come back down The walls of the hotel are somewhat thin you can hear when people walk past your room Other than that we didn t have any issues with the accommodations themselves and we had a great time , We stayed here for three days for a festival in town The staff were really nice and helpful and the breakfast was kept hot and replenished regularly for the duration of their breakfast hours The room itself was nice they clean regularly unless you tell them not to and there was a big comfy bed that my friend and I had no problem sharing

79962,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, One of the receptionists gave us the wrong information So we had to walk back in the opposite direction quite a long way to get to the right bus stop Although furnishings were great the carpet on the floor was VERY stained looked quite disgusting and the walls were marked The towel rack was on ALL the time you could not turn it off or down and although there is a warning sign because the bathroom is small I burnt my arm a few times as I accidentally bumped it , Young man at reception Alex went out of his way to help And was always courteous and respectful Our room was lovely and quiet 
79963,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Ridiculously small single bedroom in a cellar not even in the main hotel with no windows I was unable to stand up in the bathroom to shower or use the toilet I had to wait 15 minutes for a table to come free for breakfast mid week stay due to particularly small restaurant area I had to wait an exorbitantly long time to be attended to by the hotel receptionist who was more interested in giving some new foreign visitors to London a full run down on attractions worth visiting and made no apology for keeping me waiting , Convenient location for the Earls Court area

79965,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Arriving after an overnight flight to find the room I had arranged was not available even after a long email exchange on the matter meaning that staff members had to sleep together even though inappropriate because a cot would not fit But still being charged for an upgrade The sinks were clogged and the temperature controls had no effect I also had suspicious bug bites each night When I showed them to staff they asked for my email to follow up and I never heard anything after that , Nothing

79968,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Bijou room and dirty linen strewn on stairs, The room we were given for 2 persons was far too small in my opinion it was really for 1 person Bed side table on only 1 side of bed and difficult to get out of bed for 1 person unless you climbed over the bed disturbing the other person In addition on check in at 5pm there was dirty bed linen piled up in stairwell causing health safety issues Happened on checking out aswell not good to block stairwells or to touch other people s dirty linen ugh

79970,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, WiFi in lower floor very weak The alarm fired 3 times during the night 3 15AM 6 15AM and 6 45AM Apparently first time due to someone smoking in a room Okay understandable but the other 2 times were reception dixit because staff didn t reset properly the alarm Horrible night with the alarm just in my room needing to work the next day not recommended experience to people with heart sickness Things like this someone skipping smoking rules can happen eventually of course but other establishment will compensate you not charging you a breakfast for example if it s something redundant during the night Not such gestures here unfortunately , Good location 3 minutes walk from Earls Court tube stop Nice and calm street quarter Good and complete breakfast

79974,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We son t see how this hotel is 4 star rated Room was small no lounge to sit in and the breakfast area is a joke with only eleven tables sitting 22 people max so pot luck if you can get a seat no other meals offerred My wife asked for an egg cup but the staff did not understand what she meant so she bought one to use for the rest of the stay A Best Weston hotel with no egg cups Wireless internet is dire so we used the Costa Starbucks around the corner which had good internet Lift is incredibly small with only room for one person and one case Hotel is fine if all you want is a bed to sleep in after a day out but no other reason to visit , Good location for the tube and staff helpfull we got a good deal but would only visit again if a price deal could be struck Complimentary newspapers

79979,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The rooms are extremely small We had to put our luggage bags on the desk as there was no where else to put them The shower door didn t close properly so we had a little bit of a flooding issue Also the double bed is a very very small bed , The double bed was small but comfortable The bathroom is also very nice Location is excellent very close to the underground Nice bars nearby and quiet area 
79980,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room was very cramped and smelt of mould being on the lower ground floor at the front of the hotel was probably the reason for this however Bathroom was cramped Didn t have breakfast here so can t comment on this , Location was excellent only 200 metres to the railway station and all the restaurants

79982,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We had booked two double rooms but one couple were placed in a very awkward and cramped room for three people They also tried to give us a basement room that we declined due to previous reviews Make sure you check the room before you check in It taught us a valuable lesson Don t just accept what they want to give you , Convenient to tube and restaurants

79986,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Wifi was the slowest I have ever met in a hotel Speed was 0 5 1 megabytes and connection was unreliable Even the browsing the normal web pages was difficult When I reported this issue to the personnel I was told that the problem started last monday and they are waiting for the fix No refund was not offered 560 pounds for three nights stay with an unreliable internet access is not acceptable , Location is great the Earl s Court underground station was 3 5 minutes from the hotel front door From the Earl s Court station there are good connections to Heathrow and the London downtown Bed was very comfortable plenty of pillows and you could cook tea and coffee in the room 
79987,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Bed very poor Old style unlike the sweet bed of another chain Hard old mattress and horrible cloying duvet Linen felt as though it had been around a while washed sheets and towels but worn Hand towel had a big hole in it Lift extremely tiny creates a claustrophobic feel to the whole place I had to ask to get air con for cooling a stuffy room For some reason the staff had switched it off Time for this hotel to enter the expectations of 21st century , Noisy neighbours and smoking next to my window in the night The hotel staff were helpful and found me a different room at 2am as I couldn t sleep BUT there is no bell on reception to call staff and night staff took quite a while to arrive at reception from where You just have to stand around and hope someone will turn up Good sized shower and nice to have a real wardrobe and security box 
79988,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room is described as an executive double which I felt was misleading the description made me think I was getting something with a more space and something extra or different from a standard double room In actual fact the room seemed like a standard double in terms of facilities and was tiny and cramped , Great position staff were excellent breakfast was very well done
79989,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, A bit noisy at night My devices would sporadically be blocked from the slow internet for using peer to peer networks This happened on a MacBook iPad iPhone and a Windows phone The internet was very slow and difficult to work remotely using it Breakfast was not great but lots of places around about offering an alternative , Location good for getting into town

79991,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The staff were a bit cold at first but they grew warmer after a couple of days The elevator is a little too small so might consider that in terms of luggage , For this money we couldn t have asked for a better stay We got a great discount and ended up paying around 48 GBP per night for a double bed which is a steal for such a central location The room was small but had everything we needed and more including a safe The bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch The location was perfect Earl s Court tube station is around the corner and from there you can reach any part of the central London in minutes

79995,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, One member of staff took it upon herself to cancel my booking and run my credit card Because my daughter asked her what is the procedure IF we needed to cancel With that question the receptionist canceled my booking I m here in UK because my father died and I missed him by 5hrs I m stressed enough without stupidity from eager to sell the room staff members The rest of the staff have been amazing and friendly and helpful, The location The price The staff
79996,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Payments for the reservation are charged after booking not when checking out There is no possibility to cancel without costs The wifi was not stable enough to work properly in the hotel , Great location is a quiet part of Kensington and at the corner or Earl s court station Staff was very friendly I needed to leave before breakfast being served and both morning they prepared a small breakfast package for me The room was small but the bed and shower were great 
79997,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, No complaints I didn t buy the breakfast because it was quite expensive , The deal I got was good value for money A very clean smart hotel and the staff were helpful and friendly A stone s throw from the Tube but no noise I will definitely stay there again if I have work in the Earl s Court Hammersmith South Kensington area 
79998,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was rather small when compared to the photos on website as was the shower The mattress was not very comfortable and there was a humming noise which intensified during the night in room 407 , Close to underground station Staff friendly and helpful Room was nicely furnished 
79999,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Although our room was in the basement at fiirst we were a little disappointed with it but really it didn t matter we were out every day it was very adequate for our needs and was looked after by the house staff very well Change of linen and towels regularly , Both myself and my friend agreed that the over all stay was very good I meet up with my friend most years it s important to have good accommodation and location All the Staff especially the restaurant were extremely helpful and kind

80001,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, There was no hot water Most of the room are in the basement The bed was too small And to top it all the AC was too noisy and woke me up at 6 Is this really a best western and was this a joke too , Most of the employees were nice and helpful 
80002,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The lift is quite small we were 2 and fit in quite snug with our hand luggage not sure how we would have managed if we each had a large suitcase and the staircase is also quite narrow should one choose to avoid the lift , The rooms are tiny but have everything you could need for a short stay The bed is extremely comfortable I felt like I was sleeping on a combination of clouds and marshmallows and the TV is attached to a bracket on the wall that swivels out for comfortable viewing whilst in bed The shower pressure is amazing and the bathroom is fairly roomy when taking into consideration the tiny room size The breakfast room is also quite small but again covers everything you would need Both continental and full English available a variety of bread and condiments along with a variety of herbal teas Staff are also very helpful and friendly WiFi is freely available and fairly good speed and the location is incredible 2 min walk to Earl s Court Station with Byron s on the way 
80003,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I didn t like that our room was set up as if for a single person one robe and slippers on door one kit kat one pack of biscuits Didn t feel it was for a couple on their anniversary , Quiet area and easy access to tube and good facilities in location
80004,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Bed is not the most comfortable the wifi is horrible very slow with having to fill in email address name and room number each time Although breakfast had a good variety it is better to get in earlier as some stuff will not be refilled after 9 so if you want the good stuff don t sleep in No fridge in the room and it is pretty small with two large bags it is a struggle getting ready in the morning Bathroom is also small with no toilet roll holder This hotel should probably be rated as a 2 star hotel , The location is great close to the underground on the Piccadilly line so easy to get to We were able to check in early that is always great Breakfast offered a good variety of food
80005,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The rooms very small I felt claustrophobic, The pictures of the room were completely different than what you see The rooms are very small for 2p people 
80006,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Carpets were stained wifi a bit unreliable, I think your stay in the hotels in this area depends on your room position my daughter and i had a front room on the ground floor whick was nice no noise issues tea and coffe facilities and a good bathroom though quite small clean apart from stains on the carpet which is surprising for a 4 star hotel we enjoyed our stay
80007,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The hotel was very noisy didn t get much sleep due to doors being open and closed could hear people in the corridor throughout the night and cleaner early the next morning Also as not double glazed could hear people outside and the traffic There was quite a big gap under the door so the light from The corridor shone through This is why I have not given a good score for comfort even though the bed was comfortable it was ruined by the noise , The staff were very friendly and helpful 
80008,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Mattress a little soft , Fantastic location adjacent to Tube and buses Several restaurants and bars within a short stroll Our bedroom was in the lower ground floor so zero traffic noise although it did appear to be a quiet residential road anyway

80013,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room was extremely small for a couple Had to upgrade to get a reasonably sized room But at a cost Breakfast was a disaster dining room far too small to accommodate the numbers Obviously the food is precooked so when ghat is gone panic sets in They cannot cope with orders for food and only deal with customers on a one to one basis When cooking and supplying food is for all potential customers, Location
80014,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Severely sagging beds housekeeping unwillingness for extra towels drafty window dirty floors toilet in a tight space shower in a tight space very small bathroom , Free wifi close proximity to Underground station

80016,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Bathroom was small sink was blocked and the fan didn t work Breakfast room was cramped very small without much room at all Food was okay but you had to serve yourself and wait for some as it wasn t always ready on the plates so other food got cold on your plate Too many people with just one person giving help Had to ask three times for some tea three times for a glass to put some juice in and it felt as if you were a problem In all it wasn t worth the money A small over crowded place without room to swing a cat I won t go there again , The bed was comfortable
80017,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Water runs out in the morning So we had to shower extra early 2 of the 3 mornings we had to shower with cold water The lady at the reception never heard it before but did suggest we beter shower earlier or on another time She said she would have somebody take a look at it but that personen didnt found anything off and nothing was wrong We did not feel taken seriously I think the hotel works with an reservoir that contains an max of warm water Not done for 100euro a night She could at least be honest about it , Nice location Picadilly line coffeeshops shops and supermarket around the corner
80018,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We had a Bookings com discount We feel because of this we didn t have a good room Our room was in the basement at the front where staff worked there was a bright light all night outside the windows The concierge was kind enough to give us a 30 discount We would have preferred a good room we would not go back from this experience so the hotel has lost out on an opportunity We don t believe Bookings com discounts deliver added value quite the opposite , Location
80019,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The cooked breakfast items at the buffet were on both mornings tepid The continental meats and cheese options somewhat dried out due to them sitting under lighting at the buffet bar , Very pleasant staff at breakfast who greet you with a smile and always very polite and professional The room had all the essentials needed was well presented clean and the bed and pillows extremely comfortable Hotel just a 3 minute walk from Earls Court station

80025,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was underground Despite the room being quite modern and well maintained there was some neglect I cut my hand on a nail that was sticking out of the bottom of the cupboard for example The cupboard door was also broken , Clean and modern room of reasonable size Excellent location in the centre of Earl s Court and 2 minutes walk from the Underground Piccadilly District and Circle lines 
80026,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Very trifling points On last day bedroom make up just a tad incomplete one handtowel short and cushions not back on bed also noticed lift floor not clean but these are fiddly minor criticisms , Bed very comfortable Breakfast excellent Staff very helpful 
80027,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room size and toilet and bathroom facility Not the best hotel if you are six foot tall toilet has no proper room to sit and do the job , The staff was very friendly

80029,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Very small room for huge prize 42 LCD TV which occupies half of the wall prevents entering the bath room , Located not far from the main touristic attractions Room is more or less comfortable
80030,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I had to bring my key card to the reception every day when I got back to the hotel because it always stopped working on my door, Staff was very friendly rooms was nice and clean
80031,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Girl in the reception wasn t very friendly and at breakfast the service wasn t very good as they didn t explain anything and I had to help myself with coffee Another thing I had a twin room in the lower ground and next to the service bins which they started to make a lot of noise at 6am onwards , It was comfortable and very clean 
80032,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The lift tiny quite scary and often not working and the stairs are very steep , The location The bedding The breakfast Rooms are well soundproofed 
80033,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, A smal hotel converted from an historic residence it is very good , Very friendly and helpful staff An excellent breakfast many choices convent to the underground and all of London 
80034,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Small room that did no live up to the advertised room No windows in the room and the air conditioning heating not working Bed was smaller then expected based on pictures and description , Location was good for the tube and close to restaurants 
80035,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room in lower ground with no daylight and cramped space is a disgrace for the chain of Best Western The room was not made even at 4p m The door key did not work several times 3 during a 2 night stay The staff seemed incompetent and unwilling to resolve the issues , Except for the location cannot say any positive It does not deserve the name of Best Western chain unlike many other hotels of BW in which had stayed before The price for such service is shocking 
80036,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room on 4th floor very tiny I couldn t sit straight on the toilet seat as the bathroom was too small Shame as otherwise room had been refurbished, Able to check out later Staff very friendlygreat location very close to Earls court underground
80037,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room through booking com was so small one had to sit sideways on the toilet and the bed was only accessible from one side We got a marginally larger one when we complained These reservations were made several months ago so we were dissatisfied with the results , The hotel was in a good location The young woman on the desk was very personable and helped book our excursion Breakfast was very good Above par 
80038,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, They gave us the worst room lower level right on the street so we had all that noise and light This impacted our poor experience A better room would have made for a happier stay , Proximity to Earls Court Tube station was invaluable Good services available along Earls Ct Rd 
80039,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The full booking room rate for our 3 night stay was taken out of our credit card prior to arrival which was disappointing as I booked through my Australian credit card but intended to pay in pounds The room was tiny and in the basement The bed was against the wall so access for two people was very inconvenient One staff member never bothered to even look up to acknowledge us on arrival or departure which appeared very rude and gave us security concerns as anyone could walk in unchallenged , Location to Earls Cout Station and shops and restaurants is excellent The room was clean and the bed was comfortable
80040,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, I stayed for 7 nights Very enjoyable stay Tasty breakfast comfortable bed helpful and pleasant staff They put a lot of effort to make up the room every day Thank you 
80041,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The hotel had no business with 4 stars the installation of air conditioning was not working heating There is no fridge in the room 4 star what should exist The room was very small and the bed was also very small The camera was positioned in the basement where there were 15 other rooms as There s a 4 star hotel , Pozitia foarte buna micul dejun ok Internet ok 
80042,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Only Staff member serving at Breakfast was rude unhelpful and did not smile at all Wasn t keeping up with keeping food juice stocked up or tables clean Was obviously under pressure as next day there were two staff on at Breakfast , Beds were comfortable 
80043,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We had a really small bedroom should have asked for a larger room but as we were only staying two nights decided against it Bathroom and shower very tiny but all very clean , The staff were great very friendly and accommodating nothing too much trouble Location also great just around the corner from Earls Court tube station Lots of restaurants and cafe s in the area 
80044,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Our bed was up against a wall due to the bathroom door being next to it This made the bed not overly comfortable space wise for two people but perfectly manageable and a good mattress I m sure all the other rooms are different layouts so wouldn t be a problem The breakfast was great but he breakfast service was poor As the dining room only had two groups of people yet all the tables had dirty plates on The food was fab but the presentation meant there was not much out at one time and the staff were constantly replenishing the food thus not clearing tables etc , Brilliant location as it s a stone throw from one of the major tube stations Very clean and tidy area of London Really quiet street Lots of quick food places for a snack near by 
80045,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room was a bit tight but bed was very comfortable , Breakfast was fairly good Staff was very friendly and the location was awesome Two minute walk to the Tube 
80046,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Carpets stained and looked like they needed a good clean Shower not overly hot but this may not be hotels problem At least it had some power to it unlike a lot of showers in London Room small but again not unusual in London, Proximity to tube station and quiet location
80047,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, When booking online with booking com the pictures shown of the double bedroom were completely different to the room we were given The room is a lot smaller with a double bed against the wall and only one side table The bathroom was very tight We felt that we had been mislead by the images shown when booking a double bedroom There are a few bigger double bedrooms available and luckily we were moved to another room with the help of Veronica who was great , Great location just around the corner from the Earls court tube station and close to shops and restaurants 
80048,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Rooms were small and cramped for the price We were downstairs and there was little light and it felt damp and musty Not pleasant to relax in Toaster at breakfast burnt bread regularly and eventually set off alarm , Breakfast was good 
80049,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The beds were so soft and not firm at all so you would sink when you lay on them I am small person and in weight so it s definitely not me The bed was exceedingly small in size and not representative of normal hotel bed sizes The doors on the bedroom do not do much to block out the sounds of the hotel hallways and you can hear each and every guest or staff walk past your room The bathrooms were small and only had showers in them The hotel only gave 1 large towel per room which I thought odd and not standard hotel policy for London ,No Positive
80050,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I did not like anything Totally inadequate staff rude and unhelpful Rooms very small cramped and musty smell Luckily I got an offer to 60 of the price otherwise it was a real robbery Let alone breakfast The bare minimum served in a small room Must be avoided, The only positive note the proximity to the metro station Earl s Court
80051,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, All carpets in the place were stained and looked dirty Odd as everything else very clean Each room needs staff cleaning room to check and report faults after each guest We booked through you many weeks ago but told could only give us a basement room on arrival as very heavily booked , Furnishings and bathroom very good lighting very poor had to change room because only one light in whole room worked But staff very apologetic and moved us quickly 
80052,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Ok so the lift was tiny and could fit two people or 1 person and a case but it worked and I ve been places without any lifts At the end of the day it was only 4 floors , For 12 50 the breakfast was excellent value and as the selection and quality for small kitchen and restaurant was better than some top brand hotels in my opinion The bed was very comfortable Location for me was perfect 3 minutes walk outside the tube station and with easy links via Piccadilly line and district Line to most areas of London 
80053,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room was small Bathroom was clean and worked well but was very small Bed mattress was very lumpy Inconsistent resupply of toiletries in the room , Full English breakfast was good but the same every day Location excellent Can go there with the underground directly from Heathrow to Earl s Court station Very good excess to all underground lines Excellent ethnic restaurants in area 
80054,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, WiFi wasn t stable Also staff could ve been a bit more professional , The best bed we ve ever slept in We liked a small welcome gift in the room Nice selection of teas a KitKat every day a lovely touch The room is nice and modern very clean and comfortable we felt at home The hotel is in a nice suburb close to the metro and a supermarket Overall one of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed in Europe 
80055,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, few stains on the carpet also strange square in it with a couple of screws and metal around it assume it was to get to pipes or something We were on the lower level As other reviews stated room was small but that didn t bother us much The elevator was the smallest I have ever seen Two persons with carry on luggage and the door could hardy close Think maybe I would rate this as 3 1 2 rather then 4 star, good location near underground always like staying in Earl s Court area helpful staff always ready to help with our tourist questions newly redecorated especially the bath everything clean except for rug accepted our luggage both before checkin time and again after check out
80056,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Small room the wardrobe door could not be opened fully as it hit the room doors closer you needed to open the shower door to sit on the loo and having to wait at the dining room door for 10 mins to be seated then wait another 10 minutes before the empty bread drinks and food dishes were replenished This happened on both days and on the second some of the dishes were not replaced Valance sheet covered with white stains Air con was ineffective, Breakfast quality was good comfy bed 
80057,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, limited space in bedroom particularly with 3 cases, Extremely welcoming helpful welcoming staff all shifts especially on arrival at MN great location close to everything transport etc
80058,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, small room I stayed in a single room It has a little short bed and small bathroom I m 166 cm tall and woman I couldn t move well in shower booth so if you are taller than me i don t recommend you the single room Maybe double room is better but i m not sure a little noisy I heard some sounds like a close of the door in my room , good location you can go to earls court underground in 5 minutes good breakfast traditional english breakfast friendly staff very clean i stayed for 5 night My room was so clean everyday 
80059,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I had a tiny room in the basement I had to jump over my bed to get out of the bathroom Nowhere to get any water to drink Incredibly expensive for what you are getting regardless of the location Probably the worst part of the whole stay was that the bed sheets and pillows were really really damp ,No Positive
80060,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Did not respond to my pre arrival requests although given well in advance Mix of staff some excellent and some sour faced Kept getting locked our of Wifi which was annoying as I was just checking emails , Bed was comfy Good location close to tube 
80061,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We were given a room on the basement floor and it was the worst hotel experience in my life The cell phone signal tended to die out a lot in the room I had to constantly go to the ground floor to make phone calls The Wi Fi didn t work 90 percent of the time and when it did work it was only for a minute or two Due to the room being basically underground it was constantly dark and the lamps didn t give sufficient light The constant semi darkness was extremely depressing To be fair there was a window in the room but it overlooked some rubbish bins or something like that in a basement and there were constantly people poking around those bins so we had to keep the curtains closed which again led to the problem of not enough light And the absolutely worst thing is that either the guests or the stuff of the hotel used this corner of the basement as a place for smoking and we constantly had the terrible smell of smoke all over our room My mother having asthma had to double her inhaler usage and I had to take anti allergy pills , Good location amazing choice of breakfast foods AC luxury shower 
80062,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, When I booked I found none specified we will be accommodated in a room that was located in the basement I would be chosen for another I did not like it It was dark and cold all day , Good location but I got a very small room the Internet relatively good I assess comfort of 2 stars the maximum friendly staff cleanliness exemplary 
80063,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Our room was not ready to check in at 2pm as specified , We had a problem with our room and the staff were amazing and gave us an even nicer room than we paid for to compensate Lovely hotel rooms and staff Also the beds are extremely comfortable 
80064,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Staff was a wee bit hit or miss most were smiley and pleasant but a couple seemed more grumpy or less patient , Great location as it s so close to the tube Room was small but efficient and served a 1 person stay very well 
80065,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I stayed there with my 2 adult sons and the room was quite small and very over priced The single bed was far too soft It was a basement room with the unsecured window opening onto the street and although the room had a safe it was not fastened in and any one could have opened the window and walked off with the whole thing tucked inside a case , The location was ok and a quiet street 
80066,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Not much If you insist I would say I wanted new slippers Asked once but hadn t got new ones Not a big deal though , Staffs are very helpful Especially would like to thank you very much for opening my cider bottle Very comfy bed I loved that Just around the corner of Earl s Court station very convinient You have M S food nearby Also great access to Chelsea via bus 
80067,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Basement rooms very small asked for a swap and was placed in a second floor room Room still small and up against bathroom wall with no bedside cupboard Shower had a leak and was dripping all night which because of location of bed on bathroom wall could be heard all night in bedroom , Good breakfast
80068,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Internet was bad Stay 2 nights but none of wifi connections work for my i phone iPad and laptop That was frustrating I don t expect the hotel to be sound proof but door slamming easily heard so hard , Location
80069,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We had a room on the far end and our wifi was unstable and slow, Very good breakfast but if you go late place becomes bit crowded Really close to underground and bus stations that take you directly to City Free water cofee tea snack in room
80070,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The bed was too soft for a bigger person I felt like I had to hang on the shower very small and no fridge , Loacation was great easy to get anywhere Lift is small but gratefully accepted Small supermarket on corner very convenient 
80071,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Nothing everything was good , Close to train and shops in the area Staff were helpful Rooms comfortable Wifi didnt work but receiptionist let me print from the receiption computer Free tea coffee in the room 
80072,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, dissapointed there was no bar and rooms could be a bit bigger difficult to move around, breakfast very good room very clean and tidy and modern bathroom small but very efficent
80073,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room too small and AC didn t work it was too hot also the elevator was too small to fit 2 people with 2 medium bags, Location just 3 minutes walk from Earl s court underground near shops and restaurants 
80074,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Very close to Earl s Court tube station in a lovely small street Clean refurbished and very good English breakfast Excellent hotel with great value for money 
80075,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Wifi a bit hit and miss but didn t impact on a very enjoyable stay , Stayed one night as a girlie treat with my mum and despite being given the wrong room to begin with we were given a double rather than the twin specified at booking Veronica was delightfully helpful and apologetic and our actual room was perfect Spacious well appointed and clean as well as being ideally located for Earl s Court Underground and walking to Chelsea Kensington Would definitely stay again 
80076,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, No water bottles available in room , Very comfortable bed with a choice of pillows and a clean bathroom Late check out option and it was fairly quiet in the morning for those who like lay ins 
80077,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, shower head was broken towels were not all supplied I reported both immediately but although they offered to change my room I had unpacked and was rushing out for dinner I still didn t have a second bath towel when i came back but did get two extra hand towels When I checked out no one asked how was my stay Pillows were very big and I had a sore neck in the morning , Location is perfect
80078,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Reception is very small It would be nice to have bigger open reception with caffe space together then you can make more money too like across the street , Room is bit small but cannot complain for the price when you book ahead it is very reasonable 
80079,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, We had a problem with the air conditioning in our room and the hotel was full so they could not move us to another room However they really tried to make sure we are comfortable so brought a fan to the room and the next day even though it was Sunday they had someone come in and fix it , The hotel is small with a real nice feel of a victorian house to it it s in an old victorian building the rooms were renovated and are modernly designed The whole street is a row of victorian houses with a few hotels in the adjacent buildings The staff were extremely nice and very helpful It feels like they really care that you have a good experience There are small things you get for free like water bottles and cookies in the room The rooms are small but well arranged and were perfect for us Breakfast was a full English type breakfast with lots of selection We ended up eating too much Location is great It is about 2 min walk to the Earls Court tube station from which you can easily get to any of the interesting places in London There are a few restaurants and bars up the street which was also great for getting a bite or a drink and a supermarket at the closest street corner Getting there from Heathrow is just one 45 min underground trip from Heathrow or about a 30 min cab ride from there We are definitely coming back if they have vacancy the next time around
80080,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was cozy the shower was broken not fixed after we notified staff Wi fi was limited although during booking it said there would be wi fi , Room was clean tidy the hotel is located very close to the underground 
80081,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The LG1room was tiny had spider and spider web wifi didn t work AC was noisy I had to call the receptionist to turn it off couldn t sleep until my neighbours child slept he was screaming and I could hear their conversations and all , The location and the staff
80082,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was very nice but being in the basement meant we lacked light and air Saying that it didn t really affect us as we were out all day , The location was perfect for us a short walk to the underground and then a few stops to Wimbledon Plenty of places around for food drink The staff were very helpful and friendly The hotel felt modern clean and efficiently run 
80083,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The rooms were a little on the small side Fine for a short break but too small for a longer stay, Really good breakfast friendly staff great location 2 minute walk to Earls Court tube station and comfortable beds
80084,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Air con needed turning up , Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful especially in the restaurant very attentive The room was very tidy and compact shower excellent 
80085,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Unfortunately I found the room to be slightly small for a double with en suite Therefore not really very good value for money Also I think breakfast was priced a little high in regards to matching the price of the room Maybe should ve been included in the price of the room and costed more fairly , I liked how close to the station it s situated and it was definitely good accomodation Cleanliness was up to standard which is good so not a bad place to stay 
80086,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Air con noisey, the staff especially breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was very good Bed comfortable The hotel was immaculately clean Great location for our hyde park concert
80087,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Our room was on Lower Ground floor which is basically the basement The room was therefore very dark and also very small The breakfast was ok but the buffet was not that well stocked which meant we had to ask for more glasses juices eggs etc The wi fi did not work all the time , Good location with only a few hundred meters to Earls Court station Good pubs nearby The beds were comfortable Helpful staff 
80088,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Not consistently giving us face cloth instead of having to ask for them after the first day not re filling the water bottles every day a refrigerator would have helped out a lot due to there was plenty of space for it , The bed was my favorite part of the stay comfy and soft Clean room bathroom clean free bottle of water coffee and a cookie Wifi is good in the room Staff helpful and friendly they even ordered a pizza for us because we have no idead how to The location is literally a 5 min walk from the Tube grocery store restaurants star bucks and laundry mat Safe neighborhood 
80089,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, This was the worst hotel I ve ever stayed in during my life The first room they gave me lower ground floor means basement was tiny dark and dingy and right by the steps from the street down to the staff entrance so the staff had a nice view of my room and me The internet connection wouldn t work in that room so next day they moved me to a room on the 2nd floor which was marginally brighter but still tiny and the day after the internet was down for the whole day a disaster as I had urgent work to do The room was noisy you could hear people in other rooms using the shower and running water The bed was seriously uncomfortable At the prices they charge it was a total disgrace How it ever got a 4 rating is way beyond me , The staff members were fairly helpful
80090,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Well I think it s a joke that room we were given was classed as double I have never stayed in a smaller room To top it off the aircon only works in half of it even thougt the whole room is 3 x 2 metres To illustrate I couldn t fully open my suitcase anywhere in the room Definitely would not recommend this hotel , We were able to leave our luggage there prior to check in 
80091,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Receptionist should offer first rooms upstairs Rooms in basement are unacceptable Upstairs is nice and convenient , Localization is great Upstairs rooms are nice and comfortable 
80092,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, the boiler or AC makes a lot of noise so it was very hard to sleep with the constant humming and could hear next door neighbours through the wall like they were In the same room In addition air quality is poor also because the room Is a bit moldy , Location next to Earl s court station Affordable The basement flat that has its own entry 
80093,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was designated as an upgrade It as extremely small for 2 people The temperature control sporadic at best, The staff was very friendly and tried to be helpful getting our temperature under control Location was great 
80094,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Although this can t be changed the rooms were a bit on the small side But to be fair they moved us to a bigger room without any fuss, The staff were amazingly helpful the hotel was very clean The location was excellent 
80095,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, For the price I d expect breakfast to be included Even if it was just continental and extra for full English, The staff were excellent Very helpful and cheerful Room was small but had everything you could need Even had a iron and ironing board which I thought was a nice touch
80096,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Terrible beds ridiculously soft saggy old mattresses with springs that I could feel digging into me Also shorter than a regular bed would have been terrible for anyone taller than me I am 5 ft 5 and my feet were on the end of it In addition there was what I can only describe as a super thermal winter duvet in summer making it so incredibly hot that I could not sleep under it even with the noisy air con set to very cold I literally have never known a duvet like it It belongs in the arctic There were no sheets either so it was either super hot duvet or nothing The bed and duvet meant that I had an absolutely horrific night of barely any sleep Room was also unbelievably tiny and the corridors etc are the same giving it a bit of a b and B feel Considering we paid 180 it was not good at all and breakfast would have added another 30 but we decided against it Some staff were unfriendly but then perhaps I wasn t in the best mood to judge them kindly after such a horrible sleepless night No mini bar or fridge either I would not stay there again , Very clean room nice bathroom some staff were OK 
80097,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The Russian German female MGR was terrible and cold and downright Gestapo like zero pleasant THEY OVERCHARGED Me on room nightly fee waiting for that adjustment TRIED to charge me for the two morning breakfasts this was to be included and also my POINTS to my BEST WESTERN member card the Russian MGR balked at giving that to me then agreed HOSPITALITY from her and customer service was not pleasant Leak in the room from rain which did stop but , loved some of the staff Louie was wonderful and helpful I also liked the other late desk concierge his name He was black and really helpful when i had dinner delivered Also breakfast was amazing BUT they tried to charge me extra as this was included IN ROOM FEE RATE
80098,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was tiny but it did had everything I needed , Cleanliness excellent breakfast very good stuff always helpful excellent location in the terms of public transportation
80099,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The only downside of the hotel was the matress of bed which was too soft , The hotel is very well located just 4 min walking distance to the tube station It s also located in a quiet road The room was clean and well decorated I was first alocated a basement room however I couldn t open the window The hotel staff moved me to another room which was very nice I also enjoyed the continental breakfast with warm croissants 
80100,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The bed It reminded me of the first innerspring mattress my parents purchased 65 years ago They thought it was great I almost feared I would roll out of bed during the night , I liked the location of the hotel It was on the Piccadilly line convenient for LHR and Eurostar I enjoyed staying in the Earls Court neighborhood The hotel was on a quiet street and the tube and buses were just a block away The TV line up was so good I sometimes found it hard to break away from it and leave my room 
80101,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Single room is very small For example opening a normal suitcase is possible in only one place and there it blocks either bathroom or hallway door The bed is also very small I am 180 cm 5 feet 11 inches and I doubt that anybody taller than me could sleep in it There is a noticeable draft from the window even in mid May Considering the bed is next to the window during window this would be very uncomfortable Loaning a plug adaptor costs more than a new adaptor from a shop Sadly I found this out when checking out The info folder tells about the possibility of a lending one and need for a deposit but not that there is a fee for it Neither did the front desk person lending me the unit , Hotel s location is very nice very close to Earl s Court station The hotel has been recently renovated and in nice condition 
80102,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I had reserved online through booking com two rooms a double room for my parents and a single room for a friend of theirs I had booked both rooms as refundable on purpose if anything came up in the four months prior to their stay Reading more reviews on the hotel in different portals I got worried about feedback on the size of the rooms and decided to go and take a look myself as I wanted my parents to be as comfortable as possible The lady at reception was friendly and showed me two rooms the size of the double room was ok but the single room felt really claustrophobic Besides there was nothing warm or welcoming abt the place and I absolutely did not want my parents to stay there When I got home I discovered that I had made a mistake and only the double room was fully refundable while the single room was on a non refundable rate I called booking com right away and asked for advice they were very friendly and told me that most hotels agree to returning the money nonetheless which is in their discretion especially if there is still 4months to resell the room and the booking had just been made a few days ago I phoned the hotel straight away and they told me they would not be willing to let me off the hook I then walked by another day in the hope to have a better dialogue in person and the answer remained the same I did find a hotel nearby the Cranley hotel bina gardens for about the same price which was absolutely delightful with tasteful big rooms where my parents had a wonderful stay I can only recommend to anyone looking for a room to look elsewhere it s unbelievable how different a package you can get for the same price ,No Positive
80103,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Internet signal was almost none on the 4th floor The location is convenient but the Eiffel Tower area needs a big renovation and maintenance , Bed was very comfty hair dryer worked very good great shower pressure and hot water

80106,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The bathroom was like a sauna heating on full blast and no way to turn it off The lift is too small to take a pram hall ways are too narrow I had to walk like a crab with pram and car seat and the room is small , Clean and quiet location for London 
80107,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was dull dirty carpet and disgusting chair covered in stains The was a stale smell of old perfume and the heating and air conditioning didn t work properly The shower head was old and the bathroom small I don t think this hotel deserves 4 star status , Good location friendly staff
80108,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, There were many small glitches during my stay locked out of room several times noisy other guests nearby walked in on when relaxing on bed etc etc BUT I must stress that staff responded very well and everything was sorted to my satisfaction I would say more a 3 than 4 , Location 1 minute from tube Good rate Staff pleasant and helpful

80117,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, No hot water first morning Noisy basement room My colleagues room was tiny Hair dryer very poor bordering on dangerous plug wires exposed The tap on the sink is designed and placed so that you cannot place your face near enough to the sink to wash it without splashing water everywhere , Bed very comfortable

80127,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Carpet very tired looking which gave the room a musky feel No peace with constant noise despite on a side street I can only describe it as a goods truck constantly loading unloading or was it the lift going up and down I was very disappointed to not get my quality sleep after a 14 hr working day my previous stay at this hotel was pleasant which was why I returned this time , Location perfect being 5 minute walk from Earls Court tube station and main road for convenience shops and restaurants
80128,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, 1st room not clean BUT they changed us right away 2nd was all fine i guess was a random thing wifi need to insert a new code every day wifi signal on 1st room not that strong on 2nd all fine room small same as in most hotels around in that area, Area full of restaurants too close to tube Earls Court and close to easyjet drop points Hotel staff all very kind serving and with positive energy especially Pascal 1st time i recall all receptionists names

80135,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The promised iron ironing board didn t appear When I asked for a printed copy of my invoice on the morning of checking out this was thrust at me without a word by the sullen unsmiling receptionist , The room was spotlessly clean and the location was perfect for getting to work the following day 
80136,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was pretty cramped really a double bed in a single room The TV was on an angle bracket over the bed which shows there wasn t enough room for both I wish I d taken a picture , Average 3 hotel Good location for the money

80139,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Where the toilet is situated in the room was strange Other than that there was nothing at all to complain about As a frequent world traveler and an even frequent traveler to London this has been THE best value for money I have encountered so far , The hotel is modern and the rooms have been updated to modern standards All fixtures and furniture are new Each room has it s own digital heat control The location was very convenient in Earl s Court Lot s of restaurants and 3 tube connections High Street Kensington is a short and beautiful 5 10 minute walk away and the surrounding streets are filled with gorgeous London architecture 
80140,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Great hotel very well located and fantastic value for money When we left the hotel jet lagged and with small children we forgot to clear our safe deposit box The hotel staff were incredibly helpful looking after our valuables contacting us and helping us arrange for them to be couriered to our next destination Cannot speak highly enough of the excellent service 
80141,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Can be cold as the air con for heating the room can take a while, Love the hot breakfast although u need to be there at times when the fresh cooked food comes out Staff are very helpful and always happy to help
80142,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, The room was sooo tiny but it didn t bothered us , Personal was great and very helpful Hotel itself is like 100 meters walk from metro station so its position is just perfect Also beds was super comfy 
80143,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Furniture is dated carpet was VERY dirty Narrow corridors and small lift It is old building everything is quite narrowed Basement room little depressive Breakfast doesn t deserve 4 it was a bit simple however was possible to get some choices , Sure rooms are small but it is not hidden from the hotel and what do you expect for that price Go to Hilton for 3x price and you ll get more comfort Personnel is nice Wifi works well even in basement 
80144,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Cold room when you enter and so the heater needs to be switched on , The beds are comfy They offer a hot breakfast buffet bar They offer cappuccino

80146,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Very helpful staff good location close to tube station with good transport links Good sized room for London very clean and comfortable Hotel felt safe 
80147,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, They gave me a room in lower ground and said I would have to take the stairs with baggage to reach the room as that room was without lift access it was not mentioned in my booking Later the receptionist asked to pay 30 pounds more for a bigger room which was not true that was a very small room as well which I paid , I liked the location 
80148,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Very small room in the basement and window facing the street with light coming in because curtains were not completely blackout ones Key never worked when I got back at night The mattress was so old and uncomfortable that I have slept horribly during my whole stay , Close to the Tube and lots of restaurants and pub in the area 
80149,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, See above, I booked well in advance I arrived only to be told my room was external entry to the hotel and lower ground Not the best for woman travelling on her own Ivea was on call that evening and assisted in finding me a room next door at Lors Jim 
80150,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, I booked a room for 3 Adults as my daughter is 17 there was a double bed and a very small uncomfortable camp bed which we were all too big for and the room was small , Location was ideal for the Albert Hall very clean and very close to tube station
80151,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Their attitude awful in dealing with customers specially their management they should be more respectful in a way they talks The hotel is too expensive compare to the size of the room There is no space for a suit case The toilet is small narrow The elevator in the hotel is too small only for one person has space Not advisable at all 0 score deserves , Nothing 
80152,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, There was not hot water when we prepared to leave The heating system was too noisy to sleep The view was really bad , Quiet hotel clean rooms and close to underground station 
80153,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, It is advertised as a 4 hotel but that s criminal misrepresentation to be honest I was put in a dungeon of a room with a loo squashed against a wall a shower I couldn t stand up in and a tiny single bed The wifi didn t work painfully slow kept cutting out the TV aerial was broken no TV at all not even terrestrial and I couldn t work out how to let the water out of the bath They don t even provide glasses so you can have a glass of water , The receptionist was nice enough location is handy for Earl s Court tube it was clean and the towels were fluffy that s about it I m afraid 
80154,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Although the buffet breakfast was good the cooked food was lukewarm at best maybe the temperature of the heaters on the unit needs to be cranked up The hotel had free wifi which is excellent but you need to get a new password every 24 hours which is a bit of a hassle On the day of our check out the TV mysteriously stopped working and wouldn t show any channels and the fire alarm went off in our room only I think these are fairly underhand tactics to get you out of your room before the 10am checkout time which is too early in my opinion , The hotel is really close to Earls Court and West Brompton stations and there s lots of shops and restaurants near by if needed The staff were friendly and attentive 
80155,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Noisy air con when operating in heat mode Feels like a minor fix of the vents that need to be addressed , Super polite and helpful personnel Modern room styling

80158,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Small room Tiny even A couple refused their room as it was too small while I was booking in Noisy at night Fan and early morning reception staff clumping overhead from early hours onwards kept me awake Quite claustrophobic in basement with dubious fire exit safety, convenient position Friendly efficient staff Clean Warm
80159,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, As it s typical in London the room is small However it could be nicer if the furnitures and the design would be more practical e g there is a pretty big desk next to the bed makes very inconvenient to open the door of the bathroom It was almost impossible to close the window properly and the frame of the window was moldy , The hotel is close to the Earl s Court station easy to reach The staff is nice and helpful The bathroom seems to be recently refurbished and it was clean 
80160,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Room smelled bad as did a lot of the hotel common areas The room was really small and in the basement which I apparently couldn t move My kids felt it was sort of creepy Tiny bathroom and the bathroom door closet door and edge of bed are will with about 10 inches of each other Must plan ahead when maneuvering around with multiple kids in the room too I mainly stayed there because I needed to stay in that specific area I will look for a different hotel next time , Great location very close the Earl s Court tube station less than two blocks

80165,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, At 11 pm a truck arrives at the front of the hotel to pick up Laundry They are incredibly noisy at a late hour in the evening when many people are just going to sleep , Location is my primary reason for using this hotel
80166,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, The location The hotel is only 3 4 min walk to Earl s Court station There are many bars restaurants and convenient stores nearby Although I requested for upper story room the receptionist recommended the ground floor room for us It was a good recommendation as it would be quite troublesome for us to use a small lift with our big luggage Room is clean and big enough for 3 people 
80167,Best Western The Boltons Hotel London Kensington, Tv didn t work for the first day and they couldn t fix it or move me to another room Stone cold breakfast when I told the waitress how cold it was so cold I couldn t eat it she was just rude , Bed was ok
