20472,Covent Garden Hotel, There is nothing not to like about this place , Lovely lounge and bar to escape the city for some relax time if needed Also best coffee in London just over the road from the hotel 
20473,Covent Garden Hotel, Breakfast was a little slow on our second morning when we went down later This was the only time we did not feel impeccable looked after and once problem recognised the staff once again make amends with gracious style , Really comfortable bed Luxurious bathroom Plenty of space and comfort in twin room shared with my mum Pillow spray a lovely extra treat The lounge is a wonderful space to spend some time when not out and about with the added thrill of using the honesty bar to make you feel at home 
20474,Covent Garden Hotel, We were disappointed our breakfasts were only luke warm on arrival at the table and in our opinion were not quite up to five star standard , Beautifully decorated room and indeed hotel itself This is the third time we have stayed in a Firmdale hotel and we are staying again next month We love them 
20475,Covent Garden Hotel, Nothing , Best hotel in London Don t stay anywhere else Every little detail was superb staff were sooooo friendly and helpful from the doorman to the personal trainer to the concierge I didn t want to leave It was exactly as a hotel experience should be I can t say enough about it
20476,Covent Garden Hotel, big fault no coffee or tea making facilities in room breakfast good but very expensive and all items a la carte if stay again would consider breakfast elsewhere, excellent location and a beautiful room caring staff free champagne as on first visit wide selection of breakfast food did not eat in restaurant so cannot comment
20477,Covent Garden Hotel, We have grown accustomed to having help yourself coffee available in the morning or at least a make your own coffeemaker in the room There were no perks like that at this hotel , Everyone was so nice the rooms were immaculate and the bed was so comfortable 
20478,Covent Garden Hotel, None , The excellent location and very elegant design of the rooms Very nice and helpful reception The breakfast is high end level included Early check in is available if sending email to Booking com in advance 
20479,Covent Garden Hotel, At first we were placed on the lower floor below the lobby While the room was beautifully designed it was not a pleasant experience There was little lighting in the room and no view of the street above Staff was constantly walking around in addition to other hotel guests on their way to the gym or the library It was not quiet However we were quickly accommodated and moved to a room we loved , The hotel was lovely Small and boutique but in the heart of London walking distance from everything So many restaurants shops and coffeeshops around The staff was lovely and helpful Rooms are beautifully designed and comfortable 
20480,Covent Garden Hotel, Nothing in this life you tend to get what you pay for , Beds v comfy Staff v attentive but not overbearing Relaxed luxury not pompous but still classy 
20481,Covent Garden Hotel, Booked as a special Christmas present for my wife musical and nice hotel Although room was lovely we were disappointed to find it was a basement room Disappointment further compounded on return from show by food and cooking smells in room from nearby kitchen Breakfast average eggs benedict on somewhat hard muffin Overall ok but not the special hotel we had expected for the price , Staff were most helpful and friendly
20482,Covent Garden Hotel, The only complaint and it s not really a complaint is that there was no tea making facility in the room, Excellent staff Nothing too much trouble Lots of really nice touches
20483,Covent Garden Hotel, I had a call from reception to turn the TV down because the room next to me couldn t sleep And it was not that loud I assume it is not souitable for big families I was alone so I enjoyed the peaceful atmospher, I was looking for a place where I can clear my mind and relax this was the right place
20484,Covent Garden Hotel, A couple of long waits in the brasserie and a chipped glass a brief apology and a complimentary glass of tap water , Lovely room very spacious comfortable bed and great linen Large bathroom with big bath and separate shower All immaculately clean Staff as always charming Lovely atmosphere in the bar brasserie very good if you are alone I have been coming here for years and I will be back soon 
20485,Covent Garden Hotel, Not a thing , Central location with incredible customer service Excellent on site restaurant and fitness facilities Great hotel for families as they go the extra mile for the little ones This is our new go to hotel in London 
20486,Covent Garden Hotel, I don t like the idea of the bar closing relatively early and an honesty bar for residents While the beautiful drawing room is very relaxing there is nothing like a bar atmosphere in it , Almost everything was wonderful The junior suite was beautiful and very comfortable Everything very roomy and bright Breakfasts were delicious with loads of everything available 
20487,Covent Garden Hotel,No Negative, Loved loved loved our stay here Yes it s a beautiful hotel with the most gorgeous textiles and facilities but the staff were what made this a truly awesome experience When we returned from our afternoon trip our 6 yr old s toy owl was sleeping in a basket underneath a baby blanket It made us all chuckle and made our boy feel special Every element from breakfast to room service the glorious beds to the impressive bathrooms was just that extra special Will be returning again and again 
20488,Covent Garden Hotel, We liked everything , The staff all went out of their way to help us and talk to us We hugged several when we left We also loved our fabulous room with its unique decor comfy bed and seating area and luxurious bathroom The gorgeous first floor lounge and honesty bar provided the perfect meeting place for us and our friends We were always eager to return to our hotel and wanted to spend more time there We knew we d made the right choice when we arrived in a terrible rainstorm and two people with umbrellas ran out to our taxi to escort us inside 
20489,Covent Garden Hotel, The dinner was not very exciting Had a very traditionel Sunday lunch with all the trimmings But unfortunately it didn t come up as well as we were expecting Meat dry and a over cooked Potatoes and Yorkshire pudding the best , Nice and cosy hotel in a superb location in London Had a lovely library were we had complementary champagne Very traditional 
20490,Covent Garden Hotel,No Negative, This was not my first stay at this property The only time I do not stay at this property while in London is when they cannot book me a room I ve taken my mother and close friends there There is something to be said about no surprises and that is why I keep returning Emilion in the restaurant and Emmanuella at the front desk were extraordinary 
20491,Covent Garden Hotel, We reserved two rooms one of which is a deluxe double room with a bathtub which is recorded on the Booking com s confirmation document However there was no bathtub in the room and the staff at the front desk told that it was a pity that Booking com showed incorrect information on web and there was not such room available for us After a discussion they offered a higher rate room with a bathtub We enjoyed London trip very much but did not enjoy the discussion We stayed at the room paying extra charge but for us it was not a pleasant experience and the explanation of the staff at the front desk was not trustworthy nor reliable , The location was very good 
20492,Covent Garden Hotel, lovely but expensive breakfast No priority for hotel guests on the terrace so we had to sit on the sidewalk until a group passers by finished their 1 soda until we could enjoy our pre dinner drinks , Location charming decorations size of the room staff We ll go back
20493,Covent Garden Hotel, My stay was only for one night Drinks from the Honesty bar a bit pricey but London prices I guess, A lovely hotel with a boutique feel Very clean and good central location but no nuisance noise affecting my stay Would definitely book again

20496,Covent Garden Hotel, Nothing at all hope to be back , Room was large and bright with all mod cons Large bathroom with two basins and lovely amenities Hotel is charming in appearance but modern in facilities Ate lunch and breakfast in the restaurant and had drinks at the bar All wonderful food was delicious and obviously fresh Eggs Benedict for breakfast were best we have ever eaten anywhere the hollandaise sauce was light and fluffy Good selection for breakfast great coffee and good and friendly service throughout Concierge was helpful with various questions 
20497,Covent Garden Hotel, Minor minor detail No tea and coffee facilities in the room but room service within minutes , This is an excellent no faults it s all there luxury Lindon hotel Great attention to detail and well worth the money It s not cheap but then again it s Lindon and its high end So just enjoy

20505,Covent Garden Hotel, The breakfast was a bit of a disappointment the first morning the process was not explained to us very well the second morning the young waitress explained all the options to us although i did have to wait 10 minutes and ask twice for the cereal bowl to be filled before i could have some it seemed a bit hit and miss on the pastries as there was not a lot of selection on either morning We normally stay in either the Waldorf or Savoy both 5 star and their breakfast is the same sort of cost but with a lot more choice of items to choose from , The location was very good and the hotel very clean as you would expect from a 5 star one
