21919,Maison Souquet,No Negative, The hotel is fantastic in design I love the curtains the wall and every other decorations They are all exquisite and exotic for me Also the hotel is near to the Eurostar station 15 mins car so it is convenient to move luggages There are lots of nice restaurants near the hotel with a wide range of food types to choose from Most importantly the hotel staff cleans the room frequently so I give a definite five star for the cleaness of the room 
21920,Maison Souquet, Very poor lighting in room And no lights in hallway until you walk than they turn on By sensor Scary to be in the dark in a hotel Esp Coming off the elevator Rooms are candle like lights only Too dark to find things in your room Better hotels for the money Such tiny rooms 2 people couldn t fit comfortably Even at night all lights are out key activated Good luck going to toilet in the night find your way in total darkness Lights by key st the door ,No Positive
21921,Maison Souquet, My clothes pressing took a bit longer then what I have been told it would take, staff were very welcoming and helpful my room was beautiful and the hotel s decor was absolutely gorgeous 
21922,Maison Souquet, Hardly anything , Attention to detail made all the difference the room was small but perfectly appointed very comfortable and quiet The staff were amazing spoke excellent English and were charming The breakfast was simple but delicious croissants scrambled eggs fruit salad orange juice and the best tea outside of Sri Lanka I have had The location is ideal 2 minutes from the metro near all sorts of eating places quiet but central There is a rather seedy area round the corner but being so near to the Moulin Rouge its what you would expect
21923,Maison Souquet, The breakfast in our room was a little under whelming One cup of coffee each and not a pot and overall wasn t up to the standard of the rest of the stay , Staff were superb Made to restaurant recommendations over the weekend which were perfect 
21924,Maison Souquet, We had a great trip to Paris and loved the hotel However I have been charged twice which having googled is a regular problem with booking com I am absolutely furious as there hotel assured me that they we re just holding the amount My bank has confirmed that I have been charged twice ,No Positive
21925,Maison Souquet, On arrival I d left my luggage in reception as I was meeting my friend in the bar and I was assured this would be carried up to the room When we got to the room hours later in the evening my luggage had not been delivered had to ask for it Secondly the wellness area is nice but the CCTV camera is really off putting one feels observed If this is for security it would be better to have some other emergency alarm system , The staff were very nice and attentive Very good beds Very nice rooms but rather small even the Junior Suite This may be normal for Paris best to always check square footage before booking 
21926,Maison Souquet,No Negative, All the staff were excellent they couldn t do enough for you very helpful nothing was too much trouble which made our stay great fun and recommendations for restaurants were superb Maison Souquet is definitely special Looking forward to returning again soon 
21927,Maison Souquet, It was a little hot inside Tiny bar was rather crowded this time , Very unique hotel with only few rooms Location is excellent for walks Every room has a different character and story 
21928,Maison Souquet, Nothing to say , Warm and welcoming atmosphere Pierre was a great host for our stay from the beginning till the end Explained the history of the hotel was flexible with the private spa times which we could use as long as we want Great room service awesome breakfast wine lovers will find some excellent stuff on the menu the hotel is absolutely a secret tip 
21929,Maison Souquet, A little dark inside the cupboards Proper feather down pillows are needed mattress not quite as sumptuous as some hotels , Excellent staff lovely spa 
21930,Maison Souquet, we missed out on the private booking of the spa as I booked though booking com the hotel wouldn t allow me to book in advance even though I asked and were staying in a suite and so by the time we got there the only option was the crack of dawn on Sunday morning which after a night on the town was too early , the hotel is beautiful full of character easy walking distance to everything you need they couldn t do enough if you wanted something a taxi or a recommendation for somewhere to eat I would highly recommend Maison Souquet and would return without hesitation
21931,Maison Souquet,No Negative, Unique incredibly sexy little 5 star creating an atmosphere of the Paris of your fantasies located in a once infamous nowdays more more trendy but still authentic neighbourhood literally just steps from Moulen Rouge Montmartre Inpeccable attentive service discretion We loved the experince coming back soon 
21932,Maison Souquet,No Negative, excellent staff Pierre and Clemence in particular were great hosts The bar was a real delight perfect decor setting with great cocktails Staff were only too happy to make specific cocktails on request
21933,Maison Souquet, Not sure We enjoyed everything about our stay , Maud was an exceptional hostess My wife and I felt like we were staying in HER hotel She took care of all of our needs and wishes booking a romantic dinner overlooking the Louvre for my wife s 50th birthday and helping to plan our daily excursions throughout Paris The facilities were world class 
21934,Maison Souquet, It was mostly excellent one morning I asked for a pastry recommendation and the person suggested Le Pain Quotidien I m nitpicking here but given I was in Paris I don t expect to be sent to a chain store which exists in the UK when there are pastry coffee shops on every corner That s a small criticism of an otherwise brilliant place , The hotel is beautiful it oozes character it has a strong theme it s quiet the service is friendly disarming and discreet the cocktail bar is beautiful and the cocktails are absolutely excellent The spa which you hire solely for your own use rather than sharing with other guests is incredibly peaceful and private Nice location too A great hotel 
21935,Maison Souquet, It was just as it should be and better , Deliciously quirky and decorated with magnificent decadence Refreshingly friendly staff sublime cocktails and a wonderfully comfortable bed in a hushed room 
21936,Maison Souquet, The breakfast seems a bit overpriced , This has to be one of the best hotels in Paris The ambience the location and the unbelievably friendly staff makes this the perfect destination for a weekend stay I have stayed at many five star hotels around the world but this certainly has to be among top 3 
21937,Maison Souquet, Nothing it s perfect, Extremely lovely hotel with great attention to detail Wonderful that one can use the pool and hammam privately don t forget to reserve in advance Food is top quality This will be the only address in Paris I ll ever stay at 
21938,Maison Souquet, Our room was quite small I struggled to find a place to do my daily push ups without banging into things Tiny outside area in constant shade A roof terrace would make this place stellar , Friendly and very helpful staff Very elegant interior Excellent cocktails Well sound isolated so no noise from the outside traffic or people 
21939,Maison Souquet, The location is convenient enough but not ideal when you think of areas to stay in the city However we still were able to walk everywhere , The hospitality from the staff was absolutely amazing This boutique hotel is definitely a hidden gem The spa pool was a great way to unwind after a long day in the city and the bar gave us every comfort possible 
21940,Maison Souquet, There was a small issue with the private pool but the staff dealt with it quickly and professionally, The decor and location were brilliant The staff were exceptional too 
21941,Maison Souquet,No Negative, Pierre was very helpful and kind He kindly gave us lots of advice on places to visit gave us tour maps for directions and made reservations for restaurants and shows on our behalf

21946,Maison Souquet,No Negative, the upgrade that they did for my husband birthday was amazing the decoration in every room was wonderful the bar area is heavenly the products in the room hermes orangje vert are the best we ever had the private pool downstairs is the reason why we will come back
21947,Maison Souquet, You better off going to the cafes all around the hotel for breakfast , Excellent service and facility I like the ambiance which is very romantic and personal The have this scented candle made exclusively for the hotel The place is very parisian Loooove the basement pool and steam toom and massage room that you can book all for your own exclusive indulgence for an hour Great ambiance and drinks at the salon Few steps away from Moulin Rouge 
21948,Maison Souquet, rooms are super small not even a desk is available in the room nor a chair just a bed bathroom amenities are minimal the room cleaners dont know their job and move everything around they even opened our suitcases which was very odd , the location was nice staff were helpful other than the breakfast staff 
21949,Maison Souquet, It was already known that the rooms are small tight yet still loved the decor, The ambience makes for a sensual atmosphere to invite a more intimate encounter with your loved one
21950,Maison Souquet,No Negative, Fabulous location 10 mintues from Gare du Nord in Montmartre just opposite the Moulin Rouge Tiny louche and intimate jewel of a boutique hotel with super friendly young staff who are knowledgeable helpful Lots of interesting food shops places to eat outside of hotel Must try an exotic cocktial in their purple velvet bar 
21951,Maison Souquet,No Negative, It was worth every penny The staff and Nico were so wonderful and helpful The pool hammam were amazing and relaxing The decor was so luxurious and from my favorite time period The drink I had at the bar was AMAZINGLY delicious I think it was called Paiva or something 
21952,Maison Souquet,No Negative, We have travelled quite a lot through Europe Asia and America coming from Australia and the service and experience here at Maison Souquet was at a very high standard We enjoyed the banter with Alex our Butler and Alexandre the concierge Very knowledgeable and friendly team and great location with easy access to subway station Blanche to get around Paris Highly recommend you stay here 
21953,Maison Souquet,No Negative, Appreciated the ambiance of the hotel the grandeur and the history only improvement would have been a larger room as we were rather cramped however that was the compromise in order to have a bath

21955,Maison Souquet,No Negative, Stayed for 2 nights for our honeymoon The perfect hotel Staff were so friendly spa was beautiful Decor immaculate Food typically French and perfect 
21956,Maison Souquet, Was disappointed that the hammam was not working for some reason Also the toiletry was not topped up during my stay of 3 days I was forgetting to remind them but I would expect this to be done in a 5 stars hotel without me requesting it , What I liked most was how the stuff were polite friendly and helpful In particular I would like to praise a member of the stuff at the reception called Constance He was super friendly and helpful

21958,Maison Souquet,No Negative, We had a very nice stay at Maison Souquet We enjoyed the location in Montmartre neighborhood and 50 meters from Moulin Rouge Staff was very attentive and they made our stay more enjoyable Drinks at the bar was also very good We also had the opportunity to use the private spa and the wonderful swimming pool 
21959,Maison Souquet, rooms are small for the price paid and staff is still working out the kincks Wifi is spotty , Beautiful lobby Location is great if you like to walk and prefer as we do to not be in a very touristy part of town
21960,Maison Souquet, This hotel is trying to pitch for a high class standard but in a rough location Spaces facilities and rooms are quite small The staff although very friendly they are not well experienced Value for money poor and breakfast not included Parking is hopeless , Very striking decorations in the depiction of its original boudoir history Nice play on the past and location of this property 
21961,Maison Souquet, The spa in the basement wasn t quite finished but considering the hotel was only been open 4 months I can t really complain , We stayed here for our honeymoon in a wonderful Junior Suite and were greeted by rose petals over the bedding and a bottle of champagne We stayed for 10 nights and as a thank you from the owners for a long stay they offered us another bottle of champagne towards the end of our stay Beautifully decorated warm and welcoming staff Rooms attended to twice daily so always super clean and tidy Hermes bath products were a welcome addition and the overall scent in the hotel was incredible Location excellent just opposite the Moulin Rouge and Blanche Metro station for access to the rest of Paris Loved the hotel and would definitely come back here again
