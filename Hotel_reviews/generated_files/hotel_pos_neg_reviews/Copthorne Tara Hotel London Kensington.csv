440985,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Didn t like the fact that the windows were sealed so no fresh air and air con was a bit too hot for us , Great location near to Tube station for all of central London attractions and Kensington High Street so no need to pay for expensive food in hotel Clean and comfortable room Easy reach from Paddington and our cases were kept safe in the hotel on the last day so we could explore more of London before returning home 
440986,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, They were unable to process our Amex Card Yet we had no trouble using it anywhere else in London, Great position walk to Kensington Palace Hyde Park close to station buses Helpful staff great amenities comfortable good size rooms 
440987,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Was a little pricey and bed was not as comfortable as I had expected Two lifts were in need of repair and so avoided them Pleasant enough no WOW factor , The position and restaurant selections were great and the club lounge provided a nice space for happy hour or just a quiet space during the day Staff were good and the stay was trouble free 
440988,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Need to work on the lifts elevators they weren t working correctly the entire week I even stepped out of an elevator twice because of alarm bells and malfunctions m, Your staff is great The location of the property although a bit off the beaten path iit is the best combination of quiet and near enough An easy walk to a main street underground station and bustling activity 
440989,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Room keys did not work we were given the wrong room number Two of the lights did not work The hairdryer did not work Unhelpful and unpleasant staff no apology given for inconvenience caused Will not book this hotel again,No Positive
440990,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Room was very dark had a job to see no main lighting bed lamp didn t work but managed with the other one till that one blew Carpet by bathroom was wet and stained think there must have been a leak but all mentioned to staff to look into , Nice to be upgraded to club class Great breakfast great view from bedroom and very comfortable Lovely Hotel very friendly staff and would definately stay here again 
440991,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The check in is very slow and the lifts are a nightmare to use as they don t make it clear to people that they need to use their room key You often see the same people just going up and down in very full lifts not able to figure out why the lift hasn t stopped on their floor , the location is good
440992,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The bed was quite old stained It was reasonably comfortable though A little TLC in the rooms would be beneficial glue up the peeling wallpaper etc, The location was great everything was easily accessible The rooms were large light Check in out were very easy
440993,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Right beside railway but noise not too bad Breakfast a bit underwhelming for 4 star hotel no veggie sausages for my veggie partner Cold croissants etc , Staff v friendly and helpful great location just off kensington high street Facilties and room v good Fridge in room great extra 
440994,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We had booked 3 rooms one was for my disabled elderly mother in law and her carer The hotel did not have the correct number of beds in the rooms They kept us waiting for 0ver 3 hours trying to organise extra beds which never appeared When we eventually got beds for everyone the rooms reeked of cigarette smoke Some of the sausages at breakfast were half raw Perhaps they were trying to poison us It was a complete shambles None of the staff seemed to have a clue and mostly spoke poor English After 2 weeks we eventually received an apology and refund for one of the 3 rooms Would never stay here again under any circumstances ,No Positive
440995,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Reception was poorly managed some of the lifts were not working properly There were not adequate towels placed in the room and we had to call a number of times before we got any After 1 night they again didn t sort the towels out and did not replenish the tea coffee until asked to There was also not enough toilet roll and we also had to ask for some more We complained to reception but they didn t seem to care but eventually offered to have the manager call us I still haven t heard from them ,No Positive
440996,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We booked a club room but it was just an ordinary room Poor quality toiletries no robes as advertised etc, this hotel is well located near Kensington High Street
440997,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Due to an event I was attending I contacted the hotel to enquire if I could drop my luggage off before room checkin I was informed I could do this The staff were very helpful on doing this When I did arrive to check in which was late at night the service was very prompt 
440998,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We had a very poor night s sleep because the mattress was far too firm and the synthetic pillows were hard We made a verbal complaint at reception and all they offered to do was to inform the management The lifts were operated via the room s swipe card but were temperamental stopping unexpectedly between floors on all but one journey we made We talked to fellow customers who said they had experienced the same problem We didn t report this because we had already complained about the bed Not surprisingly we won t be staying at the hotel again , The location was good Very close to the tube bus and nice shops 
440999,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I didn t like having to come home , I stay here every time I am in London The location facilities and above all the staff are so professional and helpful 
441000,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I have no complaint about this property , Very close to public transportation restaurants stores and to tourist attractions The room was comfortable and a good sized The staff were exceptionally helpful I would definitely go back in the future 
441001,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, club lounge breakfast cold brassiere also no cookies or muffins just plain biscuits no afternoon tea Service in the club lounge in the morning a shamble Staff at reception not very helpful ,No Positive
441002,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Breakfast very crowded and slightly chaotic Coffee was lukewarm and seemed to be served whenever it suited the waiters rather than the customer No hash browns or other form of potato and no omelette fresh egg station which has now become common in most hotels At 13 50 per person breakfast was poor value and there was no light alternative breakfast without leaving the hotel , Room was clean and comfortable Hotel is well located being close to the Underground and within walking distance of Royal Albert Hall Kensington Palace etc 
441003,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The bath room flooded when we showered The maintenance man who came to fix it was surly and grumpy He used all the towels to mop the water and left them in a soggy heap on the bathroom floor The radiator leaked we were woken by the drip drip I used a glass and our towels to soak up the water , I liked the breakfasts the efficiency of the reception staff and the location The conference I attended was in a well ventilated room Lunch involved long queues which took out a lot of the lunch time Could have been better explained and organised 
441004,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Slight frustration that there were no towels available on our arrival and we were not able to shower before going out in the evening after travelling all day staff did apologise but should not happen really , The location is very good 
441005,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, There were a few problems On arriving in the room found it was made up for a twin but we booked 9 double rooms so we had to ask to move There was only 1 towel in the room We had to ask 3 times to get an extra towel which finally arrived at gone midnight Twice during the evening and next morning we had to get the key reset for the room as it did not work This was annoying after getting to the room and having to go all the way back to reception , This is the 6th time of staying at the hotel The location is fantastic and very convenient 
441006,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I m not a fan of carpeting , The hotel is not the prettiest on the outside but the room was clean and staff was friendly and helpful Only a few minute s walk from High Street Kensington tube station 
441007,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Elevator, Strategic location many eateries and shopping outlets nearby ATM machine in the ground floor so i don t need to find currency exchange outlets
441008,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Found the room very hot stuffy at night even if we did have the aircon on full bore all day everyday and it was cold outside Had to sleep with the curtains open becoz of the way the aircon faces so early starts every morning , Taxi waiting outside mostdays or 100m round the corner close to tube
441009,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Television didn t work very well and a booked wake up call wasn t made, The location is excellent parking is very convenient Room was comfortable and quiet
441010,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The pillow is quite flat only one bathrobe and 1 pair of bedroom slipper provided The breakfast spread remains the same for the 5 days that i was there , The location is great with shops restaurants cafes nearby The lounge room and lounge floor makes me feel more secure as I wa travelling alone with my 10yr old 
441011,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Bit chaotic with poor communication Room not fully ready although we d spoken to them about early check in and they d confirmed okay But when we came back several hours later they said no room was ready and to come back in an hour or pay to upgrade to a more expensive room Finally they got us in a room that wasn t really ready bed configuration was wrong so someone had to come and rearrange the room shower gel and other bathroom items not fully stocked so we had to call down for those But they did sort these later when we asked Just took about an hour to get room sorted Content and decor in room and bathroom a little old and worn but clean and sufficient and comfortable , Staff friendly and tried to be helpful but was a little chaotic Place was clean and correct rooms good and comfortable 
441012,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, No breakfast The lift were not very good Breakfast not included and yet price of room 110 per night and that was supposed to be a bargain , There was terrible noise all morning on my last day How could they organise for loud drilling work to be done when there are gusts next door The lack of breakfast included was a bit tight considering the cost of the room 
441013,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The place was a lot older than I thought The mugs were sometimes not cleaned and the carpet was somewhat old and dusty A little bit of renovation work would really make this place better , Regarding the other hotels nearby this hotel has bigger rooms considering the price The High Street Kensington station is only 3 min walk away and the underground tube easily takes you to the main spots in London in 15 20 mins 
441014,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The bed was just a double bed normally I have found hotels have king size Our friends who traveled with us found the double size too small My husband and I would have preferred king size too The bed was comfortable and we slept well enough though The furniture was a bit dated and could probably do with an upgrade but the room was very clean and a good size , The breakfast choice and quality was very good All the staff were very friendly and helpful We actually had an excellent view over the city from our room as we were on the 12th floor However our friends who travelled with us were less fortunate as they were allocated the 5th floor 
441015,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We were given a disabled room and the automatic door was heavy and i was standing in the open door trying to take room service off the waiter when the door hit me really hard and nearly dropped the room service ,No Positive
441016,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I will not come back to this hotel It s old looks great on pictures but reality is disappointing , Location is very good at Kensington with underground connection and a lot of buses 
441017,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Concierge acted like he could not be bothered to answer a question one morning However the desk clerk when we checked in was very pleasant There was not an elevator at the subway stop so it was difficult for me to get my luggage up the stairs upon arrival and down the stairs on departure , Location to the subway was down a back alley nighttime was unnerving Location to a Marks and Spencer grocery store and other shopping was nice Very good location to see Kensington Palace and gardens 
441018,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, The location of the hotel is great Near the underground and shops at High St Kensington The rooms are large and very clean Excellent value for money 
441019,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, We stayed in room 1133 and there was an issue with the electrics My husband switched the shower on and the bathroom light went off This concerned us and suggested that the electrics were problematic My husband did report the problem on two separate occasions Apart from that concern all was fine 
441020,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Breakfast was cold especially the tea and coffee Should not have to pay extra for a hot chocolate and then receive a poor and cold one Should be served in a pot , Location was excellent and housekeeping service was quick Staff were lovely
441021,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Poor air conditioning and very noisy , Bed OK Cleaning could be better bath toilet very old need some renovation too many big furniture in the small room Some had spat in the hallway outside of room nr 323 it lay there for 4 days without being cleaned disgusting 
441022,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Check in too ages and staff disappeared into separate office for every check in I watched We were only 15 mins before checkin time but flatly refused to check if our room was available Could clearly hear the conversation from the couple in the next room, Location
441023,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Hotel had no details of my booking Tried to move us to another hotel After two hours of talks finally obtained the four rooms booked I will not be using your booking service or this hotel in the future, Nothing
441024,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Noticed the glass protecting the furniture needed to be cleaned underneath coffee And sugar granules had gathered The towels rather thin and frayed discoloured And unable to extend the check out time did not have a flight out untl 10 pm so long wait Prior to the lengthy return journey, Beds comfortable however we were unable to alter the sound could not increase Love the tea and coffee facilities
441025,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Perhaps some biscuits with the coffee tea facilities , Convenient to underground shops Also walking distance to Kensington Gardens Good sized rooms with double bed 
441026,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, THE ROOM FO A START tHE TOWELS IN THE BATHROOM WERE SO THIN IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET PROPARLY DRIED THE FRIDGE WAS EMPTY WHICH I FOUND UNBEILEVABLE THE HOTEL IS STUCK UN THE SEVENTIES AND IS NOT ACCEPTABLETO ME , Not Much The Reception was fine the room could benefit from a total upgade I didn t like it a all 
441027,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, This was a fabulous hotel my husband and I chose for our first wedding anniversary We were delighted to arrive and receive a complimentary upgrade and in our room we were overwhelmed to find a lovely card and cake to welcome and congraltualate us on our anniversary Could not reccomend this hotel enough so comfy and clean and great location 
441028,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms were extremely tired dated and the furniture was not in good condition at all Carpet was horrendous like being time transported to the 80 s But I hasten to add it was very clean and the bed although small was comfortable enough The windows were designed not to be opened so had to have a noisy air cooling system on that was very loud if you wanted the room cool enough for comfort The rooms were fine for us as we just needed a bed for the night whilst we were out shopping and site seeing in the day To be fair I wasn t expecting much anyway as it was the only hotel with rooms left after booking to see Adele who later cancelled her concert But if you wanted to treat yourself and your partner I d advise pick another hotel or upgrade the room , Breakfast was very good very good selection and tasty Staff were very friendly and efficient The loby and Resturant rooms were nice just a shame the bedrooms were not great Position was brilliant just a two minute walk to Kensington high street tube station on the circle and district lines and just two stops from paddington A couple of shops around that Close late boots etc and some cafes 
441029,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Initially allocated an extremely poor room We complained immediately and we were moved We did have to pay an extra 60 , Location and staff very helpful
441030,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Nothing, Lovely staff We were also lucky to be upgraded to guest of the day so had the added bonus of using the Executive Lounge If you can add this to your booking it is well worth it One of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in 
441031,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, It s London it was pricey But that s to be expected , The staff were without exception courteous and so helpful The breakfast was excellent Room clean quiet and comfortable 
441032,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I booked 2 rooms my friends room was ready but I had to wait until nearly 3 30pmfor my room , Charles was exceptionally brilliant Gave us drinks vouchers for the bar as we had to leave before the free evening drinks I the Club Lounge 
441033,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Overall brilliant but you could hear the train a little in the morning but I am a very light sleeper anyway The breakfast was 30 for 2 guests so I would suggest maybe eat out or book breakfast when booking the room , Comfy bed bathroom full of toiletry essentials hairdryer iron and fridge in room Got upgraded to a double room on arrival which was lovely No queues for the lift too
441034,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The rooms were very very dated Windows didn t open air conditioning poor Bathroom also very very dated and shower not powerful enough didn t like the old fashion rubber mat that was in the bath to stop slipping gem holder ,No Positive
441035,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, we missed free drinks in club suite due to a dinner already booked ready for the concert NO other issues during the stay, We were the guests of the day So upgraded to club suite Fantastic room with excellent views of the city Breakfast was excellent all hot food was good and range was exceptional
441036,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, The view from the room was not great it looked out to the back of the hotel I was happy with that as it was lovely and quiet and could not hear traffic noise 
441037,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Hotel in need of refurbishment room worn down A lot of noise from underground track poor sound reduction in windows , Great location very close to underground 
441038,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Breakfast is self service and we were later down the food was cold I would of complained on site but there were no staff around , The size of the bed and the room in general was great 
441039,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The architecture is a shock I expected something grand given the location but Copthorne Tara is not grand Think functional and you ll be alright The windows didn t open The window unit was old and didn t work well which meant the room smelled musty and was too warm during a sunny summer visit Shower curtain smelled bad Could use some modern updates , Location is excellent Very close to High Street Kensington Station 
441040,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Dont eat in the club lounge I found it to be quite small to cater for large mass of people at meal times Most staff are nice and accomodating but you do encounter a small number of staff that are rude and make sure you feel uncomfortable We ran out of toilet paper and it wasnt replaced during room service We rang concierge twice with no answer then attempted to contact reception which in turn transfered us to the same line again with no answer Please keep in mind I am not a whinger You just expect a standard of service for a facility that claims they are 4 stars , A lovely lady named Mai checked us in and upgraded us to a club room Location was great Train station just a short walk and so easy to use Restaurants and convenient store onsite incase you get so tired to go out for meals 
441041,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, In the up graded room the bed side lights witch did not work and so I had to turn the lights off by the door and find the bed in the dark , The bathroom was on the small side for an upgraded room I could not see what extras the upgrade I paid for had given me 
441042,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Check in was a complete mess I had booked two club rooms and had previously spoke to reservation for two rooms adjacent one for me and one for my Daughter travelling from Toronto AND WAS ALLOCATED ROOMS 1269 AND 1271 ON THE 12TH FLOOR My daughter checked in and was allocated room 1269 Great I arrived an hour later and was told that the only room available was 1240 my room had been allocated to someone else I could not believe the incompetence After about 40 minutes they found two rooms together on the 11th floor So my Daughter had to move all her belongings from one room to another BREAKFAST being in a club room we had access to the club Lounge went for Breakfast could not get a table all occupied redirected to the Main breakfast room Took away the pleasure of eating in the CLUB lounge which we Paid for NOT IMPRESSED This Hotel certainly needs a manager, Staff were good
441043,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Crowds large groups everywhere tours small lobby area long quewes at reception area impossible to call reception during the busy day hours no one would answer staff mostly non British and not all understood the concept of good customer service very expensive food and drinks in the bar and restaurant restaurant set up for the tour groups and individual guests subject to large crowds and noise slow service stressed staff etc horrible and very scary old elevators harried front desk reception staff wish they would have told me about the small bar in the hotel off to the side that didn t cater to the large Tour groups overall lack of tranquility, Location is excellent 
441044,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, No bath robes in the room even after asking at reception Food was very expensive and not great , Comfortable beds nice breakfast in the club room which was advertised as continental but did actually include a cooked breakfast 
441045,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Service in hotel was extremely slow Walked out of Asian restaurant as sat for so long without even getting a drink offered The tea at breakfast was disgusting 32 for 4 glasses of wine is daylight robbery , Location was brilliant Very close to shops bars restaurants sight seeing and Tube 2 mins from hotel
441046,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, nearly 30 minutes to check in check in clerk was not aware of Artists Corner restaurant for which I had requested a reservation online and said it was not at that hotel Lunchtime service in the brasserie on 29th was very poor and two of the five dishes served were disappointing , upgraded room because of poor service at reception was a bonus Nice room and comfortable bed
441047,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Everything was positive to us Grand daughter me Loved it, Some times you find a wonderful unexpected experience This was one Loved everything about this hotel Been telling everyone about this wonderful find Large rooms Executive lounge All pluses
441048,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, They weren t particularly helpful when I tried to arrange an early check in, Nice gesture in providing us with some cake to celebrate my 70th birthday
441049,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Late notice of move more expensive journeys to and from the event I was attending I booked into the Tara and was told that it was nearer to where my dinner was being held itn wasn t and I was very late The staff at the Copthorne Fulham were fantastic but the comms between the two hotels was poor , Great reception staff at the Copthorne in Fulham I was moved from the Tara to the Fulham one at late notice it cost me extra on the tube as this was in Zone 2 
441050,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Our only quibbles were that the room was very hot we were at the back end of a heatwave in London and the air conditioning was very very noisy and the windows did not open at all Also strangely the supplies of toiletries provided did not include a shower gel or hand soap , Staff were very helfpful and friendly Room was spacious and comfortable We did not eat in the hotel as we preferred to use the numerous cafes and restaurants very close by in Kensington High Street but did have a drink in the bar which was very pleasant 
441051,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Room very stuffy with no access to fresh air Bed had very firm mattress which affected my back , The location was excellent the staff extremely helpful and friendly Good free internet access 
441052,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I ve stayed here a lot over the years which makes it feel a bit home from home for me however the rooms are getting very tired now and bathrooms really aren t up to par Staff always amazing and that s what keeps me coming back however Copthorne please please re vitalise your rooms , Staff here are always friendly and helpful Location is good too 
441053,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Many facilities shop etc were shut when I got back from a concert at 10pm This is not late if returning from a show so was disappointing I had booked an accessible room but it was difficult to find my way around I could have phoned reception for advice but it shouldn t have needed that Had to get out of bed to switch off the light as was intimidated by all the alarm buttons and couldn t find the bedside light switch for fear of summoning help by accident Better instructions to the room would help or someone should automatically accompany guests and talk them through everything It was a very small single bed It might be different if travelling with a companion as there was an adjoining door Do not know what the adjoining room was like , Breakfast was excellent Staff were delightful
441054,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The only thing we would have liked was a vending machine with some chocolate as we were craving some late at night and there wasn t any in the hotel haha , The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming Check in wasn t a problem arrived there round 4pm and there were only a couple of people in front of us The bed was comfy shower was great and the air con worked perfectly Had reservations on it from reading previous reviews but we stayed in London on one of the hottest days of the year and it kept the room at a good temp 
441055,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, a lift or disability access from the car park to reception would be good , The friendliness and general demeanour of all staff They were exemplary and made us welcome from the first meeting registering till when we left 
441056,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Bathroom door did not shut properly Ran out of tissues and toilet paper , Delicious Eggs Benedict Royal cooked perfectly Excellent customer service All staff very polite 
441057,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Excellent location Great hotel for business stays or tourists as Kensington Palace and Royal Albert Hall are not far away The skyline view from the 12th Floor and executive breakfast made the stay particularly enjoyable I would stay again ,No Positive
441058,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Fridge in room was a bit noisy and could not locate a switch to turn off as we were not using it but this is a minor fault , Nice comfortable room No noise from outside 
441059,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms a bit tired a c very poor not particularly efficient and very noisy, Staff and general facilities seemed very good only there one night so don t have a particularly informed view
441060,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Nothing to dislike, Very clean Comfortable beds Very quiet Very close to Kensington high street Lovely bars loads of very good places to buy good food Good base for touring London
441061,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Our room had an awful smell of dampness I did report it the carepet was soaking wet from the air on I think that is where the smell came from I had to spray the room with perfume and deodorant to try and help get rid of the smell it made me feel quite sick , I like it as it was a buffet very good food
441062,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, This was my second business trip to this hotel in one month I stayed a total of 10 days on two business trips in the Club Room level of the Hotel and I will not be going back The first night at the hotel was a disaster The noise was so bad from the Air conditioning units outside that I had to change my room three times To give the hotel some credit they did try hard to resolve the problem but the issue is the hotel itself rather than the personnel working there This hotel needs an upgrade especially the Double Glazing There is absolutely no soundproofing at this hotel and all the noise from outside can be heard in the room I was there with two other work colleagues who all complained of the same issue One of my colleagues who stayed on the other side of the Hotel said that he could hear the Train literally passing in Stereo through his room all night We all went to our conferences very tired and agitated The crazy thing about this experience was that we stayed in the Club Room level of the Hotel These were supposed to be some of the best rooms in the Hotel The other thing I noticed was the beds do not have fitted Bed sheets covering the matress They just use Flat sheets which means that in the morning you are often lying on top of the mattress with half a sheet under you This cannot be hyginic and is not something that I have seen in other hotels The bed was also very hard and uncomfortable Certainly not what you would expect from this standard of Hotel As part of my job I spend at least 2 weeks of every month travelling around Europe and unfortunately I have to give this hotel 4 10 , The best thing about this hotel is the location near to High street Kensington But do not expect to sleep well at this hotel as there is absolutely no soundproofing and beds are hard and uncomfortable 
441063,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Noise of trains was terrible up to 2 am and started again at 5 30am It was the hottest week in 20 years but it was really uncomfortable as windows did not open and the air con did not work that well and very noisy when on so had to turn off , Nice staff
441064,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Breakfast was extra in the Exec Lounge and was paid for it was poor slow service and bad value for money it was over subscribed so table space was limited
441065,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The power sockets for charging phones or batteries were located in awkward places like corner of the room a few centimeters from the ground Better if they were located at site and height of bedside table of writing table , i liked being just a 5 to 7 minute walk to the underground the rooms were spacious clean and comfortable the staff from doorman to front desk were all polite and helpful 
441066,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, the lounge was very busy at the time we went for breakfast we must have chosen a popular time It was difficult to get a table and the staff seemed overstretched or inadequately trained They were all very frienfly and courteous but it seemed rather chaotic for a short while The cutlery given was inadequate fork knife and spoon I would have liked a side knife to spread the butter etc a fork to use with my spoon for the fresh fruit and a teaspoon That caused unnecessary delay and duplication of work for the waiters as we waited for them to be brought from the kitchen , We paid extra to use the executive lounge and this was well worth the extra cost The small shop at the entrance was invaluable we bought tasty fresh sandwiches for our journey home 
441067,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Breakfast no up to much If staying here again wouldn t bother with it Plenty of nice little cafes up the road, Great location very near to tube station room basic but clean and quiet 
441068,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, No hairdryer I asked the maid in my area She did not speak English had no idea what I was asking Since my hair was wet there was no point in calling for a dryer as my hair would have been dry before the dryer arrived , The location is good Tube station buses just round the corner 
441069,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I suppose the room could have been a bit bigger but arriving from a number of days in France the room seemed big enough , This was our second visit to The Copthorne Tara We stayed in a Club Room which is on the top floors of the hotel The room included a very good continental breakfast with hot choices such as scrambled eggs and sausage served nicely in the Club Lounge Also included was access to wine and beer for an hour and a half in the evening served in the same lounge The bed was very comfortable and the room had a nicely appointed bathroom 
441070,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, the hotel is badly needing up graded the furniture was very worn the pillows were as flat as pancakes the bedding should be binned new quilt covers are not expensive the food at breakfast was not hot , The only thing was the convenience to underground
441071,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The room was not as depicted in the photographs The TV was malfunctioning The Commode had stains the hand shower was jerky The purse of two of our friends was stolen from the restaurant during breakfast time , The staff were excellent
441072,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Have stayed before On this occasion the room was awful Grubby carpets Torn bed surrounds Raw plugs in several places where items removed Tv not working Spoke to reception Hotel very busy Only there one night and too late to move on,No Positive
441073,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The hotel public areas are OK but the room they originally put me in was grim room 38 on the mezzanine in case you need to avoid I had booked myself into a double room and inadvertently to one where mobility could be assisted I found myself in a single room at the far end of the corridor on the mezzanine which looked like it hadn t been refurbished in decades and which reminded me of a run down hospital with bed and bath lifts The windows didn t open and there was a stale smell the chair had a stain which I feared was urine I really could believe they were charging central London four star prices for this and felt people with mobility difficulties would get a terribly raw deal They did transfer me to a double room that was merely shabby rather than grim I have made a mental note to never return here ,No Positive
441074,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I could hear the neighbours through the wall which wasn t too bad as they didn t come back late and didn t have the TV on but if they had it would have been noisy , The bed was very comfortable and the room a decent size It was in a nice quiet location and I could hear birds singing in the morning It was a lovely walk across Hyde Park to where I work

441479,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Firstly the car park has tiny spaces and difficult to manoeuvre around with many cars parking across two spaces do they pay double I wonder There is no lift from the car park to reception so you walk down a dingy corridor with hanging pipes and cables through doors with chipped paint and up about 20 steps struggling with luggage to reception Here you wait in a queue for about ten minutes to check in because guess what only three of the six check in desks are manned and a coach load of tourists has just beaten you to check in We ask a bored looking concierge if there is somewhere for our 82 year old disabled mother to sit whilst we get our key and are directed to a few stools in an area cordoned off by a red rope which he makes no attempt to move for us so we can gain access so we move it ourselves We finally check in but only after having to give again exactly the same information that we had given when making the original booking We were then asked what time we were checking out on our leaving day Not soon enough I was tempted to reply and we had only been here about half an hour We were due to go to a show at the Albert Hall so back to our friendly concierge once again but he said he didn t know where the Albert Hall was but asked an equally bored looking colleague who muttered it would be five minutes by cab My faith would have been lifted a little if he has said brightly Let me know what time you wish to leave sir and I will hail a cab for your party but I suppose we can only dream We had booked two rooms together so we re not really surprised when one was on the first floor and the other on the fifth The rooms were clean but basic with ultra thin pillows no choice of pillow like Premier Inn and the narrowest double bed I have seen in a hotel for a good many years now and we have been to quite a few We decided to eat at the Brasserie before going to our show , Nothing much apart from the location

441540,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Parking at 25 overnight seemed very steep indeed After all the room prices are not cheap While breakfast in the hotel was expensive The Muffin Man tea shop nearby provided a more reasonably priced and aesthetically pleasing alternative , This hotel is brilliantly located in a little backwater just off Kensington High Street Only a short walk from the local tube station Central Line the bright lights of London s West End are minutes away The room was fine and the bed very comfortable firm and flat if you know what I mean Room service was good and the menu reasonably priced while there was a good atmosphere in the bar and satisfying choice in the restaurants downstairs The staff were friendly and welcoming especially at the front desk where we were even given complimentary wi fi for our stay 
441541,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The tea and coffee served at breakfast was very poor I am not a big breakfast eater so a good beverage is what I am looking forward to The noise from next door guest snoring did keep me awake As did his alarms phone calls sneezing etc Apart from this the room was good , Rooms were functioned well with a safe fridge and air conditioning Superior room was a good size

441552,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Nothing really it was a very good stay , We wanted a day room because my wife is disabled and we were coming to London for lunch and a concert The staff were very helpful having disabled parking available was a real plus It was just what we needed a space of our own to rest up in 
441553,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Towels could have been softer Access to stairs was difficult when the lifts were busy, Room excellent toiletries good All staff very helpful from housekeeping reception and waitress even though the hotel was extremely busy nothing was too much trouble

441557,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The room we stayed in was a bit tired and not up to standard of a four star hotel, The hotel is in a great location most of the staff were helpful and freindly
441558,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, No negatives at all , The location was fantastic close to Kensington High Street and the tube station For a big and very busy hotel we found the staff particularly friendly and helpful

441560,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I had to insist on a room with drawers For some unknown reason management have removed the drawers from some rooms and there is nowhere apart from the wardrobe to put sweaters underwear etc etc , Location of hotel Friendly staff spacious room 
441561,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Basin plug broken so wouldn t drain NO breakfast tea or biscuits in room Keycards mis programmed at check in More reception staff needed , Rooms were quiet and clean Small shop in lobby for coffee etc Convenient for parking 
441562,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, poor service by reception did not record that we had ordered breakfast or morning newspapers did not record that we had recorded a credit card for extra items whilst on our stay this caused embarrisment with bar staff who insisted that we had to pay as we went along this was resolved but should not have been necessary also room maid cleaned room whilst we were at breakfast and had not put sign out to clean room also took ages to prepare decafinated coffee at breakfast and also took ages to serve irish coffee after evening meal all small things but as they say many mole hills turn into mountains , the rooms wee comforable and breakfast excellant

441565,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, at first impressions the exterior of the building was a bit off putting but once inside everything was spot on will definitely be back , very comfortable room at a fair price no complaints at all thanks very much
441566,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We are booking in booking com and when we are check in we wait at least 30minutes because staff said is something mistake they didn t get my booking So I need to re book again and re pay again Whole process they didn t say anything like sorry and we have a car and we already register when we check in but when we check out the staff s computer didn t show out that we are register And we need to register again So ridiculous all the thing and it is 4 stars hotel sad, Only thing I like is room service
441567,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms look v worn Maintenance could be better Couldn t open window because of height of building so had to run air con heater unit all night and was still too hot, Was good value for what I paid but certainly wouldn t have paid more Copthorne at Chelsea FC is a far better hotel
441568,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Bed not hugely comfortable New Travelodge beds much better Very impersonal service Club room nothing special a little tatty at edges Tube line noises as was air con Fridge was so noisy I had to turn it off when it woke me at 3 in morning Breakfast not good and bar very expensive,No Positive
441569,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The breakfast buffet was limited with no options within the buffet for eggs to order or coffees Over the six days the options in the buffet changed only once which became very dull and not worth the price paid for it Given the size of the hotel and number of guests it hosted there was no element of a personal touch , The location of the property is very good It is a 5 8 minute walk to the tube station depending on walking speed The tube station surrounding bus stations and availability of Ubers in the area is also on point Within the area are also good chain restaurant options and easy access to a Food Hall Pharmacy All in all a great stay 
441570,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The only little down side was the size of the bathroom needed to be bigger for me and my partner That s it , The room was very well set out and comfy Was upgraded to club class and we loved the style and comfort it brings would definitely come back one day Good location 
441571,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, There was nothing we didn t like For the price we paid through Booking com this was excellent value , Staff were very friendly and attentive particularly the Algerian French concierge whose name I sadly didn t get from greeting us politely as we arrived to immediately coming to the rescue when the keycard to our door proved faulty We had to wait twenty minutes for the issue to be resolved but were then offered a room upgrade to Club Class to compensate us for the very little inconvenience Excellent service in a hotel of 800 plus rooms where we might have felt like just another couple of guests Top marks We also loved the convenience of the location just moments away from High Street Kensington Tube 
441572,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The hot water sometimes ran with cold water for a long period of time The toilet didn t flush fully We have stayed here a few times before but this time wasn t as good as before , We liked the location The access to taxi service was good 
441573,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We had to queue for fifteen minutes for a table for breakfast This would have been very inconvenient for any guests with an exacting itinerary We have never queued for breakfast in any other hotel in the world, The porters were very helpful The twin room was comfortable with tea making facilities 
441574,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Club lounge was some times crowded and unable to use the facilities we had payed extra for, Location was fine and good transport link just up the road Accepted the offer for Club Membership which was fine 
441575,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Main dining room was full for breakfast with a long queue We were relocated to one of the bar areas which was a good solution although it seemed a bit unfair on those left in the queue Ran out of fried eggs so had scrambled not preferred option Hotel needs to increase capacity or manage demand perhaps introduce pre booked time slots for breakfast , Food was good 
441576,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Situation when staff is showing me where I have to sit during breakfast is quite uncomfortable I d like to choose a sit by myself , Charles reception manager is absolutely fantastic man It s a treasure of this hotel Very helpful easygoing competent manager

441579,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, Loved it was close by the train station and was around a great area of town The hotel staff was friendly and was willing to help us with what we needed 
441580,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, I resented the fact that once I got there I had to listen to a sell about upgrading and adding breakfast and upgrading my room because I just reserved a standard room I almost felt like I was wrong to reserve a standard room It was like listening to a used car salesman and I didn t like that I finally very nicely told the young woman that I trusted that she was going to place us in a room that I would be totally happy with and and wouldn t have to come back down to the desk and complain about I saw several negative complaints on the TripAdvisor site and didn t want to have to deal with a situation like that In the end we got a lovely room that was clean well appointed and very satisfactory ,No Positive
441581,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Place a little bit dated maybe but that s just a personal preference Dodgy view of a lot of railway lines out the window Need to get them re located , Well located nice overall experience Staff were lovely 
441582,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We had BOOKED and CONFIRMED afternoon tea for a birthday celebration On arrival manager could not find booking Afternoon tea was served in public bar where there were two t v on and people drinking They had no quite corner so we had to wait until table was set in the middle of room Very bad standard for 4 star hotel tea should be served in sitting room not public bar Would I stay there again Yes only for location Kathleen Nolan, location close to albert hall bedrooms good towels need replacing
441583,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Didnt choose to have breakfast as this seemed expensive but probably the going rate for London, Location great for the Albert Hall Kensignton High st Hyde Park etc No traffic noise as tucked away

441588,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Bar prices somewhat suspect one 175mi glass of house white 10 75 it may be Kensington but that was silly , Club rooms lounge breakfast experience really great loved it All front desk girls beautiful totally professional

441847,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Furnishings in rooms were tired The first room we had was an adjoining one and we were woken up at 7 am with the entire conversation in the next room clearly wafting through the adjoining door Clearly no privacy and we had to tell them through the door that we could hear every single word they were saying Asked for a room change since we had two more nights and it took ages Rang reception to follow up and it took forever to get someone on the phone Was told that he would call me back in 2 mins but after 10 mins I had to call again and wait again to connect to someone Someone finally delivered the key to the new room and dashed off despite us being told that we would be assisted with our luggage didn t need assistance but some recovery service would be great , Nothing 
441848,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, i wish the minibar could have some water or soft drinks when you arrive to the hotel late evening and the stores are closed it s disappointing that there is no drink available in the room , the Location is very good for Kensigton area

441852,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms and d cor are out of date and tired the place needs modernised then it would be a super hotel , Our room was not ready on arrival so we were asked if we wanted to upgrade which to save any problem we did and it was a good decision as we could have breakfast in the Copthorne suite The staff were very nice at breakfast and very helpful on the desk at reception would go back again but not at the full charged rate 
441853,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Could be better if there is a showerroom desperately in the bathroom , i like the location of the hotel easy to get to anywhere in London And the breakfast is nice and plenty of choice but will be better if the coffee could be improved 
441854,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Don t be tempted to take a room upgrade other than the view there is little difference from the cheaper rooms The breakfasts are not the best anyway and were worse in the club lounge The cooks seem to lack pride in their food preparation Electrical outlets in rooms need modernising for device charger access , close to Kensington High street and station and handy to Earls court station Easy walk to Kensington gardens Royal Albert Hall and museums Clean and comfortable
441855,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Arrived at 11am paid to upgrade the room to the 12th floor allocated a room number and signed for it Arrived back at 5pm the room had been given to someone else Ended up in a smaller room on the 10th floor with an excellent view of the window cleaning machine I felt that was unprofessional behaviour for a London hotel, I liked the members club lounge and the waiter in there He had been there 40 years

441859,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Internet useless, Really friendly close to amenities Walking distance to Kensington palace Royal Albert hall and 2 minutes to tube station Rooms very clean and comfortable and services everyday Great selection of breakfast only fault was internet was useless to non existent had to use my 4G data All being said would definitely go back 
441860,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The decor in the bedrooms and bathroom is dated but clean, The location of the hotel is excellent for shops restaurants and the tube station is a minute away
441861,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The breakfast was very poor the bacon very hard and overcooked or been kept hot for too long the scrambled egg was tasteless and the porridge was watery, The bed was comfy and the fruit salad at breakfast lovely

441864,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Too much furniture in the room must be a nightmare to keep clean get rid of one set of drawers for more space More sweeteners on the tea tray would be nice there was loads of sugar, Lovely comfortable beds room temperature just right but the staff out shone everything else nothing was too much trouble and their service was excellent
441865,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, I liked the face that even although I checked in at 8 30am arrived that morning after a night on the sleeper the staff managed to change my room booking to ensure I was checked into the room for duration of my stay 
441866,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington,No Negative, I was happy the receptionist was able to check me in quiet early Rooms and bath were comfortable and clean Stayed here four times and would definately recommend it It is the cheapest value for money at this standard 
441867,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms are old although comfortable still Bathroom is small and shower hose is not easy to use at all It s attached to the shower bar making it difficult to maneuver, Location is great Near tube station Many buses too that connect to many parts of London 
441868,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Reception staff were not efficient concierge sullen When asked a question I don t know is not an acceptable answer Pillows were lumpy , Location
441869,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, This is a huge hotel and there are many tour groups staying The reception and guest service desk concierge are understaffed I had to wait for 10 minutes to check in and another 10 minutes to collect my suitcase I left at the guest service although there was no queue When a large group of guests arrives waiting time will be extraordinary They charged 40 in addition to the room charge on my credit card without telling me I know some hotels request pre authorisation for a certain amount to cover additional charges during the stay but normally they tell me before doing so Charging customers credit card without notifying them is not a good idea They didn t give me a invoice receipt at the check out I assumed they would email me as some of the hotels recently do again they normally ask if I want a receipt emailed or in paper However I was later on told when I called the hotel to enquire about the unknown credit card charge that they wouldn t email a receipt unless I specifically request it That means they wouldn t give you a receipt unless you ask which is unusual and rude Their complementary wifi was slow and you will possibly have to pay for a faster connection if you would like to do some work or watch online video The room didn t have an available socket around the desk or bed so I had to work on my laptop on the TV stand which was inconvenient , Good location 3 minute walk from the High Street Kensington station The bathroom had a bathtub It was clean and the shower had a good pressure of water Free wifi 
441870,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Inability to move the chairs into a position where it was comfortable for each of us to watch TV Noise from underground was disturbing at times , The view from floor 12 was excellent We enjoyed the food both at breakfast and in the evening The shower was good but would have preferred a walk in shower rather than over the bath The staff were extremely helpful 
441871,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, No negative points, The room 644 was excellent and all the staff were very good I left some purchased goods in a drawer in the room and the follow up has been first class goods now in the lost property department Kevin has been most helpful as have housekeeping and will be collected by a friend in the next few days I am most grateful to all concerned 
441872,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The room was stuffy although the air conditioning worked well the air was stale The room decor was a bit tired had the feel of having been refurbished with 1970 s materials Irritating and inconvenient that we couldn t switch lights on off without getting out of bed , Staff were friendly and helpful Good sized room 
441873,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Rooms very small so suggest nothing smaller than a Club Room worth paying the extra WIFI is terrible Very busy hotel so not personal service you are just a number Bit dated , Location close to transport and attractions Felt safe within the area Nice shops and M S and Foodworks close by 
441874,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The dining area was a bit crowded at peak times particularly breakfasts , The ease of access to transport and the proximity to the train buses and taxis The location was also within easy walking distance of Kensington Gardens and Palace amongst other wonderful attractions 
441875,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, When I arrived at the hotel late Friday evening they had not been sent details of my booking from Booking com For this reason it took way too long to be checked in The room d cor was rather dated and would benefit from updating , The staff were very very helpful and friendly

441877,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Thought the breakfast at 17 a head was a little steep Decided to eat breakfast elsewhere , Nice sized bed but I did suffer a little with back ache Rooms very quiet 
441878,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Nothing Seriously i have thought for few minutes still nothing , Everything The entrance was extra grand Parking is extra close by The staff was extra friendly and super helpful The view in the club rooms is extra nice The bed linen is super comfy the pillows I could keep on and on The bacon is extra good The Breakfast in club lounge is worth coming here and made me think the room comes as a free extra to it so deserves an extra merit Unlike many nowadays this Hotel is not understaffed and even at rush hour times they coped with our large group and exceeded my not so humble expectations I have stayed in other 4 star hotels in London this one is number one and is worth every penny The glitch with the wifi was solved in minutes and only revealed how quickly the Hotel handles any problems Do not hesitate a real 10 
441879,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Short curtains meant sunlight flooded into the room right at eye level from 5 00am Also the bed was soft and bouncy making it difficult not to disturb each other , Handy for Kensington High Street 
441880,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Nothing really , View cleanliness of the room quiet my room was at the end of the corridor Was a little apprehensive after reading a few negative reviews but my room was lovely Excellent location for Albert Hall gig and close to tube station

441882,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We were originally given a room on the 1st floor at the end of a corridor It was noisy sounded like construction work next door The shower didn t work didn t switch from bath to shower We were changed to a room on the 8th floor I would be upset if I d paid more for this room as it was very similar to the one on the 1st floor In summary very disappointed with the stay The lady on reception didn t seem to appreciate why I was so upset and very reluctantly went to ask a manager for help It was a special treat weekend for us but it was spoiled by our experience at the Copthorne Tara , Location parking good 
441883,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Old hotel a bit run down Customer service ok although unfriendly Any time you would ask for something it looked like a major effort Target for very large tourist groups , Quite even if very central Perfect location for a brief visit only few steps from T in a nice neighbor hood
441884,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Our room on the 2nd floor was overlooking the railway tracks ask for a quiet room to the other side Hotel needs refurbishment You can see it from the facade going through the entrance door the corridor and in the room it s all a bit shabby , Great location in Kensington room has all you need and the service is okay
441885,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, We found the railway a little noisy but the hotel quiet, The room was very comfortable and very good value I was an exhibitor at the Kensington Dollshouse Fair in the Town hall so this was the perfect location
441886,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, It wasn t very clean and the internet was very slow Also the double bed was also made from 2 single beds united, The room was quite big the location is good and the staff very friendly

441888,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Although there was plenty of it the full English breakfast was disappointing as very bland and tasteless, the bed was really comfortable and the shower was excellent although the bathroom could do with a revamp
441889,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, See above, I could never maintain my wifi connection Maddening Asked for help at the front desk She made a call they were busy so I was instructed to keep calling back Really For this I paid my hard earned money 
441890,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, Room was comfortable and clean although it looked a little antiquated Could do with a bit of modernising with regards to the furniture Ditch the floral patterns , Very good location friendly and helpful staff attractive lobby and bar 
441891,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, There was a very old fashioned cooling unit I wouldn t even describe it as air conditioning that was totally ineffective at cooling the room down The room was unbearably hot overnight and we couldn t open a window No shampoo or conditioner provided,No Positive
441892,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The coffee and milk are very cheap in the rooms and couple biscuits is always nice on arrival after travelling, The staff are so friendly and helpful beds really comfortable great views across the city great local amenities
441893,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, The bed was very hard and the door was not sound proof at all you could hear everything going on in the hall The fridge in the room made such a racket that we had to switch it off to have any chance of sleep The noise from the Underground that passes right by the hotel was also a bit annoying The room was superficially clean but we found hairs in the bath shower when we arrived and when we wetted a flannel and wiped the bathroom door and handle quite a bit of dirt came off , Upgraded to a club room which included a breakfast that was excellent The location was good but unfortunately High Street Kensington station was closed that weekend so it was a long walk to the nearest Underground 
441894,Copthorne Tara Hotel London Kensington, District Circle lines didn t have service between Earl s Court and Edgware Road So I had to take a bus to High St Kensington When I left the hotel I walked to Gloucester Road , A very clean room a very comfortable bed good wifi connection nothing to complain The reception staff was very nice A nice Thai restaurant and a nice muffin breakfast place are just beside the hotel
