371622,Hotel Kavalier, Negative aspects were closeness to railroad lack of balcony and no mid ceiling light in the room Takes some time to get to city center but was good to park the car for the night Access to wi fi was a bit tricky but manageable , Breakfast mm delicious Overall we got a good value deal for our money Room was clean and bigger than expected 
371623,Hotel Kavalier, Little bit far from city center , The room was big I booked in a good price and it s even include breakfast The reception was very nice and helpful She helped me a lot with direction in Vienna 
371624,Hotel Kavalier, room bar is empty price should include bottle of water Breakfast are included in price but I would appreciate higher standard , Rooms are big and clean furniture is undamaged and fits the room Personnel can speak many languages 
371625,Hotel Kavalier, A little bit noisy because of passing nearby trains Minibar was missing , Free parking opposite the hotel until 09 00 AM Good size of the room clean and tidy Nice bathroom facilities Good breakfast 
371626,Hotel Kavalier, Poor WiFi signal it only worked when standing close to the door of the room Problems with temperature regulation under the shower random jumps from very cold to very hot water , Good value for money for Vienna the price for a 2 2 family was really reasonable Good breakfast 
371627,Hotel Kavalier, The wifi is not at all ok The breakfast should have more kinds of food The parking was not for free for the hotel customers There was no restaurant to prepare meals in the hotel , The safe atmosphere at the hotel The decoration is good The staff is gentle The used towels get changed every day It was clean 
371628,Hotel Kavalier, On the first midnight there was construction work The noise was at the unacceptable level Wi Fi connection was unstable and slow , My family including two kids stayed in two double rooms The rooms was clean My kids liked their bathtab Close to Sch nbrunn Palace Easy access to the city center tram to Westbahnhof Metro 
371629,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, I had a business appointment very close to the hotel so I was satisfied with the location But because of the good public tranport the hotel is a good choise to other reason The breakfast is excellent 
371630,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, Staffs were really friendly and helpful Hotel was clean It is a little bit far away from city centre but it is close to Schonbrunn and in my opinion Schonbrunn is the best place to visit in Vienna So you should come and visit 
371631,Hotel Kavalier, The rooms were small and cramped with three beds as we were a family of 3 and out child is 9 yrs old Other than that we had a very pleasant and comfortable stay , The staff at the reception was very friendly Breakfast was very good with lot of variety 
371632,Hotel Kavalier, The safe in the room did not work it was impossible to lock it The rules said Write your code number on the inside of the door But the inside had no means for writing the code no numbers or letters , The bed was good As to the eggs I mean fried eggs they left some room for improvement They should be fried abut more for they often were even half wet 
371633,Hotel Kavalier, It is said it is close to Schonnbrunn but in the reality it is not on foot through a not really nice area It is close by public transport Comparing to other 4 hotels it did not worth it s money With full of loud Asian tourists , Close to public transport 
371634,Hotel Kavalier, I don t have something that I didn t like because everything was a little better that I expected , Hotel was good for this money It was clean and nice Furniture was good and the bathroom with all necessities Breakfast was more then good with more then 20 types of food Parking is available outside for free during weekends 
371635,Hotel Kavalier, Lamp in room was broken It is ok to push two single beds together but the beds had f ing wheels If you move to the middle you fall between the beds No security at all Reception far from entrance Only hair body wash liquid in bathroom No shampoo soap or conditioner No slippers Small bathtub Nothing in mini bar I would never give 4 stars to this guest house , Breakfast was good
371636,Hotel Kavalier, Hotel was clean but would benifit from some renevations Furniture was very bssic and in need of replacing The desk are had stains and a burn mark Carpet was torn , Lovely Staff
371637,Hotel Kavalier, Very complicated finding free parking in the area esp in working days Furniture nice but little bit outdated The hotel is situated between railway station and main road eventhough windows are soud proved as soon as you open them you can hear car or railway traffic , All personnel was very kind You can find people from Slovakia among them Location is very close to Sch nbrunn walking distance We were by car so also decent proximity to city center Absolutely delicious breakfast you can even prepare your own waffles 
371638,Hotel Kavalier, Bad location The hotel was far from the city center and right on the railroad tracks The staff was overwhelmed checking in the large tour groups that arrived seemingly endlessly They were very defensive about the location of the hotel and the combined bus tram and metro train that it would take to get to the city center We ended up walking a mile each morning and evening to and from the metro train to avoid the other connections and the construction on the road outside the hotel which caused gridlock in all directions Loud trains going by all day and night right outside the our window , The room was clean and the breakfast was good 
371639,Hotel Kavalier, I would suggest that parking will be included in the accomodation fee as parking fee is a bit expensive per day , Food at the restaurant was excellent 
371640,Hotel Kavalier, We were waiting 30 minutes for order in hotel restaurant another 1 hour for dinner to be served We came at 8 and dinner was served in 9 30 disaster It was also impossible to add dinner to hotel bill and we must pay immediately with card or cash , We announced to come with small child and child bed including sheeting was ready in our room room was as close as possible to restaurant to be able to use baby sitter as requested during reservation Hotel is in walkable distance to Shoenbrunn 
371641,Hotel Kavalier, The property is a bit old but clean noisy corridors not sure if it was the house keeping staff or guests Should have been rated a 3 Stars not 4 , Place is clean staff are good Overall the Hotel is good enough to accommodate your needs 
371642,Hotel Kavalier, there was no electric kettle in the room , breakfeast for the children and adults each can find something delicious coffe was strong but its shoud be like this one also juices fresh fruits and salads jougurts cakes 
371643,Hotel Kavalier, the receptionist was not that welcoming and has that face that telling that we are not welcomed location is a Little far from the metro station around 20 min walking distance no English tea at the breakfast as all is herbal tea , room was large and clean breakfast is good and various 
371644,Hotel Kavalier, Parking outside the hotel nightmare Parking in the private garage of the hotel way too expensive Basic Breakfast, Always a good option for a transit night in Vienna Good facility clean rooms great service 
371645,Hotel Kavalier, No slippers no shoe shine sponge no double bed even though booked as double the attitude of the reception staff very poor The receptionist refused to stamp my travel order Even when I tried to explain him what it means for my company he talked back rude , Breakfast
371646,Hotel Kavalier, Coffee was terrible although it depends of person as my husband said its ok but our friend even liked it very much Hair drier is not strong enough also there was no cap for bath If you get room on street side then no good to open window as noisy We had some white wine with us but the fridge is without freezer and there was no ice available in the bar so the only way to make it cool was to keep the bottle under cold running water , We liked that there is a big selection of different kinds of vegetables like beet roots carrots and tomatoes also eggs were baked and fried There was possibility to prepare waffles yourself also all kinds of jams were available milk was cold and hot Rooms are clean and big there is enough space for 2 3 big suitcases We could leave our car on street opposite our room window and no need to pay on Sundays If you like walking then its a very nice walking to the city about 30minutes each way to reach Westbahnhoff and Mariahilfestrase But also tram stop is near the hotel and ticket costs EUR 2 20 
371647,Hotel Kavalier, Breakfast was OK but a few more options would have been better , Good sized room and bathroom with comfy beds Good value for money and the tram goes from outside the home into the city centre 
371648,Hotel Kavalier, Parking is very expensive almost all hotels from Wien have expensive parking this was no exception To park on the street near the hotel you have also to pay but the system is very complicated at least for somebody who does not live in Austria , Good and quiet location clean and confortable huge TV internet was free and good from my point of view some people which are using it for streaming maybe will complain about the quality Breakfast very good and diversified you could make your own waffles which is a nice touch We stayed only one night in transit but we will definitely be back
371649,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, Decent breakfast pleasant ambient convenient location well connected with the city center near Schoenbrunn palace great sauna helpful receptionists

371652,Hotel Kavalier, Reception unprofessional Breakfast rather poor no way a 4 breakfast Water flow very low shower terrible they didn t want to bother to give us another room Noise the bar is a bad joke money in advance before you can even see the room but you don t get any Invoice for your stay Not a 4 hotel it s a 3 hotel which needs renovation Overall it s not even close to the expectations related to the description on booking com which is usually accurate otherwise ,No Positive
371653,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, Spacious room comfortable bed welcoming staff I would go back again no problem to find parking around the hotel a nice dining room and spacious delicious breakfast
371654,Hotel Kavalier, The only minus was that our room faced the railway traks located 50 m away only a small problem for a light sleeper , Very nice hotel spotless clean big and confortable room excellent breakfast and very nice front desk staff Surely we will choose this hotel again 
371655,Hotel Kavalier, Beds could have been a little larger They are comfortable but not too wide Pillows need to be changed they are very slim , Very good price amenities ratio Clean room Pretty large Decent size and options breakfast Helpful staff Close to the major highways that go around Viena 
371656,Hotel Kavalier, For the 4 star hotel it could be better Food for the breakfast is poor no fresh fruit or salad Just one kind of coffee drink available cappucino and other coffee drinks are extra charged , Public transportation in front of the hotel Breakfast was good Rooms were spacious and clean and soundproof It is nearby railroad but it was very quiet during the night so that sleep was nice 
371657,Hotel Kavalier, There s no hot water if you want to have some tea you should pay 1 euro for hot water each time, Breakfast was great you can use the sauna it was also great I liked this hotel it s a great value for money we checked in at 9 a m and it was a nice surprise that we didn t have to wait till 2 p m The location is ok the tram is 2 min and the metro station is 10 15 min walk
371658,Hotel Kavalier, First of all this isn t a 4 star hotel not in my view at least Expensive hotel parking 19eur day The room was very noisy it was near near withing 50m 30 rail road tracks with trains passing very often every 15 mins or so There were no available power outlets near the bed The only available ones were in the bathroom and near the door Room had old furniture squeaky bed Minibar was empty I would not rebook this place , It was clean Good breakfast
371659,Hotel Kavalier, The hotel is located in outer city area so it takes a bit longer time to travel into the city center , The cost of the hotel is fair The services were great and the breakfast was delicious 
371660,Hotel Kavalier, Coming to this hotel for the second time we were disappointed Services were 50 50 Stuff was terrible When I came to the bar and asked for a cup of hot water to take a medicine they charged 1 for it , Convenient beds
371661,Hotel Kavalier, During breakfast it often ran out of juice and glasses Parking fee is too expencive in my opinion 20 eur day in hotel garage , It was very clean and staff was very helpful and nice breakfast was tasty
371662,Hotel Kavalier, , A special Christmas at Hotel Kavalier Vienna Big room clean and comfortable Nice staff good breakfast close to Schonbrunn Palace 25 minutes walk Definitely a hotel to recommend Thank you for hospitality 
371663,Hotel Kavalier, the internet is extremely boring u have to put a new password every 24 hours the rooms are not good isolated very noisy because of the train station quite close to the hotel, good breakfast nice rooms not expensive hotel
371664,Hotel Kavalier, Except 2 everything is BAD i feel only by looking its 4 star hotel but not functioning Wifi is horrible and when i complain the guy asking me to go down and use the net temperature in the room is horrible its like staying in the oven when i complain about this he is asking me to open the window why the hell they are maintaining AC in the hotel and when we open the window whole night trains are passing through your window and feel like you are sleeping beside railway track I totally not recommend to this hotel , The room was very clean and breakfast is good 
371665,Hotel Kavalier, A bit distant location of the property from the city center It s also noisy when your windows have a street side, Very clean delicious and rich breakfasts
371666,Hotel Kavalier, The restaurant was not open since it was Christmas The parking inside was very expensive 19 euros night The wifi was very poor , Spacious room and cosy Nice breakfast 
371667,Hotel Kavalier, It is NOT a 4 star hotel It looks old it is obviously a transit hotel for the east Europeans The breakfast was dull and every day identical the small breads were more than once stale You cannot regulate the heat in the room they said at the reception that we only had to close the heating but it did no good We actually had problems sleeping because of that The beds were really soft and creaked at every move not alt all comfortable Same problem regulating the hot water in the shower you got lukewarm or scorching hot The maid came in the room with a Do not disturb sign hanging the sign disappeared afterwards I found that really annoying The parking fee is really high 19 euros day We did not know that in the beginning but you can park for free on the street , The room was big enough Really clean rooms Tram station and Supermarket 200 m away 
371668,Hotel Kavalier, I saw how a good business can become bad because of people who work there At 8 AM housekeeping womans will knok all the doors will yell on the coridor Horrible , Good location for my needs good conections nice rooms
371669,Hotel Kavalier, There was a fire at the hotel Alarms went on off Firemen turned up Staff didn t communicate what guests should do for more than 1 5 hours And then only when asked if we could return to our rooms Very cavalier attitude in what could have been a serious incident , Cleanliness proximity to tram
371670,Hotel Kavalier, The Bistro in the hotel was not something to write home about No vegetables Didn t taste good If you asked for something the answer NO You couldn t even get a sandwich Strange , The staff at the reception and the room 
371671,Hotel Kavalier, The WiFi quality was just horrible No outlets next to the bed , The rooms are quite big with comfortable furniture The breakfast was great plenty of things to choose from A tram stop with direct connection to the city center is not far away 
371672,Hotel Kavalier, No wireless internet in room at our room 312 The internet very slow All areas No tea catel in the rooms Bad staff behavior Staff gave wrong information about prices and charged more int call an exmple Plz be carful , Nothing special
371673,Hotel Kavalier, Breakfast buffet was poor and the food tasted a bit artificial The bed was too soft felt like I was drowning in it My spine and back didn t appreciate it , In general the hotel is ok Room and bathroom was quite spacious big TV 
371674,Hotel Kavalier, The wifi was quite annoying as it kept disconnecting and it was a nightmare to get anything done online The hotel is right next to a train line so there were trains at all hours although it didn t bother me that much , The staff spoke English as and when required The breakfast was excellent with every type of preference catered to The room was amazing as was the reception the lobby and the dining area The staff were able to help when I needed a print out urgently free of charge Very close to Schloss Schonbrunn which was the main purpose of the visit In short a 4 star experience at a great price 
371675,Hotel Kavalier, This hotel is located just opposite to the huge railway or fast train station The noise of trams and trains is simply unbearable so that we could hardly sleep The breakfast as for 4 hotel was a misunderstanding low quality of food restaurant with used furniture you want to run out from this place as soon as possible , Comfortable beds large size of the room 
371676,Hotel Kavalier, very slow elevators and only 2 of them for a hotel with many rooms it s a nice hotel but not exactly 4 poor breakfast, nice staff conditions were ok room and bathroom clean
371677,Hotel Kavalier, Location is a long way from town centre how ever the tram is at the door and connects to underground Expensive taxi ride to connect to river cruise and train Young girl at front desk needs to learn to smile and for a receptionist should have better knowledge of how thIngs work in the city to be able to advise travelers Fridge in room did not work which was disappointing for my medication Air conditioning in room also could not be controlled even though there as a controller on the wall it didn t work therefore we were extremely HOT , Wi fi worked well hotel was comfortable and close to public transport which is excellent in this town Glad we only had one night Breakfast not too fussy and coffee horrible as most places in Europe 
371678,Hotel Kavalier, Light in bathroom took 1 min to turn on Parking price was quite expensive and even more than in April when we were there first time , Standard rooms but well kept nice big TV though we didn t use it Breakfast was fine 
371679,Hotel Kavalier, Feels more like 3 star hotel Breakfast could be improved on the products quality Very noisy cleaning ladies in the mornings Rooms smelled old , Good value for money

371681,Hotel Kavalier, The older male receptionist on the evening of our arrival 25th Sept was haughty gave us wrong information on parking and the next evening was nearly arrogant with notes like I ve said it already three times we didn t like his attitude at all I think this man was not happy at all that some guests are in the hotel The young staff woman and another man were fine and friendly but in general we won t say good reference on Kavalier I m sorry Mrs A Petranova,No Positive
371682,Hotel Kavalier, Wi Fi was slow sometimes sometimes it dissappers asks to relogin, Good bathtub comfortable bed opportunity to make fresh waffles by yourself on the breakfast
371683,Hotel Kavalier, Very poor wifi we could not close bathroom door they were swelled from moisture water temperature was hard to control bathroom would deserve more cleaning and mold prevention There were many smudges on walls in the room no power outlet near nightstand room was noisy in the morning when we opened the window Rooms did not look like 4 star hotel , Big TV tram next to the hotel close to Schonbrunn good variety of food on breakfast
371684,Hotel Kavalier, crowded restaurant at breakfast time a bit far from center 5 6 km but ok when visiting by car, second time here qood cost quality ratio free parking outside the hotel between 7 pm to 09 am very comfortable room and bath with bathtub ok breakfast romanian speaking receptionist
371685,Hotel Kavalier, Not the best location for restaurants but close to public transport to get into the city centre the place was busy with a lot of tours we missed out on breakfast one morning as there was no where to sit and we had to go to the airport , Decent sized rooms clean comfortable affordable 
371686,Hotel Kavalier, No parking on the site which is a pain As a 4 star hotel it should provide parking Only 1 person at checkin counter and I waited about 30min to get keys of the room He wasn t really nice No weq come attitude , Hotel was very clean breakfast was very nice 
371687,Hotel Kavalier, Although it s non smoking it still had a smell of staleness around the room like it was or had recently been a smoking floor , Good value Good breakfast 
371688,Hotel Kavalier, Hotel is very old need renovation, Airconditioner was perfect Also they provided us early checkin opportunity Breakfast was very good for the room price
371689,Hotel Kavalier, Understaffed at reception Poor quality breakfast cheap and lacking any effort on behalf of the hotel not up to even a 2 standard , Quiet room Comfy bed
371690,Hotel Kavalier, The nearest metro station was closed Street noise in the night , Very comfortable good garage 16 EUR no problems tram line and Billa very next to the hotel Good price for 4 hotel in Vienna 
371691,Hotel Kavalier, It was a little bit far from center but you can reach it with metro and S bahn in 25 30 min , The hotel was very clean and breakfast was good enough It is just 10 min to Sch nbrunn palace with the line 52 direction westbahnhof 
371692,Hotel Kavalier, The wifi was okay but not super fast but then again this is in the internet third world called Europe You can t expect the speeds you get in Asia or even USA The parking garage in the basement is very safe but for the first night they ran out of spaces and I had to go get a parking pass from a convenient store you can buy it for 1 hour 2 hour etc and park across the street plenty of spots there for 2 hours till 6 pm after which is it is free on the street too They should keep a few parking passes just in case they run out of spaces in the parking garage But it seemed like a rare problem as the next 2 days the garage wasn t full , This clearly felt like a 3 to 4 star hotel Nice bar The breakfast is out of this world Everything that you can look for The hotel was very clean and the rooms were really large sized as well Having strong AC was another positive The sheets were clean and the bed comfortable enough The ladies who manage the big breakfast hall were very friendly I loved how one of them went and got me a coffee at 6 30 just when they opened to take outside to the open sitting area for a smoke I ate breakfast only later and just need a coffee early Very friendly staff The location is good with a tram line right in front that takes you a few km to the city center easily 18 minute walking to the Schonnbrunn Palace which is another plus point 
371693,Hotel Kavalier, Close to the railway station so it may be a little bit noisy , I wanted to visit Schonbrunn so the location was perfect Good value for money if you want to stay for a night or two Parking cost is 16 EUR but during weekend there is a lot of free parking spaces near the hotel Friendly staff average breakfast 
371694,Hotel Kavalier, considering the size of the breakfastroom and people the hotel ressembled more a youth hostel than a 4star hotel breakfast more is not more It would be better to offer quality instead of quantity wifi could not be used to slow First time I ve had that in a 4star hotel furniture and bathroom a little dated, The staff and the cleaness of the room
371695,Hotel Kavalier, Noise in the room from the railways In the night very hot in the room air conditioning was not working properly, Breakfast is very good Staff very friendly
371696,Hotel Kavalier, Relatively slow internet No mustard at breakfast , The tram stop is close and it takes you to westbahnhof The breakfast was good Sch nbrunn is not far you can just walk there 
371697,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, Thanks for wonderful experience that we had I am more than happy about Robert Babadshanow personality he help me so much he is real professional Definitely i would award him for his flawlessly good job He is the best FOM I ever met Hotel is nice and rooms are very spacious 
371698,Hotel Kavalier, Everything was ok , Location close to the highway Rooms are big enough and clean The breakfast is good We parked our car across the street just in front of our window it s free of charge Comfortable beds Very good value for money 
371699,Hotel Kavalier, It is NOT a 4 hotel maybe 2 5 The room was not very clean old outdated furniture the hallway smelld funny the breakfast was ok but not fit for a 4 star hotel On the second night we found a bed bug on the carpet and after flipping the whole bed over we found another one hidden in the bed frame I know this can happen in many higher class hotels and it s not always their fault so we didn t panic but the lack of interest and lack of internal procedure for solving the issue was extremely upsetting We did receive another room though and after searching till 2 30 a m we declared it bug free Both rooms was relatively quiet on the street side of the building but every morning we were woken up at 6 30 7 00 by the terrible noise of the cleaning crew s cart passing several times on the hallway Not the best stay we had , Close to Schonbrunn 
371700,Hotel Kavalier, The first night that we arrived we received a very cold welcome from the guy at the reception The wifi is very bad The breakfast is also not like a four star hotel , Rooms are big
371701,Hotel Kavalier, , The location was perfect for me There is a door which can be unlocked to link two rooms which is perfect when traveling with family tram stop is just next to the hotel 
371702,Hotel Kavalier, Noise from the railways trains were riding quite often if you like sleeping with open window don t recommend room by the railways At our arrival the receptionist didn t have a small talk and he didn t communicate with us at all he didn t tell us about services in the hotel if we didn t ask about breakfast he wouldn t probably say it either We didn t feel inivited Receptionist a girl next day was much more nicer Reception as a place looked very old fashioned not clean and it didn t make a good impression when receptionist don t have same outfit Breakfast was not something special seemed like not very high quality ,No Positive
371703,Hotel Kavalier, Parking garage door is the left one that was impossible to know before asking from the receptionist The breakfast was lacking fresh fruit otherwise it was good , Small faults but otherwise good hotel nice big room helpful staff 
371704,Hotel Kavalier, Location and connection to downtown could be better You need to take a tram to Westbanhof and then subway to city center or walk 10 15 minutes to nearest U bahn U4 , Spacious rooms Good breakfast Enough parking space for free in front of hotel on weekends 
371705,Hotel Kavalier, It is at most 3 hotel and not a 4 There were no amenities in the rooms no tea coffee or even a boiler , Early check In was allowed Breakfast is moderate
371706,Hotel Kavalier, The location is rather remote and right on the railroad tracks so there was not much sleep that happened at night Also ignore the stars next to the hotel name No way this is a 4 star hotel solid 2 maybe 3 If you adjust your expectations then it will be OK , The staff were really helpful they showed me how to get around town and explained how to use the tram metro system The breakfast here was also very good lots of options quality ingredients I had dinner at the hotel as well which was very good Do yourself a favor order something that involves their french fries Best fries ever Grilled meat was also excellent very nicely marinated 
371707,Hotel Kavalier, The parking is too expensive 16 euros per day Geting out of the parking lot is very chalanging because there is a big slope and the door opens automaticaly but very slow so if you arrive fast in front of the exit door the car s engine dies and you slip back into a wall there is a big turn right before the exit The coffee at breakfast was awfull a 4 stars hotel should have an espresso machine It takes about 10 seconds to have the light in the bathroom It feels like forever , The breakfast was varied and good The stuff was friendly The room is big and clean The wi fi is free and it works pretty good 
371708,Hotel Kavalier, The hotel has a smell of an old building probably is not completely renovated the parking place in the garrage of the hotel is really expansive 15 euro per day don t book this hotel if you travel by car I am sure there are other hotels at the same price with free parking place The internet connection is very very weak almost you can tell there is no any , The location is good if you are just on a night break and want to be close to Schonbrunn and A1 The breakfast is excellent we really enjoyed it 
371709,Hotel Kavalier, 16 EUR for parking why The room was tidy but only at first sight It was very complicated to find some socket to charge a cell phone , If you want to visit Sch nbrunn choose this hotel The hotel is easy to find Wi Fi for free single login per device 
371710,Hotel Kavalier, Wifi was very poor and didn work at all In the booking price breakfast was included but in the hotel they want to add extra price for the breakfast , Cleanliness staff easy transport to city center 
371711,Hotel Kavalier, Cleaning staff start making noise to early in the morning Street side rooms will get much more noise from outside , Big and clean rooms Breakfast Good value for this money 
371712,Hotel Kavalier, We had requested parking but upon arrival the garage was being renovated We had to park on the street about a block away , Easy to get to Shonbrunn palace and metro to Vienna on the bus Not hard to find
371713,Hotel Kavalier, Nothing, Thanks for the early check in The breakfast was good the location is close to tram stop and connects easily to town center 15 min to schonbrunn by tram 
371714,Hotel Kavalier, Bit far out of town Fine but not it is not 4 star , Lovely staff Comfy beds Location not the best but at least tram stops outside Breakfast was decent 
371715,Hotel Kavalier, Location wasn t great My room looked out onto the train tracks and was intermittently noisy The neighborhood is a bit dodgy Room furniture was stripped down to the pure basics , Good value for money friendly staff and very clean 
371716,Hotel Kavalier, Very noisy rooms could not sleep due to main road traffic and as well noise from other rooms No posibility to buy parking ticket at the hotel had to search 30 min where to buy , Big size room clean 
371717,Hotel Kavalier, the room i stayed in had two smaller beds and it did not feel too spacious , it was clean and quiet good breakfast closeness to the A1 was good for me and one of the main reasons i chose the hotel excellent value for the price the mini fridge which was unexpectedly silent came in handy 
371718,Hotel Kavalier, Our room was facing a street so it was a little bit noisy No kettle in the room , Good location not in the city center but close to the train station and tram Good breakfast and WiFi connection Nice and clean room with refrigerator Friendly staff at reception I will definitely consider to stay at this hotel again 
371719,Hotel Kavalier, The parking is like 20 Euros day and if you park on the street you ll have to buy parking tickets and replace them every 2 hours Austrian police is everywhere they give you a ticket even if your parking ticket is still available ,No Positive
371720,Hotel Kavalier, 1 The shower was too hot or cold and it took me time to make it warm 2 There is no tea pot in the room and there is no drinking water in the room or at the floor So it s not 4 stars only very good 3 ones 3 The mirror at the bathroom was not clean enough , 1 The breakfast was great the bed linen was really white and clean the personal helpful and careful 2 And I could leave my luggage in a baggage room after check out to the late evening free 3 It takes only 10 min on foot to get th metro station and 15 to get the Schonbrunn Zoo or 3 5 min by bus 
371721,Hotel Kavalier, Their policy not to welcome pets leaves an ugly stain on the hotel s otherwise nice overall appearance That is not necessary in 2016 While we got a very good room rate their pricing varies a lot and can be unreasonably high for certain dates , Friendly staff clean and spacious rooms good breakfast included in the room rate rather rare these days while its location is not exactly central it is still well connected and it only takes a 15 minute tram ride to the center
371722,Hotel Kavalier, The water tap in the bathroom was near failing so the water was too hot or too cold , Good location close to Schonbrunn nice and comfy room Breakfast was also nice 
371723,Hotel Kavalier, The railway station is really close Therefore the rooms are a little bit noisy , Good breakfast Comfortable bed Tram stop is almost in front of the hotel Sch nbrunn is reachable by walk
371724,Hotel Kavalier, The hotel is located next to the railway hubs so remember to sleep every 5 min allow the train at full speed we did not sleep at all avoid this hotel if you think you sleep ,No Positive
371725,Hotel Kavalier, there was not parking space for my car I had to leave my car outside the receiving receptionist was not great but the leaving one was good, the location and the facilities were pretty good
371726,Hotel Kavalier, The room was too hot and it was impossible to get the air on to go under 21 degrees way to hot for sleeping and when opening the window there was too much street noise At breakfast the selection was a bit too ordinary and the bacon was warm ish and floppy not browned , that breakfast was included in the price
371727,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, Too good for this price We paid 43 euros for a dbl room with breakfast included Parking is 16 euros but there is a public parking opposite the hotel which is free if you arrive late in the evening until 9 am next day Breakfast was quite rich for the sum of money we paid It was close to Schonbrunn We ll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Vienna 
371728,Hotel Kavalier, Parking was quite expensive missing information folder on the room with general information most necessary was inside the keycard holder , Clean spacious room location good close to tram that lead straight to center Good looking welcoming Breakfast was fine plenty of staff to cleanup and replace food 
371729,Hotel Kavalier, We din not had any towels in our room and we were asked to come to the reception to take them Unfortunately we have asked for a late check out if approx 1 hour and it was ok for them but after exactly 1 hour they called us to check out the room not even 10 or 20 min more , The hotel improved the breakfast and had been paid more attention to client requests 
371730,Hotel Kavalier, Wifi signal is too weak in room and only possible using it in lobby , Just beside of tram 52 line and easy to access to city center approx 20 30 mins Good place for group traveller Free breakfast is also good 
371731,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, We would like to sincerely share our Thank you to all the staff at the front desk and at the breakfast table gorgeous times Thank You 
371732,Hotel Kavalier, The breakfast was the same each day The cleaning ladies were very noisy each morning starting 7 a m On booking it was written that the room was queen size bed but it was a twin room , The price
371733,Hotel Kavalier, The breakfast is not great and it is the same each morning The cleaning ladies make a lot of noise in the morning starting from 7 a m , The price is correct for the conditions offered 
371734,Hotel Kavalier, The staff is not friendly at all with the exception of the lady from the reception who was very nice and kind Even though on booking it was double room we received a twin room and they told us to move the bed closed to each other if we want a double bed We stayed there many nights and the breakfast was the same each day even poor some days when there were groups of tourists The hotel is old The cleaning ladies were making lot of noise in the morning because at 7 o clock they were carring some rolling cases for towels and they were running with them , The price per night was very good 
371735,Hotel Kavalier, It is not in the city center as presented in the booking From one side of the hotel there are tramrails from the other trainrails Noisy , Rooms are big Breakfast is good
371736,Hotel Kavalier, Hotel does not have restaurant Ventilation in bathroom works very strange probably it is broken it makes big noise Aircondition does not work In room is very hot even when close radiators Windows and doors do not tightly sealed and during windy weather everything is shaking banging draught whistles Parking is very expensive and on site is possible to park for free , Good place near Sch nbrunn
371737,Hotel Kavalier, The hotel is right next to multi track railway with sidings points and much NOISY traffic I requested a superior room quiet with double bed and got an average room with two singles The bedroom overlooked the railway and if this was a quiet room I dread to think what the others would be like Didn t get much sleep Overnight parking at 16 per night is expensive , Pleasant staff included breakfast was reasonable
371738,Hotel Kavalier, When I got to the reception there was no one there so after waiting five minutes I rang the bell at the reception Eventually after another five minutes came a person Wi fi works very poorly has no signal so I could not even watch a video The bathroom was not very clean , Good location with free parking place outside on the street 
371739,Hotel Kavalier, breakfast so and so quality food in general same food every day worst coffee that I had in the past year in a hotel understaffed in the restaurant it was very crowded one morning and you had to wait 10 20 minutes to get a clean table not very nice if you are in a hurry I was asked to pay for the room in advance the moment we arrived not very comunicative staff room was poorly vented the window would open only partially and it is hard to get fresh air in a lot of warmth from the heating in a bad ventilated room made the air very DRY at night afar from the Operring and center of Vienna 7 km by car good quality furnishings but showing signs of use and abuse , cozy and spacious room 3 different table surfaces coffee table with two chairs make up table and a working desk good size bathtub quietness inspite of the room facing the train lines free parking in the street easily accesible by car working refrigerator fast elevators 42 inch lg led tv with a good selection of HD channels good location for reaching Schloss Schonbrunn on foot free Vienna map at reception 
371740,Hotel Kavalier, The wifi was the worst in this hotel It was always maximum 200kbps and it made in unable to search for anything in an online map or even watch youtube videos , We really loved the rooms They where amazingly warm and comfortable Breakfast was also great We also had no problem at all with the trains They stopped completely at night Lastly the view from our rooms was really nice 
371741,Hotel Kavalier, We asked for a double bed but the hotel has only two twin beds Please check before booking, Location is not too far and tram stop is nearby The hotel is decent with very friendly staff 
371742,Hotel Kavalier, The Receptionist didn t understand what we booked instantly prepared the room Too much dissapointed at this hotel Service and quality is just two stars Never use there again , Breakfast was good Many variety of food were served 
371743,Hotel Kavalier, You could tell it hasn t been renovated in a while Old furniture carpets etc Bad smell on the hallway, Great staff the people at the reception were very very nice Overall it s a good and clean hotel good breakfast
371744,Hotel Kavalier, You can not leave the car unattented for 1 minute infront of the hotel to check out The staff sais it s up to the police It was ok when I checked in the staff told me it s ok but when I was checking out one car was towed away it s true it was parked infront of the hotel the guest wasn t checking out or in and the staff told me I shouldn t leave the car unattened I don t know how you can check in or out if you re travelling alone and the staff can t have a look at your car for 5 10 minutes I guess it s different if you use their garage for 16 eur night it s not for 24 hours , Great value for money 
371745,Hotel Kavalier, We asked for a double bed and instead we got a twin rooms with two bounted beds We asked the receptionist to help us with a dinner reservation and she wasn t capable to help us in any way after several explanations she only dialled the restaurant s number and passed me the phone to speak in German I find this unacceptable for a 4 hotel , The breakfast was varied with products of excellent quality The room was clean The city centre is a little fat We found free parking across the street but only because it was weekend 
371746,Hotel Kavalier, The internet connection was slow and somewhat restrictive Had to sign in several times during the stay , Great breakfast Conveniently located just in front of a tram stop 
371747,Hotel Kavalier, Difficult to balance hot and cold water in the bathroom, Close to public transportation 15 20 minutes away from city center Free Wi Fi Kind and helpful front desk staff
371748,Hotel Kavalier, Definitely not a 4 star hotel more like a 3 One side of the hotel is facing the train tracks so make sure you ask for a room facing the street The guy at the reception wasn t particularly polite or helpful couldn t tell how to get to the closest subway station my question when does the restaurant open for breakfast was answered Same as yesterday , excellent value for the price 15min walk from Schonbrunn Good breakfast
371749,Hotel Kavalier,No Negative, The hotel is clean nice and cozy The people were very nice especially a young romanian lady she helped us very much by giving us accurate transport directions The cleaning was made daily also the towels changed every day Flatscreen tv A small fridge empty no unsolicited beverages The bathroom clean quite big Also the room was big The matresses were confortable but the our double room had 2 single beds put together insted of one double The breakfast had many items good quality It consisted of the classic items ham cheese salami eggs tomatoes cucumbers fruit cereal jam honey juices different pastries etc but also fruit salads fruit yoghurt pancakes one day apfelstrudel some days even vegetable soup which we did not try We had a room facing the street and not on the railway so it was also quiet The location is not extraordinary but also not bad Near Schonbrunn You also have one Hofer market near same type as Lidl and a Billa You have a tram near the entrance of the hotel metro station not far approx 15 min walk I guess but you may need an hour to get in center especially in the evening All in all very good price quality ratio would definitely recommend for the price you pay in Vienna you get super value 
371750,Hotel Kavalier, Hotel is very far from the city center For wifi you need to get separate piece of paper with code every 12 hours not a very user friendly thing , Hotel is nice and clear 
371751,Hotel Kavalier, Even we booked by credit card the lady from the reception asked us to pay the room in advance Cleaning stuff awoke us at 8 a m even I was hanging on the door the ticket do not disturbe And that s happend every morning of our stay , The room and the bathroom was ok very confortable and clean the breakfast very good 
371752,Hotel Kavalier, The photo in booking is not reflecting the real room experience One staff are not welling to help me when i request them to call the airline office in vienna as i dont understand the language of the airline phone operator and he lift me with even appologize for not helping me also the breakfast were the same as for seven days with no change The reception staff is not up to the four star hotels level It may be fine for one night transit , May be the location is quit and relatively not far from the city center
371753,Hotel Kavalier, It was a small shame that one member of our group in a single room was on a different floor to us in a double room We made good use of the internal phones Wifi was a bit hit and miss in the rooms , Very comfortable Lovely breakfast Good location for us with parking for our hire car and to visit the Sch nbrunn Palace The staff were friendly and helpful thank you 
371754,Hotel Kavalier, It s not good to be sent to another hotel without information ahead when we travelled long to find the one we booked Your partner hotel is very good at location if we knew that we would be sent there we wouldn t spent much time and energy to get to you , Actually the ratings are for the Hotel Prinz Eugen near Haupt Bahnhof bacause Hotel Kavalier sent us there due to the fullness of the rooms 
371755,Hotel Kavalier, Unfortunately the hot water was not functioning properly in the bathroom and even has just stopped all of a sudden with very cold water flowing instead , Good breakfast
371756,Hotel Kavalier, The room design and furniture is a little outdated Breakfast was decent but do not expect something special only standard items I would have appreciated some espresso cappuccino or fresh bakery , Comfortable big beds large screen TV overall nice conditions Underground garage Close to Schonbrun Palace 
371757,Hotel Kavalier, Very slow Internet The door card had to be used 5 or more times to get the door opened , The food The AC Quiet area Elevator Tram 52 is near the hotel Otherwise The city center is quite far away
