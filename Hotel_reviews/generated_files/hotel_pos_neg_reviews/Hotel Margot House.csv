397183,Hotel Margot House, Really confusing method for the payment they blocked the total amount before we arrive than they charge us the total amount again also the bicycle rent did the same and block 800Eur for insurance which is really bad other than that every than was more than great , Wonderful location comfort helpful and attentive staff we had beautiful suite with minimalist design and mesmerizing view 
397184,Hotel Margot House, Nothing , This is a superb place to stay The bedroom was small but well designed The breakfast was excellent Coffee was available at all times in the large residents area Overall design is perfect in a beautiful building Staff members were charming and helpful at all times The train from Sitges stops near the front door We were welcome to stay as long as we liked after checking out in the residents area while we waited for our late night flight 
397185,Hotel Margot House, I didnt like the fact there is no telephone in the room so if you need something from reception you need to go there in person This wasnt very comfortable for me as I had to go there few times Also the fact the door doesnt have incorporated peep hole doesnt make me feel comfortable at all You dont know who is knocking on your door when you re opening it The hotel is beautiful but the majority of the rooms are basically with no daily light at all I had to pay for upgrade to feel good in my room thanks God because of my birthday they got me better rate for that but I think they should inform the guests before they re coming to their accomodation about that fact , The bed was fantastic and if you pay the expensive room the view is just fantastic You have feeling like you re at home especially when you go to common area for breakfast or just to have cup of tea The staff is lovely 
397186,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, Barcelona is a town full of experiences One of the best experiences was this hotel Awesome location Delicious food at all hours Amazing smell in the hygiene products Decoration that appeals to your senses Relaxing music and environment Exceptional staff who treats you with the utmost respect and at the same time like they know you since you were little One of whom was the coolest Portuguese ever 
397187,Hotel Margot House, Rooms very closer to the reception and common area noisy and also giving the impression that someone was entering on it, Nice design Breakfast Common areas Shower
397188,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, The Hotel is charming welcoming well located and the attention top details is 5 star I was there only for a quick visit but wish I could have spent more time in it Highly recommended 
397189,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, Everything was excellent from the friendly staff to the soundproof room with great furnitures This will always be my first choice every time I come to Barcelona
397190,Hotel Margot House, It would be better for the hanger to be installed out of shower room and to have extra hangers for the hand towels , Best Location The breakfast provided was so fresh and yummy and Nacho was so friendly and kind 
397191,Hotel Margot House, The wifi connection was very slow , Minimalistic yet luxureous interior of the rooms and lobby which felt like a huge living room Friendly staff Super comfortable beds and a rain shower with water pressure I ve never come across before 
397192,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, Location is unbeatable Then beds were extremely comfortable The modern style and decor are outstanding The reading room the kitchen the rooms themselves Wow The best breakfast in Barcelona The staff are outstanding and accommodating Gaudi s work directly across the street I can keep going on and on Best and coolest hotel I will go back as often I go back to Barcelona 
397193,Hotel Margot House, It could have been fair to warn us before the booking that the room called interior rooms which do not have a view on Paseo de Gracia do not benefit from natural light This is very detrimental to the comfort This should not be possible considering the price of the room , Good location and great breakfast
397194,Hotel Margot House, Loved everything, Beautifully furnished Loved the lounge area where you could help yourself to a drink sit and read or just relax after a big day out We stayed in a front room overlooking Paseo de Gracia Very happy to see Aesop products in rooms 
397195,Hotel Margot House, There was some construction and generally the walls seemed thin Bring earplugs we always travel with them and you will be fine We slept late nearly every morning with them , Margot House was excellent The decor location directly across from Casa Batllo room staff breakfast bath products Aesop etc were all fantastic Also having access to Porter Sail concierge app was incredible It helped to guide our trip and never steered us wrong 
397196,Hotel Margot House, It was a bit noisy the night we stayed in but not sure if noise was coming from hotel itself or from flat above next door , Big living room with a homely feel comfy bed and spacious bathroom lovely and helpful staff delicious breakfast 
397197,Hotel Margot House, Nothing, Great comfy bed Amazing super fresh and tasty breakfast Love the simple and very elegant deco with natural materials Staff was amazing and superbe location opposite the gaudi house Will be back 
397198,Hotel Margot House, attitude of the staff when there was a problem with the hot water in the morning their was no hot water they didn t excuse only answer we got was that we had hot water in the evening so for them all was ok seems strange for us Also breakfast is overrated the same as everywhere no local specialties besides the traditional ham cheese and salami so below expectations as well, location was top having the room above the terrace of the Mc caf was very noisy in the morning price quality was overrated One need to take the suite as all the other rooms are very small 
397199,Hotel Margot House, The door to our bathroom kept getting stuck on the cement floor room 2 which meant you couldn t close it not great for privacy whilst on the toilet The rooms need a full length mirror an iron ironing board our only option was to pay for it to be done a welcome book outlining info about what you can do within the hotel processes and costs We got stung with the washing of our smalls The most expensive load of washing I ve ever paid for We found the day time manager quite cold and unfriendly The night time staff were lovely though , The design of the hotel is great Beds are super comfy and bed linen extra soft Love the Aesop products Double shower and bath brilliant Netflix in room a winner plus free wifi Great breakfast and free snacks throughout the day We received a lovely gift bag during our stay with product from various food suppliers 
397200,Hotel Margot House, Some of the rooms don t have windows so check when booking if you have a tendency to feel claustrophobic , The hotel is set up like an apartment and service is highly personalized The staff were very friendly and helpful Every question we had was immediately answered every issue efficiently dealt with The hotel is amazingly quiet considering the location 
397201,Hotel Margot House, We loved it and nothing that we didn t like except not having stayed there for more nights , We liked everything about it Best location Amazing staff Amazing interior decor Most friendly staff that we have ever experienced You are really made to feel at home 
397202,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, The staff were amazingly attentive and thoughtful and their effort to make Margot House feel like being at home was well accomplished I would definitely stay here again 
397203,Hotel Margot House, Would prefer to have key to gain access to main entrance becomes rather annoying having to ring the bell each time , Clean simple rooms Great shower great breakfast
397204,Hotel Margot House, If you wanted to be a prisoner it s a good choice for you It s not a hotel at all only a hostel for the better off The receptionist Alessandio would command you don t do this don t do that when he introduced the area If you wanted to touch anything in the public area you had to ask for his permission first As our passports were locked inside the luggage which was stored by Alessandio During check in time he blamed us not to submit the documents to him immediately and warned us that he had the right not to allow us to get in This rude attitude was not a normal hotel customer service If he gave us back the luggage of course we could give our documents at once The room was dark with one locked fake window which was facing the inside corridor whenever someone passed by they could see your room clearly so you had to lower down the curtain lived inside a dungeon or prison The bed had no duvet or blanket at all but only with one white sheet for you to cover When we asked for it they dared to say the horizontal bed decoration sheet was a blanket With further complaint the more nicer female receptionist finally gave us a duvet Remember this place was not on the ground floor you had to pass three gates to go upstairs however the first gate was in a busy street and you had to press a button to wait the receptionist to open the gate the first day we had to wait more than 5 minutes in the street before we could get in It was so embarrassing when everyone in the street staring at you as you pressed the button and waited so long If we paid the price of a hostel we would shut our mouth and say nothing It was ridiculous to pay such money to receive such service In this trip of Spain we experienced the worst so called hotel in their word in our life , The breakfast was not bad 
397205,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, The interior design of the place is amazing and gives the lobby living room area a homely feel We only stayed one night but felt like at home immediately 
397206,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect for sightseeing It was as oasis of calm after the hustle and bustle of the streets of Barcelona All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was a sight to behold 
397207,Hotel Margot House, Would be good to have another large mirror in bedroom , Lovely ambience bed super comfy really lovely fresh breakfast Staff incredibly friendly and nothing to much trouble Really enjoyed our stay Would definitely come back to Margot House 
397208,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, We would like to thank the staff of the hotel for the excellent service warm hospitality and always eager to help make our stay as comfortable as possible The location of the hotel is excellent the rooms are large spacious clean and very beautiful the breakfast was really tasty with a variety to chose from We highly recommend this hotel and No doubt that the hotel experience make out trip unforgettable we will defiantly return again
397209,Hotel Margot House, Bathroom was a little bit smelly , Great little place Loved the personal touch Fantastic location Very comfortable in the room and a lounge area that was a joy to sit in Complimentary cake hot drinks and a glass of sparkling wine were very welcome

397211,Hotel Margot House, The room had no windows so there was no daylight The breakfast was always the same everyday Wifi was not stable , The bed was extremely comfortable the bathroom was very spacious and good for couples
397212,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Margot I can t think of 1 thing that was less than perfect very comfortable quiet rooms that were well appointed The front desk staff was friendly and helpful amazing breakfast experience as well Wonderful boutique hotel highly recommended 
397213,Hotel Margot House, 1 There are no signs indicating where the hotel is It took 15 minutes for us to figure out that the hotel is actually on the 1st floor of a bulding but this is not indicated anywhere The staff of the hotel claims that this is because this place is supposed to be secret Well I woild say rather than secret is badly indicated 2 internet connection not working for an entire day When we complained about it the 2 people at front desk tried to do some useless attempts to restore the connection and then they said that nothing could have been fixed until the day after as nobody works on Sunday this happened on Sunday Result I could not send some important documents and this ruined my day 3 we had a sleepless night some horrible noises of chairs and table being moved from above or maybe next door made impossible for us to sleep I believe that our room was right next door to a restaurant or something like that and nothing was done to make the rooms soundproof 4 the idea of the ladies making the breakfast right in front of your eyes every morning is nice However the boiled eggs that we had cooked were hard like stones and these women were cutting 5 slices of ham and cheese a time so we didn t feel like grabbing more than 1 slice each because this would have meant to empty the plate of ham and cheeses available for the other guests Summary the idea of this home style hotel is innovative However before spending time on details they should have spent time on more important things such as making the rooms quiet and soundproof or guaranteeing an Internet connection to the guests If this is supposed to be Margot s house Margot has a lot of work to do to make my stay pleasant , Location perfect 
397214,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, The staff is friendly kind and helpful very professional and welcoming They go to great lengths to assist in such things as making dinner reservations haircut appointments or buying tickets to events And THEIR recommendations are great Additionally they provide the most beautiful breakfast we ve ever seen or eaten Margot House is truly a great find 
397215,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, We were in Barcelona for one day and had to wake up at 5am to go to the airport It was really hard to leave the hotel behind as it was such an amazing and comfortable space Can t wait to go back and stay here again for longer 
397216,Hotel Margot House, Not all rooms have windows This is good if you need the absolute quietest room but not good if you prefer natural light Although not a big negative since there is so much to do in this part of the city there s no need to hang out in the room during the day , Cleanliness and overall feel of the property very home like inviting and comfortable common areas Excellent breakfast 
397217,Hotel Margot House, That we had to leave , Margot house is a true gem The best location within the city of Barcelona and an incredible space which has been created Coming from 2 very seasoned vacationers this was one of the most impressive hotels we have stayed in A different approach to luxury accommodation but one I hope to see more of 
397218,Hotel Margot House,No Negative, Hotel Margot House location and its wonderful helpful and warm staff can t be beat Both were perfect Breakfast was yummy Now onto the design and aesthetics cool without trying too hard Highly recommended 
397219,Hotel Margot House, The lack of an external area such as a terrace If someone wants to smoke he has to go downstairs outside the building , Excellent staff location right across casa Batlo breakfast Very pleasant and peaceful interior decoration Spacious rooms Feels like staying in your own apartment in Barcelona Laila at the reception was always joyful and helpful
