250115,Chambiges Elys es, Not initially allocated rooms next to the children s room in fact all the way across the hall so we had to split up Was sorted the next day but needed to push for it ,No Positive
250116,Chambiges Elys es, The only small criticism would be the size of the breakfast area if all guests descended on this area at the same time then it would not cope But unlikely and a small trade off for its location and style , This hotel is tucked away just off the Champs Elysees and in a nice area 5 mins walk from the Metro Alma Marceau or Franklin D Roosevelt Alma is nearer Its a small boutique hotel but with everything you need for a very comfortable stay Charming reception staff who could not do enough for us and recommended an excellent restaurant which was only 200 metres away Despite a small breakfast area the choice was good and freshly prepared Easy walking into the centre of Paris along the Seine or the Champs Elysees plus options for Batobus or Metro stations to assist We upgraded to the Deluxe room and this was beautifully decorated in classic french decor with a sofa seating area and balcony A wonderful time in a beautiful place 
250117,Chambiges Elys es, AC in one of the rooms not working very well but was just cool enough AC in the other room worked very well , Family of 4 so staying in the apartment was excellent Very roomy Very clean Excellent daily housekeeping Alicia at the breakfast service was excellent fresh food good coffee big smile Front desk very helpful with recommendations and dinner reservations Excellent location 
250118,Chambiges Elys es, Nothing, Beautiful lovely hotel Great location The staff is very friendly welcoming efficient and accommodating even to some of our unique requests We recommend this lovely hotel 
250119,Chambiges Elys es, I didn t appreciate how they trick us into getting the attic of the hotel I booked a suite and they give me the worst one I should have been more selective and never approve on getting that room We have to bend because letterly we were at the attic And when it was raining we hear the rain like we were sleeping in a tin can The bed was so in comfortable And the breakfast buffet need to be better The coffee for example is tasteless The front desk were very helpful during our stay But when I ask about the sports channel I expect an answer other than I m alone at the desk I can t help you with anything , I loved the location of the hotel It was perfect for me especially when traveling with my kids The supermarket next to the hotel was a plus Also how clean and quiet the street of the hotel was 
250120,Chambiges Elys es, The breakfast area was rather small and cramped The water in the shower was only lukewarm at 7 pm when one wanted to shower before going out in the evening The Internet connection was very slow , The characterful and well equipped room was very comfortable with a small seating area by the windows which opened on to a small balcony overlooking the street All the staff were very friendly and helpful particularly the cheerful breakfast lady 
250121,Chambiges Elys es,No Negative, Wonderful friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast choice I especially liked the way the breakfast seating area was set up very cozy Lovely tranquil bedroom and lounge area great location with nice local restaurants I was a solo traveller and found that I had no problem as I was made to feel most welcome everywhere I visited 
250122,Chambiges Elys es,No Negative, For me this charming hotel was perfect Just around the corner from the Theatre des Champs Elysees and conveniently located near the Metro and Bus service I would certainly book here again For a wonderful dining experience try Mollard a beautiful Art Nouveau Restaurant specialising in French seafood but serving other dishes as well Lovey food and elegant service almost a step back in time Located at 115 rue Saint Lazare Loved it 
250123,Chambiges Elys es, We should give them the key Whenever we leave the hotel but I do not know why but it is not A big deal And Overall the hotel is really great, The room was cozy and the staff are nice we should catch the early plane and they prepare the breakfast earlier than the normal time for us 
250124,Chambiges Elys es, Plug in bath faulty so could not take a bath Towels a bit grey Electric lights came on after stepped out of room or lift Nobody closed the curtains at night Only 1 staff at reception at any time I had to wait for check in Not their fault but husband banging on his wife s bedroom door and shouting loudly and aggressively woke me up I felt if there was cctv this could have been addressed without me having to call reception , The decor was very fine Cloth on walls and matching curtains The reception staff were helpful Top Location 
250125,Chambiges Elys es, While the hotel is in a classy neighborhood and on a very quiet street it s not on a metro station Staying there in the winter made it not fun to walk back and from the metro station 8 minute walk We ended up taking taxis from around the corner there are plenty in front of Hotel Plaza Athenee , Beautiful decor just like in the pictures Very cozy Spacious rooms Nice breakfast 
250126,Chambiges Elys es, The prices of the drinks etc in the mini bar and the hotel bar are excessive but so is everything in Paris , The hotel is small and charming which is exactly what we were looking for It s in a good location in a quiet street off rue Montaigne We stayed in a deluxe room and had all we needed We would definitely return 
250127,Chambiges Elys es, Nothing, The location is really good and staff are really helpful We take the long flight arrive in the morning she processed an early check in for us And the day we leave the hotel to airport we left phone in the taxi the reception staff helped us to contact the taxi driver and send the phone to the airport

250129,Chambiges Elys es,No Negative, We stayed only two nights in Paris However we all enjoyed our stay thanks to the staffs in the hotel Their hospitality was amazing and we would love to go back there again In addition to that regarding the room I think the size was bigger than other hotels in Paris The location was perfect as well You can access to Effiel Tower easily and do shopping in Champs lys es If you want to stay somewhere convenient but not too busy location this hotel is the best one for you

250132,Chambiges Elys es, Why don t all hotel staff ask if you have emptied the safe and not just the mini bar as a necessary question at checkout We almost forgot to check ours , very nice breakfast if breakfast area is a little cramped Great location Very comfy bed and pin drop quiet room 
250133,Chambiges Elys es, Only slight problem in a converted town house is that the breakfast room is small and a little cramped when busy Chairs a bit too large for the space and buffet is hard to access if other guests already there , Upgraded to Deluxe room Quiet and spacious Staff kind helpful and remembered me from my last visit when I injured my leg when they were very helpful Elegant and stylish setting 
250134,Chambiges Elys es,No Negative, We loved our romantic stay at the Chambiges Elys es We were placed in a large room on the main level which was the most comfortable and nice room that I have ever stayed in in Paris over 15 trips Location is perfect moments to 2 different metro line and several bus lines moments to the Seine and Eiffel Tower and Champs lys es friendly staff 
250135,Chambiges Elys es, Bathroom offered little privacy Beautiful facility but with open area of shower tub and no curtain it made sharing the lavatory while someone was bathing impossible There was a separate WC area that helped a great deal We quickly adapted and made it work out well Upon checkout the desk staff had copy of my credit card and told me that when the last of our group of 3 left she could handle the check out 2 of us were leaving early however I was later told by the last member of our group that she had to put the charge on her card That could have been a major disaster had the last member of group not been able to handle the fee on her card , Such friendly staff I emailed prior to arrival to ask a few questions and was promptly answered with courteous care each time I made contact They also arranged for our airport transfer What a life saver Room was clean and freshened daily What a joy to return from an adventure late in the day to find a neat room and fresh linens in bath We were always greeted with a friendly smile and kind word regardless of the time of day Location is ideal Just a block or two from Champs Elysees and other areas of interest we were able to walk to most attractions

250148,Chambiges Elys es, I entered the bar for a drink the person on duty did not acknowledge me I think you have to go to reception from the bar to order a drink but he could see me in the bar still didn t acknowledge me Not a big problem but I think service could be improved if guests are properly acknowledged, Location of hotel style of room
