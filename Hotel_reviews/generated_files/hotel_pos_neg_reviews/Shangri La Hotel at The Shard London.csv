147608,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, We order a take away however when we asked reception staff for an empty plate we were told we had to pay 15 You would think that for the price per night of the room an empty plate would be free Completely unnecessary to charge such a fee , Stunning view 
147609,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The price for Christmas Dinner was a little high , Stayed for Christmas and could not fault a thing with the hotel itself Service was amazing staff superb and overall a brilliant stay 
147610,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Staff in restaurant where lacking focus on clients too slow order taking took too long, Great location wonderful views over London extraordinary rooms

147612,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Very disappointed with our evening meal at the Ting My chicken was very pink and when I told the waiter it took him 10 mins to get back to me that the chef agreed and he would do me another one but by then my husband was almost finished with his main course So I didn t bother to eat a main course as I didn t want to eat alone but my husband ended eating alone anyway The service was extremely slow and poor and no apologies for the uncooked chicken Really disappointed and upset as this was a birthday treat for my husband ,No Positive
147613,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London,No Negative, Person on check in was beyond nice he knew it was my husband s birthday so he upgraded us to a suite The suite was spacious with beautiful view from every room as well as the bathroom 
147614,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Could not fault anything, The TV in the mirror in the bathroom all the toiletries the view the bed which had an extra mattress topper which made it so much more comfortable
147615,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, having to be charged extra for a room with a better view, the view was amazing from the room Check in was really quick was supposed to be at 3pm was given the room at 1pm
147616,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London,No Negative, The facility and the views are really good Knowing we celebrating my husband s birthday the staff was kindly left a surprise birthday cake in our room Will definitely come again 
147617,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Could have been cheaper but it no more expensive than other 5 star hotels Location however despite being on top of a Tube station could have been better as its far from many of the more interesting parts of London , Service is on point with what you d expect with a world renowned luxury label Efficient personable and tactful Accomodations are equally sublime However the main reason to stay at the Shard is for the unbeatable room Pay the extra for a city view breathtaking view of London to be had no where else 
147618,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Unfortunately someone was able to charge drinks and food to my room the charge was taken when I checked out thankfully I noticed and alerted someone at reception My money was refunded but it makes me wonder how someone managed to charge over 100 worth of alcohol and food to a room that wasn t the same number as to the one I was staying in , Staff were very polite and helpful Breakfast was cooked lovely and the room was spotless everything was perfect 
147619,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The area around the location was not good for shopping , The staff were very attentive and polite The room was spacious extremely comfortable and well appointed View would have been extraordinary if the fog had lifted during our stay

147621,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Internet and WiFi connection was extremely poor I couldn t connect to the WiFi throughout the whole of my stay, The pool was amazing the views obviously incredible and the staff could not have been more attentive and proud of their work 
147622,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Food was too pricey and breakfast should be included into the price or at least for children , Food was excellent though Site and staff were great and assisted with all queries Great View
147623,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Nothing whatsoever to fault, The best hotel to stay in ever From the amazing views the anything to help attitude of the staff through to that oh so lovely heated loo seat there s nothing to on which to fault the Shangri La This is an amazing place 
147624,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, We left our room around mid day and expected it to have been cleaned by the time we came back but it hadn t been We tried to order breakfast in the room but there was a 1 1 2 hour wait , Staff would do anything to make your stay perfect Lovely pool 
147625,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, We had to pay the full cost of a 3 night stay some months in advance rather than a holding deposit which isn t our usual experience at other hotels Also for our special occasion weekend Hotel staff failed to deliver on a special surprise treat agreed in advance and on the day The Duty Manager did later apologise , The appeal of this hotel is that it occupies floors 35 to 52 within the Shard the 70 storey iconic tourist attraction on the Southbank of London s River Thames Hence all rooms have magnificent panoramic views You can upgrade to get City views of e g The River Thames Westminster London Eye Tower Bridge etc etc Facilities within this hotel are on the more expensive side but offer a touch of luxury especially for that special occasion Apart from being within the Shard it is well located near the Southbank for lovely restaurants and strolls along the waterside to the Globe Theatre art galleries the London Eye etc It is opposite the interesting Borough Market and a short walk to London Bridge including its underground tube station Overall a very good experience 
147626,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Price of breakfast Not sure how one justifies 10 for porridge for example even in the best hotels in this part if London, Fantastic facilities and views of course Great attention to details 
147627,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The charges for mini bar items was prohibitive for very basic products I don t like using the word rip off but this is the only word that accurately represents my genuine position When we arrived there was a wedding party in the main reception area This wasn t a problem but when we went for dinner in the restaurant in the lobby area later in the evening we waited over an hour for our dinner to be served and were advised by the restaurant manager that the delay in the serving of our meal was due to delays in the kitchen attributed to the wedding function This is a 5 star establishment and the wedding was likely to be booked many months in advance and therefore one would have expected that the required number of kitchen staff would be on hand to ensure the guests in the hotel together with the guests attending the wedding function would have been adequately catered for On the third night my companion and I ordered tea coffee and scones again in the lobby restaurant area We were sitting at a low table and his knee accidentally hit the table and his entire cup of coffee spilled over The waiter enquired if he wanted a replacement coffee and he ordered another We were then charged for the extra coffee on top of 20 for 2 scones As stated above the only word that I can honestly use to describe the experience is rip off We paid 1 500 for a 3 night stay which was the equivalent of a recent trip to Dubai including return flights transfers and full weeks 1 2 board stay at a 5 star hotel Our stay at the Shard was to mark a special occasion and regrettably our lasting impression was fabulous but not worth the money rip off , The design and layout of the hotel and room was super The views were breath taking A lovely ambiance
147628,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Guests had just 5 discount if they wanted to go to the top of The Shard even though you pay a lot to stay Mini bar was very over priced 5 for a small bar of chocolate 3 for 1 can of coke , Everything except some prices
147629,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Breakfast Breakfast at Ting on Monday 28th Nov was a bit of a joke if you open a restaurant for breakfast at 06 30 then everything should be ready for the customer On Monday 28th Nov when I arrived for breakfast at about 06 45 I had to ask for a certain bread which the day before had been out ready however it still took over 10 minutes for the bread to arrive how can it take 10 minutes to simply bring out a loaf there were also other items missing on the buffet Also there was no hot self service buffet breakfast rather you had to place an order with a waiter this did not work as not only did it take too long for the hot food to arrive but when it did a couple of people I was traveling with had the wrong order given to them and the food wasn t hot Basically prior to Monday 28th Nov breakfast seemed to work well and as they say if it ain t broke don t fix it Simply all you need is a hot and cold buffet breakfast and let the customer get on with it themselves and just let the staff bring the tea coffee and clear the tables and check on the hot cold buffet if it needs replenishing and that is it however for some unknown reason there seemed to be a lot of staff buzzing around but what they are all actually doing is anyone s guess , very quite rooms
147630,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Not child friendly nowhere to get coffees at night staff couldn t be bothered to serve us had meal in oblix staff rushed us so they could have the table back, Clean rooms

147634,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Loved it all but expensive to eat and drink here, Fantastic place to stay pricey by our standards but as a treat well worth it cannot recommend this hotel enough the views are stunning 
147635,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, small gym no sauna or steam room staff not as attentive as they should be in a hotel like this you shouldn t have to be asked to be served in the bar , awesome view one of the best on the planet 
147636,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, A bit of expensive but I think it s worth it , The room unlike most of londons hotels have some space not very crowded The view from the room is stunning The breakfast is versatile and really really good The staff are friendly and very helpful I came for a course in Milton Keynes and the concearge arranged for me a list of all the trains and how to get to the train stations that take me directly to the city Overall I would definitely come back and I recommend it very much

147645,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, In house chocolates and nuts pretty poor Being patronised encouraged to take the tube not waiting taking a taxi from the hotel front had to go up escalators with our luggage to other taxi rank In the end the taxi journey across town only took 20 mins , Staff were superb 
147646,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, This is being picky because it really was all so good but a mirror near a power socket for a heated hair brush would be helpful , Great room extremely well appointed comfy bed bedding and pillows fabulous views of course Very friendly welcoming staff When they discovered on checking in that we were celebrating a birthday miraculously a delicious cake was waiting for us when we were shown to our room There was also a plate of complimentary fruit 
147647,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, It could have been cheaper lol but then everyone would go couldnt fault it , Wow where do you start the VIEWS were amazing we enjoyed a free upgrade the bed was sooo nice we had breakfast in bed the following morning just to enjoy the facilities and the staff were lovely very friendly

147651,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London,No Negative, Everything From the moment we stepped into the hotel to the minute we left we loved every moment Me and my wife love luxury and this was a treat for her birthday We live reasonably close to London for a start so neither of us fancied going out so we stayed in the hotel The staff were amazing and friendly They couldn t do enough for us We ordered from the in room dining menu which was extraordinary We both had the burger on the menu and was astounded when i was asked how did i want the burger cooked Around 30 minutes later the food arrived and was pushed into the room by one of the hotel staff The trolley the food was served in folded out as a table to we were able to sit around this to eat whilst enjoying the London Skyline The food was amazing I have never eaten something so delicious in all of my life I don t think i could have eaten any more than a main and a desert as it was so filling The rest of the evening was spent using the binoculars supplied by the hotel to gaze at the London Skyline From our room you could see the Southbank with the London Eye staring back We could see Big Ben illuminated in the back ground St Paul s Cathedral was right across the river from us and we had a fantastic view of London Bridge After a luxurious nights sleep in the biggest most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in we looked out over the morning London skyline which was somewhat more dismal and grey than the night before but being in The Shard made the weather irrelevant We went to breakfast which was included in our stay We were greeted at the entrance to the restaurant and shown to a table The chairs around the table were actual armchairs We were asked to get our food from the buffet which was the usual egg bacon sausage hash brown etc The food again was amazing We returned to the room to pack our things Everything had been amazing and was even better than we had imagined

147655,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, For such a high end hotel there were some small niggles around the turn down service but nothing too serious The champagne we ordered for our arrival was corked although this can happen anywhere obviously The hotel is expensive but I guess you do expect to pay a premium for such a stunning location , Location is perfect as are the views as one would expect from such a building The staff were sympathetic and helpful if somewhat inexperienced was asked to choose wine for dinner before seeing the food menu which was slightly odd The dinner itself at Ting was good although not exceptional The views from the infinity pool are however really special and spectacular 
147656,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Long wait at check in has to wait to be seated for dinner even though it was booked for 6pm and we turned up at 6pm had a seat by the window but they put us next to the waiters service area so had different waiters coming and going all the time Check out time valet bought the wrong car so had to wait longer than we would have liked but all in all it was good make sure you have a big enough budget before going though , Valet parking always someone on hand to help beautiful room with great view massive comfy bed had everything you could think of in the room lovely bathroom good choice of in room dining good choice of tv channels Had dinner booked at the ting restaurant halal menu had the free range chicken and British beef both beautifully cooked and table by the window with a view as well 
147657,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Give the option of keeping using towels as there were changed the same day I know it is part of the service but maybe some guests are environmentally friendly , Everything very good but maybe it could be a little bit less expensive

147668,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, More helpful staff e g Asked for tea in pool area and informed there is no tea just coffee or water At the cost of 550 per night I would have thought that finding a tea bag wouldn t be too much trouble , Views of London and luxury bathroom facilities

147681,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, not much to fault about the Shangri La other than the value for your money involving the food and meals In my opinion food should cost less as we are paying for the stay would be nice to have some sort of meal included with the stay , The bed in our room was amazing and so comfortable The staff where very helpful Polite and friendly and made us feel at home views where exceptional and the facilities in the Hotel where immaculate In general an amazing and magical place to stay as a couple offering the best service I have ever received in an International five star hotel transport links where also perfect as train and bus stations where just meters from the Hotel

147746,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The marks on the marble floors and stone tops in the bathrooms don t look so good even though they are clean, I loved the light large modern rooms Other hotels in London are all dark and dingy no matter how many stars they have

147752,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The fact that our room wasn t ready , The rooms were fantastic as were the staff our room wasn t going to be ready until 5 pm but the staff talked us through the other room available and showed us a room which turned out to be cheaper and better Fabulous views service was excellent Oh and the warm loo seat a marvel

147824,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Being questioned every time we entered the lower building They need a better system so hotel guests do not get asked what they are doing there every time they want to go to their room, Everything

147837,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, I struggle to think of anything but the only minor point would be a lack of fresh or enough milk in the room It would be nice for there to have been fresh milk or just more milk available and that was a little disappointing , The friendliness helpfulness and professional nature of all the staff we met Both inside and and on the door The setting and the room we had The ambience of the hotel Very special

147843,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The lack of parking or instructions on serviced parking We would have liked to simply drive up to the doorstep and someone would take and park our car on our behalf and bring it back on checkout , The view is worth every penny Just amazing Staff and facilities were exceptional

147850,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, we ordered drinks at the bar and had to chase them up after 5 min The tv in our bathroom did not work did not matter to us The mirror in the bathroom would not stay up room 4702, Very helpful staff Front of house were great 
147851,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, I feel the one negative of the Shangri La and I don t know if this is because it is part of a large group of hotels is that I think it lacks the personal touch of other good 5 hotels such as the Berkely or Langham e g putting little touches in the room such as a card chocolates cake or even a bottle of champagne in the case of the Berkely which makes it feel that little bit more special , We recently stayed at the Shangri La for my Husband s Birthday 28th November 15 and the views are simply breathtaking and the staff were very attentive

147874,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, It is not a bad experience as the location is great and the service was good but we had dinner in the restaurant Monday evening 19 10 and we had the 5 course menu We had expected a bit more of that Some taste combinations were a bit odd and the pig cheeks were not super , The view the comfort the location
147875,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, In the room we stayed in stains etched into bathroom floor need polishing off as on initial inspection they make the floor look dirty Some wall hangings are looking tired around the external corners and writing desk had a split in the leatherette small lamp table top had large impact damage site to one side Japanese toilet controls seemed to malfunction when used , Have stayed before and like more or less most aspects Some great furniture in the rooms and beautiful oriental inspired decor upholstery 
147876,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The only small issue is that we were not told that we did not have a window seat which is the whole point for dinner when we booked We should have been given the option or told we would not when we booked , Room service experience all 5

147882,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Would have been nicer if the pool was abit warmer, Great location and really friendly staff Loved the room binoculars to appreciate the gorgeous view and the bathroom was amazing 
147883,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, When we arrived there was a problem with the booking system so a room hadn t yet been allocated to us This meant waiting When we arrived in our room the lady demonstrated the blinds but they weren t working so someone from engineering had to come up and fix them Also because a room hadn t been allocated the birthday cake for my partner that the staff had assured me would be there wasn t there which took away from the wow factor when entering the room for me Luckily I managed to get the staff to sneak one in whilst we were in the swimming pool There were also minor niggles such as ring marks from cups on the marble surfaces and the nespresso machine stopped working just before we left the room to go home The above were things that just took away from that truly 5 star service especially when you re paying 560 for one night , Lovely room and the view was obviously amazing Nice touches such as the nespresso machine and binoculars The swimming pool on the 52nd floor is amazing Also having English breakfast in the morning with such an amazing view was a memorable experience 
147884,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Very very expensive , It was fabulous in every way fantastic friendly staff amazing views over London we even caught the Spitfire flypast for the Battle of Britain and a very comfy bed It was the first night of our honeymoon and they gave us a chocolate heart with truffles and a bouquet of roses Gorgeous

147887,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Not a good location for shopping , Good location for attractions on the Thames such as London Dungeon London Eye Shrek HMS Belfast Tower of London
147888,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Arrived at our room at 9pm after being caught in a torrential downpour Heating in our room wasn t working and blasting out cold air Electrical came and was in our room for almost 30mins and didn t fix the problem When I complained we were moved to a disabled room You don t pay this amount of money to stay in a disabled room with a revolting shower curtain , The views were amazing A few issues that were eventually sorted out but there shouldn t have been those issues 
147889,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Walking in through the ground floor I did not feel that the concierge was very interested in me I am just an ordinary person and obviously not wealthy like some of the travellers who stay there and as a result when I went out for my run I was ignored had to open my own door and was almost pushed out of the way by the concierge attempting to get the chinese lady into her taxi However reception staff were the opposite so not all bad They made me feel very special , I thought the hotel itself was amazing the room was spacious and everything had been thought through The bathroom with heated toilet seat and views from the shower or the bath of the city was amazing The bed was so comfortable as well

147895,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, They did not receive the message sent via Booking com app about us celebrating our 10th anniversary Would be great if they had a spa or a room based massage service , Staff very friendly helpful Beautiful views

147900,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Check in We arrived early to have a drink in the bar When we went to check in a huge amount of people were waiting to check in And we had to wait in line for around 15mins When charging this amount for a room don t really expect that Seeing in to the next room is also very strange but understand its the shape of the building and not a lot can be done , Location is amazing The view is incredible 
147901,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Nothing, Large spotlessly clean rooms with modern decor and furnishings Bathroom in deluxe room out of this world Incredible breathtaking views Reasonably priced room service 
147902,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, A member of concierge staff needs more training His attitude made me feel uncomfortable Also if you guys open presents for security check then please close them like they were and inform the guests that you ll be opening present before hand One of my present was a chocolate champagne bottle from thorntons which was melted so never got delivered that s a loss of 40 and all I was offered was a question whether I told concierge it needed to be in fridge or not Still these are minor things I m only stating to help improve your standards otherwise it was next to flawless , Friendly service comfortable stay Guest relations are in particular very helpful and offer a personalised service I stayed here for my wife s 40th birthday and she couldn t have been more happier Thank you so much team at shangria la hotel 
147903,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The hotel is amazing there were only a few downsides paid for a city view and got the wrong side of the main city Bathrrom tv wasnt working engineer later came to fix Blinds were intermittent but later worked itself out Overall if it wasnt for those things it felt like i was in a different country ,No Positive
147904,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Every time you unlock the room the TV switches on with some vaguely asian esque music playing forcing me to switch the TV off every time I d have preferred it if the TV just switched on when I wanted it switched on , From the moment you step out of the taxi you are being looked after Definitely a level of service that I have never experienced before Add to that the incredible views I was offered the chance to upgrade to a better room with a view over the City of London but my southward facing room was just as good with views of London Eye Elephant and Castle and Waterloo But strangely the thing that I liked best was the superb Japanese bottom washing toilets 
147905,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, had to wait to be served in the restaurant for at least 15min then to get the order it took an other 20min Pool small and the floor is slippery my son slipped and hurt his ankle , the hotel location and views is amazing 
147906,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, breakfast should be included, Location view and staff we were given a lovely surprise gifted a delicious cake with a thoughtful note I will defiantly return the city view was amazing 
147907,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Bizarrely there was a huge TV right across the main window in front of the bed obscuring the view I disconnected it and put it on the floor A TV could surely have been placed elsewhere , A genuine feeling of luxury and sense of space Stunning views 
147908,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, I didn t like that our room wasn t as high up in the sky as it could ve been My son didn t like his late night pasta but I loved my mushroom lasagna At breakfast their was no ice for drinks and our plates weren t cleared away quick enough to make us feel welcome to get another plate I really wanted to try some breads with salmon maybe some cheeses the fruits But all I had were the eggs And as usual my son wanted to leave He is not a breakfast person , The bed the bath and the staff in particular A porter who helped me with all my foibles whose name began with an M I have to give many many thanks Thank you so much The view was spectacular But then I ve seen London many times I expected our room to be higher so my son could say awesome instead of cool 
147909,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The only thing was the hair drier kept over heating but thats being really picky, The staff were really friendly and couldnt help us enough they even brought a birthday cake to our room for my fiancee 
147910,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The times allocated to children being able to swim in the very small pool My son is 11 and a fantastic swimmer we were so disappointed that he couldn t use the pool more even though the girl who checked us in said he could they were pretty flexible but this was not the case , Everything about our stay was brilliant the staff are amongst the friendliest in the world and the food is amazing a bit overpriced to be honest room too a bit overpriced Still overall 5 star is 5 star in this hotel theres nothing the staff would not do for you 
147911,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Price of Breakfast and Mini Bar, The views from the City facing room This building generally Comfort Decor and ambience of the room and what a fantastic bathroom Quite simply it was magic 
147912,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The pool could have been warmer and was a basic gym No spa facilities for such an amazing place, Absolutely stunning views excellent hotel room just very expensive and you don t get breakfast Although in the middle of London it s not a necessity Once in a lifetime must do 
147913,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The accommodation price did not include breakfast , The experience the staff were very helpful My wife received flowers from the hotel as it was our thirtieth wedding anniversary We also had a room upgrade

147917,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The noisy air con all through the night prevented me from sleeping, It was my wifes 65th birthday and they supplied a lovely complimentary chocolate cake All the staff we had contact with The Sky pool
147918,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, Some staff were not as polite as I would expect for a 5 hotel Each time we entered the hotel we were asked whether we were staying in the hotel this is owing to public access to the Gong Bar on the 52nd floor although understandable annoying when a resident System of sitting near the window in the Gong Bar it seemed a little confusing and guests don t have priority disappointing considering the price of the room , Check in service was excellent Room great views and very comfortable Pool was lovely again with great views nice to have cool fruity water and coffee on tap Definitely worth a stay for a special occassion 
147919,Shangri La Hotel at The Shard London, The choice of food so we didn t eat at the hotel Shame there was no steam room , It was our Wedding Anniversary and we had a little note in our room wishing us a Happy Anniversary with 2 cupcakes It was a nice touch
