90029,La Villa Royale, only one thing very poor internet conection, I ve been upgraded to luxury room with whirpool there s no number of the room but each room has own name my room was Yves Saint Laurent My room was in the fifth floor with view to Sacre coeur really beautiful So beautiful room like on old castle so romantic Very friendly staff good breakfast The best location metro station is in the front of the hotel 
90030,La Villa Royale, Not the area for anyone with walking difficulties , Good location for Montmartre Plenty of places to eat and drink at reasonable prices Hotel close to metro line Staff are really helpful and pleasant 
90031,La Villa Royale, The one downside was that the shower lacked a proper shower curtain This made it a challenge to comfortably shower without soaking the whole bathroom , The location was great and the rooms were very comfortable This was couple with very helpful attentive staff 
90032,La Villa Royale, The location is incredibly noisy I really struggled to sleep even with a pillow over my head between the general traffic sirens and party goers falling out of the local nightclubs pretty much from 2 to 5am each night Turning right out of the hotel is quite nice Turn left however and you run a rather terrifying gauntlet of sex clubs sex shops pimps and drug dealers that is not very comfortable , The hotel itself is lovely clean comfortable and with wonderful character Inside the hotel it is also very quiet 
90033,La Villa Royale, Some of the staff was nice others on the other hand were not so eager to help Breakfast was ok but lack of variation from one day to the other and components A bit too expensive for where it is located and what they offer , the rooms were nice clean spacious The beds were confortable 
90034,La Villa Royale, Far too noisy could hear the couple next door early hours and nightclub opposite Bottle bank outside seems to be used 24 hours per day , Design of bedroom and reception
90035,La Villa Royale,No Negative, We loved our stay here and felt that it was in a great location with lots of restaurant and bars nearby It was also extremely close to the metro which was fantastic 
90036,La Villa Royale, Room was a tad small wanted to upgrade so viewed a superior room of which the bath tub had red stains in the bath looked like blood Not worth an extra 40 per night , The staff were excellent really helpful and kind to us
90037,La Villa Royale, Unfortunately even in the winter this area of town has a lot of nightlife which we could hear But we were so tired from touristing all day that we slept anyways , Breakfast was good We loved being right next to the Metro 
90038,La Villa Royale, The wardrobe was very small and access to it was a little difficult and the full length mirror was directed to the inside , The hotel is in an excellent position for walking to the Moulin Rouge and close to the metro and bus The breakfast was of very good quality and much better value than going to a caf A good start to the day We were on the second floor on a corner and the view at night was exciting 
90039,La Villa Royale, I don t have any complaints , The room was very much to my taste Super sexy but romantic at the same time The neighbourhood is not as bad as they say It s the world famous red light district of Paris but I had no problem and I never felt unsafe even though I walked around at night for a long time And it s really close to Montmartre But most importantly it s a very romantic and sexy place to go as a couple But it s not sleezy at all Staff and the style of the hotel is cool clean and mature There s just a lot of red and it easily gets you in the mood 
90040,La Villa Royale, Was excellent , Exquisite yet bohemian design to rooms Spacious spa tub Perfect location for night and day life that is not centered on traditional spots Just a short walk to Montmarte and the Siene Lovely staff providing 24 hour service Great 24 hour bakery across the circle from the hotel Very efficient checkin checkout 
90041,La Villa Royale, The curtains could have done with being darker very bright in the morning but that s it , We had the blue room complete with stars Very kitsch and fun the staff are lovely there and we love the Monmatre area Free wifi too Yes there are sex shops nearby but we have always felt safe and its so convenient for the sights too 
90042,La Villa Royale, Don t know what this type of hotel is doing on Booking com , The staff is very helpful Location is good Fairly clean but too bad for the ugly stained bathtub 
90043,La Villa Royale, Immediate area is full of sex shops and some dubious characters in the street This is red light district of Paris , Location next to 2 lines of metro station Pigalle Rich deep colours in the room Comfortable Helpful staff 
90044,La Villa Royale, Staff rather formal Blinds did not block street lights from the room Polyester duvet made you clammy during the night , Large bath very Parisenne quirky decor convenient location good value Interesting lift decoration 
90045,La Villa Royale, It has been over 2 weeks since I ve stayed at this hotel and I have still not got my deposit back despite contacting the staff about it Staff were unhelpful , Close to moulin rouge sistene chapel and hop on hop off bus
90046,La Villa Royale, This hotel has seen better days The location is red light district borderline and not a place we would normally choose , We had to be in that area to meet friends for a day and this hotel just passed our norms Parking a few blocks away at a reasonable price but you need to leave your car key behind 
90047,La Villa Royale, I did not quite realise the location was in the red light area but when a day later after I booked in March I tried to change I was refused my fault for not realising booking Com regs but 3 months in advance after only 1 day booked I felt unfair Parking was 93 for 2 nights so beware The rooms were set as a madames boudoir and a little on the shabby side Fortunately my 3 sons aged 21 14 saw the funny side Beds comfortable enough and rooms cool Staff English speaking and friendly , The quirkiness of the place
90048,La Villa Royale, Having to pay 50 deposit as well as full balance on arrival I had not anticipated or budgeted for the 50 and when I checked out I was told it could take up to 10 days to be be refunded to my account , The boutique decor was beautiful and I was overwhelmed so much better than I expected 
90049,La Villa Royale, The furniture was old and outdated Wall papers curtains carpets were too goddy Air conditioning was bad and wifi did not work inside room Hotel needs complete refurbishing and uplift , Location of the hotel and its room size were okay 
90050,La Villa Royale,No Negative, Beautiful tiny romantic room overlooking Pigalle The bathroom and bedroom had huge windows that opened out onto the square The building itself is beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful The area is extremely diverse and full of life at all hours Despite being on such a busy street and being a light sleeper I slept extremely well all six nights I highly recommend this place It was exactly like what I imagined a quaint hotel room in Paris should look like 
90051,La Villa Royale,No Negative, Beatiuful warm and relaxing ambience in this hotel Amazing staircase which I preffered to use over lift every day Unique decor in every room Mini bar Great room service With delicious food Interesting area Great spot for reaching every touristy location and to take in local everydays life Monmarte ideal for artisty kind with most amazing cathedral and buzzing atmosphere just few min walk away Be openminded because you are staying in Pigalle place for lots of sex shops and place where lots of sex selling business take place you will hear it through your window in the nights or mornings If all that buzz would not bother you this place is the perfect stay Loved it would stay again 
90052,La Villa Royale,No Negative, This hotel was like stepping back in time to the era of Toulouse Lautrec Fantastic d cor wonderful position at the heart of the Pigalle area a view of Sacre Coeur from our window spotlessly clean and helpful friendly efficient staff PERFECT 
90053,La Villa Royale, Due to the nature of the area there were one or two less savoury characters floating about It s also quite noisey at night we were woken up by voices on the street In the rooms the lamp shades were flimsy paper mache the edge of the desk was peeling breaking off and there were splatters on the material wall paper Probably nothing sinister I think it s quite difficult to clean material walls and is probably remembrance of a good night out I d say it s more of a 3 5 star hotel than 4 star to be honest The wifi could only connect if we sat on the corner of the bath Definitely wasn t available throughout the room , This hotel is super quirky and definitely plunges visitors into the sexier side of Paris Located in the red light district type place Pigalle it was quite fun to enjoy frivolous France The rooms are typically French with crazy pink walls and carpets we enjoyed the quirkiness of it It s literally 50 meters away from the Pigalle Metro which is fantastic as 2 lines meet there making travelling around the capital very easy The staff were also really amazing super helpful and they even upgraded us so that we had a jacuzzi bath for our honeymoon There is a fridge so you can store water or cooldrinks in your room if you need to they didn t have a problem with us bringing in snacks The airport shuttle was easy to organise and a fantastic service 
90054,La Villa Royale, Approaching the hotel from Pigalle Metro Station you see a large sign saying Villa Royale atop a building and a few doors at the bottom of that building directly below the sign As i went into those doors i am told that this is not the hotel just a cafe The actual entrance to the hotel is around the corner Opening the door to the hotel which is a VERY heavy door there is no immediate sign of reception just some chairs and paintings I had no idea where to go until a worker walked past and took me to the reception a tiny thing not bigger than a schooldesk I checked in fine but i was rather surprised that every single time i leave the hotel i have to give the key back to the reception staff and they will give it back to me upon my return After coming back from a days activities i go to reception to get my key back from a person i had not met before and all i had to do was say the room number and he gave me the key to the room This begs the question of could anyone saunter into that hotel and ask for any room key and they d get it There were literally no checks and this made me a tiny bit worried about my belongings when i was out and about No complaints about the room but if you want to be extra picky it was a small gap between the bed and the wardrobe so for people who are slightly larger it may prove a problem Also one of the wardrobe doors opens less than halfway because of the bed , A rather decent hotel with each room dedicated to a certain type of Artist Desginer most of them French The more expensive rooms get you the more upmarket designers Louis Vuitton Coco Chanel etc The room i stayed in overlooked Pigalle Square and it was quite a nice atmosphere and view from my balcony Pigalle metro station is less than 30 metres from the hotel entrance which is a big plus With pretty good views of Sacre Coeur rooms facing the front of the hotel and a 10 minute walk from Moulin Rouge its not the worst place to be in The rooms are rather nice with decorated carpets plush wallpaper and an ornate bathroom The beds were comfy a touch on the firmer side but still nice A generous amount of storage space for one room with a good 12 hangars in the wardrobe Just round the corner from the hotel is a long road full of sex shops and strip clubs Didn t really bother me that they were there but its worth pointing out that there are a LOT 
90055,La Villa Royale, The location was both good and bad right next to Pigalle sex shops and a large nightclub Also lots of traffic 1 night I slept great but the next I had to put in earplugs The windows do block out a lot of noise but you will still notice the area is very lively and noisy especially if you are not used to it at home a few little detals that would maybe improve the total impression of the hotel like a few missing buttons in the elevator velvet wall that could be replaced deposit upon arrival of 50eur Maybe it s just in case there are damages to the room Not sure Either way I don t understand why we have to pay a deposit upon arrival since the room has already been paid for by credit card non refundable on booking com, comfortable bed I would describe the decor as warm and unique plush Not cold looking like modern business hotels Charming we had a corner room with windows facing 2 directions and there was a lot of light in the room during the day which is great but also big thick curtains to block out light when you are sleeping bathroom very charming with a big window and lots of natural light including hairdryer and toiletries big towels friendly and hospitable staff who stored our luggage after we checked out great boulangerie next to the McDonalds across the street highly recommended location was both good and bad Great for transport 2 metro lines bus stops taxis right in front of hotel however if you are physically able I would really recommend walking to the center you will be pleasantly suprised at all the interesting and beautiful landmarks buildings city parks shops and cafes along the way Lots of restaurants and cafes in the area Cross the main street to Montmartre district However check the other section for minus points 
90056,La Villa Royale, Unfortunately the jacuzzi did not work during our stay but this was not a big concern for us , Great location friendly and helpful staff As it was a special holiday for us the staff upgraded our room for free 
90057,La Villa Royale, Wifi wasn t good but managed to log into another hotel s and lift was slow but we weren t in a rush Bathroom could do with a bit of updating but it was fine , Full of character Very funky Colourful Close to Montmartre which is a fantastic area We also got upgraded to a larger room which was very kind 
90058,La Villa Royale, WiFi was unstable in our room chopin Luckily we had WiFi from a hotel nearby We informed them that one basin was not working right they never fix it , The decoration of the room Metro station is too close
90059,La Villa Royale, Breakfast was good but if you come near closing time there isn t much left , Wonderful hotel near Place Pigalle The staff was so sevice minded and helpful Our room was big and spatious with a big and comfy bed I would definetely recommend it for adults since the location is not suitable for children 
90060,La Villa Royale, Its not that I didn t like But if some people can t afford a little noise during the night is not the perfect place for them But in our case it was not a problem , The location is really good near to the metro and coffee shops or markets The style of room is special and the the air conditioning is 24 24 No problems with wifi Very clean every day they clean the room The staff is so friendly Happy for the stay 
90061,La Villa Royale, The only problem we had was with the toilet door Unfortunately it was just a glass sliding door that didn t fully close and was fogged but you could see faint shadows from both sides , The rooms were decorated lovely and the staff were always very helpful polite and attentive Hotel was Infront of a metro station and we found it very easy to travel around Paris We stayed in the basic double room a little small but perfect for the two of us 
90062,La Villa Royale, For those travelling with children or prefer not to walk Villa Royale might not be the best choice The hotel itself is refined but surrounded by the usual Pigalle sex shops and nightclubs Further the walk to the hotel is slightly uphill so may be challenging for those with mobility problems Otherwise absolutely outstanding , Excellent location out of the busiest tourist tracks of the city Each room has fantastic personality I was lucky to stay in the Louis Vuitton room on the top floor which afforded unbeatable views of the Sacre Couer Service all exceedingly friendly Breakfast is provided but Montmartre has so many colourful little cafes that I much preferred to eat at a new place every morning Spa bath was a lovely touch 
90063,La Villa Royale, Was gonna have breakfast but changed our mind when we saw the offering, Great little place Super staff Funky decor Loved it Room a little small But ok for a short stay 
90064,La Villa Royale, I missed a chair to the desk The available bench was too large to move The TV guide had wrong no for some channels some lights were gone in the weekend terrible dump music the whole night from the neighboring music place but that was not the hotels fault and I had one of the closest room to the source and partly open window other rooms may not be affected , Nice bathroom very good bed breakfast to reduced price was fine Normal price too high Stayed there for 6 nights for a very good price The lift was large and fine I had no problems with the neighboorhood Place Pigalle is Place Pigalle 50 m to Metro can t be closer 
90065,La Villa Royale, NOTHING, Location Very near to Pigalle Metro station Red colour themed room is SIMPLY SUPERB AND AMAZING Bathroom is Clean Very Good pressure in taps Jaccuzzi was good Colourful Furnitures Furnishings Friendly Staffs VERY GOOD VIEW FROM THE ROOM OVERALL IT IS A GREAT HOTEL
