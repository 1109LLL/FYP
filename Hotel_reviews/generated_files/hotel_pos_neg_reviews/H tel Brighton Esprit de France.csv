106685,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The only problem we had was poor wifi reception , The hotel is lovely and the rooms very well appointed and comfortable The location is superb But most of all the staff is excellent helpful friendly accommodating and knowledgeable They make this excellent hotel even better 
106686,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The only thing I can think of to improve is somewhere to plug in the kettle The cord was very short and there were only a couple of power points the only spot we could find was on the floor Not a big issue but could be improved , We stayed for 4 days and interacted with 5 or 6 staff members They were all friendly helpful and good at their jobs The location of this hotel was fantastic It was so nice to be able to cross the road to the gardens go just around the corner to find lovely places to eat and also only a 40 minute very pleasant walk from the Eiffel Tower along the river 
106687,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, Shower didn t have enough pressure we had to use hand held wand , Was clean had nice character super staff friendly bartender Comfy beds and great location 
106688,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The hotel is extremely dirty staff is incompetent and they don t care there was poop spots on the WC seat and around it on the wall when we checked in at 4 pm we informed the reception who didn t do anything and we discovered this at night Went back to complain and they handed over to me a sponge and cleaning product and advised me to do it myself No manager came in to check about the complaint or bothered calling, Location is good for a new tourist who didn t visit Paris before
106689,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, 5th floor rooms are tiny rooms up in the eaves and they do not have a view of the Eiffel Tower from within the room even those advertised as Eiffel Tower view rooms If you want a view of the tower from your room request 4th floor or lower 3rd and 4th floors probably best views , This hotel has a fantastic location and generally excellent views of the gardens Louvre Eiffel Tower and other landmarks

106696,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The private car driver recommended by the hotel was not honest We paid him from the airport to the hotel and later he told his manager he only received 20 Paris taxi is very good we found out later and we should have had used taxi instead , It is close to Louvre and Odyssey Staff were very nice and Breakfast was really good with fresh juice and bread 
106697,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, House keeping came late in the day getting my room cleaned , The location was great It is directly across the street from Tuileries Garden and the Louvre There were some staff that were wonderful 
106698,H tel Brighton Esprit de France,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly and we were made to feel very welcome The bed was very comfortable but the hotel could do to install double glazed windows as we had the noise from the traffic throughout the day and night 
106699,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The only challenge was the WIFI which was unstable Otherwise nothing to detract , Location was perfect could not be faulted Older style four style hotel with great charm that was improved by our being upgraded for our three night stay to an executive room Space light access to the Metro and fashionable old world furniture Complimentary water was nice touch and housekeeping excellent 
106700,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, nothing, The hotel was much more than we expected We overlooked the Tuileries to our left the Eiffel Tower and to our right the Louvre so wonderful The breakfast was excellent however the room was uncomfortably quiet ad some background music would be nice our only complaint is that we have no complaint Tony and Breda Clear Ireland
106701,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, Wi Fi did not work temporarily during my stay Used computer at lobby as a result No instructions for using in room Nespresso machine Asked gentleman checking capsules to show me My bank balance after shopping and having to leave the property , Very pleasantly surprised to receive a phone call in advance of my stay to confirm my estimated time of arrival This gave me a great impression of the property before checking in Friendly reminder at check in to hide my cross body bag on the Paris Metro Being personally acknowledged by the hotel manager about an issue which was quickly resolved Large bathroom with bath and toilet separated depends on the room Fluffy towels bathrobes and very comfortable bed Clean Complimentary toiletries are SOTHYS PARIS A quality French brand Prime location for art and high end shopping Nice lobby Welcome tray includes Mariage Fr res tea bags Another quality French brand Complimentary bottles of water

106703,H tel Brighton Esprit de France,No Negative, Staff was very helpful with great recommendations for restaurants And especially helpful with airport arrangements Be aware It takes 45 minutes or more to get to the airport and you will need at least 3 hours at CDG to get through security The staff guided us through the timing to be sure we wouldn t run into trouble The hotel is perfectly situated for walking to major sites and areas of Paris The room was extremely comfortable Can t wait to go back 
106704,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, I cannot think of any negative point , I and my husband stayed in this hotel for one night The receptionist who welcomed us upon our arrival was the most elegant gentle and professional hotel receptionist we ve ever met His posture was very warm and welcoming the check in was so smooth and once he knew that we are Japanese he started talking to us in Japanese His Japanese was very fluent and almost perfect and we were absolutely impressed On the next day after check out we realised that my husband has left his sunglasses so I went back to the hotel to pick it up I was attended by the same receptionist and to my surprise he remembered our room number even after checkout And I received my husband s sunglasses within one minute During our stay he was extremely patient with my very bad French and he even praised me my French is absolutely broken We were constantly impressed by his extraordinary services It was our last night in Paris and was definitely the best one Hats off for the five star customer services 
106705,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, My room was facing the Rue de Rivoli so not ideal for light sleepers I didn t mind it cause I like a view from the window , My room was delightful Smelling fresh and clean with coffee tea facilities Bathroom offered beautiful Sothys products Front desk was very welcoming and friendly Location is perfect it s in walking distance of most of Paris s iconic monuments Lafeyette galleria shopping cafes and restaurants all close by 
106706,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, assistance to tourists is not upto the mark I faced difficulty in finding the best options of visiting tourist places No connections with tour operators , Need some kind of Attraction with in the building 
106707,H tel Brighton Esprit de France,No Negative, Good Morning I do not eat breakfast in hotels because I find it too much food and too expensive I go around the corner to a coffee bar I have gone to this hotel for 20 years and always loved it We used to stay in room 408 but that is now too expensive and I am alone and it is very large 
106708,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The shower in the bathroom has great water pressure but stepping out of it was a bit precarious You have to open the glass shower door and carefully lay down a bath mat before stepping out otherwise it is quite slippery You can t lay down the mat first because then you can t open the shower door to get in This is a very minor inconvenience relative to the many positive attributes of this hotel but it is just something to be mindful of The elevator is slow and only accommodates about 2 normal sized adults If you have trouble walking up the circular stairs you will need patience for the elevator Again this is minor but I did get my workout going up and down 3 flights of stairs circular , The staff was super friendly and helpful We were anxious about not knowing the language but the staff put us at ease instantly The furnishings and decor of our room were so classic French It was delightful The Nespresso machine in our room and the chocolates in the evening were wonderful We also loved the thick fluffy towels and the spaciousness of the room We were 4 adults parents with 2 adult daughters and the large king bed and the sleeper sofa were both very comfortable From this hotel it was an easy walk to the Louvre The Seine river and the Tuilleries garden both in front of our hotel were amazingly beautiful places to linger and people watch Behind the hotel we discovered lots of restaurants to explore Only a block from the hotel are several bakeries chocolate shops and souvenir shops yet our immediate location was quiet We really enjoyed the hotel its staff and its location 
106709,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, There is no reataurant but this is not a problem as so many eating houses within 150 metres Had problems with the free Wifi and continually had to login and often not successful , Very conveniently situated and central Close to tuileries and tour operator offices 50 metres to subway The male staff were obliging and helpful One of the lifts is the smallest I have ever been in Many cafes nearby to suit all types

106711,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, Elevator is tiny which we see often in old building in Paris This property is an old historical building , Staff were very friendly accommodating for us and others Location was wonderful Few minutes to walk to Louvre all good restaurants are in walkable distance beautiful park is just in front of us We were there during Easter weekend Enjoyed walk around the neighborhood most good stores and restaurants were open we had relaxing time in this property Our room was up grated to a corner suites had amazing view of Paris

106714,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The lift access is a bit restricting especially if you are on the top floor , The greeting from all staff was excellent and above a top end hotel that made us feel very welcome We were only in the hotel Brighton on a stop over on our way back by train from Rome to London We would definitely use this hotel again for its central location with stunning views to the Eiffel tower Great for a shopping expedition Bar staff and reception staff exceptional 
106715,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, HUGE ripoff Buyer beware Room was nothing like photos Photos showed two large windows open room floor plan Purchased upgraded room to exec suite yet actual size was small and all the space was in a lone unusable hallway Actual room was small maybe 150 sq ft It was cramped low headroom ducking to get through doorways the view was only visible if you climbed out of the single tiny window onto a 3 ft wide narrow ledge Staff sold museum 2 day ticket without warning even though they knew the Pompidou was closed on strike Hotel desk told us by phone that they could get us tickets to a classical concert we wanted to attend We rushed back to only be told it was sold out Staff did not want anyone in the lobby seating if you were not buying drinks I stay in Europe frequently on business and no one could ever consider this a 4 star hotel I have stayed at much nicer three star hotels ,No Positive
106716,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, In this hotel we were robbed They stole new things from the room The hotel did not recognize this the video refused to show the police refused to call We went to the police ourselves The criminal case of a theft in the hotel is instituted I do not recommend this hotel ,No Positive
106717,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, I was given a room to the Eiffel Tower and was very about it but during the night is terrible I can hear everything from the streets motorbikes ambulances and also the doors closing and opening at the corridor Terrible night My room 510 has a damaged wall in the shower not acceptable for this well rated hotel Not sure if I will come back too expensive for what you offer , Staff is brilliant Anne is so nice and breakfast is delicious Location is also great 
106718,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The first room the mini bar was off and the room just smelt awfully of mold the mini bar was not clean and the room still looked as if you could tell someone else had been in it The staff were rude due to that we eventually moved rooms just to miss the Eiffel tower lights come on why we were spending so much to stay so close They charge 13 euro just for two coffees i would definitely not recommend the Brighton to anyone , the location was convenient
106719,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The bathroom was well appointed but the tub was too narrow for a nice bath Also while I usually seek out a cafe for breakfast I indulged in breakfast in the breakfast room my first morning tasty but expensive 34 euros , I was upgraded from a classic room to a room with a view watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle every night from my balcony was wonderful The room was spacious and comfortable The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly

106758,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The air conditioner could have been a little cooler as we were there in late July and it was extremely hot The air goes off when the room is empty and the key removed We found that the taxi service the hotel arranged for us was more expensive than a local taxi flagged on the street , We chose Hotel Brighton because a friend recommended it and we found it online and liked what we read We especially enjoyed our lovely breakfasts at the hotel and found the staff very helpful The location is excellent and the restaurants nearby are also very good

106760,H tel Brighton Esprit de France, The attitude of the new manager who questioned why I was not happy with the pokey little room in the roof that we were first put in that didn t have hot water or any windows and we had to bend down to avoid hitting our heads , The manager who we have met before and has been there for over five years He looked after us and moved us into a more suitable room and was always pleasant and helpful Also the staff that came to check the room when I could not get hot water and helped us move our things into the new room
