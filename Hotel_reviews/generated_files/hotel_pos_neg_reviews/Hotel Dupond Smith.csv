89963,Hotel Dupond Smith,No Negative, the accommodations were incredible we arrived for one night and got upgraded to a lovely suite the shower tub outdoor patio the bed the sitting room everything was perfection the boutique upscale and cozy hotel had the nicest staff and was so lovely to stay in the heart of paris they served an amazing breakfast that was typical parisian and so quaint and european it had such great vibes and it exceeded my expectations

89965,Hotel Dupond Smith, More attention could be paid to the bathroom amenities by the housekeeper We had to ask for shower gel twice two guys showering twice a day requires a lot of shower gel But the hotel delivered immediately such a small thing , The staff especially our room had a Small Terrace on the 4th floor Only two rooms per floor Quiet Excellent breakfasts that are not included but heavenly croissants and breads An honesty bar in the afternoon This is a boutique hotel with 8 rooms in the middle of the Marais We stayed 6 nights and were well cared for Not inexpensive
