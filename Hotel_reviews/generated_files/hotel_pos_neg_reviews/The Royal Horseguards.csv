94382,The Royal Horseguards, The bar staff were useless The hotel bar shut at 11 15 pm on Monday 31st July It was meant to be open until 12 30 After complaining we were attendend to by a bar girl with crap attitude who quite obviously didn t want to be there My advice is please make her wish come true sack her Then complained to duty manager about bar girl He was useless as well Won t be going back to this hotel , Good Location
94383,The Royal Horseguards, The room had a wall 6 inches outside the window this was not made clear on booking When this was queried no action was taken by the staff Also a 12 5 service charge was added to the cost of breakfast this was not made clear before we paid when queried the staff said it was stated on the breakfast menu but we never received one Breakfast itself was limited in choice of hot food service was poor definitely not value for money , Room was clean Lobby was very impressive 
94384,The Royal Horseguards, The site has a parking symbol on this hotel but there is no parking on site the nearest is 5 mins walk away at 40 a day , A very nice hotel and a great location to stay when visiting London 
94385,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Fantastic staff with great standards The quality of service from all was of a superior standard and Mo the receptionist went out of his way to help Thank you for a fantastic stay 
94386,The Royal Horseguards, One window was dirty and dusty , Excellent location very comfortable bed Helpful stuff We liked the traditional very British and still modern design of the hotel 
94387,The Royal Horseguards, Service at reception they didn t seem to be expecting us we had to be asked to be directed to our room bar restaurant etc Concierge was having a very loud telephone conversation with a temporary member of staff who had gone home early Service in bar very slow and at points non existent TV remote didn t work in shower TV didn t work 2 people in room but only 1 packet of crisps and 1 chocolate bar in the mini bar although more importantly there were 2 of each beverage huge sink in the bathroom made bathroom a bit of an obstacle course very expensive room rate when you consider that no breakfast was included Turned out that booking com was not the best rate that had been available but by the time we found this out the hotel had sold out of the offer , brilliant location beautiful building super comfortable bed comfortable room with air conditioning drinks provided in mini bar
94388,The Royal Horseguards, wifi very unreliable in my room had to resort to hotel foyer Bit old fashioned for my taste, great location and views over the Thames and staff were really kind polite and very helpful
94389,The Royal Horseguards, The fact this time when I got a room I thought I d go for a city view rather then no view and it was tiny u could just about walk round the bed and I payed a lot more for it No point getting a city view if u want some room, The complimentary mini fridge
94390,The Royal Horseguards, Addition of CNN or MSNBC to the TV selections would have been enhancing of our visit , This beautifully appointed hotel is ideally located in a quiet area of downtown London with a park adjacent to it Perhaps the most outstanding aspect of the hotel is the superb staff very knowledgeable attentive and courteous individuals that were professional in behaviour and appearance Lovely dining on the terrace or inside with friendly staff and nice dishes A very well managed hotel with an outstanding team 
94391,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Very nice old fashion hotel large room on the 7th floor with river view Good breakfast outside with great service Close to many great interestung places
94392,The Royal Horseguards, Disapointing smell everywhere as an old poorly ventilated building not possible to open windows not possible to use balconies bad smelling air conditioning fire alarm at 4 am evacuating building , Great location and character 
94393,The Royal Horseguards, Beware the tub Upon exiting my tub after showering I discovered the material in the bottom of the tub to prevent falls had been worn down and was of no use As a result with the left foot part way out of the tub my right foot slipped on the slippery tub base resulting in my falling hard again the sides and bottom of the tub I was lucky to not have hit my head The tub was narrow and had very tall sides and because the tub was wet after the shower and no traction it took almost 30 minutes to find a way to get out of the tub I was alone in the room Very very scary I am not a young person and a month later I am still recovering from strains sprains bruises pain etc resulting from the fall They did offer to change me to a room with a regular shower Nice offer for another day but did not help for the fall already taken , Nice location The bed was comfortable the room was inviting the view of the London Eye was generally unobstructed The towels were huge and warmed The staff was very friendly When personnel realized that my friend and I would be returning from the theater too late to get dinner they let us place our dinner order before leaving for the theater and prepared it for us upon our return to the hotel even though the restaurant was closed for the evening 
94394,The Royal Horseguards, The only problem we had was eating breakfast at the restaurant Our breakfast was not included with the room We didn t want the buffet that was 24 person We wanted to order from the a la cart menu We were able to do so but felt forgotten in the corner and had to wait a long time for service Also had to track down the bill We didn t go back the rest of the week I m sure it would have been a better experience if we had the breakfast included option , The location is excellent We walked to most of the local sights We also used the Underground which is very close and The Big Bus We always felt very safe 
94395,The Royal Horseguards, It was ideal so no issues , Fabulous hotel staff were very friendly and easy to deal with room service was excellent Would highly recommend this Hotel 
94396,The Royal Horseguards, The room smelled really musky the first day but the odor went away after we aired the room The service was appalling especially for a hotel of this category Nobody helped us with the luggage the waiters did not understand English nor did they know the difference between a macchiato and a latte the concierge was often missing smoking a cigarette The food at the restaurant was just ok nothing impressive despite the publicity of the hotel taunting it as one of the best in London and the service was again painfully slow despite the fact that there were not that many customers Finally the breakfast buffet had a lot to be desired with regard to fruits they were either previously frozen or in preserve It was especially to be regretted that they substituted real berries when they are excellent in England from previously frozen ones The shower door did not close properly so the bathroom got flooded any time we took a shower We dried it with the towels Mercifully there is a great tower warmer that dried the towels relatively quickly The bathroom is a little crumpled and there is not much room around the sink for toilettries , The size of the room the mattress and the shower are outstanding It also has outlets for any kind of plug so you do not need to use any adaptors The decor is a bit pretentious but nice The electronics in the room are sophisticated and allow you to connect your own devise and choose different sets of speakers in the bed bathroom etc There is a tv in the shower for those interested in that kind of thing The shower is fantastic with a rain head and massage heads in the wall 
94397,The Royal Horseguards, Water leaking through the speaker in the shower Massive health and safety issue Staff rude They asked for a 50 security deposit on top of the full payment for the room total of 300 on arrival Then on check out they asked for full payment on the room again They said the first payment was the holding fee and would be released back to my account so they had 550 of my money for a 250 room So that was 300 I hadnt budgeted for and couldn t spend on my activities I planned around London that day and my trip had to be cut short To summarise there s no point shelling out for this Hotle as a treat you might as well get a travel lodge ,No Positive
94398,The Royal Horseguards, Shower Old fashioned everything No electric plugs by bed Breakfast poor Not that clean Certainly not five star Maybe 3 5 stars Bar and restaurant no ambience Boring, Location
94399,The Royal Horseguards, At 11pm the bar closed a bit too early , This hotel was a great value for the money It is modern well appointed clean and in an ideal location for seeing many of the city s main sites The room service is good quality The staff were generally helpful 
94400,The Royal Horseguards, Sadly the bar staff didn t seem to enjoy their work There is no parking at the hotel but it s a public one nearby , Great river view from room 
94401,The Royal Horseguards, Expensive for a room but worth it as treat , Stayed here before and loved it so know the Hotel We were going to Adele concert at Wembley stadium and wanted to be near the underground without being too close to Wembley Embankment station is really close by and enables you to visit anywhere in London Fantastic location with bars and shopping just a couple of hundred metres away plus the river Thames with floating bars and restaurants really close too Horseguards parade is a short stroll away and we went to watch the changing of the guard Our executive room with superb river views towards the London eye was very nice and the large bed was comfortable Their was a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and a box of chocolates the first night Tea and coffee making facilities in room and free mini bar in ours Very friendly doorman and staff Will certainly stay here again 
94402,The Royal Horseguards, Check out was slow due to issues with the printer , Loved the natural light in the bedroom and the fact that the trees in front of the window allow the curtains to be open without anyone seeing in Breakfast outdoors was wonderful The bed was very comfortable and the ability to have a shower or a bath was a lovely 
94403,The Royal Horseguards, This is an esthetically pleasing hotel on the surface however perhaps due to the age of the building it lacks the comfort factor found in more contemporary hotels Rooms have limited storage area and amenities such as coffee are stored away and awkward to access Bathrooms are small and a more substantial shower curtain would have been able to withstand the draft resulting in less water on the floor Upon arrival while waiting for our room to be readied we had a couple of drinks in the bar the cost was 28 pounds the hotel adds a service charge Service in general was adequate but hardly 5 star except for the doormen who were to a man courteous and very helpful This hotel represents itself as 5 star hotel and It would seem they rely on their excellent location and outward attractiveness to merit this rating A better value for the price will be sought next time , Location is excellent and general area of hotel is quiet with green space available for walking 
94404,The Royal Horseguards, The shower was very poor with maximum 40 working of the holes in the showerhead Breakfast was also poor I was buffet style the fried eggs were very overcooked and other elements were greasy and only warm Nowhere near 5 star standard , Lovely building in a great location with extremely friendly and helpful staff The rooms are a decent size the beds and linen extremely comfortable 
94405,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, I arrived early in the morning after flying in from San Francisco The reception desk arranged for me to have a resting room so I could sleep until check in was available A very nice touch 
94406,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and welcoming and went the extra mile to accommodate myself and 4 grown up grandchildren Rooms were clean and had everything we needed Breakfast too was very enjoyable though room off the dining room was very cold 
94407,The Royal Horseguards, A C worked great but blew directly across head of bed bed on wheels not attached to headboard so rolled bed away to avoid problem No 24 hr room service limited different menus at specific times, Location right on the Thames across from London Eye 2 blocks from Trafalgar square many restaurants bars Many attractions within 15 min walk Free non alcoholic minibar Large bathroom large shower lux towels
94408,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Food was good The set up was a little long winded in terms of 15 for one area 24 for the other Hot but tea and coffee included in certain prices but not if you ordered from from a la carte Couldn t they just come up with a one size fits all price 
94409,The Royal Horseguards, Cut myself on damaged desk but fixed immediately Lamp didn t work in corner of room Having to find the tea making facilities and lifting them out of the bottom draw was a Little tricky No plug socket near bed so couldn t charge phone while using it in bed Couldn t have coffee outside because they were finishing breakfast waitress suggested we walk round to the public garden ad come in that entrance then they would be ready for us One of 3 lifts not working so had to wait for lift and unable to get in some lifts in the morning , Comfy bed very clean Helpful booking Michael early check in arranged 
94410,The Royal Horseguards, Room excellent but very dark no natural daylight in room just a brick wall outside the room so opening the curtains made no difference in the mornings , Very limited cereal choice just cornflakes and one other Cooked breakfasts fine if you wanted one 
94411,The Royal Horseguards, We were very disappointed It took over 2 hours to get our luggage to our room and this was after asking 3 times where the luggage was The bathroom was fine but the separate shower was not working There was a shower over the bath but this was not practical as water escaped over the side of the bath It was not pointed out to us on check in that we had to request the turndown service which was why when we got back to the room little bugs had entered as the windows were left open On check out my wife and I waited with our luggage at the lifts My wife managed to squeeze into one of the lifts to get down to reception to pay the bill I was left waiting to get the lift with the luggage it took more than 20 minutes to have access to a lift We looked forward to staying at Horseguards and we were let down , My wife and I stayed at Horseguards a few years ago and really enjoyed the stay so when the opportunity came to stay there again we really looked forward to it We stayed in a lovely room with garden river views We stayed in a lovely room with garden river views 
94412,The Royal Horseguards, Some staff wasn t sure of how or where you could find various things e g ice for drinks was left waiting with no response for a very long time we were also charged twice for our stay due to system error, The room was wonderful and the hotel staff were mostly helpful concierge and bell boys were excellent as was the greating as we arrived and left
94413,The Royal Horseguards, rooms were supplied with cold drinks but no bottle opener for the beer the staff wasn t able to find one on request otherwise it was wonderful to have the cold water and wine in the frig ,No Positive
94414,The Royal Horseguards, We could not fault our stay at all , A lovely welcome Staff were really friendly Bed was super slept really well Room was small but fine for us and they gave us a room with a view which we hadn t paid for and as well we got a complimentary bottle of fizz as it was our 30th wedding anniversary weekend treat Fantastic and such a surprise Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back pure luxury 
94415,The Royal Horseguards, they did not tell me they were taking a extra 50 pounds per room they said it would go back only after i asked why they were taking it in all they took an extra 518 pounds and i only got it back on thursday when i rang up and asked what they were playing at , rooms and easy reach to the london eye 
94416,The Royal Horseguards, If there is one thing need to improve is the rainforest shower the shower is not powerful enough , Excellent location and good atmosphere of the hotel friendly staff 
94417,The Royal Horseguards, Deluxe Room with a window with view to the opposite dark wall When asked for a possible change welcome desk replied that they are overbooked which was a pure lie as rooms were available on booking com Suddenly a change to a single room with an acceptable view was possible but a tiny single room No adjustment on price Never again , Location
94418,The Royal Horseguards, Pricey full English breakfast for what we got Had to ask waitress for butter they didn t top up jams on table from previous guest , service at reception front staff excellent n helpful Comfy room quiet 
94419,The Royal Horseguards, Not enough coffee and milk in the room We requested extra but this wasn t provided As a result we had to leave our room and purchase a coffee in a nearby cafe Not good , Location Room well appointed if rather small Helpful friendly staff Elegant public areas
94420,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, We upgraded to the waterloo Suite Besides the additional room space which was very impressive there was a stunning view lots of storage room for clothes and suitcases Also there was plenty of power points 
94421,The Royal Horseguards, Bathroom is a bit shabby and needs upgrading Shower is tight Pillows not comfy It takes several tries for someone to pick up the phone when dialing housekeeping or concierge , Location is great Size of the room is good Snacks and beverages including water are complimentary in the minibar 
94422,The Royal Horseguards, Small TV with a very poor signal this didn t match the quality throughout the rest of the hotel , Superb hotel Excellent staff Made you feel like royalty 
94423,The Royal Horseguards, Despite it being a beautiful evening the terrace area was neglected and barely open bar was quiet restaurant lacked any atmosphere A tad disappointing considering its a 5 Star Hotel Just feels like the hotel is not fulfilling its full potential given the location , Location is superb 
94424,The Royal Horseguards, Breakfast was a rip off Orange juice from a carton in a 5 Star property All about money at breakfast from time we hit dining room Your breakfast not included was first comment then a complicated explanation of how the service worked plus all the extra charges An omelette 10 pounds extra Are they joking , Location
94425,The Royal Horseguards, We were initially a located an inside small room quite dark but when queried were immediately moved to an outside room which type we ve had on our previous visits Limited space for clothing , Location and comfort Staff were very customer focused 
94426,The Royal Horseguards, Bar staff more interested in chatting than customers Rooms rather tired and upgrade was for a view from a tiny window Price and star rating generates expectations of certain standards that weren t met , Superb location
94427,The Royal Horseguards, We were very happy with our room but be aware that as in many London hotels it was internal outlook meaning no view We knew this so no problem and it also had plenty of windows so was very light The only negative was that the carpet was stained in a number of places and could have benefitted from a good clean , Fantastic location in a beautiful old building overlooking the Whitehall gardens and the river with grand public spaces It is a really excellent hotel Wonderful breakfast spread All the staff from reception to bar to restaurant were very well trained giving perfect service Our room was huge with a very comfortable bed and quality pillows and linen Loved the character and ambiance of the hotel Would highly recommend it and we will return 
94428,The Royal Horseguards, Shower did not work I had to be transferred in another room Plus reception staff quite insufficient for a hotel of this size the concierge had to come and see that my shower did not work because there was nobody else available at 6am ,No Positive
94429,The Royal Horseguards, I have been a regular customer I have asked to upgrade on arrival expecting better room and kind of VIP treatment It wasn t to my expectation Bathroom wash basin was higher than normal Quality of accessories e g towel and slippers has gone down , Good location and easy accessible Clean facility
94430,The Royal Horseguards, We were surprised and disappointed to find that the room we had booked on the basis that it had an interior view in actual fact had no view at all The windows are opaque Room 832 That should not be acceptable at this price in a London city centre hotel The room we upgraded to was very pleasant but I have to say did NOT make up for the unsuitable first offering , We have enjoyed the Royal Horseguards for some time especially as a good meeting place as well as a place to stay It still is 
94431,The Royal Horseguards, I didn t like being told that my complimentary mini bar was going to be restocked daily and it never was restocked I had to call each time and then was told it is only done every other day and it still was never restocked I didn t like that they gave me body soap instead of shampoo on more than one occasion I wasn t a big fan of the restaurant I didn t like that room service selection was limited I didn t like that my room telephone didn t work so when I would call down to the front desk or try to order room service I couldn t I told them at the desk about it and it was never addressed Seemed I just had to call and call to get anything done or go down to the front desk to get answers Over all it was a nice central hotel for the money Corinthia Hotel is across the street and looked fabulous and had two wonderful places to eat I will be looking into this hotel for any future visits , The location was nice Walking distance to anything and everything I like being upgraded since I booked a double bed thinking it was going to be two beds my fault Staff was very friendly 
94432,The Royal Horseguards, Some of the bar staff had difficulty understanding English and one member of staff was a bit brusque That is our only complaint , Beautiful architecture comfortable rooms and for the most part polite and helpful staff 
94433,The Royal Horseguards, The Equus Bar the staff were rude unhelpful the food was awful and expensive In short the service was awful and we wont be hosting another event there , The room was lovely the comfort hotel staff and concierge staff were lovely and helpful 
94434,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, We stayed here for our wedding and Mo the Guest Services Manager went above and beyond to ensure we had an unforgettable stay Our room was upgraded and we had the most fabulous view to wake up which made our experience even more incredible 
94435,The Royal Horseguards, Only little niggle the bedding was too hot for a lady of my time of life Could have done with a sheet in the closet Air con does work very well , The breakfast was well worth paying the extra for Fantastic choice Had a garden room fantastic view of the Thames and the London eye Very quite hotel no road or other noise in a great part of London Staff wonderful 
94436,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Home away from home in this hidden gem in London Great Afternoon tea Staff incredibly friendly Really close to everything shopping theatres museums 
94437,The Royal Horseguards, The fitness room too small the room is not what we could expect, The room the high quality service at the registration desk the view of the room the location the cleanliness
94438,The Royal Horseguards, As it was a special occasion for my husbands 60th I was disappointed there wasn t a bottle of something nice or some fresh fruit as a celebration touch Also the fridge was very poorly stocked, Excellent breakfast in the room Comfy bed staff all pleasant and helpful Beautiful hotel
94439,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally charming The room delightful comfortable and quiet Room service was prompt and delicious Look forward to more of the same next week
94440,The Royal Horseguards, The bed was very small probably one of the smallest I ve ever slept in at a hotel A C in the room was very noisy , Good location friendly staff 
94441,The Royal Horseguards, Nothing really and would definitely stay there again , The room was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable I also liked that the shops are well within walking distance Check in and check out was very efficient and the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful I really liked the free soft drinks in the fridge and the Sky Sports on the TV I also liked the Elemis bathroom products 
94442,The Royal Horseguards, Air con rubbish Room small Hotel tired Carpet old and needs replaced Hair dryer didn t work and had to get another from reception Only a small double bed, Location
94443,The Royal Horseguards, TV Setting for volume were a little off and no CNN , Bed was really comfortable and view of the Thames was fantastic The bathroom was large and lots of counter space 
94444,The Royal Horseguards, room had not been properly dusted which may have effected someone s allergy, Excellent hotel with friendly and professional staff that were very helpful an ideal location to rest after a long day
94445,The Royal Horseguards, Tiles on floor in shower weren t grouted properly Wall tiles were though , Location was perfect Staff very courteous helpful Room was clean well presented 
94446,The Royal Horseguards, Our main problem with hotel was the contradictions Free mini bar great nice touch but The afternoon tea was very mediocre and very expensive and service certainly didn t match the cost After experiencing the stale scones and bland sandwiches we didn t bother eating the hotel again as you can so easily get great food for a much more reasonable price in central London You are given a map with vouchers discounting food in the hotel when you check in Our surly waitress took this away and cut the voucher out leaving a hole in the map where Regent s Park used to be luckily we weren t planning to go to the zoo This was all a bit naff for a hotel that is trading on its luxury status The rooms have old style Apple docks built into the desks Great for 10 years ago but for the price and the luxury status a simple Bluetooth speaker in the room would have allowed us to enjoy our own music radio easily Bottom line lots of impressive aspects but let down by staff random cheapness and lack of attention to detail so a high 8 rather than a 9 , Our room had a totally fantastic view of the Thames and the London eye The room was big by London standards and very clean The location of the hotel was ideal for a break in central London 
94447,The Royal Horseguards, Personally the late bites evening room service menu could do with a slight expansion , From first entering the hotel till the last time we vacated we had nothing but great service from all staff On arrival I asked my partner to go take a seat and relax This was a surprise weekend for her I explained to the lovely ladies behind reception that we are away to celebrate our Anniversary and my fianc e Birthday She offered to upgrade us to the tower suite I would highly recommend staying in the Tower Suite its luxury with beautiful views You have almost 360 degree view of londons skyline We decided we would like to take in the view a little longer so ordered breakfast to the room so we could look over the wonders of the city In our room we felt 1 million miles away from city life We couldn t thank the staff enough they where all fantastic and very welcoming We will be returning 
94448,The Royal Horseguards, Disappointed with the room was expecting much better from a 5 establishment The room size was extremely small and the decor was quite dated The bathroom was also looking quite tired I wouldn t expect a luxury hotel to have a plastic shower curtain We were kept awake until the early hours by a wedding that was being hosted in the hotel although we were provided with a complimentary breakfast to apologise I felt that this was very disappointing considering the price of the room There was basic free provisions water and coke in the mini bar but nothing else was provided The bathroom toiletries were Elemis but limited compared to other establishments , Excellent location and lovely reception area the staff were friendly and helpful The free wifi and breakfast were good 
94449,The Royal Horseguards, You can only provide a 5 star experience when every aspect of the service offered is 5 star In my opinion the management of the Royal Horseguards Hotel falls short in the one thing they should excel in ensure their staff has the eye for detail or their guests for that matter needed to offer a 5 star experience There were some happy exceptions like the man who served us afternoon tea but generally staff seemed too busy with things that didn t matter to their guests Rather disappointing , Great location Beautiful historic building 
94450,The Royal Horseguards, Afternoon tea wasn t wonderful considering the hotels reputation Happy to pay more for better Need to up the afternoon tea game I think , It was all very good
94451,The Royal Horseguards, Not one bad thing to say , Gorgeous hotel in a fantastic central location with the most amazing views of London Couldn t fault it a wonderful treat to celebrate my husband s 50th Birthday
94452,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Staff were very friendly helpful Olga was a star We didn t like our first room inward facing near air conditioning duct outside noisy Very efficient in moving us Definitely would use again 
94453,The Royal Horseguards, Not sure why they would add 12 5 service charge when you are sat at a bar ordering drinks , Hospitality food and staff were superb Could not fault anything 
94454,The Royal Horseguards, The bar lady on Friday night was extremely rude and made the worse Bloody Mary At first we didn t think she was going to serve us The lady on Sunday afternoon however was the opposite and couldn t do enough for us , Beds super comfy breakfast a bit pricey as we re very small eaters 
94455,The Royal Horseguards, The restaurant needs to upgrade , Very nice hotel with excellent location Beautiful room with stunning view over the river and London Eye Friendly staff 
94456,The Royal Horseguards, Nothing at all , The location on the river and close to Embankment Station made it a perfect base for the weekend The hotel was all that we hoped for on this special occassion and the staff were all wonderful Little things like a heated bathroom floor free mini bar and early and late checkout flexibility just topped it off Would definitely stay here again 
94457,The Royal Horseguards, Really can t fault the hotel , The room was fantastic with a great view of the London Eye and the Thames It was fresh clean full of charm and character The bathroom was wonderful with rain shower an in shower TV and an very nice illuminated shower screen Brilliant 
94458,The Royal Horseguards, Breakfast bacon leathery both days sausages excellent though Mortadella salad listed but no longer available No Rioja in stock , Staffattitude Service room dinner general cleanliness all excellent Location ideal for theatres and touristy things Great ambience inside the hotel it s not apparent one is in the middle of London 
94459,The Royal Horseguards, The first room has a very small bed und no real window was ok but , We upgraded to a very perfect room with river view Great room Perfect location very close to the subway very calm 
94460,The Royal Horseguards, Bar service in Equus was a little underwhelming and it s quite a small area , Loved the location and the d cor Our room was very comfortable spacious and clean 
94461,The Royal Horseguards, Unfortunately our City View was of the walls of the Old War Office so we didn t really see any more of the city Room was good but for the price of over 250 for one night probably not worth that , Deluxe room with City View room was huge bathroom was great staff were very friendly and you get the feel of a posh 5 London hotel Location was excellent too 
94462,The Royal Horseguards, VERY TIRED BEDROOMS OLD AND COLD AND NOISY NO DOUBLE GLAZING ALTHOUGH GREAT VIEW OF THE RIVER AND SITES IT WAS NOISY, STAFF VERY ATTENTIVE GOOD LOCATION FOR SITES
94463,The Royal Horseguards, Gym wasn t 24 hours and was very small for a 5 star hotel , Booked a standard room mid week and was upgraded to the apartment suite which was great and made the stay a good value one Without that the mid week rate was a little on the high side but a nice hotel 
94464,The Royal Horseguards, Room was very small and the damp and crack in the ceiling should be fixed Also needs a full length mirror As this was a valentines treat asked for rose petals on bed but this was not done The Manager did give a discount for this mistake , The view of river and london
94465,The Royal Horseguards, Banging my head in the middle if the night Clumsiness happens everywhere, Free mini bar and TV in the bath Amazing customer service genuinely helpful all staff couldn t do enough to help us Despite being a young couple we were treated with as much respect as every other guest 
94466,The Royal Horseguards, The bar was very expensive we d been out for an evening meal at The Shard which was very reasonably priced so it was a little surprising to be charged 80 for 4 drinks , Room upgrade on arrival friendly informative staff that couldn t do enough for us The room and view was outstanding All in all it was a fantastic stay we didn t want to leave and we ll certainly be using this hotel as our base for future London visits 
94467,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, From check in to check out our experience was fantastic over mine and my partners 2 night stay The staff were wonderful and very helpful the room was wonderful and clean and very well presented Would most certainly recommend and will be returning 
94468,The Royal Horseguards, The plug was broken in the bath Air con is VERY noisy , Very friendly welcoming staff Beautiful rooms views if at the front of hotel Fantastic central location walking distance to everywhere 
94469,The Royal Horseguards, Expensive breakfast No bath, Ideal for sightseeing and theatres Free water and soft drinks Nice ambience with a real fire in the lobby and candles all around
94470,The Royal Horseguards, Room bin not emptied on day 2 Mould in shower which should be cleaned in a hotel of this calibre Small points but worthy of note , Fantastic location friendly and helpful staff
94471,The Royal Horseguards, I have one negative thing to say the room was very hot and the pillows on the bed was slightly hard I swapped them with my husband when he had gone to the bathroom and his was slightly better He didn t know by the way , Very helpful staff couldn t do enough for you The breakfast was excellent 
94472,The Royal Horseguards, Leaving , Excellent hotel Excellent location Excellent service Excellent all round How could you not enjoy that view from the bedroom window across the Thames to the London Eye 
94473,The Royal Horseguards, Paid the extra for a better room and city view Room was very small So was the bathroom The view wasn t worth the extra either Breakfast was a nightmare Lack of space to seat people Actually gave up in the end To be honest wouldn t go back here again It isn t that great when you compare to other upmarket hotels in London Do yourself a favour and try somewhere else, In a fantastic location Very traditional 
94474,The Royal Horseguards, The bathroom definitely needed to have a makeover the tiles in the shower were actually coming off as you showered the tap on the basin was also very loose Breakfast was way too expensive for what you got I ve had better breakfasts elsewhere that were a lot cheaper you also had to eat quick on account of the food being cold You do get complimentary mini bar but what you actually get is free water and a bag of crisps Hardly worth saying complimentary minibar you should say free bottles of water it would be more accurate I wouldn t say the hotel was any more than a 3 4 hotel , The staff were lovely the bed was comfortable the views were fantastic and location was spot on 
94475,The Royal Horseguards, The Bar Prices 25 for two drinks , Superb location very nice room with lovely view of the Thames Beautiful hotel efficient and friendly staff Would definitely stay again 
94476,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Everything from arrival to leaving was perfect The man that opened the front door for us was always so polite and nice checking in was effortless and all staff were brilliant and lovely The room was amazing and I will definitely stay again 
94477,The Royal Horseguards, Can t really moan about the price because it s a wonderful hotel in best central London position but if it was cheaper we would go more often , The location on the Thames opposite the London Eye was superb Super quality hotel 
94478,The Royal Horseguards, Nothing at all , Location lovely staff even gave us an umbrella because it was raining when we was about to go out for the evening fantastic historical buildings Brilliant 
94479,The Royal Horseguards, appalling service from the moment we arrived room keys not working room not made up room service staff not able to understand English hundreds of people in lobby waiting roms hotel in chaos, location
94480,The Royal Horseguards, Room service was poor difficult to connect with the phone just rang rang, The room was lovely but there was no kettle in the room when I ordered room service it didn t come There was only one set of towels in the room even though I booked as a couple The location was great though
94481,The Royal Horseguards, Sheet should be changed every day we had an apartment had to request clean towels , Bed very comfy amazing breakfast great Christmas diner staff was more than perfect 
94482,The Royal Horseguards, A little mix up on the delivery of a package I had sent for my partner resolved on checkout though so better late than never and they were very apologetic , Its just such a lovely place to stay for a romantic getaway and beautifully decorated for the Christmas season A room over looking the Thames is a must 
94483,The Royal Horseguards, Could not have a room until 3pm but the staff helpfully gave us a single room on arrival and moved the baggage , The service overall was very good There was no plug in the bath and this was sorted very quickly at 1am The river view from the eighth floor is wonderful 
94484,The Royal Horseguards, Loved the room views but due to being on 9th top floor the views can only be seen when standing up in room as windows are high up , Free room upgrade from a double to an executive suite with incredible views of the Thames London Eye city Complementary mini bar as reason for stay was a special birthday celebration a bottle of chilled prosecco was provided all very well received a lovely surprise 
94485,The Royal Horseguards, We arrived back at the Hotel late after a concert and were hungry Upon ordering some sandwiches from room service I have to say that what arrived for the cost of 8 per sandwich 5 tray charge was hugely disappointing It is not stretching it to say a rip off You expect to pay high prices for a central London Hotel of this type but you expect quality in return , We had booked an Executive City view room and on arrival were upgraded to a suite which was a superb apartment on the top floor 
94486,The Royal Horseguards, We stayed in room 703 and the bed wasn t as comfortable as a premier inn bed and the temperature of the room was very warm during the night We needed to asked for the sink to be declogged as the water didn t automatically drain away , The location and staff are excellent and bar facilities great The coffee and biscuits in the room appreciated 
94487,The Royal Horseguards, Coming back to a very well loved and tidied up room is very important to us but unfortunately this didn t seem to be this hotel s forte , The location is very convenient The staff were very helpful and friendly all of them added a little touch of magic to our stay 
94488,The Royal Horseguards, We didn t get our room serviced but in fairness as soon as we asked it was done immediately also we always stay in the Royal Horseguards when we visit London however this time some things were looking at little in need of some tlc, Amazing staff the two doormen are wonderful friendly and very helpful also the new free mini bar with water soft drinks crisps flapjack and beer was a lovely touch and was partly replenished during our stay Also amazing views of the river and Southbank
94489,The Royal Horseguards, It s high end so be prepared for formalities and looking nice I wore my best clothes so I wouldn t stand out but I m American so I d much rather be in yoga pants and nikes It was pricey but I d stay there again , This place was amazing My husband and I came in after a red eye flight and our room wasn t ready so they gave us a changing room to nap in When we got to our room it was so grand The bathroom was like a spa Everything was clean We ordered in breakfast every day and everything was great The location is great everything is in walking distance Staff was kind and friendly 
94490,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, This hotel treated us just in a Royal way We came to London to celebrate my wife s birthday we booked a double room at The Royal Horseguards through the booking com and we were so excited by their attitude to our special occasion First of all they have have precisely fulfilled all special requests a bottle of champagne flowers in the room the bouquet was beautiful all on a very short notice But the main surprise was that they gave us a free upgrade to their Tower Suite Staying in this two floor 270degrees panorama suite is worth of a separate visit to London itself This hotel is a real historical and cultural landmark the building is just magnificent It s location architecture interior and genuine British spirit makes staying in this hotel a unique experience We would like to send our special thanks to James who enabled all this perfect experience and who was very professional super friendly and attentive We enjoyed every second of staying there and we highly recommend it to all travellers 
94491,The Royal Horseguards, Sound on TV was very muffled Phoned room service and asked for a plain cheese sandwich was told they would find out and come back to me but never did I had to phone up again and request it but eventually got just what I wanted The bed a bit hard for me but my husband loved it Room a bit cold for me and I did not seem to be able to change it but my husband thought it was fine , Breakfast very nice indeed
94492,The Royal Horseguards, Slight issue with Room service we should have been advised that the curry dishes chosen at 11pm would take about an hour to arrive perhaps we should have realised as well were given the same on a complementary basis but perhaps that should be stated on the Menu Prices are getting higher which may put us off perhaps in the future is there a scheme for loyalty , Location is fabulous staff excellent breakfast very good I ve been several times and cannot think of a better place to stay Quiet on the weekends and shows London off at its imperial best Bottomless teapot in the foyer I think that I had 5 full cups 
94493,The Royal Horseguards, Check in was poor no information about the hotel offered no morning paper offered etc There was a bulb out in the bathroom that we reported but was not replaced We were promised a bottle of wine as compensation that never arrived Overall not the standard of service you would expect for what was charged ,No Positive
94494,The Royal Horseguards, Our internal facing room our room even though the decor and setup was excellent the only windows faced onto a brick wall Especially with the booking being for our honeymoon our expectations was a little higher and expected a river view or at least a street view , The feeling of exclusivity the location dictates a level of magnificence and it doesn t fail in doing so 
94495,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, I have always found the staff and quality of the rooms to be of the highest standard i would have no hesitation in staying at the hotel during my next trip to London 
94496,The Royal Horseguards, It was cold Air con in the room didn t work very well Most of the items in the room doesn t work Hotel requires serious refurbishment , People was very well 
94497,The Royal Horseguards, View from our room was awful Mini bar free but only 1 packet of crisps between two of us , Friendly staff and excellent location for our visit we had a dinner cruise from the embankment pier Bathroom very clean 
94498,The Royal Horseguards, I didnt like the fact that we had just a one night stay would have been perfect to base ourselves there fore a few days, the king bed was luxury as was the free standing bath The view was amazing and the hotel itself is beautiful inside and out
94499,The Royal Horseguards, Had no idea there were tea coffee making facilities until we accidentally discovered these hidden in a chest of drawers as we were checking the room before leaving , Excellent staff attentive and courteous 
94500,The Royal Horseguards, Cheap poorly executed recent renovation by Guoman Grubby elevators with scratched and smeared brass cheap and garish corridor lighting etc contribute to the overall ambience a failed cheap effort to layer a new metro hotel over a worn out post war classic Price gouging parking 110GBP overnight , Location is amazing Big rooms Great Internet free and fast Food was ok but nothing special 
94501,The Royal Horseguards, Couldn t stay longer , Room exceptional Staff courteous and friendly Breakfast excellent We needed a place to relax and wind down to end our vacation and the hotel met all our needs well 
94502,The Royal Horseguards, The poor points are very minor Pillows too soft the TV and other media needs updating AC worked but as an AC engineer I noticed the air filleted were blocked Bath TV was damaged The sink had a small crack , We had an amazing stay at this hotel with breath taking views of the London eye river Thames and other land marks such as St Paul s cathedral and the gherkin Our room was 817 This hotel is brilliantly situated and we will definitely be re using this hotel every time we go to London Everything is in walking distance or very easy public transport routes 
94503,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Bed was fantastic room was excellent bathroom television speakers were an added surprise All in all everything I could want from a city hotel Many thanks
94504,The Royal Horseguards, Price of breakfast , Nice room great location nice touch leaving some chilled prosecco in room and free minibar Clean room with some nice features will need up dating a bit with new technology next year 
94505,The Royal Horseguards, the difficulty in controlling the volume on the tv sound was either on very loud or off sometimes on in the bathroom and sometimes off probably a dodgy switch on the dressing table panel think the guests in the next room had the same problem at around 3am , staff were politeness personified the room had every conceivable comfort and the location was right in the heart of the London we wanted to see great job guys 
94506,The Royal Horseguards, The shower in the room was a rain shower in the bath perfect however the shower curtain was too short and there was a flood every time shower was used The shower would be better as a walk in wet area rather than in the bath Wouldn t stop us from going back to this hotel though , Relaxed hotel in a central location situated in a quiet street Tea and coffee making facilities and free mini bar contents greatly appreciated although didn t use all it was nice to know the water was free Really enjoyed the breakfast which we indulged in for the first day 
94507,The Royal Horseguards, cost of breakfast I am allergic to wheat so 24 50 for a poached egg and mushrooms is a bit steep I know gluten free is on offer but I dont like it my choice would pay extra for breakfast but there is a limit, Ambience and location
94508,The Royal Horseguards, Valet parking charges were a bit on the high side considering the close proximity of other parking We were also not made are on booking or follow up telephone calls that some roads would be inaccessible on the Sunday , The view from the room could not have been better and within easy walking distance of most sights Staff all very friendly and consistent in their delivery Food quality was excellent 
94509,The Royal Horseguards, I forgot my phone charger and that of my computer and I called as soon as I left the hotel and they told me they did not find it They said they would make an investigation but instead never called me Thieves ,No Positive

94519,The Royal Horseguards, Nothing , The hotel was absolutely gorgeous very close to the Tube the Thames as well as a huge variety of sights to see The staff were not only friendly but amazingly helpful with directions maps 
94520,The Royal Horseguards, On checking in I told the receptionist it was our wedding anniversary so he said he d send up a complimentary bottle of prosseco which didn t arrive Also the bar staff were very slow and a bit rude and the food wasn t worth the price It s billed as a 5 star hotel but it doesn t live up to it , The location was great close to embankment tube station and walkable to Hyde park 
94521,The Royal Horseguards, Breakfast could have been better no glasses for fruit juice until we asked likewise not toast or butter Eggs were luke warm and no baked beans Would have expected more selection and freshly cooked items , Staff were brilliant room view superb
94522,The Royal Horseguards, Room 905 was a small room which did not seem to us to be within the range of room we purchased as represented on the website When the washbasin was used shaving hairs gurgled up We contacted reception the maintenance engineer attended quickly and advised that this was a major problem We are surprised that this problem had not been noted before Had there not been the washbasin problem we would not have complained about the room as the receptionist indicated that the hotel was very busy but we would not have used the hotel again , After the maintenance engineer could not unblock the sink in Room 905 to which we were originally allocated we were quickly re allocated and upgraded to Room 849 which was a splendid room The hotel was otherwise excellent 
94523,The Royal Horseguards, No EE phone reception in room Couldn t turn the headboard speakers down View of a brickwall 6feet from window instead of London Eye Phone and mini bar lit up room at nightsl so couldn t sleep This was an Executive room Lots of gadgets gimmicks but would have been more comfortable in a Premier Inn, Lovely hotel in a great location with very friendly staff

94527,The Royal Horseguards, Our room 108 was directly under an extremely bright street lamp that made nighttime as bright as day and necessitated closing all the drapes fully just to bring the light level to something tolerable Luckily the drapes were very thick , Central location yet quiet at night extremely professional and attentive staff solid quality spaciousness and amenities on par with an upper middle tier hotel in the USA 
94528,The Royal Horseguards, big windows however no day light in room window panes matt Also impossible to open them even a little bit and get some fresh air hence a smell of stuck air , the friendliness and helpfullness of the staff

94531,The Royal Horseguards, Breakfast was OK but we doubt it s worth 25 pounds per person , We stayed for a weekend in the Deluxe Room with River View on the 8th floor This room costs extra but it was worth every penny the view is amazing Day and night you have an excellent view of the Thames the London Eye and the skyline of The City The room itself was wonderful Definitely recommended Staff was very friendly and room service was excellent 
94532,The Royal Horseguards, I think the price is too much 260 00 for 1 night without breakfast Room is small and windows are blinded You have to shower in the bath , Good location and very friendly staff

94534,The Royal Horseguards, I didn t like that I selected a city view room and only had a view of the hotel across the street I could see the embankment underground station as well but very little of the city itself from my room I was not overly impressed with the comfort of the bed It was ok but I expected better The TV located inside the shower didn t work but I wasn t going to use it anyway , I loved the location It was really close to the Embankment underground station and just across the river from the London eye The Wifi was really good and they supplied umbrella s for use if needed 
94535,The Royal Horseguards, Our room looked out at a c units so they whitened the windows out Fine for 1 night but any longer it would be very claustrophobic So many plugs in the room but no plugs next to the bed Refrigerator did not work Shower tiles looked moldy , Very nice staff Front door man very pleasant Very close to the tube station Nice entry room to enjoy reading the papers 
94536,The Royal Horseguards, Charged service charge for breakfast although reception did remove this from the bill when I questioned it after all it was a self service buffet and breakfast is 18 per head continental or 24 per head full disappointed as we were quoted less than this when we rang to add breakfast to our order I had booked room only in error initially , Location rooms we had 2 deluxe doubles were spacious comfortable spotlessly clean well equipped Complimentary mini bar appreciated on a hot day could enjoy coke water without needing room service Breakfast is extensive but see comment on cost

94539,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, We arrived too early straight from the airport because we had a baby with us we were given a room to rest whilst waiting for our Suite to be ready really worth the money

94545,The Royal Horseguards, The layout of the room was more for show than practicality but in saying that everything worked and was spotless, The view from the room and the welcome and perfectly cooked breakfast via room service Sunday morning that really was an achievement worth mentioning and I am not being facetious

94553,The Royal Horseguards, The lock on my door broke twice in a two day stay On one occasion I was locked out of my room for 40 mins at 11 30pm It s very expensive didn t feel it was value for money, The location is really what makes this hotel one street away from the Thames and a five minute walk from Embankment tube station It is a beautiful grand old building with sumptuous reception areas
94554,The Royal Horseguards, Sink plug in the basin didn t seal in my bathroom For some strange reason housekeeping emptied my fridge and left their lunch in it I reported this but no apparent action was taken , Excellent staff nothing was any problem particularly Konrad the concierge who helped me get my lost phone back Liked the flexibility of not being disturbed by house keeping

94559,The Royal Horseguards, We did not have enough soap in the bath and had to request it a couple of times Minor issue and I think they were having some phone problems Not a big deal at all loved this hotel , The location was walking distance to most attractions and very close to several Underground stations The bed was super comfy The concierge Richard was great

94562,The Royal Horseguards, The room service was an issue I was told mine would take 30 35 mins but after an hour I called and was told it would be another 10 mins but it was 20 more minutes and the chips were very cold on arrival with the club sandwich , The smell of the room it was like a gentleman s shoe polish It was really very nice The furniture was also of a very high standard The view was amazing The room was spotless

94566,The Royal Horseguards, We arrive at 2PM the room was not ready we had to wait till 3 pm We seat in the coffe shop waiting 20 minutes till a waitress came The coffe was HORRIBLE Then we went in the room I asked no connected room and we get a connected room we could hear all conversations from the other room very noisy You can really close the balcony windows in winter it should be very cold and noisy from the street also I dont know how how much they pay to get the 5 stars it s more a 3 stars with 7 stars price Only situation is nice close to Metro AVOID ,No Positive

94571,The Royal Horseguards, What is the point of placing a hair dryer in the desk drawer on a fixed length cord with no mirror available clearly designed by a man Get with the program and place it in the bathroom or provide a mirror you can move The day I arrived my room door could not be locked and required fixing by the concierge The following day when I returned to the hotel at 11 15 pm after 14hrs walking my door could not be opened 3 round trips from the 8th floor before the concierge said he would have to fix it again Had to sit in the lounge until after 12mn before I could access my bed that said the staff did give me a free glass of champagne while I was waiting , Lovely hotel in fantastic location 2 mins walk from Embankment tube station and easy walking distance to Tower of London monument tower bridge Buckingham palace Westminster Cathedral etc
94572,The Royal Horseguards, I thought the bathroom was a bit tired for the price of the room The room had all amenities but nothing special for 300 pounds a night , I ate in the resturant and although there wasn t much atmosphere the waitress was very good and made up for that and the food excellent 
94573,The Royal Horseguards, The shower was broken we went down stair and told reception and they sent a maintenance man up which took the door off and left so we could not use the shower on our last day, Nice room and very nice people that worked there

94701,The Royal Horseguards, Booked a deluxe room and was quite disappointed with the size Was fine for a couple of nights but the wardrobe was very small contained the mini fridge safe and ironing board so there was very little space to hang clothes Have stayed at the hotel previously and found on this trip some items looking a little tired now , Fantastic location with superb views of the Thames and London Eye Tube close by at Embankment so easy to travel around Concierge and Reception Staff very warm helpful and friendly Public areas very clean and well maintained

94712,The Royal Horseguards, I did not encounter a single friendly staff member which as a young traveler was frankly annoying They did not refrain from the scriptnl at check in and check out and seemed less than enthused to supply us with any additional information beyond that which they had already informed Our remote did not work for our room we called down and received a remote that worked for ten minutes and then did not work again There was no fridge in our room just an empty cabinet We called down to ask for two more packets of regular coffee and it took half an hour and an additional phone call to make it happen With this we were given one extra packet of coffee , The bathroom tv feature was an unanticipated plus The cleanliness and presentation of our room and the property was of a world class quality

94730,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, A very warm welcome and the staff were great in showing us to the room and attending to our luggage When checking in we were asked if it was a trip for any special reason it was my wife s birthday the day we checked in and our wedding anniversary the day we checked out On returning to our room in the evening of our arrival we were delighted to find a Birthday card with special chocolates on a slate with Happy Birthday written in icing sugar and a bottle of Bubbly on ice A most thoughtful gesture Even the fire alarm going off on Sunday morning and the evacuation of the hotel was carried out calmly and with great speed and courtesy by all the staff 
94731,The Royal Horseguards, As we checked in at 14 30 we were told our river view room was not available yet if we needed the room we had to settle for a room with a dingy corridor for a view on meeting up with two other couples they were given exactly the same story yet check out is 12 noon, Location is very good for central London tube station very close as is Parliament buildings and Theames river

94736,The Royal Horseguards, We may just have picked a very busy weekend the staff seemed overwhelmed with the volume of guests I had to collect my luggage from reception having been told it was being brought up and as I had an appointment to get to eventually I had to go get it myself I also had to wait 2 hours for my room to be ready I did arrive early but had already asked for an early check in I am being very picky but there were a few little niggles that shouldn t be there in a 5 star hotel , The staff were fantastic and tried very hard to make our stay perfect 
94737,The Royal Horseguards, WE were on the first level room was over all the in and out goings of the hotel so was really noisy with trolleys being loaded through the nite so when we stay there in the next couple of weeks time will request for a quite area of the hotel also was kept waiting to be seated for breakfast 15mins then told the staff two times no plates for cooked breakfast really need a bigger room , WARM WELCOME LOVLEY SPOTLESS ROOM
94738,The Royal Horseguards, Breakfast staff didn t clear our table so used plates sat there and the table was very small Nobody showed us where everything was laid out so for a moment we didnt know there was more till we went exploring in the next room Bathroom This is what dropped our rating as it affected our comfort It seemed the people before us checled out late so cleaning was done in a hurry There were hairs stuck on the shower curtain and on the windowsill It made for a very uncomfortable bath time even after the hairs were cleaned out the following day I had an elastic band that snapped whes trying to tie up a bag in the morning It fell on yhe carpet and we were late so we rushed off Returned in the evening Room had been cleaned but elastic band was lying on yhe same spot on the carpet This hotel could be so much more than it is , The view was spectacular We requested a view of the Thames on a high floor and got more than expected with the shard and eye in the same view This was the highlight along with the delicious fruits at the reception area 
94739,The Royal Horseguards, There is nothing we didn t love , Amazing service immaculate place best hotel ever stayed in pure luxury worth every penny and the breakfast was out of this world 
94740,The Royal Horseguards, I booked a deluxe room for a weekend half a year beforehand and asked a room with a nice view on the River We spent only 2 nights in the hotel On our arrival we were given a room with a view on the roofs no spectacular view at all The room so small it was more like a cupboard The next day we were moved to another room with a view on the River The view was marvelous but the size of the room left much to be desired The biggest disappointment was our dinner at the restaurant 1212 at the hotel I ordered rib eye medium When I got it it was with blood The meat was nice and soft though I don t know what went wrong but next day I had a great problem with digestion We had to spend the whole afternoon and Saturday evening in the hotel The next day was a torture to me as well And we came to London only for a weekend The weekend was ruined Happily enough I could see London from my bed Next time I will consider another hotel , The hotel s location is superb the stuff is always ready to help 
94741,The Royal Horseguards, Only one negative We arrive from the U S at 11 30 and the room was not ready which is understandable However the prior guest had already checked out and it took 3 hours to get our room A first class hotel like this should prioritize the preparation of the rooms for guests who arrive early , Great hotel in a great location Supreme wifi which is not so easy to find all the time Very pleasant staff

94744,The Royal Horseguards, Not a bad experience really just a quirk The heated towel rails are mounted very high on the wall and I could not reach the towels had to stand on the toilet to pull the towels down and lay them out elsewhere I contacted housekeeping and they put the towels on the counter one day But he other 3 days the message apparently was missed overlooked So back up on the toilet seat to get the towels If one is average height or taller no problem but I m 5 tall and it was inconvenient , I really enjoyed the entire 4 night stay My room was spacious and had French Doors overlooking the Eye and river Turn down service concierge restaurant lounge bar morning newspaper just everything was terrific I arrived late and the restaurant stops serving at 9 30 pm but they stayed open for me and I was able to have a full meal Another night I had a very late light supper drinks in the Lounge and it was really tasty 
94745,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, Great location really lovely hotel and friendly staff The room was spacious and we had a pleasant view There was everything you could have wanted for breakfast It was my birthday the day we arrived and the very nice receptionist arranged for a bottle of wine to be placed in our room

94750,The Royal Horseguards, Our room had no natural light Breakfast was not included in the room rate These two things were disappointing given the quality of the hotel and the room rate making the value for money questionable , Staff were excellent courteous and helpful Room was a good size Quieter area of central London but in close proximity to a tube station and river Easy walking distance to many sights Complimentary umbrella 
94751,The Royal Horseguards,No Negative, loved the hotel and room the majority of the staff were very helpful however a couple of the younger chaps on concierge didn t seem up to speed with the service expected no assistance with luggage on the way in and the car parking system leaves a lot to be desired having booked the hotel expecting on site parking I was disappointed to have to park my own car then deal with the logistics of the luggage 
94752,The Royal Horseguards, Poor food Overpriced Poorly stocked bar Hotel required attention Attention to detail sadly lacking Poor organisation for breakfast service Dinner was poor Significantly overcooked , good location
94753,The Royal Horseguards, I would have liked bar soap in the bathroom and room in refrig for my own items , It is a lovely property and so close to Trafalgar Square Service was excellent

94759,The Royal Horseguards, there was a little misunderstanding on deducting from our credit cards with some duplication required refunds Quickly resolved but really should not have occurred , Location and quality of hotel outstanding so close to everything that you could ever wish to see and do 
94760,The Royal Horseguards, Nothing , I stayed here before thru a Tauck tour a few years ago and liked the hotel So this was my choice on my return trip to London I felt very welcomed as a single woman 
94761,The Royal Horseguards, The room was small and a bit cramped but big enough just I d suggest opting for a larger room type if you are staying longer than a night and have lots of travel cases and your budget allows , I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel as I had never stayed here before The staff were all really friendly and helpful and the breakfast was one of the best I have had in a London hotel Nice calm ambience

94786,The Royal Horseguards, On check in they booked us into a standard room I had booked a executive room This was corrected the following day I did however have the feeling that this was done hoping we would not notice , Very clean Great location excellent room 
94787,The Royal Horseguards, The phone system went down and you could not call the front desk or anywhere in the hotel , Great location Very nice hotel Made an assumption that it took up the entire building but is only about a third of it Wish there had been a grande staircase or entry of the historic period it was built in but that was not the case Ask for a room with a view of the Thames 
94788,The Royal Horseguards, The wardrobe had a fridge and safe built into it leaving only 4 inches of useable hanging rail which is unacceptable for a hotel of this standard The table was far too small to accommodate having breakfast meal in the room, The Guest Services Manager was excellent and addressed a problem we had quickly and with good grace The hotel was very peaceful and the location couldn t be better for accessing Central London 
94789,The Royal Horseguards, That we had to leave and couldn t stay longer , Very helpful and friendly staff very accommodating and worked to make sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable Breakfast was lovely and very well organised with every available choice The room was extremely well equipped

94795,The Royal Horseguards, Below expectation in organisation We stayed for 3 nights and we were moved 3 times moved every day this was not particularly convenient and constituted and unwanted disruption to our enjoyment of our much deserved holiday I couldn t unpack for the whole duration because of this The lift doors needs cleaning finger prints all over as does some of the windows We have stayed at the Corinthians twice before and did notice the difference so a lot of sorting out is needed in my view , The location was very central to all the places we had to visit 
94796,The Royal Horseguards, If I had to say anything it would be the window in our room faced onto an internal wall , The room was very clean and comfortable with good facilities The entrance was welcoming The location was central easy to find and close to the tube station The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful Breakfast was delicious My friend and I both enjoyed our stay and would go there again
