257570,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, I booked a room for two people w the thought a teenager will sleep on the floor Room was to small for that so the staff moved people around and found an extra room for me 2 nights to be exact thanks for accommodating us 
257571,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Really disappointed with quality of the room dirty walls broken nightlamps broken coffee express and lack of daylight in the room For the price we paid I expected a bit of more , Really nice breakfast really nice staff good location

257573,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, My visit to Paris was a birthday present to myself which was stated on my booking but the hotel staff made no special gesture during my stay Cleaners entered my room everyday but the bed was remade with the same sheets the carpet was not swept and the bathroom floor was not cleaned , The reception staff Greg and Patrick were very nice as were the 2 women who served breakfast during my stay The Wifi worked well in the hotel 
257574,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The minibar fridge did not work and after mentioning this there was no solution really they plugged it in but it still did not cool the content The standard room is kind of small for 2 persons plus luggage After mentioning these 2 things I was offered an upgrade to a room that was only slightly bigger for 20 per night The supply of towels and toiletpaper is a bit tight Had to ask for clean towels and toiletpaper after room was made They brought what was missing immediately though , Everything in the room was tidy and clean Bed is comfi and no noise at night from street The look and feel of the hotel is modern and design The bathroom is comfortable and the shower is great Most of the staff is superfriendly One of the frontoffice staff even speaks Dutch breakfast is basic buffet however tasty 
257575,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The morning reception person could not event print the bill he was busy preparing the breakfast or helping the staff i had requested for taxi he could not find one even in 20minutes on top did not bother to tell me that he did not find one Had to rush to Gare du nord taxi parking to catch taxi for Orly i just managed to catch my flight , All was really good in the hotel facilites in the heart of city food around market metro etc 
257576,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The space in the room not quite enough for handling two suitcases , Location excellent Very close to metro station We came from Gare de Nord by metro which is easy route The hotel turned out to be in walking distance to it even though we took taxi w heavy luggage returning that cost less than 5 which is v fair 
257577,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The room was crammed not as shown in the pictures as a spacious room The TV Did not have a control and when a replacement came that didnt work either The curtains were hanging off the windows Overall not worth half of what i paid for for the room , The staff attempted to be as friendly as possible

257582,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, the breakfast service on Sunday was nearly empty by 09 50 and the staff did not clean the tables there is no restaurant space some of the staff members cannot speak English and they are in charge of breakfast area , the location in Lafayette close center is perfect and direct connection with tube in seconds can talk to sacre core opera and gare du nord station 
257583,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, nothing, Friendly staff and room bed very comfortable Breakfast was excellent value for money As a lone female traveller in Paris it was in an excellent location for Gare du Nord and Galleries Lafayette both walking distance 
257584,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Breakfast was a bit disappointing and ran out of things before it finished and wasn t fully replenished, Location was great you could walk anywhere from there
257585,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, When we first went to bed both my partner and I felt a bit ichy we weren t sure if it was from the bed sheet or the bath towels we both got the same feeling but it didnt last long as we knocked out after a long tiring day , Staff were very helpful and friendly the bed was very comfortable 
257586,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Nothing , New hotel and very nice stuff rooms are bigger than many paris hotels Room design is very trendy and modern I had 503 which I recommend with bathtub and a lot of sun light Beds are very comfy overall at the hotel there is a very clean feeling There is a metro station just front of the hotel and 10 min walk to garde north station There is a grocery store and bakery and some local cafes next to hotel If you walk down in 5 min you are in a street full of nicer trendier local Parisian restaurants La fayette is 15 min walk It s not in perfect perfect location but if you use metro it s perfect When you go out of the hotel you are in safe but average environment
257587,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Housekeeping left the window open a couple of times and it was freezing cold Also the staff wasn t very responsive of our complaints also due to a lack of the English language , The room was clean and proper Nice beds and the breakfast was fine Location was good 20 metres of a subway station and also very nearby the main train station 
257588,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Tiny room Bed just a little too firm Not everything available throughout breakfast Ran out of milk during breakfast due to a delivery problem, Staff very friendly and helpful The tiny room was creatively appointed and had a great bathroom The food available at breakfast was limited but was of good quality Little bar facility in lobby was a lovely touch
257589,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Some cups and trays they were using to serve tea were dirty And some facilities in the room didnt work i e some sockets tv or fixing was lose , Staff were very friendly
257590,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The WiFi dropped on us a couple of times, The breakfast was amazing with all foods sourced locally and tasting amazing The room was spacious and comfortable with enough room and storage for a couple for 3 nights Will be staying again 
257591,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The prices of offers in mini bar too high compared with price performance ratio for overnight stay , The very calm and pleasant small room in 5th foor with absolutely sun protecting curtains 
257592,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, N A, The staff were very friendly and helpful the nicest staff I have ever come across The night manager was a real delightful man very attentive 10 of our 10 Nice little touches like umbrellas if it rained and a sweet a day jar to cheer you up and beat hot chocolate fab shower room 88 fouberg on rue de fouberg Thank you for a memorable stay Xx
257593,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Room was very small no dressing gown and slippers in the wardrobe had to ask for them , Good location friendly staff tea and coffee facilities very comfortable bed 
257594,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The bathroom because it had paperthin glassdoors so not much privacy and when showering water went all over the bathroom , 3 steps away from the Metro great staff good sized room for Paris Superior room std room must be tiny minibar fridge tea coffee facilities 
257595,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Nothing everything was perfect, Hotel was great value for money very close to metro and station Room was very clean bathroom was very spacious and waterfall shower was great Staff were very helpful and provided great advise about getting around Paris 
257596,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Cannot find anything all was perfect , Quite convenient location very clean very nice staff perfect breakfast this is why I will return here on my next trip to Paris
257597,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Good location if travelling from Gare du Nord otherwise better locations are possible for the same price Slow wifi Small bathroom , Very comfortable bed 
257598,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Service can be improved I would expect a more inviting helpful and friendly treatment and attitude from the hotel s staff especially since this is a 4 rated hotel , Slept well conveniently situated near Gare du Nord
257599,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Style of the bathroom The whole floor got wet when someone showered I would ve preferred to pay the city tax as part of the price advertised online rather than when we were checking out , The bed was extremely comfortable The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful in giving directions to certain sites and recommending which metro lines to take to get to them They even printed detailed close up maps to ensure we didn t get lost It was quite close to gate du nord station but we had a bit of trouble navigating which direction to walk initially from the station to the hotel Mini mart next to hotel super close to metro line poissoineire and walking distance from the lovely sacre couer and montrematre
257600,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The breakfast could have used more items like different kinds of eggs and kababs, Everything about this hotel was correct metro was 20 meters and access was very good everywhere 
257601,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The cleaner stole money from us along with the breakfast girl having a terrible attitude , The reception staff are very helpful and the hotels position is great 
257602,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Needs some repairs bathroom ceiling had experienced leaking so was mildewed flaking and bulging over shower corner Square sink cool design but doesn t drain efficiently , Room was well designed but cramped so that moving around the beds was difficult and entering the bathroom more so You have to sit on bed or stand against bed to open bathroom doors 
257603,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The rooms were a little bit small for these prices , The hotel is close to the Gare du Nord and the Poissioniere subway station The facilities e g the waterfall shower were very nice 
257604,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The reason we bought food for breakfast was because the hotel breakfast was too expensive Every where else in France we went we paid less than 10 Euros per person for breakfast and at the Best Western it was almost double that price , Very convenient to a shop with a fruit stand where we got food for breakfast right next door and around the corner from a bakery which we also used for breakfast food There was a small refrigerator in the room which made it nice A METRO stop was almost right outside the front door of the hotel and we were 5 minutes by car from 2 major train stations There were plenty of different types of restaurants near by to choose from The room was cozy but very comfortable and it was clean The hotel staff was very helpful and accommodating 
257605,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The hotel was very small We had a family room setup with two adjoining rooms Rooms were small with very little space to put your luggage But common size for Paris Breakfast was not included but should have been for the price we paid , Location was a bit far from most tourist attractions but the hotel was right outside of a Metro stop so that was great Beds were very comfortable 
257606,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, A little far from opera louvre and other monuments as far as walking is concerned , Location right at the steps of metro Staff is very professional knowledgeable tentative Hotel room facilities and amenities are very good Small botique hotel with good value for money Walking distance from Gard de Nord station 
257607,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, Location was very close to Metro and easy to get anywhere The young man who was on the reception desk during the day was very helpful and exceptional in the way he made us feel welcome and went out of his way to help us with any questions His grasp of the English language was also very good 
257608,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The cramped room but you get what you pay for Our sheets were changed after 3 days not every 2 as stated minor detail though , The staff were very friendly and really helpful And yes the bed was super comfy The decor was nice and modern too Great having wi fi as well 
257609,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The tiny rooms where you could not pass by the bed without shuffling sideways The single chair The idea of a meal brought to the room was laughable with nowhere to put a tray There was also nowhere to sit downstairs a space laid for breakfast quite expensive at Euro 14 , The layout of the rooms though abysmally small was well thought out and everything worked 
257610,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, It was a interior room with no views a bit claustrophobic also the bathroom was downstairs and this was uncomfortable They did not clean the room one of the days of our stay , The bed was really comfortable
257611,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The guy at the reception as we were leaving was a bit weary of helping us Given it was very early in the morning and he was probably tired he could have been a little more patient with us , The fact that the subway station is right next to the hotel is a great plus We didnt really like our stay in Paris but the hotel made up for it We always looked forward to going back to our comfy bed The staff are really nice Very accommodating and even though we were a bit annoying with trying to get back to the hotel after almost getting lost all the time they were always so patient with us We ended up leaving a tip in the room before we left Fantastic service especially from the guy which name I failed to get tall shaved head guy the one who ordered the food for us and Deborah Thank you You made our first romantic trip memorable Room 405
257612,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, Very helpful friendly staff Walking distance from Paris Nord and across the road from a metro station There is a laundry mat a block away and many restaurants and small food shops close 
257613,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The bar prices for drinks were expensive but on a par with other best western hotels in Nice and Barcelona The rooms are smaller than other Best Western hotels but about the same as other hotels we have stopped in in Paris , The staff were extremely helpful during our stay Giving advice and help with places to go and things to see Including which restaurants they would recommend At the end of our stay my purse was taken by a pickpocket on the metro system and the staff at the hotel could not do enough to help They offered to call the police and translate for us They offered to contact anyone we needed to contact to stop cards etc Considering we had already checked out this was above and beyond our expectations 
257614,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Wine by the glass at the bar only available by the bottle Not really a complaint just a temptation , value of information from concierge nearest good places to eat which didn t mean the dearest and friendly banter about what we had done each day not too busy to make our trip feel special
257615,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, The staff was very knowledgeable and very helpful They answered our endless questions with patience I also loved that the hotel is located a few feet away from the subway The room was really small but it looks exactly like the picture There are restaurants close by The breakfast is a little pricey but there is an amazing bakery right around the corner from the hotel It is not a luxury hotel but I am happy I chose Faubourg 88 and I would stay there again 
257616,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The room was very small the smaliest which I had around the world Size was not for 2 people even for one person would be room small at all There was not any place to put luggage we had always jump over them Even bigger superiour room was not bigger enough Honestly 4 stars do not fit to the hotel it is more nice modest 3 star hotel Pokoj byl velmi mal nejmen jak jsem kdy po cel m sv t m l Velikost rozhodn nebyla pro 2 lidi mal by byl i pro jednoho Nebyl tam v bec dn prostor kam polo it kufr st le jsme p es n museli sk kat I kdy n m nab dli v t superiour room byla v t jen o tro ku nem lo smysl se st hovat Up mn hotel neodpov d 4 hv zdi k m sp e je to hezk skromn 3 hv zdi kov hotel , Excellent location many restaurants and grocery stores not so far from touristic sites Staff was very kind Breakfast was good fresh could be more variet according 4 stars Staff was very helpfull even tried to offer a bigger room but there were other disadvantiges Skv l lokalita v bezprost edn m okol mnoho restaurac a obchod s potravinami ne p li daleko od turistick ch m st Person l byl velmi ochotn dokonce se n m sna il nab dnout v t pokoj v dy tam v ak byly jin nev hody Sn dan byla dobr a erstv mohla by b t rozmanit j vzhledem ke 4 hv zdi k m 
257617,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Staff They need to be professionally trained They have no communication skills and sound pretty arrogant However can be ignored if one is well versed of Paris, Excellent location to travel back forth from the city Paris Small but comfortable and clean room Short and sweet breakfast arrangement 
257618,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, I liked the convenience of the location and that it was within walking distance to everything The beds were so comfortable it was like sleeping on clouds The staff were very helpful especially Gregoire Will definitely return next time I m in France 
257619,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, A bit pricey in my opinion but still worth it , Looks very modern nice looking and pretty big for the standard room size of Paris hotel rooms Literally a minute walking from a metro station and 6 minutes walking from the train station 
257620,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Room a bit small crowded Breakfast a bit meager dull a 2nd cup of coffee would have been lovely , Excellent lighting Thoughtful amenities Small but well thought out Comfortable beds Nice terrace outside room Reception extremely helpful and considerate 
257621,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Specifically requested twin room but were given a double , Good location friendly staff basic but plentiful breakfast We were travelling in from abroad and chose this place based on its proximity to Gare du Nord Very easy to find from there 
257622,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, limited choice for breakfast , bathroom was spacious in Paris standards and spotless Coffee making machine in the room Close to metro station Poissoni re and Gare du Nord 8 minutes walk Friendly and helpful staff 
257623,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Rooms are tiny although they made clever use of the space they had Don t bring a large suitcase with you , Fantastic location Walking distance to Gard du Nord so convenient for using the Eurostar Rooms are quiet despite central location Good facilities Clean hotel Friendly staff 
257624,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, can t say we found anything that we didnt enjoy, friendly staff and very clean and comfortable modern rooms and about 20 yards from metro station but very little street noise 
257625,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Showers were hard to operate It would be nice to have some directions on how to adjust hot cold temperatures , Edward your front desk host was extremely helpful and courteous Our first night at the hotel he made some suggestions on where to eat dinner that turned out to be the best French meal we had He truly made our trip and stay in Paris most enjoyable His personal service and attention to my family and I exceded all my expectations I would highly recommend to anyone to stay at your hotel 
257626,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Nothing not to like but just to let fellow long maned travellers know there was no hair conditioner I didn t bring any and there was only shampoo The complimentary soap shower gel shampoo and body lotion were nice though I have very sensitive skin and had no problems , Very friendly and helpful staff The location is ideal for quick links to the Metro and the main Gare du Nord for stress free rail links to the airport The room was comfortable and a decent size we had a superior room on the 3rd floor overlooking the street below it was quiet very little street noise 
257627,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, my mom had difficulty walking It was a lil difficult to get a taxi passing by off course calling was there but calling a taxi from hotel was bit too expensive , All the staff were very nice and helpful 
257628,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, Everything was brilliant Great value for the money I like the design cleanness of the hotel as well as great location just next to the subway 
257629,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Little ambience in bar area fine for breakfast Most staff really helpful but one had little knowledge of local amenities , Excellent value good position for access to everything including Metro and station 
257630,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, comfortable bed clean 30 paces from metro Poissoniere 8mins walk from Gare du Nord clean ompact room but that aligns with Paris hotel room sizing
257631,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Poor Bar area They had no ice at the bar and limited drinks on offer Rooms very small Had to pay for a upgrade which was much better but still the beds were small , Location staff really helpful friendly and professional Upgraded room has more space and downstairs bathroom but much better space to be in 
257632,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming and helpful for any queries we had The rooms were excellent and the beds were very comfy The hotel is in a great location with 20 min walk to the sacre coeur and 30 mins from the Louvre Would definitely recommend and I will definitely stay there the next time I m in Paris 
257633,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Being a vegetarian I wanted something hot for breakfast but lacked a few veggies other then that very satisfied, Clean comfortable and value for money 
257634,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, it s my second time to stay with Best Western 88 great great location and the stuffs there are very friendly the courtyard was very chilled and quite on the evening I will definitely come back again if I go Paris 
257635,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Tiny room but i guess that s the standard average in Paris VoIP is blocked on their wifi also a recent trend around France Staff too pushy to sell the breakfast One morning the hot water in the shower wasn t hot enough, Clean room newly refurbished redesigned quiet location good location Excellent value for the money
257636,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, The hot breakfast enticed me to stay but is overated only difference from other hotel is that BW have scrambled eggs Room very small even for a couple Supposed to be a romantic getaway buy it was very cramped, The shower and deco
257637,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Unfortunately we couldn t regulate the heating but we were able to open the windows , We asked for a lower floor room to avoid using the lift the hotel upgraded our room at no extra charge to accommodate our wishes Clean modern large room Friendly staff 
257638,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, At least one or two English speaking channels other than BBC World might be a good idea, The location was excellent walking distance to so many good restaurants one minute to Poissoniere metro stop and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly the showers are wonderful 
257639,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, we stayed at 5 different hotels across france during our recent trip Starting from description of location which was falsely claimed as 500 meters it was all lie Hotel is atleast 2 KMs away from Gare Du Nord The rooms were so small that it was claustrophobic The toilet was in closet Absolutely no place to walk or keep Luggage Services were pathetic On reaching the hotel late in the night there was no pillow and blanket On requesting we were told that hotel doesn t have one Heating was not working in the night We had sleep in cold We came back from cold and filled ourselves a cup of tea It wasn t brewed or anything Just normal tea coffee facility provided by hotel in every room warm water tea sachet and creamer later on we were charged 35 euros I have stayed in best western chain of hotels before It was my worst stay and makes me wonder if any one should stay in best western properties again MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT NO ONE SHOULD EVER STAY HERE,No Positive
257640,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88,No Negative, Hotel was within easy walking distance to Gare Du Nord train station The room decor was very modern trendy which gave the room a nice upscale feel very trendy The room we were in was a Jr Suite It was very roomy for the three adults in our party It had one large bed I believe it was a king and a couch sofa bed which was rather comfy The bathroom was quite large due to rainfall shower setup no shower doors While the shower setup was very nice it did leave the surrounding bathroom floor quite wet so some we had to mop it up after each use One of the best features of the hotel was its super close proximity to the Poissonniere Metro subway stop The stop was literally right outside the hotel door It wasn t a busy stop so people and traffic noise were quite low Several nice Cafes were in all directions as were a number of convenience stores for wine water snacks etc The front desk staff were very nice helpful We were able to store our luggage after we checked out while we did some final exploring before our train to London A small refrigerator was in the room which was nice to keep water drinks food chilled There was also a coffee machine in the room Keurig like but ours did not function well The bath towels were very large and plush but the bed pillows were a bit soft for my taste The hotel did offer breakfast but we thought it was a bit pricey so we did not take advantage of it

257644,Best Western Premier Faubourg 88, Didn t like that the shower did not have a door It created a wet floor that was slippery and messy And the location was hard to locate on the map , It was new and staff were very attentive A good breakfast was also made available
