55055,Best Western Premier Le Swann, None, Beautiful hotel with great staff really like the option where you can leave your luggage in safe place after check out if your flight is in evening no need for walking around city with it We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel Definitely worth the money we spend 
55056,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Stayed in a family room and shower was leaking I slipped whilst pregnant and hit my head on the stone flooring When I highlighted the leaking shower to a staff member they were fully aware of the leak and said that this was the best room in the hotel to which I responded I d rather have the worst room as long as it s safe This room should not have been booked out especially knowing that children would be walking in and out of the bathroom Staff were not friendly at all ,No Positive
55057,Best Western Premier Le Swann,No Negative, The hotel is in a good location Public transport easily accessible There are a lot of restaurants in the neighbourhood There were supermarkets close by The breakfast at the hotel is quite reasonable and very much enjoyable 
55058,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Air conditioner was not working in full power No 24 hours room service Bar in the lobby was closed in the afternoon so we couldn t even buy a bottle of water Receptionist refused to add BW points on my account as hotel was booked via booking com , Room was clean and a bed was comfortable
55059,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Staff didn t come to clean the room until 5pm by which time it was too late as we had returned to change for the evening Disappointed as it was for our ruby wedding anniversary The bar was closed at the weekend for some reason , Location
55060,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Tiny Room No kettle so we had to rely on the Nespresso machine to boil water which came out tasting like there was residue coffee , Beautifully designed interiors 
55061,Best Western Premier Le Swann, The room was very small We stored our large luggage on the balcony, The bed was very comfortable My wife commented on the mattress every morning The breakfast buffet had plenty of items to choose from Every recommendation the staff made for dining transportation and site seeing was excellent The newly renovated bathroom was very nice 
55062,Best Western Premier Le Swann, During the first two mornings we didn t really like the breakfast staff They were a bit rude Throwing the cutlery on the table But on the 3rd morning it was all made better by a very friendly lady , The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful When we arrived early our rooms were already available to us 3 rooms We received 3 maps upon our arrival which is always welcomed The location of the hotel was very good for us as we took the public transportation quite a bit to get out of the city centre The breakfast was nice The setting of the hotel the atmosphere was probably my favourite part It felt good The balcony rooms were also very lovely The rooms quiet and cute 
55063,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Cleanliness could have been better There was a stain on the bed covers and I think the tub was not thoroughly cleaned Wifi needs to improve as it wasn t stable and it kept logging me off , Breakfast was nice and plenty and the staff very attentive Room was nice and pleasant although a bit too small but it is Paris Location was brilliant close to metro and bus stations Lovely area as well 
55064,Best Western Premier Le Swann, The room was very small The bathroom door was only frosted glass which didn t give much privacy , The bed was very comfy and although our window faced a main road it was very quiet 
55065,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Nothing all perfect, Nicely designed rooms great ambiance Balcony Helpful staff especially the front desk girl who helped us with direction to places Clean Comfortable bed though the cologne can be a bit much but not a serious complain We LOVE the toiletteries Close to metro 2 lines approx 5 10 mins walk

55068,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Not much privacy glass bathroom is virtually in the room which was fine for us but I imagine would be awful if you were a new couple Mattress and pillows weren t what I like Bit hard , The location was great very convenient and good value So good location good breakfast clean and modern so perfect for a city break
55069,Best Western Premier Le Swann, It is not that I didn t like I was already aware of that but everyone should know the rooms are small and bathrooms are the size of a closet Very functional very clean but small Also the hotel s free WiFi disconnects every now and then something that might bug some people , The hotel is really charming and cozy It seems to be recently renovated The staff is always helpful and most of then speaks English Location is AMAZING specially for being close to St Lazarre station that can take you all around the major city sights in just a couple of stops

55073,Best Western Premier Le Swann, The room like all other travellers to Paris say was very small I was not able to connect to the Wifi while my wife was able to and the staff despite trying for 20 minutes couldnt solve the problem , Breakfast was good and location was also convenient with many of the sightseeing places nearby Staff was friendly and helpful
55074,Best Western Premier Le Swann, I did not like the glass toilet door When two people stay together it feels uncomfortable to use the toilet Also I did not like that the door of the shower It did not close and there was water everywhere after having a shower I did not like the waitress in the morning at breakfast Most of the time she was not around When you ask her for something she was always grumpy It would be nice if there were spare plates on the bar or nearby We used only one plate which was on the table for the entire breakfast I used the same plate for scrambled eggs and ham croissants with jam and fruit , I very much appreciated the Manager s help in accommodating us He was very efficient and professional I would like to say Thank you to him once again for making our stay so pleasant and enjoyable Well done

55081,Best Western Premier Le Swann, We are used to have our rooms at hotels cleaned well before lunch but here there was another story we even came back around 3 pm and had to go out again so the cleaning staff could finish their work not what we expected , The Junior suite was excellent staff great rooms clean and location was good
55082,Best Western Premier Le Swann, Room size we booked executive double and it was a bit disappointing but a minor point Breakfast was a bit expensive but otherwise fine The standard rate would be expensive for what you get in my opinion which above average but nothing amazing , The front desk staff who were very friendly and helpful Clean room and well maintained decor Close enough to Metro to get around city Overall a very good stay 
55083,Best Western Premier Le Swann, well you have to remember that the price of the hotel doesn t include the city taxes so on checking out you will be hit with another bill Nothing too high but may be 1 5 of the price you paid for the room This is for all hotels Plus I was told breakfast was included but when I was billed for it realized they meant it was available but this just may be the difference in the language barrier , the rooms were gorgeous everything you could need you felt like you were in paris For the price it exceeded any expectation I could have I would definitely stay there again Staff were friendly and helpful
