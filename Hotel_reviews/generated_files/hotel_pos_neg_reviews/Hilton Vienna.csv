268552,Hilton Vienna, Bear in mind at check in hotel charge you deposit full amount of your staying additional 70 euro per day No free wifi in rooms Very noisy starting early morning If you want to sleep well before important meeting definitely is not this place Poor minibar , Perfect location next to train station from to airport and to hop on bus stop Good breakfast 
268553,Hilton Vienna, It is a really old hotel with old furniture and old beds The staff were rude and some of them waited for a drink The cleaning was not done well enough There were leftovers of waste from others who had stayed at the hotel see photo There was not internet in the rooms you should pay extra if you wanted this It is not at all a Hilton hotel as you would expect , The only good thing was the location which however was not so close to the center 
268554,Hilton Vienna, Housekeeping cleaned our room after 4 00pm and only after we complained they forgot to do so check in too long computer was not working properly and we took our key cards later on the day signs of wear and tear in the room refurbishment would help, Location breakfast
268555,Hilton Vienna, What I didn t like 1 No Free water 2 I requested one water they charged me the water price and delivery to my room price 3 no Fan in the toilet no small drainage hole in the toilet some water stayed in the bathroom until house keeping clean it Especially if you have kids taking bath and playing with water , What I like is 1 Locations is in the center of City 2 Great Breakfast 3 I like the lobby 4 Nearby a lot of Halal Restaurants Turkish Indian etc 5 Check in out was easy they allow me check out at 1 PM for free 6 Available arabic TV for kids 
268556,Hilton Vienna, Room space and BATH ROOM is too small No fruits no drinking water bottles as complementary , The hotel is in a good location and close to Train station and Metro Also close to the famous church and food streets The room was too small for 3 people my son had to sleep in a small bed as against what was shown during booking time the photos were totally different Breakfast and Lounge facility is too good Leading Tours and travels come for pick up Hotel also arranged for breakfast packets for 2 days which were awesome 
268557,Hilton Vienna, Breakfast way to expensive Bathroom smelled like vinegar and shower toilet leaked all over the floor The lowest quality hilton I have stayed at so far , room was comfortable 
268558,Hilton Vienna, Woke up at 3 am due to construction nickel and dime for everything charge 8 euros for a water 10 euros per day wifi 6 euros room service charge for anything , Location opposit park
268559,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Very good service from the reception staff at the Hilton Vienna special mention for Petra who checked us in and was really helpful in relation to the area the hotel facilities etc and then also came to the rescue on a restaurant reservation as well an excellent ambassador for the Hilton brand 
268560,Hilton Vienna, The lack of Internet service complimentary with room fee was just wrong We found out a person can come off the street sit at the bar and use the Internet for no charge while those of us who actually purchased room s were charged 10 day We actually sat in the bar and lobby and used the free access the second night , We loved the young man in concierge He was so helpful in planning our short stay of 2 days so that we got thee most of the lovely city of Vienna He showed us all the places to stop and where we were on the map so our stay was much more enjoyable 
268561,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The front of house staff are well below average No free wifi in the rooms and when I called the reception desk they were rude and dismissive and it took three phone calls to get it sorted of which I had to pay the only saving grace for this place is the man at the concierge desk He is awesome and very helpful Everything else was crap 
268562,Hilton Vienna, See above together with what I like Overall it is a great place to be However it is excessively priced as far as room charge internet in the room and underground parking , The hotel is not in good shape Massive refreshment modernization would be required It is absurd that a breakfast costs euro 31 per person unless it is booked with the room It is also a bad idea to charge euro 25 for internet in the room Overall it is a rip off However breakfast is great quality and the vicinity of public transport is a great advantage 
268563,Hilton Vienna, Over priced Based on facilities and room condition it is really expensive While checked in my card was authorized with room price 70 additional and on top of that they charged the room price i understand that amount will be released later but it seems you are paying more than double of ur room rate Corridor carpet seems dirty and room looks old and renovated again Overall it doesnt feel that you are staying in hilton , Location
268564,Hilton Vienna, Front desk personnel a bit unfriendly and unhelpful The only department needed to be Improved in terms of service mind , Excellent location in Vienna Wonderful breakfast buffet line Friendly and helpful restaurant staff Best concierge personnel 
268565,Hilton Vienna, The bathroom was tiny but the room size made up for it No wifi in the room unless u pay extra or are a Hilton honours member In case of the latter the speed was slow and had to keep reconnecting Wifi should be available free of cost at a fast speed for all, Room size location executive lounge
268566,Hilton Vienna, Wifi is not free these days this is essential and usually free Carpets and entrance floor in the room were not clean , Close to transport shops restaurants and a short walk to the centre of Vienna Breakfast was very good 
268567,Hilton Vienna, Wifi was a bit strange EUR 10 per device and for 24 hours I ended up paying about EUR 80 just for wifi Restaurant was ok but you would expect better from Hilton brand , Location and staff both excellent
268568,Hilton Vienna, Corridors and rooms looked cheap and tired Bathroom small Service in lobby bar slow , Clean comfortable and efficient Good breakfast buffet Check out arrangements v efficient Bed bedding and pillows excellent 
268569,Hilton Vienna, No free water and its within the mini bar service, The room was clean and comfy All the facility was available like iron and coffee and the rest The location is perfect or extra perfect as u found variety of resturant suit any taste Starbucks nearby also Stattpark is just few step away Safety as the parking is secured 
268570,Hilton Vienna, The Hilton should have had a pool preferably temperature controlled , Its centrally located with steps away frm the metro line and a few 100 metres from the tram The mall and restaurants are at a stone throw distance The staff is courteous and prompt Its a value for money in totality 
268571,Hilton Vienna, As a Hilton Honours member I could have had free in room wifi if I d booked direct with Hilton Through Booking com it cost 25 euros per day Disappointing This needs fixing or where is the incentive to use your platform ,No Positive
268572,Hilton Vienna, Price too high They asked 490 Euro for a double room in june a period not very busy , Complete services good parking car rental agency food taxi very close with imidiately response
268573,Hilton Vienna, If we could have free wifi Howevery free wifi is provided in the lobby so not too bad, Location is perfect In the center of everything Hop on hop off bus station metro station and super market are located across the street 
268574,Hilton Vienna, No free WI FI in Rooms and No automatic doors to get into the Hotel for wheelchair users, Great location Right outside main Train Station Close to Shops and Restaurant s 
268575,Hilton Vienna, The room was not cleaned enough I found a dead fly in my pillow the towels had black points of something else inside the bathroom was not cleaned and the room was full of this old smoking smell maybe because of the old furnitures and moquette , The bed was comfy and the view was stunning
268576,Hilton Vienna, One of the staff at reception wasn t helpful nor welcoming at all There s parking right next door but it costs quiet a lot for a long stay so calculate that in your price , The corner room had a really nice view the room in general super comfortable and the location is great The area has nice restaurants around and if you dont mind walking a bit you can even reach most landmarks by foot 
268577,Hilton Vienna, The family room is actually 2 rooms with a connecting door this makes the reservation much more expensive as we paid for two rooms Parking is expensive 35 euro per night, Good breakfast Very clean comfortable beds
268578,Hilton Vienna, Would prefer coffee to be served hot Topping up from jugs means the coffee cools down , Great range of breakfast food Bed very comfortable No waiting for lifts Close to central Vienna 
268579,Hilton Vienna, Staff were not particularly helpful, The staff at check in were not very friendly I am a Hilton gold member and my partner is a platinum member and because we did not book through the Hilton website we did not get to avail of our membership We were not advised of the hotel facilities or where the gym was etc minor detail but still nice to be told what s on the premises The breakfast is slightly chaotic due to the large volume of tour groups so it s not a perfect location for business travelers
268580,Hilton Vienna, The hotel manager was NOT helpful at all we booked a room for 3 adults they sent us to a room with ONE bed so we went back to the front desk to ask for different accommodations and his answer was that is the way all our Hilton Hotel rooms are not true as we stay in Hilton quite often We then asked for adjoining rooms as we were not all going to fit in one bed and although he did find one we had to make 3 trips back from the elevator as the keys they made continued to NOT work We were VERy frustrated and the hotel manager never once apologised for their mistakes The bed in the main room was incredibly uncomfortable and the room was not clean dirty cups spoons and a partially opened coffee pack Will be reporting this to Corporate Hilton as well No one should have to go through this frustrating experience while traveling , the location was convenient
268581,Hilton Vienna, Being called on our phone on three separate occassions by other guests Chinese I think House making was a bit over eager to service our rooms while we were still there We were goi g to check out later that day so why couldn t they wait until then The shower didn t keep a stable temperature but alternated between very hot and very cold , Good beds and airconditioning The view was fantastic 
268582,Hilton Vienna, Felt that the receptionist on the desk should have known about Wienhbf Surely you would know about your own main station and how to get to it , Great transport communications bring you right to this hotel in the centre of the city It is a perfect location 
268583,Hilton Vienna, Would be good if steam room and sauna could operate longer hours , Went to gym and then steam room in mid afternoon Tried to switch on light of steam room Did not know steam room was opened for certain hours only Instead accidentally pressed on alarm in the semi darkness Two staff came shortly cos of the alarm However they were gracious when I apologised and even switched on the steam room for me Staff at restaurants are also very service oriented 
268584,Hilton Vienna, The weather was gloomy for the first 2 days We chose bad days to travel, The room was spacious and had a lot of light The metro station opposite to the hotel connects the whole city and going around was easy and enjoyable The center was 15 mins walk with many book on both sides of the road
268585,Hilton Vienna, Parking does not belongs to Hilton Hotel no directions from underground parking to the hotel Services of staff on reception and staff in the breakfast area are very poor no smile no warm welcome I would get better services in 3 star accommodation or B B Shower was unbelievable the temperature of the water was suddenly increasing so you got burned WiFi set up was not very user friendly Property has great location pitty that is not more invested also in the rooms equipment is quite dated , Location of the hotel Selection of different kind of food during breakfast 
268586,Hilton Vienna, every thing rooms furnature very old and small bathroom i had to park the car my self stuff not supportive at all and they acting like if they gave me the room for free i don t recommend this hotel at all if you going there for pleasure , location and still you need to walk little bit
268587,Hilton Vienna, Price is too expensive for the property the temperature of water is not stable while having shower Need to pay extra fee to have internet in the room , Great location very easy to reach public transport and shops 
268588,Hilton Vienna, I am a registered member of hhonors but did not get the free wifi till last day The wifi connection was very slow, The location is within walking distance to all major attractions I loved the super market in the city center which is across the street
268589,Hilton Vienna, Although the food at the restaurant was good the service was quite slow and we were given the wrong steaks mixed them up , Room was very comfortable and roomy Excellent breakfast which was included in the price Ate at the restaurant one night and the food was delicious and good value with a 20 discount given 
268590,Hilton Vienna, Only one bath robe was in the room And only one milk sachet for out morning coffee Couldnt raise the point with the staff because we had to leave early,No Positive
268591,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Breakfast is an experience Apart from that room was ok basically I was expecting something more luxurious with 310 per night But in general it was a good experience
268592,Hilton Vienna, Perhaps it would be a good idea to add some more shampoo and body wash in the bathroom Everything else was perfect , Congratulations to all the hotel staff We loved our stay at your hotel 
268593,Hilton Vienna, While the hotel was in a great location we found it to be a little basic and the room decor could perhaps do with updating Free wifi was available in the lobby however only available in the room for an additioanl cost Hoped for a room with a view over the city but unfortunately this was not available to us at the time , The location of the hotel was fantastic just a short walk from the Inner Stadt and the main attractions For getting into the city from Vienna International Airport the hotel was less than a two minute walk from Wein Mitte station where you can get the City Airport Train CAT which at 17 euros is a bit expensive but only takes 16 minutes We had a room with a king size bed which was incredibly comfortable especially good after busy days sightseeing The room was very clean and we were very impressed with the housekeeping service 
268594,Hilton Vienna, See above, Bathrooms small door opens against the shower rail No fan Water from both the shower bath and basin takes forever to drain away For a 5 star hotel very poor No free wifi in rooms Wifi in the lobby only unless you wish to pay EUR10 daily
268595,Hilton Vienna, Unfortunately I did not like the carpet It looks like it needs to be changed soon , Very friendly staff Thank you Teresa for helping my mom with printing her boarding pass Cleaning team well done Our room was sparkling clean each day 
268596,Hilton Vienna, The room was much smaller than advertised or shown on pictures for this room type and it felt cramped To be honest we were quite disappointed since our main reason for chosing this hotel was the promised room size Bathroom was also small and there were no bathrobes as promised Everything was quite worn out with visible tears and spots in the wallpaper and curtains The carpet was not really clean the minibar was filthy the coffee cups were dusty etc All in all not good value for money and this is definitely not a five star hotel , The hotel has a great location very central and easy to reach Breakfast was excellent The beds were very comfortable 
268597,Hilton Vienna, To short bed and poor bathroom The water wasn t running properly , The cook was prepearing the omlet for breakfast Tasty orange juice The staff at the breakfast was very profesional 
268598,Hilton Vienna, The bathroom was bad the flushing was not working well and the shower was not heated well it was really bad experience and last time for me with Hilton group , Location 
268599,Hilton Vienna, Room doors are getting old Washroom is not at the standard I expect from Hilton The water can be extremely hot at times for every few secconds, location is very convenient for all means of transport
268600,Hilton Vienna, I expected a larger and more comfortable rooms for the money I paid and more luxurious facilities , Location Perfect location and a walking distance to most of the touristic attraction transportation 3 minutes away from as express train station to the airport A very safe area 
268601,Hilton Vienna, How can a well known hotel not provide free internet in the room that is absurd to experience in 2017 The bathroom was not clean at all , The bed was confy
268602,Hilton Vienna, No required extra bed upon arrival 2 bathrobes for 5 persons long waiting time at front desk No free wifi although advertised only for HH members Many more better options around ,No Positive
268603,Hilton Vienna, Tempremental shower Some traffic noise from the busy road beside the hotel , Good sized bright room overlooking the centre Proximity to CAT station a bonus Very helpful and friendly staff
268604,Hilton Vienna, None, After 2 issues with the room I was given upgrade to the Excecutlve Floor Very comfortable Great view on the park and the cathedral Stone throw away from CAT direct train to the airport 
268605,Hilton Vienna, The welcome greeting could have been better Rooms 128 129 are near the lift core causes disturbances when lifts in use No free wifi Room was not appropriately configured for two guests , Location was great Fantastic selection of Gin Condition of room finishes and furniture was very high 
268606,Hilton Vienna, Stayed in the junior suite facing the cathedral Access to Executive lounge but they putnme on the first floor so every time I opened a window Ac does not work during winter months all I got was traffic noise First day was given a complimentary bottle of sparkling water which was never replaced the next day like all other hotels in the world they actually left the empty bottle sitting on my bedside Cleaning staff never put the ironing board or iron away The TV faces the toilet and you have to lie diagonally on your bed to watch tv or turn your neck The two chairs for guests are useless and uncomfortable Decor is terrible All brown shades of old Wifi is not free scam and shameful I felt I was back in 1973 , Great concierge team Always moving quick and efficient while retaining the respect to all guests Genuinely helping everyone around them
268607,Hilton Vienna, Location wasnt great and the rooms are small The shower is horrible and the rooms are datet Plus the staff was really unfriendly Because of things that happened we wanted to change dates the Hilton Berlin Where we made reservations also wanted to help us But the Hilton vienna were really unfriendly and they couldn t care less , Breakfast was really Nice
268608,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Great location We took the City Airport Train after flying in from Heathrow and it was a bonus to find we simply had to walk across the street to the hotel All staff were helpful and pleasant and a great breakfast Easy to walk everywhere especially good for someone like me who doesn t like buses 
268609,Hilton Vienna, Parking was very expensive and we were charged for in room internet because we booked through booking com rather than through the Hilton site directly ,No Positive
268610,Hilton Vienna, I don t like to pay more for the internet Surprisingly the net is available free anywhere in the city except inside the hotel which is only free in the lobby The rate of the hotel is high and I don t know why they put a charge for it Anyway I ll be more careful next time when I choose a hotel For that hotel they will lose a lot while they are looking for a minimum , Only one thing it is next to the airport city train 
268611,Hilton Vienna, Charging for Wi Fi at the room in 2017 is a complete rip off It is a cheap trick that really taints Hilton s prestige I might accept a higher price for the room but would never pay 10 Euro for this hidden extra It is matter of principle My bed side alarm woke me up at 7 15 It wasn t me who had set it on probably the previous tenant and moreover I could not make it shut up in the darkness of my room Very unpleasant start for the day Cleaning ladies should be trained to de activate any alarm clock when preparing a new room , Good quality toiletries
268612,Hilton Vienna, I honestly cannot think of anything negative , Comfortable beds and pillows good size room all bathroom essentials provided Breakfast had many choices and was of good quality 
268613,Hilton Vienna, The breakfast probably isn t worth it as it becomes a bit of a scrum for lukewarm food on the weekend The rooms were clean and nice but a little bit dated , The staff and hotel locaiton were amazing The Hilton was conveniently located near the CAT express train to the airport and walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Vienna 
268614,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The staff where extra friendly and very helpful at all times The location and the facilities are excellent Well done to the Hilton team Special compliments to the professionalism of Edgardo 
268615,Hilton Vienna, The room was VERY warm We were on the 9th floor and the air con didn t work , Firstly the hotel was very easy to get to with a main station just opposite The view from the room was beautiful It was very clean a great size and all the furniture was modern
268616,Hilton Vienna, Rooms are over dated not very clean poorly decorated furniture old and used wit scratches no basic goods in room slippers etc , Lobby of Hotel was at the level of 5 
268617,Hilton Vienna, Not good value for money For the price paid breakfast should have been included Bathroom was not too nice , Excellent location Good bar in the lobby 
268618,Hilton Vienna, Room service is too late bad breakfast in general food in hotel s restaurant Sparks is poor but prices are excessive , Location is perfect good and spacious room comfortable bathroom 
268619,Hilton Vienna, The rooms that have a connecting door are not properly sound isolated so if you have noisy neighbors you hear everything , Excellent location and delicious breakfast At the breakfast room they have a table ready so you can take water fruits and croissants with you for the day The free wifi in the lobby even works in the rooms 
268620,Hilton Vienna, The whole place feels tired and in desperate need of a refurbishment It looks like nothing has changed since it opened 14 years ago when I first stayed there The carpets furniture and bathrooms are worn out scratched and damaged The internet is expensive and the breakfast hour 8 to 9 is often very crowded I only stay at the hotel because it is next door to my Head Office , Location 
268621,Hilton Vienna, The hotel needs refurbishment at least for the type of room I reserved King Cathedral Room View old furniture almost excessively worn , Location Good breakfast 
268622,Hilton Vienna, Room size smelly bathroom feels dirty slow net doesn t feel like a five star more like 2 stars Couldn t wait to check out , Right off train station and abundance choice of restaurants around
268623,Hilton Vienna, Hotwl needs a major renovation Carpet walls bathroom are old and can barely hold for the luxury you would expect in a 4 star hotel Better comunicatin between departments and a change in management is imperial , Breakfast was diverse and you had a cook that would do eggs and pankakes the way you wante Croissants fruits snacks water and a bag to take away in the morning 
268624,Hilton Vienna, Just include the wifi Don t make guests pay extra for it Sauna and steam room set up was a bit weird It was mixed and there was a man wandering around naked I know we were in Europe but come on , Room was spacious and beds were comfortable Bathroom was good Wifi in lobby was good Close to metro and bakery Staff kindly gave us a slightly later check out 
268625,Hilton Vienna, Nothing, Happy with the stay would stay again Loved the choice of Breakfast how pretty the park next to the hilton was covered in snow at the time And i had a walk down across the bridge to the very end of the shopping street Turned left to see a beautiful gothic church Nice walk If you turn right and follow the road down there s hard rock cafe 
268626,Hilton Vienna, Staff in the reception are rude Didn t know much the benefit of Hilton member are entitled to have free room Internet regardless you book in booking com , Location
268627,Hilton Vienna, Tiny rooms 3 star facilities poor sound proof walls and unwelcoming receptionists and staff 5 star rating Is over stretched Not worth staying just for the location ,No Positive
268628,Hilton Vienna, Bathrooms could have been a little bigger and no a c in bedroom as winter Room very hot On 2nd night called front desk who sent engineer He turned off the a c as only feeds warm air in during winter but unlocked the window so could be fully opened which helped cook the room , Breakfast in S parks restaurant very good Breakfast in Executive Lounge not too extensive and a little dried out by the time we got to it 
268629,Hilton Vienna, Expected free wifi in the room should be standard at a hotel like this not good enough with free wifi in the reception area Our room on 9th floor seemed a bit old fashion time to change carpets and curtens Just one coffe machine created a queue in the morning would recommend investing in one more coffe machine , Service minded staff Very nice gym sauna and steam Great breakfast 
268630,Hilton Vienna, WiFi is chargeable 10 EUR per day My credit card was mistakenly pre authorized twice during the stay 70 and 25 5 EUR without any reason The reception staff told me that this had been a system error A week later the funds were unblocked by a bank , Location is very convenient just next to Wien Mitte 5 min walk from the City Airport Train platform very close to the city center 10 15 min walk to Stephansplatz Room was quite and comfortable Breakfast was perfect diverse and tasty 
268631,Hilton Vienna, The breakfast organization was not the best Restaurant used for breakfast was too small and overcrowded every day , Bed was very comfortable Room was clean Hotel has a great location 
268632,Hilton Vienna, In a 4 Hotel in heart of Vienna there is no free internet connection WIFI in your room Are you KIDDING me , Best Location The stuffs behavior was perfect Clean Comfortable 
268633,Hilton Vienna, The rooms are pretty basic more like a good 3 Hotel There is no water in sauna nor can you order it via room service Thats unexceptable The lady at the spa was very nice and helpful though , Good breakfast and good location Kind staff 
268634,Hilton Vienna, Paid WiFi 10 day and paid parking 35 day What year is this Staff not very helpful and a cleaner walked into my room at 7 30 am on a Saturday The building is old and could use some renovation soon You d expect great service since you re paying a premium for the brand name but everything was an add on e g WiFi and the staff was rather cold and impersonal , Location was great just a 10 minute walk from Stephansplatz Breakfast was also great Sign up for HHonors for free to get free WiFi in your room 
268635,Hilton Vienna, It would be awesome if WiFI was free , Hilton Hotel is located 5 minutes away from the heart of the city and right next to the CAT station 16 minutes train ride to airport and the mall Have a breakfast at DerMann its the only place that was open at 8 am on Saturday morning The room was absolutely amazing starting with spacious room and clean bathroom and finishing with comfortable bed and fluffy towels Francesca at the front desk was very helpful Ask front desk girls for the best places to eat and what to see They know the best 
268636,Hilton Vienna, The room was very basic and worn out specially the bathroom which was not in the same standard as other guilting hotels I ve been to Also charge for using wifi in the room is ridiculous , The location is excellent in front of the subway station and train to airport Breakfast is also very good Staff is polite and helpful 
268637,Hilton Vienna, WC in the room could be more clean WC was not appropriate as a facility for a 5 hotel, Large room with various comforts eg office space with comfy chair Large 42 inch HDTV Comfortable bed with very comfortable pillows and beddings Great location next to the airport train 1km from Stephanplatz
268638,Hilton Vienna, It s quite expensive but hotels of this category have similar prices While it s stated that linen are changed every 3 days in our case the were changed only after I had put the special sign on the bed at day 4 , Breakfast has great variety The room was spacious with amazing view temperature and comfort The concierge staff is very helpful It has the best location you can have bc it s across the main train and metro station and is walking distance to the centre Stefanplatz We would definitely stay there again 
268639,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Staff is very nice and helpful plus the facilities is perfect I used room service ordered some food in late night it was quick and very good service 
268640,Hilton Vienna, No shower in the room a bit old room check in lady in reception not very kind Evereything would be ok if the average rate for the room is lower , Breakfast restaurant and hall event nice 
268641,Hilton Vienna, Executive lounge was not as nice as the name implies We were entitled for breakfast in it but actually prefered to have our breakfast down in the main restaurant , Breaskfast was excellent and a large variety The conceirge was very helpful with booking of tickets Location was excellent in a very central location Room view on the 10th floor was wonderful 
268642,Hilton Vienna, There was not a thing we did not like, We had a perfect expirience we were spoiled the crew was friendly and helpful Sauna was lovely and breakfast was great Location is best 
268643,Hilton Vienna, Heatinh system was pretty bad It was sometimes not working , The breakfast was really great The subway and bus station was very close to the hilton hotel And view was awesome The bed was fitable for me They gave us some chocolates and middle size of water 
268644,Hilton Vienna, Reception staff is not very friendly We felt we were treated like second class guests because our booking wasn t through the hotel website, The Hotel s location is excellent few meters away from a well connected train station and few minutes from the City Centre
268645,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, We loved the Hotel itself and the location is perfect across the street from the main train station we took the city train from the airport very convenient 
268646,Hilton Vienna, Breakfast quality and service Overpriced charges such as water price New year eve celebration food quality very disappointing for hotel like Hilton, Hotel location and staff were excellent but the services such as breakfast was a big disappointment 
268647,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The location was excellent Stephensplatz is a short walk away Wien mitte station is a 2 min walk and the sauna and steam bath facilities are an added comfort The only thing is that wifi in rooms is paid 
268648,Hilton Vienna, Very small rooms the sheets had holes in them Wasn t very clean and when we went to complain the front desk lady said they are not a five stars hotel they are a hilton So the sheets are only changed once every three days , Good breakfast and good concierge staff
268649,Hilton Vienna, 7 50 Euro for a medium bottle of Evian one of those places one should really check the prices to not get ripped of Rooms are just average for a five star place ,No Positive
268650,Hilton Vienna, It was very expensive more than it should be but it was New Year so that probably drove the price up , Fantastic location in the centre Within walking distance of all the sights and across the road from the airport train
268651,Hilton Vienna, The staff have no attention to detail are not willing to compensate for their errors The room booked was not given on the first night and had to complain to receive it Even then it was dirty and noisy Bathrobes and slippers had to be requested Breakfast served until 11am on weekends but when I arrived at 10 40am I was told it was finished When I pointed out there was 20minutes left I was left to find a table which where all dirty and no one came to clean it I have had better service from a B B , The location was quite excellent and was able to walk to all the museums theatres and restaurants 
268652,Hilton Vienna, WiFi 10 euro day 24 euro day premium Is it normal in modern world Hotel blocks extra money 1 night price as a guarantee Unfriendly staff High price with awful service I ll never choose Hilton , Good location
268653,Hilton Vienna, Had to order a heater for the room Room heating not efficient Fan vent in bathroom non existent, Great location walk to all the sights or catch the train subway Bed was super comfy Cleaning staff foyer staff were super friendly and helpful Breakfast was fabo
268654,Hilton Vienna, Rooms on first floor exposed to sound from nightclub below the hotel this is fairly disturbing thus these rooms should be traded for less money, Excellent location friendly staff
268655,Hilton Vienna, Nothing, Staff were accommodating and informative Well located with underground station very close by Breakfast was a lovely variety of foods accommodating all 
268656,Hilton Vienna, The service was not so perfect at breakfast the server was extremely rude and had an awful attitude it was unacceptable Furthermore the rooms heating did not work and the employees could only fix it after a day , The room was nicely designed and the view from the hotel was also mesmerizing 
268657,Hilton Vienna, While the exterior was excellent the room itself looks a bit dated i e the furnitures and carpet For a Hilton I would expect better The Wi Fi was very very erractic Our room actually had the general lobby Wi Fi reception but it was a sometimes there sometimes not case Hence on Day 2 I opted for the paid wifi at EUR10 for 24 hours Alas the connection is exactly the same as the ones we get via he general lobby in our room Paid EUR10 for nothing Needs major improvement , The staffs were extremely helpful Especially the concierge staff by the name of Andrea or was it Andreas He was extremely patient with all queries on excursions and other infos even though he s handling a long queue of hotel patrons He did help us to secure a day excursion to Budapest even tough it was initially fully booked Now the location It was just excellent It is right in front of the underground station and the S line both of which will take you to the Wien HBF Public transport all settled then The breakfast spread is good as well And if you ran out of things to do the cinema is just next door 
268658,Hilton Vienna, Nothing, Excellent breakfast buffet Attentive and helpful staff Very good location Underground Station is across the street The city centre is a few minutes away on foot If I were to return to Vienna this hotel would be my first choice 
268659,Hilton Vienna, I ask for interconnected rooms with 2weeks before but they don t answer me just took the money after I ask again to reception they told me that don t have in first night they give me from second night they put hold to my money like a waranty and after check out they free my money to late after sone days I stay in Hilton every time when I am in Wien I must say the room service food it s not the same it s bad it s not like in previous years too bad , location
268660,Hilton Vienna, Room is very plain and mine was in the section that had the worst view in the building overlooking the shopping mall from a low floor , Great value especially considering that the excellent breakfast buffet 30 Euros to buy by itself is included Hotel is conveniently located downtown and right next to the airport train

268665,Hilton Vienna, It was disappointing to see that you can t avail of topping up your Hilton points if you book through booking com instead of directly from the Hilton website , Location was excellent
268666,Hilton Vienna, It is a huge disadvantage that the WIFI is chargeable in the rooms and only free in the reception area We are in 2016 and wifi should just be availie and included , Location was good and the food in the Resturant Both for breakfast and dinner
268667,Hilton Vienna, The room could have been cleaner One day nobody came to clean the room until reminded in the evening One coffee sachet each per day in the hospitality tray was inadequate , The location is good with the station and shops very close by The staff were very helpful and friendly

268673,Hilton Vienna, Bathroom shower was a loose handheld and sprayed water all over room It could not be tightened, Beautiful lobby comfortable bed room was ready early
268674,Hilton Vienna, Internet wi fi is not free and this is unfriendly , It is a very comfortable city hotel with excellent breakfast The hotel is only 10 min walking distance to the 1st district in Vienna and also located at underground station Wien Mitte From here you can take the City Airport Train CAT to Vienna Airport the journey is a short one only 16 min

268679,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Staff friendly and helpful rooms kept clean and very comfortable Stayed on the executive floor good value for money especially with the use of the lounge 
268680,Hilton Vienna, The receptionist Ms Sjaron did not handle the check in efficiently nothing was explained I have to ask things and thats the only time she would poorly answer the inquiries shes a trainee and she needs to learn more, The room was lovely although the airconditioning did not work well The morning breakfast was excellent The staff were all warm and accommodating Patrick was very helpful friendly and was excellently efficient handling the check out 
268681,Hilton Vienna, Room d cor is a bit tired but rooms are clean and functional and service is good , Breakfast buffet was super And the location is unbeatable 10 15 minutes walk to most attractions and across the street from CAT terminal and subway station 
268682,Hilton Vienna, This hotel would be lucky to be rated 4 star anywhere other than Europe All you get from the grumpy old doorman is a grunt when you arrive My room was dated with a tiny bathroom I enquired about a late checkout and was told they were fully booked on that day however when I checked online there were 7 different room types available including mine Never again for me , Location was good
268683,Hilton Vienna, Very bad quality in everything Staff clean and services We had problem with the hotel and when we contact with the manager he want helpful and he didn t help us in anything and he didn t listen to us My advice to any one is to not book in this hotel because it is very bad hotel in every thing ,No Positive
268684,Hilton Vienna, Every thing was very bad The room was in the first floor and bery old and the bathroom is very old and broken and the service of the staff is very bad , I didnt like any thing The room was very very bad and very old and no any facility at the room 
268685,Hilton Vienna, 1 water temperature at the tap was constantly changing from cool to hot water 2 internet in the room to be paid additionaly, Everything was ok service cleanness breakfast
268686,Hilton Vienna, The WiFi was paid, The room was very neat clean and large The bathrooms also very good quality The location is excellent right outside main station Wien Mitte so traveling around Vienna was very convenient 
268687,Hilton Vienna, It does not have the accommodation luxury to be a 5 start hotel Recently we staid in a Eurobuilding which is a 4 start and has a better facilities infrastructure Hilton Plaza need a urgent remodeling upgrade to be a 5 start , Close to midtown and shopping mall 
268688,Hilton Vienna, There s nothing I didn t really like There is a few things that could be improved but nothing major , Whole experience wes great Staff was very helpful with a constant smile on their faces which I like I like the central location There s a nice park on one side and a shopping mall on the other which comes in handy in case you forgot to bring something or you just like shopping Breakfast was great which for me at least is very important 
268689,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Well equipped hotel with very helpful stuff and good lobby The standard room was comfortable and clean I think the bathroom a bit small but it was clean and well equipped too 
268690,Hilton Vienna, very very very small bathroom i couldn t have a shower due to a small bath tub and very short bathroom sealing also old and very used furniture need renovation ASAP , location and the room size
268691,Hilton Vienna, One or two of staff could have been a little more pleasant , Great location and amenities Very clean and comfortable room and we were lucky enough to book it for a great rate
268692,Hilton Vienna, Free Wifi only available in the lobby You have to pay to get wifi in the room , Location is convenient especially if you take the express train from the airport 
268693,Hilton Vienna, Honours free wifi was temperamental needed to login to public wifi in lobby to properly enable, concierge was excellent and got twin city liner tickets for us
268694,Hilton Vienna, 1 Reception staff are very rude not welcoming and not helpful at all 2 We had an issue with having an extra bed in the room even though on booking com it was mentioned that child under 18 years is free of charge They offered us another room but they asked us to pay Why should we pay if there was a miscommunication between booking and the hotel 3 Room service staff were very unprofessional they used to enter the room even if we were there sleeping or getting ready 4 It s very shocking that Hilton is a 5 star hotel but they don t have free wifi in the room again they ask to pay for it Looks like all they value is money , the location and breakfast only
268695,Hilton Vienna, I have spent 2 nights and plan to have one more night here after my trip to Poland I checked out at 12 pm and i spent time sitting in the lobby waiting to leave at 8pm due to my train schedule I ordered the drink and using my laptop The staff try to ask me every 15 20 min if i need anything else and the worst is she gave me the bill without my request while the other guests sitting there without any drinks What was that , Clean and good location 
268696,Hilton Vienna, Cleaner opened our room door at 9am in the morning and wanted to enter the flat while we were still in bed room without proper knocking or being allowed to enter The check out time is 12pm which is being ignored I have complained to the concierge who just defended the lady saying they earn 3 euros per room and have to do their job quickly I was expecting a lot more from Hilton but won t book any room again with them in future Paying 10 euros a night for using a wifi in the room is ridiculous considering you can get free wifie in pretty much every cafe or street around Also breakfast costs 30 euros per day which is well overpriced you can get 10 times better coffees and morning buns elsewhere for fraction of the cost , Good location
268697,Hilton Vienna, No free internet in room Shower facility poor Upgrading needed, Location right opposite Mitte Vien View from room incredible Worth the extra money 
268698,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, This hotel is just across the Wien Mitte station From this station the airport express train departs You can also check in your bags here before you go to the airport A shoppingcenter with a lot of great places to eat at Have in mind most of the shops are closed on Sundays It is a big hotel You can sit in the reception area to really realx or just access to the Wi Fi There is also computers you can use for check in or just search interesting things Breakfast is in the restaurant area there is a lot to choose from You can also bring a small bag with you when you leave they have fruits and water if you want We didn t hear any noise from the street below we had a view to that street Very nice beds and pillows You can make yourself coffee or tea and a small refrigerator A safety box is in the closet You can easily take the subway from this location to any interesting building park It is clean and fresh so I would stay here again if I go back to Vienna 
268699,Hilton Vienna, I didn t like that my room is far from my kids room, Every thing i like the breakfast the helpful staff the location and Teresa the receptionist She was very helpful informative professional with big smile on her beautiful face Thanks Teresa The location is excellent Every thing is around you You can find restaurants metro station supermarket and pharmacy 
268700,Hilton Vienna, Twin room of limited dimensions and the size of the single beds really uncomfortable and unexpectable from a 5 star Hilton hotel Limited guantities of soap and shampoo in room Mini bar locked and needed a credit card deposit to be at guest s disposal Breakfast room overcrowded and staff without necessary experience to deal with such a great number of visitors Great delay during preparation of hot dishes like waffles and omeletes Reception desk always busy Propably understaffed and somewhat nervous Not free wifi in room in 2016 unacceptable And finally Hilton Honours benefits free internet etc not provided because according to reception the reservation was not made through Hilton com , The proximity of the hotel to the old town and the convenience of its location nearby underground station Westbanhof and CAT and central shopping mall Porters kind and ready to help with taxi and luggage 
268701,Hilton Vienna, cleaning problem of the room and bathroom room floor carpet looks too old and dirty no internet in the room unaccepted Wi Fi service available now even in the streets but not in this hotel which is suited for conferences and scientific meeting asking for taxi to the airport cost 75 euros while we just went out of the hotel door only cost 40 euros, breakfast very good location also good beds comfortable
268702,Hilton Vienna, We wanted umbrellas one day and were told curtly there weren t any Then another staff gave us two Wifi in room should be free In some rooms the public wifi is available which is free In other rooms like mine I had to pay 10 euros a day , Excellent location A little removed from the crowded historical areas and yet close Eating joints supermarkets delis etc next to hotel were excellent My room had a terrific view Hotel worked with high efficiency Staff was generally friendly
268703,Hilton Vienna, Some times when you ask for somthing from the reseption they ignore it For Example asking or water of a trolly or an iron, Everything is near perfect location
268704,Hilton Vienna, No free wifi at the rooms The view from the room was not great , The breakfast was excelent the location of the hotel is perfect The junior suite room were comfort
268705,Hilton Vienna, One minor irritation was some bathroom noise from adjacent rooms , Very good location within walking distance of tourist sites and very near train station 
268706,Hilton Vienna, Hilton has a certain image as a 5 star hotel but facilities and rooms are at best 3 star quality and even the Wifi which is offered today by buses are not provided by the hotel for free to customers and they charge an arm and a leg to get a data package very 90s style , Concierge services were amazing and prompt 
268707,Hilton Vienna, ROOM IS DATED AND COULD DO WTH A REFURBISHMENT, THE BED IS ALWAYS GREAT IN A HILTON YOU ALWAYS GET A GREAT NIGHTS SLEEP EVEN IF THE ROOMS ARE NOT FURNISHED TASTEFULLY
268708,Hilton Vienna, Judgemental staff at welcome desk Mattress in junior suite very worn making for a very uncomfortable sleep Executive benefits average not much choice with drinks snacks , Great location and restaurant Clean and spacious 
268709,Hilton Vienna, So impersonal from the welcome to the checkout everything in between The take it or leave it attitude from the staff is so pervasive it s disappointing I quite often reside at a Hilton enjoy the stay it s generally an upmarket quality chain not in this instance Additionally the spa was not functioning properly Wifi 10 per day is a rip off even Hilton Honors guests pay this if they did not book directly with Hilton Meaning the fact that you stay there is not valued you are in fact penalized if you booked via Expedia Booking com etc Ludicrous In essence Too Busy Too Uncaring a pity , Good location standard type breakfast is adequate not exceptional bed comfortable able 
268710,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The room is large comfortable for parents and kids Parking is provided by the hotel share you plans with the management and they will offer you better price
268711,Hilton Vienna, for the price of room is very unconvenient and expensive to pay the internet to use in the room sound very expensive and innapropriate when almost every where internet is included on the room rate, room and service ok I had some problem with power lights in the room they came 3 times to fix and again happens the same problem at the end at 10pm after my claim I was changed room
268712,Hilton Vienna, there is free WIFI at ground floor in rooms cost 10 Euro can t use Hilton points since order made through Booking com Breakfast 31 Euro per person we took accomodation without breakfast , Very Good location 10 Minutes from cathedral train from and to Airport stop near the hotel Very good service
268713,Hilton Vienna, Please remove the charge for the internet You have to pay 10 euros for the internet 10 euros For a five star hotel that caters for business people we couldn t believe you have to pay extra for the internet in 2016 , My adult children and I stayed at the Hilton and were excited by the prospect a 5 star hotel in Vienna perfect Unfortunately we were disappointed 
268714,Hilton Vienna, I spent over an hour at check in due to the longest queue I have ever encountered at a hotel check in desk I was told that this was due to a flight that had been cancelled and scores of people checking in at the same time Still not a valid excuse this delay spoiled my evening dinner plans In such situations the hotel should bend over backwards to compensate by e g offering a free dinner or suchlike It certainly was not the best start to my stay ,No Positive
268715,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The hotel is centrally located very convenient to get anywhere by foot a train station shopping center a car rental company a few steps away A beautiful park is in front of the hotel The staff service is friendly courteous and efficient 
268716,Hilton Vienna, A little overpriced , Spacious room massive comfy bed Breakfast was lovely We stayed here overnight to be close to the CAT city airport train and it was only a 2 min walk 10 min walk from centre of Vienna 
268717,Hilton Vienna, Disorganised staff No free wifi although it was advertised They get around this by providing free wifi in parts of the lobby They should not be able to count this as free wifi , Nothing It feels like a Holiday Inn or a large budget hotel Kids staying in different room could not charge breakfast an extortionate 31 to their rooms despite all rooms being guaranteed on card of first room 
268718,Hilton Vienna, not many choices for vegetarians the daily buffet breakfast has the same food choices for 5 days in a row the executive lounge is just about ok in the food and drinks options , very good location service was courteous and concierge desk was quite friendly
268719,Hilton Vienna, Our room was one the few with really no view at all but looking to blind walls in our reservation some months ago we asked for some view apparently that was not used The shower temperature changes constantly from cold to hot and back really inconvenient Booking via booking com makes that no hotel points are collected but even worse the staff does not recognise your status, Location close to city center Parking availability and valet Breakfast
268720,Hilton Vienna, The person at the omelet station always overcook eggs over medium and waffles The person at the restaurant entrance who checks in your room number for breakfast needs to learn greetings or smile , Location was convenient and close to the tram and Metro subway 
268721,Hilton Vienna, Decent walk to main tourist areas , Its a classy big modern hotel Beautiful finish and spotless rooms Excellent locality next to Mitte train station and taxi rank 
268722,Hilton Vienna, Had trouble getting free wi fi to work ended up paying for 24 hour access Breakfast expensive but plenty of options in the street around the corner , Excellent location for walking around or catching one of the hop on hop off buses Great view over the city Free baggage storage after check out until our train departed late in the day 
268723,Hilton Vienna, Insufficient number of toiletries awkward for this price range and while you can get free wifi in common spaces then in the room you get only paid options a kind of rude as for my taste , Convenient location very convenient parking We also liked the S Parks restaurant very much nice place excellent food 
268724,Hilton Vienna, Have to shower standing in a bathtub No good free wifi Furniture is old poor breakfast for 5 Hotel no spa , I had a corner room with a beautiful view and diner was great 
268725,Hilton Vienna, For Vienna this is a comparatively new building so rather lacking in charm I was on the 3rd floor in a corner room which was decorated in all shades of yellow and orange Rather overwhelming when the curtains were closed Sound Proofing is an issue The people upstairs clearly had small children who thundered around until past 11pm Next door a cupboard door was allowed to rattle back into position with monotonous regularly until past midnight I hate any kind of noise but with the only alternative being to request a room transfer at midnight I pushed on through You need your room card to access the floors in the lift which confused a lot of people including me as it didn t work very well Worst of all wifi is not free I am an HHonors member and thought that meant I got free wifi However when I rang hotel services to enquire I was told no that was not the case So the choice is either pay 10 Euros for each 24 hours or go down to the lobby where it is free I opted for the lobby where I found myself surrounded by fellow users and one man making very loud international telephone calls Not ideal if you are on business In this day and age charging for wifi is a blatant money making racket which lowered my opinion of this hotel considerably So I moved to Le Meridien for the rest of my holiday , This hotel is located opposite Landstrasse train station into which trains from the airport arrive Very little schlepping later and your luggage will be whisked away by the very attentive bellboy as soon as you walk through the door It is then a minute walk to the Stadtpark Vienna s city park and a further 5 to 10 minute walk to St Stephens cathedral the very heart of the city The staff are friendly and helpful The gym is small but functional with most of the equipment one might expect The room was clean and spacious I didn t have breakfast as at 31 Euros you can enjoy a full evening meal for 2 in Vienna no need to pay that much for breakfast 
268726,Hilton Vienna, There was nothing I didn t like , Very central location easy walk to everything in the old centre of Vienna Concierge was very helpful breakfast deal was great if taken up on check in which we did 
268727,Hilton Vienna, There is no smoking area or balcony in the room It is a strong 4 stars but I ve seen better 5 star hotels , Perfect breakfast with big choice of food pleasant staff 
268728,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Large standard room with comfortable bed and bathroom Hotel is very central few setps away from the train to the airport CAT and 15 minute walk to the canal boardwalk and the cathedral I was given a quite room as I had requested The check out was done under a minute 
268729,Hilton Vienna, After checkout When I told one of the staff that I forgot some of my stuff in the room and asked if he could help check he seemed really impatient , Locate is so convenient Room really huge and comfortable Wonderful stay
268730,Hilton Vienna, Bed was disaster they put me in the room with unconfortable split connected bed My girlfriend birthday on 13 05 was ruined what else to say Internet access was not properly explained and I had to call several times to get access , Concierge service great guys with lots of experience
268731,Hilton Vienna, There was a bit cold in our suit I asked the staff to check the heating system and the answer was that the heating AC system is out of order in the hotel First we got an electric radiator after that we got a new room with the same temperature No heating in a five star hotel It s a joke not recommended,No Positive
268732,Hilton Vienna, From tme to time it became very crowded as big tour groups arrived but I understand it is good business It would have been nice to be slightly closer to the city centre where all the restaurants bars and galleries are , The hotel is clean and the staff were friendly and helpful Everyone spoke English The room was spacious and the beds are very very comfortable with good quality linen Loved the ironing facility in the room Breakfast is unbelievable I have never seen such s spread anywhere and everything was fresh and delicious A good walk to city centre but across the road is the red bus stop Very convenient and tickets can be bought at the hotel 
268733,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, This is a lovely hotel next to a pretty park Though we didn t have any meals the room was lovely The staffordable were very helpful and friendly It was in an easy location 
268734,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The location is great with easy access to the center of Vienna within walking distance Hotel facilities are good especially the breakfast Remember to join Hilton program for free WIFI 
268735,Hilton Vienna, It is not a 5 star hotel I have booked on a discounted rate but still it doesn t worth it The staff were pretty rude and I believe specially since i booked through booking and asked them if i will get points on my HHonors account they have treated me as a second class guest The bathroom needs a renovation even in executive floor the carpets are messy in the city that you have public fast free wifi in the middle of the city in museum quartier s huge open space it is a shame to charge for a pretty hard to get wifi I am sure that I wont stay in this hotel again unless it is heavily discounted again For the same price you have many other more interesting options in town unless the proximity to the Train station to airport is a must for you , Access to the hotel is pretty easy it s easy to find and it s both close enough to the center to walk and far enough to not have the noise like almost all Hiltons the real estate was perfectly chosen It is after all a Hilton take a photo and no one can tell which city you are in 
268736,Hilton Vienna, The stuff was rude and unfriendly and the fact that the room fee doesn t include anything The overall experience it very affected by the behavior of the stuff which disrupted the comfort during our stay ,No Positive
268737,Hilton Vienna, the worst thing ever is when we chicked in there were no staff to take the bags and luggage to the rooms we had to take a troley by ourselves and take the bags to the rooms i think it is shame on hilton group for this to happen second there is no parking to park a car and if you need a parking you have to pay 38 euro each day wich is tooooo expensive third for chick out we had to call the reception 4 times to send someone to take the luggage and we had to wait 30 mints and we were late to reach airport because of bad facilities the hotel has forth in chick out the staff told us there is an error in the system and we had to wait 20 mints to chick out and we were in harry to reach the airport I dont recomend this hotel at all and I will not stay there again,No Positive
268738,Hilton Vienna, The air conditioning didn t work properly the hotel provided us with two large oil filled heaters it took a couple of hours before the temperature increased to an acceptable level however the hotel apologised and brought a selection of chocolates to our room , Everything was good in this hotel the room was spacious the staff very friendly and helpful breakfast was amazing with a fresh omelette maker 10mins walk from the centre
268739,Hilton Vienna, Wi fi could ve been made complimentary since it was too slow for 10 Euros , The breakfast buffet was really nice which includes an espresso machine Location wise was fantastic since it s right next to the Wien Mitte Landstrasse train subway station Shops were within walking distance Would definitely stay here next time 
268740,Hilton Vienna, I Asked by booking com reservation Connecting rooms and emptying the mini bar but that was not happen in arriving day because there is no linked between the hotel system and booking com system which means if you have additional requirements in your reservation it will not be feasible because it would not reach the hotel this is a mistake of booking com that what the hotel stuff explain to me, location
268741,Hilton Vienna, Twin beds are not comfortable The breakfast has a lot of varieties but one must be careful to the halal status This is important in a city with multiple cultures and a hotel with a lot of Arab and moslem guests The need to reconnect to the Internet in the lobby several times daily No free lnternet in the room One bar of soap and one small shampoo tube daily unlike before 2 of each The standard room is relatively small , Good location very close to the train and subway stations and not far from many attractions Friendly staff although one of them was not very keen to change the twin bed room to a double bed room 
268742,Hilton Vienna, Given twin instead of a double bed, Excellent central position near to Wien Mitte and convenient for airport and city centre Very good breakfast comfy bed and professional staff
268743,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Super friendly Staff a very special thanks to the house keeping folks who went out of their way to help us as my kid fell sick Excellent location next to Wien Mitte and you can take a CAT train directly to Airport Opp to Stadpark 
268744,Hilton Vienna, hotel room was VERY humid and stuffy and when I called reception they advised the air conditioning system was not switched on due to it being the winter season so there was nothing they could do about it , Concierge was very friendly and helpful and location of the hotel was very convenient right opposite the train station 
268745,Hilton Vienna, The air conditioning was not operating during our week long stay in March It was not possible to cool our first room satisfactorily by opening the window even though outdoor temperatures were in the 0 5 degrees Celsius range We appreciated being moved to a corner room where cross ventilation made the room comfortable , The breakfast was very good 
268746,Hilton Vienna, HHonors card for free Wifi is not accepted if hotel booked over booking com free Wifi available lobby but didn t work for some internet sites we needed We went two times the wellness area in order to ask the pricelist for massages but unfortunately there was neither a receptionist nor offer lists available It would be great to simply put a pricelist in the rooms , Good hotel which we would recommend and choose again when visiting Vienna Some minor points could be improved like in every hotel but definitely a good place to stay to eat 
268747,Hilton Vienna, On the last third night of our stay there was extreme noise in the corridor from 10 p m to 1 a m The corridor was full of young boys and girls When I called the reception they said that there was a performance at the hotel and the room next to us were given to the performers young boys and girls They offered us to change our room at midnight however we did not accept as we would check out the next day This was really a bad experience on the last night of our stay The performance should have been organized such that the guests of the hotel would not have been affected or bothered , Breakfast was excellent 
268748,Hilton Vienna, they were rude rejecting a hilton honor club membership because i did book the hotel from bookimg com further they charge horrible internet connection this is the city probably you pay extra for internet only at hilton room plus the interior decoration and corridors are leftover from 70s, worst hilton experience i ever had i am a hilton honor gold member they did refused my membership value since i booked the hotel through booking com they charge extra for internet connection at the room 1 3 rd of the room price 
268749,Hilton Vienna, We booked first a double room it was not clean and smells cigerate the bathroom is too small and the bathroom then we booked the park suite it was amazing but the shower was broken, Beds park suite mini bar location
268750,Hilton Vienna, They make you pay for WiFi And it s 10 per day And that s for the slow version that lets you open emails and loads websites very slowly The proper version is 25 a day The staff are very apologetic about this and know that it s incredibly odd WiFi is free in the lobby the slow version , Excellent location Very good breakfast buffet with made to order eggs and waffles A classic hotel stay
268751,Hilton Vienna, The cleaning is not to Hilton standards Also how come they don t put water in the rooms cuz it s a normal room all the rooms are in Hilton , Location and breakfast is very good
268752,Hilton Vienna, it was an average Hilton hotel the lobby is much more impressive than the room the coffee supplied in the rooms were was very average and there were not enough toiletries , Location of the hotel was fantastic 
268753,Hilton Vienna, They are forcing people to sit in lobby with free wifi only in lobby strategy and trying to earn money from the lobby bar through extreme prices , Location
268754,Hilton Vienna, bad value for money got to pay even for wi fi poor facilties spa was weak, the breakfast was pretty good and the location close to the first district of wien
268755,Hilton Vienna, The staff was not very helpfull especially the lady at the time of check in We had requested inter connecting rooms as we had young kids with us first she said she has none as hotel is full Then she gave us rooms which were not even next to each other on 8th floor I was like what is going on than I was a little stern and than she gave us an interconnecting room but said it is not ready and need to come at 3 pm This she could have clearly said at the beginning Not a way to treat family on New Year s Eve , The location was amazing 
268756,Hilton Vienna, We were looking forward to getting a drink at the executive lounge but were horrified to see it was standing room only with way too many people packed into the room There were no glasses available and we would have had to wait until some had been washed So we left On a positive note we complained at reception and were offered a free drink at the bar downstairs , The room was big and the bed comfy It was my daughter s birthday and they brought a cake to our room which was a lovely gesture 
268757,Hilton Vienna, The air conditioning kept the room too hot The maintainance guy couldn t help but put the air conditioning off and open the windows, The location and the friendly staff 
268758,Hilton Vienna, Unforunaitly our small kids make some painting on the leather chair and they force us to pay the whole amount of new chair which is not fare whike they f cleaning the chairshould chararge us the cost o, The location of the hotel is excellent
268759,Hilton Vienna, Rooms were a bit dated however staff advised that hotel had planned for rooms to be completely refurbished , Wonderful and excellent staff especially in the Restaurant for breakfast Great location and good rooms with all amenities 
268760,Hilton Vienna, Hilton does not honor its Honors memberships for customers who book through this site Members receive no points for nights stayed are charged a minimum 10 euro day for the overpriced wifi service and are told that Hilton only recognizes their program s members when they book directly This inhospitable policy is discouraging to anyone who likes to quickly review and compare their options and make quick hassle free reservations Banners throughout the hotel proudly display Hilton s promises to give all the benefits to new members while treating long term members who made reservations through this web site as less than desired guests , Next to the city center train station and mall the location is very convenient to the entire city 
268761,Hilton Vienna, The room amenities and decoration seemed a bit outdated and outworn , The hotel is near a train stop it is easy to get from the airport Also the fitness facilities were great 
268762,Hilton Vienna, We booked through Booking com not directly with the hotel but our request for an additional bed for our young son didn t get to Housekeeping so we had to wait for his bed to arrive We weren t initially given access to the Executive Lounge which was supposed to be in our booking Staff dealt with these problems efficiently though , The view of St Stephen s Cathedral from our room was beautiful The room was clean and the bed was wonderfully comfortable It was also located just across the street from the cat station so we travelled from the airport direct to the hotel by train in less than 20 minutes 
268763,Hilton Vienna, Nil, Good location Easily accessible to city center and other attractions Metro and supermarket was just across the hotel Staff were friendly and helpful Had a junior suite good size on the second floor facing the road but it was very quiet and the bed is comfortable 
268764,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Location is perfect Most of the famous sights are a walking distance away Hotel facilities are excellent The hotel lobby is warm and comfortable Rooms are clean And oh the daily breakfast YUM my The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful Special shout out to Edgardo thank you so much for everything Hilton Vienna is truly an award winning hotel Highly recommended x
268765,Hilton Vienna, We were told upon registration that we could not get wifi but only in the lobby The next day we discovered that we could get it from the concierge, We had an issue with the booking and it was solved very smoothly with the staff
268766,Hilton Vienna, Very slow service in the lobby desk both check in and check out Cups and plates were a little bit dirty in the breakfast restaurant , Good breakfast Good location Clean room Air handling system in the room pleasantly quiet 
268767,Hilton Vienna, 9 euro for a 1 minute phone call from the room , Great location in Central Vienna with easy access from the airport via the train 12 euro one way 25 mins duration runs every 15 minutes Bed was very comfortable and the hotel was typically Hilton 
268768,Hilton Vienna, Internet should be free and available no matter what Breakfast should be included at that price I will not look for Hilton again The smaller hotels give better services , Location
268769,Hilton Vienna, staff is not pleasant at all especially reception and concierge, great location and very convenient right next to cat train from to airport and at same time in the center of the city
268770,Hilton Vienna, I m really pissed that Hilton would not recognize my HHonors status or credit the stay to the program because the booking was through booking com, Location is perfect right by the city and the express airport train 
268771,Hilton Vienna, Hotel staff very rude and unhelpful when dealing with heating cooling issue and wifi issue Nothing was resolved Was told to go open window , Location 
268772,Hilton Vienna, The Hotel was overcrowded We had to wait for the breakfast room to get a free table There were too many people around the foods The breakfast room was too small relative to the number of people having breakfast The choice was not as good as one would expect to be in a Hilton hotel Considering the overall quality the price was too high In Vienna there are as good hotels or even better than this one on a much lower price , Excellent location 
268773,Hilton Vienna, only good experiences thank you , We have stayed in Hilton hotels in other countries and feel comfortable with choosing the Hilton brand as our expectations of overall top quality service in all aspects have always been met 
268774,Hilton Vienna, I could not get a good nights sleep due to the heat of the room on any of the four nights there as the air conditioning was not available to turn on When I requested at reception that they send up a maintenance man to rectify this I was told it is Autumn They suggested they would send someone up to turn off the unit completely and open the window I told them I had done this and that this did not solve the problem , Just across the road from the train station to the airport
268775,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Very wide room very clean and comfortable bed breakfast amazing location is wonderful very close to shopping streets by walking also metro train and bus stations are one minute walking even transportation to airport no place like it
268776,Hilton Vienna, All facilities in the bathroom were for only 1 person no slippers We used our slippers which disappeared on the second day together with a portion of nuts which we decided to leave in the room They did not give us a new pair of slippers On the third day cleaning lady started to knock our door already at 8 am On top of that there s no free wifi in the rooms 24 25 euros per day I think this is the only place left in the whole world with no free wifi for the clients , Spacious room iron tea coffee facilities comfortable location

268781,Hilton Vienna, Concierge could be more proactive We choose a tour Night Tour that was not very appealing , Hotel cleanliness the Breakfast and general attitude of the staff 
268782,Hilton Vienna, Omitted to clean room on one day Refused late checkout despite having requested and Genius Status Forced to have breakfast with conference group even though booked and paid seperately Terrible attitude of guest services , Some of the staff were friendly 
268783,Hilton Vienna, Wish the WiFi was included for a hotel of this calibre would have expected that Breakfast was also expensive but there were plenty of options nearby , Fantastic location 16min CAT Train ride from the airport easy 8 10 min walk to Stephensplatz cathedral and central part of town or you can take the metro for 2 stops The hotel is surrounded by grocery stores and all the essentials for an easy breakfast coffee meal at a reasonable cost Friendly staff with very comfortable rooms As a tip buy your Mozart chocolates at the grocery store nearby instead of downtown they are packaged the same and cost 33 less great for gifts We will stay here again when visiting Vienna
268784,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The hotel was so central for everything shops and transport right outside the door We drove to Vienna and managed to park our car in the underground car park at the hotel although it did not belong to them You could buy a ticket for a weeks stay for 100euros which was far less than what you would pay at the car park very good value 
268785,Hilton Vienna, Not too friendly a hotel Some time you feel as they have done a favor by letting you to stay in their hotel Car parking charges Euro 34 Room WiFi is against payment It is really shame for such a large chain of hotels was picking each penny from their eye lashes They refused to give me my HHonr points as i booked my hotel through Booking Com Hilton never informed me as a member in their dozen of email every month they are sending to market their product , Location breakfast powerful lobby wifi

268787,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, Good location It took 15 minutes to walk to the centre of town but there was excellent public transport if you wanted it The park opposite the hotel was beautiful 
268788,Hilton Vienna, The rooms are too old the bathrooms have only tubs and no standup showers the hotel management should consider upgrading the rooms, The spacious lobby and the location
268789,Hilton Vienna, the free part of the internet is hardly usable and does not work in the rooms A visit to the previous century Surprisingly clean water much more difficult to produce and distribute to all rooms was for free , location parking facility staff friendliness breakfast
268790,Hilton Vienna, It is a shame that free wifi was only available in the lobby which was packed with other guests at all times and not extended also in the rooms Reception staff should be better trained Busy area and hotel guests were less than quiet , The room was very clean and comfortable We appreciated the choice of tv channels 
268791,Hilton Vienna,No Negative, The hotel is perfectly positioned next to the City Park only 10 15 min by foot from Graben Opera and all other attractions Many restaurants nearby and easy access from to the airport both subway and taxi For local movements a taxi stand just outside of the entrance to the hotel Very friendly and accommodating staff overall excellent price to quality ratio for what we paid
