68998,Hilton London Euston, Rooms very small street noise shower was very small and there was a blue led light in the bathroom so I couldn t see properly No answer when ringing front desk and no answer when ringing room service , Comfortable bed staff friendly good food at restaurant good location property seemed clean nice flatscreen TV 
68999,Hilton London Euston, Chiming from a local clock every 15mins but even this seemed to cease during the early hours , Staff were lovely breakfast had a good selection room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable Easy access to all amenities perfect for our requirements 
69000,Hilton London Euston, The receipetionest on the night that I check in the service of the staff is not friendly and not welcoming Secondly the receipetionest double check in me which mean he checked in me with a room that have another guest Moreover when I checked in my room is on the 5th floor but due to the renovation so I have to take the stairs the problem here is that I m having a lot of luggages with me it isn t the receipetionest should call a concerge to help me out But he didn t I have to ask for it Over the facilities of the hotel it s fine However staffs training it s still needed to be improve to match with the brand This disappointed me a lot , The cleaness of the room and the bed is comfortable The concerage guy is nice and helpful 
69001,Hilton London Euston, It was very noisy at the property Workmen were doing drilling and renovations right outside the breakfast room The sound made us leave rather than enjoy the breakfast offerings because it was so loud The hotel really should have asked the workmen to begin work in that particular area after breakfast service I understand that renovations need to be undertaken but more care should be taken in relation to guest comfort It was disappointing that nothing was listed on the booking com website or the Hilton website itself about the renovations taking place , The bed was comfortable and the room clean The wifi was strong and all of the staff members were lovely and welcoming The location being so close to Euston Station was absolutely brilliant 
69002,Hilton London Euston, Reception staff seem to have problems booking people in ie couldn t find our name and told us we weren t booked in before checking system properly Not just us Also front rooms seem to have too much traffic noise, Location cleanliness
69003,Hilton London Euston, Broken amenities in bathroom reported and not fixed we stayed in same room 4 days apart Male staff member on reception whom we encountered both stays was really rude and unhelpful Porter watched us struggle with bags up front stairs but didn t help, Beds and pillows so comfortable
69004,Hilton London Euston, Staff and room, Got shouted at at man in gray suit after staying there for three weeks when repairs were being made on my property concierge man diabolical behaviour from a staff member so left he even spat at me
69005,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, Breakfast was good although Tea was weak as it always is in hotels i just expected the Hilton to get that right never mind the overall stay was fantastic
69006,Hilton London Euston, Gym wasn t available , Very close to Euston Station rail and underground Staff all very helpful Comfortable bed Quiet Stayed at back of hotel Breakfast everything you could want 
69007,Hilton London Euston, My MAJOR problem with this hotel was that the wifi in my room only worked in a small corner close to the door This meant I had to work at the desk and type emails and do my business and then take my laptop and stand in the small corner until all my emails sent and updates were done Reception suggested I move to another room but that room was smaller with no work desk and really not what I paid for I specifically chose this hotel because it has a gym Nowhere on their website or in the hotel it shows that the gym is out of order but only when i changed and actually went to the gym there was a notice on the door Both these issues gave me such a bad impression of Hilton Euston London , It was very easy to travel from this location and the hotel seems to have a good standard at first glance and seems to be in line with other 4 star accommodation I liked the room and found it clean crisp and ideal with a desk to do work when I needed to 
69008,Hilton London Euston, The baggage man was rude asking us to find a better hotel in Mayfair just because we said it is a small room Be careful with the entrance 5 steps of stairs which you can not enter with your baby stroller Painting smell made me not sleep coughing no view to the street with small opening window Wifi is with fee costy hotel with no wifi access no nespresso machine even in Delux room only one elevator lift ,No Positive
69009,Hilton London Euston, Food drink in Bistro expensive, Good selection at breakfast Beds comfortable Handy when travelling by train from Kings Cross Euston or St Pancreas Train Stations
69010,Hilton London Euston, No staff at reception when I arrived queuing to get into breakfast Something strange about the bed the mattress felt cold and damp so I was shivering during the night, Just a walk to Covent garden Leicester Square Picadilly etc 
69011,Hilton London Euston, If I had to be picky I would say the room could do with being a little bit bigger , I was impressed by how well sound proofed the windows were We were on the ground floor near the road and I was expecting to hear the traffic noise but it was nice and peaceful With the exception of an occasional police siren which you would hear on any floor Great location Was great being able to get the train to Euston on a Friday night and just walk across the road to the hotel Very handy for the tube and only a few stops to most of the main sights Staff Friendly and polite also held our luggage for us after check out which was a big help 
69012,Hilton London Euston, I decided to eat an evening meal at the hotel as my family were coming to meet me there It was not good at all I would not choose to eat there again The food quality was very poor , The room was small which was alright as I was on my own 
69013,Hilton London Euston, Fitness centre wasn t usable as under construction apparently Rooms extremely noisy outside traffic No parking Tiny rooms No bath , Great breakfast great location comfortable bed 
69014,Hilton London Euston, We had first been given a room that was already occupied by other guests and just imagine the embarrassment walking into someone else s room in the middle of the night No apologies or explanation was made by the hotel staff Then our credit card got charged twice and we still haven t received our refund Having paid 250 per night for a room for 7 nights I expected better than this ,No Positive
69015,Hilton London Euston, We requested a twin room 2 weeks in advance When we arrived we were told that there wasn t one available The shower was poor Overall quite disappointing for the price ,No Positive
69016,Hilton London Euston, Tea and coffee are average and need more milk in rooms , Staff very friendly and helpful location is fantastic with Kings Cross Station 7 mins Walk away Room service very good 
69017,Hilton London Euston, Whether it was because I booked through booking com I dont know but quality of room for a Hilton was poor The room I was allocated room 82 I think is next to cleaners store room they have no issues with slamming the hoovers out in the morning around 7am The bathroom was completed to a poor standard the shower screen didnt have a seal so water ran to the floor areas of skirting had paint drips from the walls Just looked and felt like a cheap hotel TV remote didnt work bulb out in lamp etc , The room was modern
69018,Hilton London Euston, I cannot think it was all great , Beautifull hotel in a great location breakfast was delicious and the presence of the chef who regularly checked the food was nice to see Friendly helpful staff and spotless comfortable rooms On arrival the staff member who dealt with check in was incredible helpful and went over and beyond to help me with an issue 
69019,Hilton London Euston, Although the wifi was free the signal was weak and iratic Hopefully once the renovation is complete it will improve , Rooms and beds were very comfortable and the lounge and bar were warm and inviting Room service was delicious and the staff were friendly and efficient Will definitely stay again 
69020,Hilton London Euston, There were some improvements taking place which were a bit noisy on Sunday morning However it wasnt so bad , The hotel was perfectly located close to Euston station With a lovely pizza resteraunt a stones throw away It was perfect for us
69021,Hilton London Euston, Just not the standard you d expect for What I paid I ve stayed at better budget hotels with free unlimited wifi and better options and breakfast Will stay at a travelodge next time , The bed was comfy 
69022,Hilton London Euston, Room was way too small in the eves on the 4th floor The hotel was mid way through renovations and all seemed to be a mess Way too expensive under those circumstances , The bed was comfy 
69023,Hilton London Euston, BUT THE BATHROOM WAS A BIT SMALL AND ALSO THE BED WAS CRAMPED WITH ACCESS ONLY ONE SIDE On arrival our room was full of luggage but this was quickly sorted out and we found it quite comfortable although we had to ring for milk with the tea coffee in the Room , WE REALLY ENJOYED THE BREAKFAST BEST THING ABOUT THE STAY THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND ALL THE STAFF VERY HELPFUL AND PLEASANT EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL Loved the way they offered us extra Pancakes and served delicious Waffles at the Table too The Bacon was a little overcooked though A reasonable price for Central London The Area is very historic and interesting 
69024,Hilton London Euston, The hotel is extremely noisy as there is building work going on that we wasn t aware of so every morning we was woken up before 8 00 am, Staff were nice and welcoming
69025,Hilton London Euston, Room quite small for a family the bed was not comfy and a humming noise all night kept us awake The children had a sofa bed It was expensive for what we had , Nothing much 
69026,Hilton London Euston, I see no reason in this day and age why there should be a cost for WiFi It s a necessity for foreign travellers and you can t tell me the Hilton can t afford to wear the cost , Location was great
69027,Hilton London Euston, Room was located on the ground floor next to external bins So was rather noisy Not happy with the fact that people were conducting business meetings in the lounge when you re trying to enjoy a relaxing drink and was subjected to loud conversation of which are of no interest to me , The bed was comfortable but room could have been larger
69028,Hilton London Euston, I prepaid for the stay but they blocked my debit card by 150 without informing me thus not allowing me to withdraw from my account It could have been very embarrassing if I had used my card in a retails place and it were rejected ,No Positive
69029,Hilton London Euston, Hidden charges Got charged 50 for room service even though I never used it only to be told it ll get refunded in a week , Good bed Nice clean room 
69030,Hilton London Euston, Except the location everything is very bad Also it is very noise in the morning Lift cannot be used since Last year October until now hv no diea when it can be used , Location
69031,Hilton London Euston, would have liked a window which had an external view but that was our only negative, Food seemed to be fresh and not sitting too long under a lamp great choice as well staff were very good especially in the bar everything was spotless and our room was ready early
69032,Hilton London Euston, Noise was very bad Lots of street noises Would be worthwhile to invest in triple paned windows for the rooms facing the street , The desk staff was fantastic Very helpful allowed me early checkin and held my baggage until my room was available 
69033,Hilton London Euston, How close it was to the main road but not hotels fault it s nice for booking as constantly hearing sirens but that s London Didn t wake me up though 3 for a glass of coke in the bar should of had half a lager was cheaper but I am used to northern prices , Bed was comfy sunk right into it
69034,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, This was a last minute stay as we had to change from a flight from Southampton to a train from St Pancras for a New Year s break The hotel was picked for its location as a very easy walk to the international station It was clean comfortable and after a stressful day caused by fog cancellations and travel plans going horribly wrong we were very happy with our accommodation for the night 
69035,Hilton London Euston, The room is too small For the money I have paid I was expecting something just a bit more The internet free wifi was very slow Also the concierge did not answer to my phone call from the room I spent 15 20 minutes near the phone to ask a question It repeated not once seems that they have shortage in workers The breakfast was very poor standard poor quality english breakfast In addition the location is not good it is just on the road it does not have any bay for cars to drive in Was very difficult to catch a taxi because in front of the hotel the taxi could not stop by the law I did not like my stay at that hotel whereas I have paid a lot of money , The bathroom was very spacious and comfortable 
69036,Hilton London Euston, Very cold in the restaurant people were moving their food into the bar area because l was so cold in the restaurant l did not finish my food even that was cold , Very good location great breakfast clean
69037,Hilton London Euston, Rude staff when I asked why my account was charged 100 I wasn t informed this money would be taken Construction work on a Sunday morning and not once was I contacted informing me of this work I would have booked another hotel Kept up a lot of the night by the lift saying going up going down Poor hotel wouldn t expect to pay 100 for two nights never mind 300 , Good location for Euston tube
69038,Hilton London Euston, The entrance was dated and need renovation Gym was not available for use during our stay Quality of bathroom products was poor Wifi was poor and found the breakfast option very expensive , Excellent location Rooms were clean and well taken care of 
69039,Hilton London Euston, Most of it Staff were rude Bathroom was dirty and fixture were dangerous, The heater didnt work hair in bathroom bathroom fan just sat in the hole in the wall not secured in staff finished there chatting before serving me and also bathroom light flickered
69040,Hilton London Euston, When I checked in at 00 20 there was no one on the desk and no bell to ring for attention When the member of staff did eventually arrive I found him a little surly The staff in the morning were much friendlier and more helpful though , I loved that the single room had a single bed and that I was not charged for a double twin room as is usually the case The layout of the room was excellent and the bed was super comfortable
69041,Hilton London Euston, Some work on the outside of the hotel scaffolding was up workmen wandering Didn t hear too much noise but it would have been nice to have been notified , Breakfast was great excellent choice of foods quality ingredients Room was very clean and the bed was large comfy 
69042,Hilton London Euston, The Doors to the Bathroom WC in our room needs some repair you can hardly close or open them from inside the Bathroom unless you lift it up which i regard it to be very heavy even for 186cm Athletic like me , Customer care was good quick and tried to offer alternatives All Staff members were very polite and kind Specially the Concierge was very watchfull and forthcoming Thank you Sir 
69043,Hilton London Euston, Ground floor room was a little noisy Stayed at this hotel before and always been 2 3rd floor and slept a lot better , Staff very friendly in the bar all rooms very nice 
69044,Hilton London Euston, Front of house staff poor Very rough round edges Building work going on, When I told them I was working late and would not need breakfast as would be asleep to put me in a room next to the building work was terrible For a Hilton the level of service and state of the place was not 4 star If it was a franchise property not Hilton owned they simply wouldn t pass brand standards Not impressed at all and the staff blamed me for not telling them about it the night before when the building work didn t start until the morning Then offered me a free breakfast after breakfast was finished I should have suspected something when I checked in a couple came down saying they d been checked into a room that someone was in 
69045,Hilton London Euston, Prices for coffee in the lounge was as expensive as a pint of Guinness , Was perfect location we visited so we could get around to various areas Hyde park oxford street Camden etc and as this is located next to the station links are very easy and perfect for getting about even if you wanted to get on the tour bus stopped right outside 
69046,Hilton London Euston, Air conditioning was not working and the room was incredibly stuffy and very hot The maintenance chap tried to fix but it didn t work was too hot to sleep , The new decor 
69047,Hilton London Euston, Loud building works, The location is great and the rooms have been recently refurbished and are very comfortable However there are very loud building works in the hotel which means no peace in the afternoon and they woke us up at 8am on Sunday so no lie in 
69048,Hilton London Euston, Coffees expensive food choices in the bar limited We were lucky to get food at 10 15 pm after the theatre so that was a bonus , Great choice for breakfast room was very comfortable lovely bathroom only criticism is the towels need drying in the tumble dryer to fluff them up A very enjoyable stay and would stay there again Location perfect for our stay 
69049,Hilton London Euston, No control over the heating in my room Concierge not always available Refurbishment taking a very long time , Comfortable location handy for British Museum and British Library Breakfast is good and time extended at weekends 
69050,Hilton London Euston, Nothing, My husband and I stayed here for the night before his heart operation and were desperate for a good night s sleep The room was lovely and the beds were so comfy that we just couldn t help but drop off to sleep which was just what we needed Food in the bar was excellent too 
69051,Hilton London Euston, Tiny shower with little water pressure no bath The tv didn t have a remote control which they remedied quite quickly Though part of our room service was fries and onion rings we weren t offered or given any sauces In the scheme of things these aren t a huge deal but you d expect a higher standard from a Hilton especially considering the price tag , Great location very comfortable bed 
69052,Hilton London Euston, Was a fairly noisy area of the hotel that I stayed in and was disturbed a number of times late at night by loud doors and other guests , Liked location and Friendly Staff
69053,Hilton London Euston, I paid a lot of money for 1 night to be very dissapointed by the level of noise on Sunday morning I knew there was refurbishment going on in the hotel however I didn t know that I would be getting the room right underneath all the drilling and renovating On a Sunday to be woken at 8am by drilling was not nice and plus this was a surprise for my other half so I was a little embarrassed If there was a money back guarantee I would be asking for a full refund , I loved the breakfast choice in the morning and the closeness of the hotel to the station
69054,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, Very good location Great size room with a very comfortable bed Quiet and in the center of things at the same time Polite and friendly staff ensuring that we had everything we needed 
69055,Hilton London Euston, I didn t think the reception staff were very friendly or welcoming Yet the breakfast staff were totally different and could not do enough for you,No Positive
69056,Hilton London Euston, Too much noise could be heard from neighbours and people chatting on the corridor the windows in our room weren t double glazed so the noise of blue light sirens disturbed us throughout night It was also quite cold as the heating wasn t on but I think this is due to ongoing building work , Beautiful room comfy beds Lovely staff
69057,Hilton London Euston, At check in the staff member seemed a little disinterested so wasn t overly enthusiastic at checking , I had stayed at this hotel before but since then seems like the rooms have been refurbished or are a lot more modern or maybe I got a better room this time Very nice d cor and the bed was very comfortable It is situated close to St Pancreas station so very convenient if you have just come off the Eurostar 
69058,Hilton London Euston, Cooked breakfast was poor Arriving for breakfast at 9am on a Friday morning there were no eggs left no baked beans no bread selection and the bacon had been under the heat lamp that long we couldn t physically cut it with a knife I would expect these basic items to be readily available without having to ask staff I notified reception that morning to receive little interest Very disappointing ,No Positive
69059,Hilton London Euston, As they are undergoing upgrading works the lift was not working Breakfast is pretty good but I do expect a little more from Hilton , The bed was very comfy The bedroom looks amazing Very well renovated Love the room 
69060,Hilton London Euston, On ground floor romm 94 very nosiey bin collection that seemed to go on a long time in the middle of the night I had requested a quite room Shower not great , Bed was very good Check in out very swift 
69061,Hilton London Euston, Longer cord for the hairdryer so it could reach the mirror , Very comfortable bed room size good Fabulous breakfast buffet This hotel exceeded my expectations after reading a few rather complaining reviews 
69062,Hilton London Euston, The curtains in my room did not really cover the windows as thoroughly as I would have liked they moved too freely on the rail were not big enough for this to make covering the window work And the tv did not work in my room I mentioned this to the staff in the morning it did not bother me enough to complain they made notes to get it fixed, The bed was soooo comfy And the staff were friendly efficient professional
69063,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, They windows are not isolated and we had the baby crib right to the window facing the street There wasn t a fireplace as showned on the pictures And the restaurant really needs a loving hand it looks horrible and old There should move the restaurant to the basement and have the breakfast served upstairs where there is light 
69064,Hilton London Euston, The bedroom was disappointing it was a disabled room so no bath The work desk didn t have a mirror so drying my hair and putting my makeup on was difficult as the mirror was in the bathroom nowhere near a socket It was also very hot the air con didn t work and there was no extractor fan in the bathroom Apart from that the room was very clean and the staff were very helpful , Breakfast was lovely location was perfect for what we wanted to do for the weekend 
69065,Hilton London Euston, lift did not work Senior manager needs to have a training on customer service and how to integrate with customers , rooms are very cosy Reception staff very helpful Breakfast is very good so is the restaurant staff 
69066,Hilton London Euston, No lift and no offer of compensation for trekking up 3 flights of stairs with luggage Room key card then didn t work when we got to room at night even though not been kept by mobile phone Breakfast staff were rude didn t acknowledge us until we asked to be sat down Didn t listen to our order so brought coffee not tea Cooked breakfast was cheap food that had sat for a long time and was one of worst hotel breakfasts id ever had Put us off hiltons, Room was nice
69067,Hilton London Euston, The lift was out of order and it was a real challenge to have to walk up and down the stairs my room was o The 4th floor and I m pregnant The stairwell area hadn t been refurbished like the rest of the hotel wasn t even particularly clean , Room and room decor was very nice Fairly recently refurbished 
69068,Hilton London Euston, Tired Not at all a Hilton in terms of ambience Carpets dirty tired Breakfast room very TravelLodge like , Comfy bed and quiet away from traffic but central location
69069,Hilton London Euston, Night receptionist was very rude and unhelpful We received the wrong room and he refused to help claiming the hotel was full and that what is it Funnily enough I could still book the exact same room over the Internet through the Hiltons direct website, Breakfast staff were lovely and was a good selection
69070,Hilton London Euston, breakfast selection can be improved or change Was charged extra for a cappuccino though in most Hilton it is all inclusive , room is clean and beds comfortable Check in was no issue and same for check out smooth overall the staff are friendly
69071,Hilton London Euston, I booked a double room for five days but I received a single room so small that we couldn t move in side the room The air conditioned does not work in almost all rooms I spent three days stewing me in a micro oven warm room After I have complained a lot they change us for four times until find a working aircon After complain a lot about the size when they put us in a very much smal room just could accommodate one person they show us a room bigger promised a room like that but put us in another very smal room Nevertheless many employes are from abroad I realized this hotel does not like very much foreign people If you are not a blond blue eye England person they will put you in a very smal micro oven warm wormy room The breakfast is worm with rotten fruits The service room bring us the worst meal that I ever have seen in all my life The pizza is fast food meal bought on the market of the corner The hand mad meat and rice from the menu is an absolut lie is ready food bought on the corner as well The elevator is broken for a long time ago for many months so guests have to use a very bad smelling fire stairs The hotel does not intend to fix the elevator it s hall is now just a dirty and messy deposit Finally Internet wifi is terrible does not work most part of time To be in this hotel is waste of money Don t you believe in it Try on it and after that put your opinion here I m gonna waiting , Only thing almost good is the location some minutes by walk from Euston Metro Station 
69072,Hilton London Euston, Elevator did not work for 2 days The corridors and the room were smelly They should air rate the place The windows were not sound proof so the noise from the street can be heared in the room There was a refrigerator in the room but it was empty except for 2 bottles of water So I have to go out get some snacks , concierge service was excellent
69073,Hilton London Euston, Dark room too warm With an early train to Europe I was offered a packed breakfast this was not ready and took far too long making me late The staff were most unhelpful The breakfast consisted of an apple an orange a dry roll and a childs fruit drink If that is your standard i hope i never find myself in a Hilton Hotel ever again again Certainly the worst and most expensive hotel in a 20 day rail journey from London to China, Nothing
69074,Hilton London Euston, The lift didnt work The air conditioning didnt work The room was too hot and the window would not stay open We could not have the room until 4pm instead of 3 which messed up our evening arrangements I would not return , It was very clean and well decirated
69075,Hilton London Euston, Rooms very small if one body have a seat another one have to be stand or seat on the bed Air conditioner does not work the room is like a oven Lift does not work guest have to use fire stairs , Staff very kindness but does not fix the problems 
69076,Hilton London Euston, The lift had broken down There was only one lift So it meant climbing up and down the stairs My travel agent contacted the hotel to book me an early morning transfer to Heathrow Airport The duty manager assured her it would be booked It was never booked Luckily I double checked and Kareem the concierge booked the transfer for me , Clean comfortable and closely situated to Euston St Pancras and Kings Cross Railway stations 
69077,Hilton London Euston, I wonder how this tiny hotel been given a rate of 4 star personally it should 2 star hotel Only facilities availabe is a small gym breakfast room is very worm with uncomfortable seating The rooms been refurbished but Aircon are not working in some rooms Very small reception area with very few seating plus that elevator are out of service The WiFi signal are very week that i couldn t use at all Unprofessional day manager with bad attitude Careless stuff totally waste of money to stay in this , The only good thing about this hotel is it s location which is a walking distance to Euston railway station underground 
69078,Hilton London Euston, Placed on third floor with no lift No apologies or forewarning and was very difficult for my husband who still recovering from major surgery , Room newly refurbished though small Breakfast staff very friendly and food good 
69079,Hilton London Euston, Wi fi is sooooo bad AC is difficult to manage drinks are expensive bad value for money booking name is wrong as all the information in the booking sheet, Location
69080,Hilton London Euston, The elevator was out of order and it was so difficult for me and my wife who has knees pain to climb the stairs to the 3rd floor twice and me 4 times The staff response looked like take it or leave it Very bad experience , Location
69081,Hilton London Euston, The shower and bath facility should be better , Excellent location just 5 min from Euston station Convenience to travel in Centric location Convenient yet quite spacious surrounding area 
69082,Hilton London Euston, The road traffic noise does get through into the room, We stayed in the King Deluxe The room was big and spacious The bed was very comfortable Bathroom was perfect just massive and spotless 
69083,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, We stayed last minute due to disruption with the trains Reception and housekeeping staff were extremely helpful Breakfast choice and quality was excellent 
69084,Hilton London Euston, Air conditioning and ventilation in the breakfast room was poor especially on a hot day , Service and welcome upon arrival Reception staff did their best to provide early check in and speedy check out 
69085,Hilton London Euston, Small room Lift not working noisy air con road noise wi fi charge breakfast excluded small uncomfortable bed old rough towels, Location staff welcome
69086,Hilton London Euston, Small bedroom but I get why in London, Trainee receptionist made sure I had a quiet room Evening meal head barman was very attentive and knew his stuff
69087,Hilton London Euston, The staff were not informative or helpful Our requests for quiet room were met with a placement right next to the building works of the hotel and when contacted regarding adjoining room door which meant no soundproofing no assistance given Our room also had an additional portable bed placed in it which was not requested and made the room completely small We reduced our stay from 5 to 1 night and would never return Substandard on all levels,No Positive
69088,Hilton London Euston, A little dated and no disabled or pushchair access to the entrance have to use stairs Undergoing refurbishment so maybe these points will be addressed , Breakfast was amongst the best I have ever had with freshly baked pastries omelettes waffles and pancakes made to order A few mins walk away from Euston Station so perfect location Friendly staff comfortable beds 
69089,Hilton London Euston, The concierge The prices at the bar The room service menu The size and outlook and air con in the rooms But this is an old building with old fashioned room sizes and outlooks Ask for one with an outlook not at the back , I have stayed at this hotel several times over 8 years It has had had a renovation and the bathrooms are lovely although I hate showers over a bath with a small glass screen The rooms are small but the beds are comfortable and linen good Some rooms are very small and have no air con and no outlook as the one we rented for a half day between a cruise and a flight home We were thankful to store luggage and for a shower etc but thankfully we were not in the room for more than an hour 85 We went to the zoo 10 min by cab Don t agree to rooms up the few stairs from reception 82 83 etc etc And I am a Hilton member We had stayed for 2 nights before the cruise and the room was ok although small with no outlook but breakfast was good and the staff friendly and obliging Also Euston station is 5 min walk I return here as I know what i m getting and no surprises and its a nice breakfast The drinks at the bar were expensive A pasta dish for my grandson from room service was fine but the menu limited The concierge as had experienced from the last visit was pathetic waited and waited for any attention and there was no offer of help with the luggage but being Australian I am happy to do it myself and then I save the tip 
69090,Hilton London Euston, Reception staff wernt very friendly on check in There was refurbishment going on that we were not told about prior to booking External noise is not very well blocked out and as a result didn t have the best of sleeps , Excellent location and very clean rooms Really comfy beds 
69091,Hilton London Euston, The ongoing renovation still brings some inconvenience elevator staircase In few weeks the work should be completed and then there is nothing left to complain , The rooms are renovated and the cleaning was always good All the staff was very friendly and responsive for any request The breakfast offers a nice variety tip try the Nutella muffin Location in front of Euston station British Museum Kings Cross and St Pancras only a few minutes away Many good restaurants in walking distances 
69092,Hilton London Euston, There s building going on meaning we used the staff lift and there were paper signs everywhere Thin Windows meaning we could hear everything on the road and not having us down initially for breakfast making us feel embarrassed , good choice at breakfast 
69093,Hilton London Euston, The building work that was underway but it didn t impact too much, The concierge was so friendly and helpful he should be commended and his efforts to make everyones stay enjoyable
69094,Hilton London Euston, Housekeeping entered room just after we arrived with no warning or knock on the door Long wait to be shown a table for breakfast and pit of tea never arrived , Friendly and helpful reception staff
69095,Hilton London Euston, Didn t know about having to use the temporary lift as the others were being renewed It was the slowest lift ever , The bed was amazingly comfy Newly refurbished room and bathroom was really nice
69096,Hilton London Euston, Very poor air con and very greasy breakfast on 2 nd day, Rooms were small air con was awful and renovations could be managed better 1 staff lift is not sufficient for guest numbers Great location the standard of breakfast varied from very good to very poor this seemed to be when different kitchen staff were on 
69097,Hilton London Euston, Room was on the small side though was immaculately clean, Great location having used Euston as my arrival and departure station Easy to get into central London
69098,Hilton London Euston, We had a room where the WiFi signal wasn t very good but other than that was a real experience thanks, Bed were very comfy and staff were pleasant Breakfast has a great range to choose from as well
69099,Hilton London Euston, Noisy but this is understandable due to the location The room was small and could have done with a full length mirror in the room Only mirror was in the bathroom ,No Positive
69100,Hilton London Euston, Nothing, Hotel was close to Euston station only 2 minutes walk away Camdon market was about 20 mintues walk Staff were very friendly helpful Excellent Indian restaurant straight across the road down a walk way Brilliant stay would recommend
69101,Hilton London Euston, Room we were in backed onto corridor and air con was not very good also had two fans in room which was noisy and circulating warm air, Staff very friendly Breakfast very nice
69102,Hilton London Euston, Other rooms being renovated so boxes and furniture against walls etc however difficult to do renovations with this and rooms are nice when finished but felt like I was in the way of the building works a little , Newly refurbished room very nice and clean Staff friendly food good Very good stay 
69103,Hilton London Euston, The hotel is currently undergoing refurbishment we were not informed of this A crane arrived to be set up at 7am on the Sunday morning the lifts in the hotel were also not working This should all be reflected in the price of the stay but was not and the hotel did not inform us that they were having a lot of work done at the time of booking , Breakfast was great
69104,Hilton London Euston, Too hot in room air conditioning seemed impossible to successfully operate despite staff help They brought a portable Unit but forgot to give it ice etc Also lifts taking ages to get fixed, Bar meal Breakfast
69105,Hilton London Euston, Well it starts from the extremely dry unwelcoming and somewhat rude front desk staff and the non existing concierge I would have at least expected someone to ask me if i needed help with my bags since i had to deal with 5 of them Now after checking in we had to wait for around 10 minutes in a somewhat hot reception to get the service elevator since the other 2 are under renovation Everytime it stoped it was full of either staff of workers When we finally reached our floor it smelt like a worksite some airfreshners would have been nice The room itself is nice but was located near an emergency exit that woke us up everytime it slammed when closing Later that day after comming back from a walk we were then greeted by boxes almost blocking the hallways and minibars on the floors in front of everyroom this was followed by a maintenance person knocking on my door to check if he could install the fridge May i just point out that he must have been the most polite employee i encountered during my stay as he apologized for the mess and inconvenience Anyways im glad i only booked this place for one night I understand hotels renovate and need to work around guest but a few smiles some signs in the service hallways and a bit of courtesy doesn t hurt , The bed was comfy
69106,Hilton London Euston, Airconditioning didn t work We asked them to look into it someone came up and told that it would take some time Well it took until I left the room and the temp was still 26 7 C, Breakfast was good 
69107,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, Great Location for Euston and easy to get everywhere Rooms recently renovated so everything clean and new Plenty of choice for breakfast Good value for money 
69108,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, The lobby staff were uncomfortably unhelpful and slightly rude This tarnished the experience for me as I ve stayed in many Hilton establishments prior and have never experienced this treatment The waiter and waitresses at breakfast were a different story however SO helpful polite and made us feel extra special and as though nothing was too much to ask for could do with passing some of this on to the desk lobby staff 
69109,Hilton London Euston, Ridiculous price for breakfast bags were lost and found damaged when held in the back office on day of leaving including a present in a box from Hamleys toy store ,No Positive
69110,Hilton London Euston, The hotel room was so hot that we had to use an electric fan so we didn t sleep very well, The bed was very comfy pillows lovely room and bathroom very clean Breakfast amazing with loads of choice
69111,Hilton London Euston, Only down side was due to refurbishments the restaurant wasn t open , Lovely and comfy Perfect stay for me and my hens Family room really spacious Very good breakfast 
69112,Hilton London Euston, The view from our room was of their gymnasium which was being renovated and was basically a construction site See my photo of our view from the deluxe double room There was no natural light in the room There was a problem checking in as they couldn t find my booking even though I d already paid in full Took around 20 uncomfortable minutes for them to find my booking About half an hour after I d been in my room two men entered saying that they had the room Shocked that they had a key card and were able to open the door Very concerned about safety and security after that As a result of all of this I didn t think it was acceptable for over 300 for just two nights , Breakfast was great Exactly what I wanted The location was great and the room was clean The room in itself was fine but let down by the many negatives 
69113,Hilton London Euston, The room we were given had been having problems with the air con temperature but we were given it regardless we didn t know this on arrival We put the temperature down and went out thinking it would be ok when we returned it wasn t We got back at midnight and it was still like a sauna called down and that was when the staff member said they had been having issues He gave us an option of a cool down unit opening the window and lots of fans or we could swap to the only room left in the hotel Luckily I was there with my sister and we shared a room with a king size bed but it really was very poor of the hotel to book this room out knowing it was faulty ,No Positive
69114,Hilton London Euston, Tv not working and receiption did nothing after being informed air con not working so room hotter than hell and view from window was a building site , Location was good and room seemed a decent standard 
69115,Hilton London Euston, The constant construction was terribly obnoxious and irritating The air conditioning in the rooms barely worked Also having to travel 5 blocks to the other Hilton hotel to use the gym as their s was undergoing construction that we were not aware of was annoying ,No Positive
69116,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, It was a nice comfortable clean room which was perfect for my needs as I was only sleeping there as my course finished late Lovely little touches such as bath robes slippers and water bottles were very welcome Breakfast was a wide range of hot and cold buffet which was tasty Staff were all pleasant and polite 
69117,Hilton London Euston, No hot water window at a construction place elevator didn t work room smells like sigaret bathroom for handicapped people wasn t comfortable,No Positive
69118,Hilton London Euston, Ice machine broke and despite our remarks to staff remained broken all our stay Not possible to lower temperature of the room Temperature control did not seem to work No bath in the room There were some renovation work going on whike we stayed there, Excellent location Good breakfast
69119,Hilton London Euston, Only small item was lack of dressing table area to sit at to dry my hair No mirror with a seat and pug socket made it difficult to style hair , The bed was extra comfy the room was spotless The extras like slippers we were given a free drink in the bar as we mentioned we were attending a wedding across the road 
69120,Hilton London Euston, Building work in progress so awakened by scaffolding falling at 8am on a Sunday morning Probably not the hotel s fault however as they tried their best to minimise the inconvenience , Good service in the breakfast room Very good service by the desk manager who arranged for a change of room when my wife hurt herself on the bathroom door jamb Also made sure we got a taxi for our return journey
69121,Hilton London Euston, Everything perfect , Great hotel where the staff caring and attentive Location couldn t be better so handy to be able to leave our suitcase in the hotel after checkout until we got our train home 
69122,Hilton London Euston, The room faced the high street which was noisy 24 7, Very nice newly refurbished room Very good quality Good location for Euston Camden bus links
69123,Hilton London Euston, Hotel was very shabby lifts not working lobby and rooms tired looking Requires a major refit to bring it up to a decent standard , Price was reasonable 
69124,Hilton London Euston, My room had no view only a rubbish tip that was dumped there works going on woke me up at 8am on the sat morning and when I asked about being moved it was refused, Bar staff were excalent as was the breakfasts but that s as far as it goes the rest of my stay there well let s just say I won t stay there again my view from my room was a rubbish dump full of carbourd and was a fire risk
69125,Hilton London Euston, There was construction going on from 8am so don t expect a lie in We were told breakfast was on until10 30 which it was not and we missed it even though we had paid Due to the construction the lifts were out of order therefore being on the fourth floor we had to use the staff lifts which came out to a aged staff sink which was leaking The hall way was old and dated I e the paint was peeling off the room door The water was turned off in the morning whilst in the shower Was unable to finish showering or brush our teeth We weren t notified of this No concierge offered Very unhappy with our experience You could get a better experience elsewhere for this price I e Travelodge, Location was good 
69126,Hilton London Euston, Very expensive for available facilities Small bedroom Very dimly lit room No desk or desk light to do work in the evening Traffic noise audible from outside No breakfast included for 240 night for 1 person No proper working elevator had to use service elevator Landing areas outside elevator untidy and in poor condition for such an expensive stay, Clean room
69127,Hilton London Euston, The room was cold The air con wasn t working The bathroom needed updating Service in the bar was poor Confusion over the booking , The room was clean and tidy 
69128,Hilton London Euston, Heating in the room did not work Room was very noisy as it was near the street despite having asked for a quiet room when booking Gym was closed for renovation not mentioned on booking com , Staff is very friendly and helpful
69129,Hilton London Euston, It was being renovated so corridors and were full of paint buckets and the room smelt of fresh plaster we weren t informed of this until we arrived, The breakfast was delicious
69130,Hilton London Euston, There is scaffolding around the whole front of the hotel and was still being erected when we got there pending what looks like a good deal of work I feel we should have been advised about this prior to the booking being confirmed and possibly a discount offered considering the potential for disruption The initial room we were given was a single room with a double bed This was promptly changed to a standard double hence the excellent rating for the staff and service level The food also is excellent but the need to use the service lift and ongoing work means the hotel itself is not currently up to the standard I would expect from a Hilton in the heart of London with the rates expected , The staff and level of service was excellent
69131,Hilton London Euston, Woken up by building work in the next door room at 7am Dangerous plug sockets In room , Had a late room service who was very polite and food not bad for a limited 24hr menu
69132,Hilton London Euston,No Negative, The room we had on the ground floor was one of the new revamped ones it was lovely and clean bed was really comfortable you just sank into it staff were fabulous food was lovely afternoon tea and bar snacks and the breakfast was just well all i can say is that you are spoilt for choice 
69133,Hilton London Euston, The Hotel is being fully refurbished and will not be finished until the summer so noise boarded up lifts and other affected facilities could be a real problem , We were given a refurbished room which was very comfortable and the staff were helpful and considerate 
69134,Hilton London Euston, There were NO plug sockets near the mirrors How can your guests style their hair after a shower if the hairdryer goes nowhere near the mirrors , The bed was really comfortable and the room was clean 
69135,Hilton London Euston, This hotel is currently undergoing a major refurbishment and should be avoided while this is underway The air conditioning had been switched off in my room and although a fan was supplied the room was stuffy and it was difficult to sleep I had to use a service elevator which was still being used for food deliveries etc The front of the building is covered in scaffolding which must raise security and privacy concerns While the refurbishment is under way much better idea to stay in the Ambassadors opposite or Premier Inn round the corner ,No Positive
69136,Hilton London Euston, there was nothing which I didn t like about the hilton , everything it is a fantastic place to stay the staff are eager to please polite and courteous the Hotel is spotlessly clean and well managed the bedroom was modern and bright with the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in the breakfast was 100 yum yum well done Hilton I look forward to seeing you again 
69137,Hilton London Euston, 1 Noisy from the street hotel maintenance work the church bells 2 The hotel is old building 3 There was maintenance work during my staying period in the hotel and supposedly the guest should be informed about that before check in date , location is nearby Eusten Station Regent Park 
69138,Hilton London Euston, It felt like I was sleeping in a wardrobe The room was badly shaped and sized There was a shelf had head height when laying down that I kept hitting my head on through the night It was dated and badly in need of renovation , The staff were very friendly and helpful the foyer was nice The room was clean and the bathroom a nice size It is being renovated 
69139,Hilton London Euston, The deputy manager Jeffery Hosegood was terrible and unnecessarily very catty an attitude to put me off going to the hotel ever again , The hotel it s self was a very good standard
69140,Hilton London Euston, drilling noise right above the bedroom at 8am The size of the room was not what I booked The refurb room upgrade was an insult and just smelt strongly of paint Not worth the money at all much rather a premier inn, close it was to Euston station
69141,Hilton London Euston, Keep in mind renovation works are ongoing which are disturbing It was not a Hilton experience Disappointing in fact Front desk staff was confusing My room was tiny and not quite up to par No finesse what so ever , Not alot
69142,Hilton London Euston, Although it didn t reduce how much we enjoyed the stay I would have liked to have been prewarned about the scaffolding outside the building, Very lovely staff Concierge was especially helpful 
69143,Hilton London Euston, Needed a socket near a mirror for hair drying straightening Building work commenced at 0750 in the morning and power was lost to the room twice ,No Positive
69144,Hilton London Euston, We were disappointed to find that our room smelt so strongly of smoke and as we had not asked for a smoking room we expected that it would be automatic these days for people to be booked into non smoking accommodation , Comfortable bed
69145,Hilton London Euston, The room was so stuffy and it stunk Couldn t open a window because the only window was looking into the restaurant Had to keep the shutters closed so no one could see me which left the room always dark I didn t know I was paying so much for a single bed The carpet was filthy I didn t want to walk on it without shoes The Internet was useless it shut off every 3 minutes and I had to type in the code again I used the Internet for probably 2 hours total and had to type in the code about 20 times I thought Hilton was supposed to be a decent hotel I was so suprized to have such an uncomfortable stay 200 Canadian should get me a lot more considering it wasn t even in a prime location , The location was decent
69146,Hilton London Euston, There was no plug socket near the mirror or no mirror near the plug socket which made drying hair a nightmare Also the shower door nearly chopped my fingers off as I think it was new and it shut with quite some force lovely shower though , Location and friendliness of staff We also thought the beds were really comfortable 
69147,Hilton London Euston, The hotel was undergoing refurbishment which we were not informed of in advance The bedroom we were allocated was stiflingly hot the window did not open and the air conditioning was not working The view was of builders rubble piled up outside the window We were allocated another room on the fourth floor accessed by a staff lift entered from a tradesman s kitchen with a exposed pipe running water down the sink The dining room was not open We had ordered afternoon tea for five people at 4pm for a family celebration We were told that tea was not served until 5 pm despite the website stating it was served from 2 30 to 4 30 and pre booking it for 4pm The website clearly advertised tea in a very nice looking dining room The staff did their best to accommodate us in the bar area but despite being there for two hours the staff then waited until my husband and I had gone to change before insisting that the tea was signed for by a person staying at the hotel or else paid for My daughter therefore paid for her celebration tea later reimbursed by us of course but that was not the point We were offered a bottle of Pinot Grigio White wine as recompense When we stated that we were intending to have glasses of sparkling wine in any event to mark her achievements the Pinot Grigio disappeared and we were charged full price for the five glasses of sparkling wine which was not the best quality in any event That was also on the bill which daughter paid We appreciate that it is difficult whilst renovations take place but the situation should be made clear when booking It was altogether unsatisfactory Had we known we would have stayed elsewhere ,No Positive
69148,Hilton London Euston, Would be good to have instructions on how to use TV gave up and went to sleep , Location was ideal for what we needed Staff went out of their way to help us Clean and friendly Nothing to much trouble Breakfast had lots of choices and hot and tasty Would stay again
69149,Hilton London Euston, Dirty old fashioned tired and dated Shower did not work and leaked over the floor no ventilation and uncontrollable central heating bed was dirty and too small I m 6ft and my feet were hanging over the end of the bed overall service poor A disgrace to be called a Hilton as clearly does not meet the standards ,No Positive
69150,Hilton London Euston, For a Hilton hotel and the price paid hotel lacked shine Rooms were dated Ive stayed in premier inn hotels with rooms with a sharper feel Also renovation was going on so had intermittant drilling and dusty lift lobby area Nice enough to stay but I expected more with Hilton and for the price paid Unfortunately I dont think ill be staying here again , Staff were friendly and polite Tasty and good selection at breakfast 
69151,Hilton London Euston, The hotel had recently been refurbished so there was an overwhelming smell of paint The air conditioning was also not working so the hotel had put makeshift invidiual aircon units in rooms that when used can only be described as a plane taking off The heating was on high and couldnt be adjusted So overall a horrendous night When I complained to the manager the following morning although pleasant enough during his explanation that many people had complained due to the obvious issues the best he could offer me was a reduction on my next stay I decided to take him up on the offer given I needed 9 rooms for my staff for a company function Not only did they offer a measely 10 pounds per room but I discovered I could get the rooms for less on booking com Needless to say I shant be returning to this mobey grabbing hotel , Not much on this occassion
69152,Hilton London Euston, The room 88 was too hot no windows to open for any air no air conditioning either there was a water cooler however room temperature was soaring high and there was damp smell in the room, It was clean
69153,Hilton London Euston, Shocking service at the desk very rude member of staff Initially put in a twin room both single beds The room had an overpowering bad smell Damp all in the bathroom ceiling and tiles Complained and asked to be moved and had to upgrade to be able to get a room that didn t smell Not what I expects from this brand Hilton , Location Iron

69157,Hilton London Euston, Basically a good hotel with great location just need to get the refurbished done or herring in rooms before letting them to people , Great location and hotel Heating air on not working so room temp fell to 15 degC at night Windows didn t shut properly Nice room spoilt by cold 
69158,Hilton London Euston, hotel was like a building site string smell of paint in room bedroom had no window apart from an internal window overlooking hotel function room and a noisy function was on Gym was not available and booked this hotel as expected same level of quality as other Hiltons as I am also Hilton honours member very disappointing, location was fine

69164,Hilton London Euston, View out the window room temperature was not hot and was not able to cook it down Was expecting a guess double room so not value for money, Location and friendly staff

69172,Hilton London Euston, Hotel very very poor considering the 184 per room paid No customer lifts had to use staff lift which was a mess stair ways were dirty as we re the floors decor was a mess Staff had no idea what they were doing , Leaving the hotel and heading home 
69173,Hilton London Euston, Really shabby for a Hilton I mean to be fair they are undergoing refurbishment but it is hard to believe that a Hilton could have ever been in such a poor condition prior to the refurbishment The room was stuffy and smelly smelled like damp clothes and carpet Pulled kettle out to make a cup of tea and it was filthy with little black bits on the base The elevator opened up to a really filthy area Basically Premier Inn or worse quality at Hilton price , The staff was very polite and helpful No hassle about payments and credit cards used for payment etc like most hotels True Hilton style 
69174,Hilton London Euston, Very average and dated room although hotel is currently undergoing renovation , Had to book at short notice 10pm of night of arrival and so it was suitable since rate was significantly discounted
69175,Hilton London Euston, We ve been to this hotel more than 10 times Leave this property alone during the renovation Be aware that they allocate the worst rooms possible to bookings com reservations Complain and they upgrade you Surprising , Location

69179,Hilton London Euston, Room was small and layout was not great Room 401 xurtain falling off decor was old Not worth the money we paid We both work in hotels and we were left feeling disappointed , The concierge staff were great Good location to euston 
69180,Hilton London Euston, The hotel was being refurbished while I was there and there was no air conditioning My room was like a sauna and I couldn t sleep with the windows open because of the noise of the traffic outside There was supposed to be bottled water available in each of the rooms and the staff were supposed to leave the curtains closed to keep the temperature down Didn t happen in my case , The hotel is very handy for London Euston station
69181,Hilton London Euston, possibly the worst night sleep in 20 years traveling for business The aircon in the whole hotel was broken so I had to attempt to sleep with the window and curtains open to generate some cool air The room was very hot The hotel is off Euston road and near a hospital so I did not sleep No attempt by the staff to compensate , the location is perfect for my London office quick and easy check in out the breakfast was very good

69186,Hilton London Euston, Having to sleep in a room with no air con and the only option to compensate this was an air cooler and a fan that was like trying to sleep in a box room with a jet engine Impossible to relax watch TV get ready in fact overall enjoy or short stay in London Absolute disgrace that this room was sold to us as the hotel was going under a renovation Feel conned by both Hilton and booking Com Even more so now that the Manager offered us a free up grade on our next visit Refused as this was just simply not good enough , Reception staff

69192,Hilton London Euston, The hotel is tired and in need of renovation once is scheduled in the near future The biggest disappointment was that the hotel air condition was not working throughout the hotel which is not ideal at anytime of the year but particularly in July when the temp was 24 degrees Portable air units were provided but did not solve the issue It was not possible to fully open the window In the circumstances we checked out after one nights stay It was a real disappointment I would not expect that for a Hilton, Staff were very helpful and obliging given they have to work in less than perfect circumstances 
69193,Hilton London Euston, There is no air conditioning and I was in an internal room like being in a boiling hot cell Sink in room broken When I spoke to the reception on check out no apology no offer of discount They knew about the air conditioning not working the hotel is going through refurbishment and blamed the website for not informing potential bookers , Location
