399158,Eurostars Bcn Design, The hallways feel like your in a hostel and the staff customer service was pretty crap Not very friendly and could not be bothered There was a taxi strike and there was a sign up in the lift informing guests of it When we asked staff for advice on how to get to the airport they were not really prepared and didn t give us enough information , Location and great black out curtains which really helped us in having a good sleep 
399159,Eurostars Bcn Design, This is not a 5 star hotel 3 star max The common parts and the rooms reminded me of a hostel The room had shower cubicle and a loo within it with glass doors and no locks Anyone else in the room or across the road admittedly with binoculars as it is a big road had a good view of ones ablutions Did not like that at all Common parts and main entrance need a massive upgrade to at least try and resemble a 5 star hotel, Staff were very helpful and pleasant Excellent location
399160,Eurostars Bcn Design, The glass shower and toilet doors are open to the room that made my 20 year old daughter staying with us uncomfortable There should be some sort of barrier to provide some privacy Other than that the hotel is wonderful , Like the design location staff and the bed it was within walking distance to train station metro museums and shopping We really loved it The hotel also offers in room coffee and tea we like that too 
399161,Eurostars Bcn Design, Only distraction where the shower stall which had two very large stones as a floor they where a little loose and when you moved around in there they could shift and grind against each other making a very annoying loud screeching noise like an industrial accident just happend The shower stall was clean however I did feel it could use some general maintence as it did have a somewhat worn look and feel to it , Spacious hotelroom Should be said I had a corne room which is a little bigger then the some of the other rooms Quirky with the bathtub in the middle of the room but that just gave the room some charm and personality in my opinion Nice little french balcony where you could stand and watch the citylife pass by Staff where friendly and accomodating But best of all where locaition locaition locaition right in the heart of the city with two of the major metro line stops yellow and purple line within 200 300 meters distance making access to the rest of Barcelona fast and easy Would be happy to use this hotel again if I needed to stay in Barcelona another time 
399162,Eurostars Bcn Design, All ok, Top quality breakfast highest ranking means f iberico Upgraded to pent house exelent service arrived 03 00 after mid night and perinell was superb
399163,Eurostars Bcn Design, Tolietries limited for 5 star hotel dont even have hair conditioner No bell serice you are expected to lug baggage to room yourself , Noisy room Staff not very friendly and helpful 
399164,Eurostars Bcn Design, It was a bit too expensive but we made an exception for our honeymoon Couldn t justify the cost on a regular trip , The bed was very comfy and the room was gorgeous 
399165,Eurostars Bcn Design, The only thing I can fault is the lack of bathrobes in a hot country this is an essential especially if you travel light and don t have the packing space , Beautiful hotel and a little quirky The staff were friendly and helpful The location perfect for the main shops and restaurants as well as bus tours and an array of public transport right on the doorstep 
399166,Eurostars Bcn Design, Plumming from central heating broke , Service at the desk was better than average they helped me with reservations to restaurants and concerts Lots of info for bus and sightseeing Rebeca did a Good job 
399167,Eurostars Bcn Design, Although we were upgraded the noise from others rooms the hall way and music coming from god knows where two nights no sleep and yes we only stayed two nights Designer type hotel that doesn t work , Location is perfect if you like walking up and down the slight hill that is the main shopping street 
399168,Eurostars Bcn Design, Room with views do not always have good views I was in the third floor and because of the trees I couldn t see Paseo de Gracia Gym definitely needs to be improved First by having more space and then by improving the machines specially the treadmill , Small but functional hotel 
399169,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, Location is great We were changed to this hotel because the one I booked had trouble with processing my credit card This one is fine right on the Paseo de Gracia A lot of shopping and restaurants 
399170,Eurostars Bcn Design, Better light around the mirrow would have been nice The room smelled a bit moist mould after shower , Staff was very helpful and friendly Room was as we wished it to be a bath tub in the midlle of it D French balcony and street view from the room was a nice suprise Perfect locatio across the street from Casa Bastillo 
399171,Eurostars Bcn Design, We have serious criticism about the hotel s cleaning services For two days they did not clean the room until we complained to the principal It should be noted that after the complaint there was indeed an improvement and the room was cleaned on a daily basis We also received financial compensation The bathroom in the middle of the room looks good but totally useless and takes up space in a room that is already small , We took a room with a view to the Passeig de Gr cia The street is charming with amazing architecture You can not hear the noises of the street when the balcony door is closed Location is excellent The hotel is located in the center of Barcelona and very close to the tourist centers The metro station is only a few meters away and it is very convenient The room is beautiful and the bed is very spacious and comfortable 
399172,Eurostars Bcn Design, The serving personnel didn t speak English very well Not really any bar resto all focused on room service which I never used but was available 24h if you sit down in the bar resto to eat or drink in the evening the serving personnel will be away periodically to deliver room service Rooms not very sound proof , In the middle of Barcelona on high end street close to everything but descrete low key and not at all busy Very friendly staff Good breakfast 
399173,Eurostars Bcn Design, Honestly nothing good but the staff there were very nice and helpful although they need more experience, the allocation was good although the hotel was bleow my expectations
399174,Eurostars Bcn Design, Even if the bathroom is very nice there were no towel racks and the wc door was uncomfortable to close Because the bedroom and the bathroom aren t separated after using the bath or the shower it was necessary to open the window to avoid the moisture , The position of the hotel is amazing very close to the subway The room is spacious very stylish and with a little nice balcony 
399175,Eurostars Bcn Design, The toilet sound proof and ventilation were not planned well The bath tub was placed in a very awkward place I would rather have the space than the tub sitting in the middle , The hotel is located in the heart of the city and excellent The sheets were very clean and nice refreshment service by the reception 
399176,Eurostars Bcn Design, Nothing , Having booked a double room we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves in a superior double with terrace and free standing bath The room was spacious and very clean The terrace was a fair size and caught the sun all afternoon The free standing bath bonus speaks for itself a touch of class All in all the room was utilised to the max spacious modern and the bed was very comfortable If you are travelling with someone you don t know too well the bathroom facilities are quite open so be warned otherwise absolutely tip top accommodation The hotel is right in the middle of the city with lots to see and do on the doorstep we couldn t really have asked for better The breakfast was ample and fresh with only one small blot on their coupon was the second boiled egg I received must have just fallen out of the chicken straight into the egg cup Other than that Perfect 
399177,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, Rebeca on reception was so kind and friendly made our stay in Barcelona comfortable and memorable I ve been to many hotels in the city and this is the best so far great value for money great location and great service 
399178,Eurostars Bcn Design, Hotel failed to deliver on the basics a good night s sleep a hot shower I had the fright of my life when I was woken up at 03 40 by a member of staff entering my room And there was no hot water I m sure both incidences were exceptional and just bad luck for me it happens but I won t be coming back , Breakfast was good Location was great Staff were friendly 
399179,Eurostars Bcn Design, Arrived Tuesday morning which I stated on email expect from 10 11a m travelled all night couldn t check in till 3 We were so tired walking around Barcelona, The bed was very comfortable
399180,Eurostars Bcn Design, Everything was great Great breakfast , The employees the atmosphere the above and beyond service They asked how they help us and they in detailed guidance Free drink and the awesome chocolate and sweets We loved the front desk reception employees and the restaurant employees The were all amazing every possible way Always greeted with a big smile from everyone Thanks everyone for making out stay very enjoyable 
399181,Eurostars Bcn Design, Had to request a clean kettle the hairdryer had exposed wires and had to request clean cups and glasses which were then washed in the bathroom sink not 5 stars at all, Location
399182,Eurostars Bcn Design, LAST NIGHT DINNER IN THE RESTAURANT CHEF LEFT 9 30 FANTASTIC SERVER JORGE WAS BARMAN SERVER AND CHEF ALL ALONE LOTS OF STAFF STANDING AROUND NOT WILLING TO ASSIST DO MANAGEMENT REALISE WHAT AN ASSET JORGE IS TO THE HOTEL LACK OF MANAGEMENT DEFINITELY IN THE EVENING , VERY FRIENDLY STAFF GREAT LOCATION NICE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST BUT A BIT STEEP AT 15 EUROS 
399183,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, I booked this hotel for a weekend away for my partners 21st birthday I wanted the room to be decorated for our arrival I was able to organise it all from back home in London as their communication was amazing and speedy The rooms were absolutely stunning The bath and shower was amazing We had a lovely balcony overlooking the Main Street which again was lovely The staff were lovely I cannot fault them at all I would recommend everyone to come and stay here You won t be disappointed 
399184,Eurostars Bcn Design, No privacy when using the toilet Frosted glass door in the room open plan and you could see everything Not a problem for me and my partner but it may make others uncomfortable , Brilliant breakfast Lovely hotel and rooms Location was perfect Extremely friendly and helpful staff Downsides Open plan bathroom with toilet being a frosted glass door which could make some people uncomfortable as you could see through the glass Fitness centre was only 3 machines and some dumbbells in a tiny room 
399185,Eurostars Bcn Design, Breakfast was very disappointing Buffet selection was very limited and often not replenished quickly Staff at breakfast were unorganised and often tables were not re set or cleared Whole area looked messy Hot breakfast option was very limited and was of low quality , Hotel well located 
399186,Eurostars Bcn Design, The toilets were open plan and the sinks were too small , We are a young family with two children The staff were extremely helpful and accomodating towards us The room service was fab and the food at the in house restaurant tasted delicious 
399187,Eurostars Bcn Design, The hotel is old need to be refurnished a lot of humidity Breakfast is very modest for 5 star hotel , Very friendly staff clean hotel central location 
399188,Eurostars Bcn Design, doesn t deserve 5 stars at all whenever you ask for help or directions they ask you to go through the internet access to the terrace is limited to specific times it was closed at 8 am no one helped us with the baggage 5 stars serves the spa is small room with 2 machines air conditioning didn t work until we made a complaint , location
399189,Eurostars Bcn Design, Air conditioning didn t work not a problem in the cooler days when the window can be thrown open but summer might be a bit uncomfortable Internet was very slow but it was free and did the job , Great value for money super location very clean very friendly and helpful staff Quirky decor and building but interesting generally well run Hotel
399190,Eurostars Bcn Design, The bathroom is part of the room which is very annoying I really urge the hotel to reconsider having the bathroom like this If you want to wash your face you will get the whole floor wet because of the small sink You can t use the bathroom because your have zero privacy, Location of the hotel
399191,Eurostars Bcn Design, There was a cockroach that came from under the sink in the bedroom so I didn t sleep so good knowing it was walking around , The bed was big and the room spacious
399192,Eurostars Bcn Design, Integrated toilet and shower meant a total lack of privacy Also not a single hook for coats towels Not what I d call a bon design , Easy to find excellent location very clean
399193,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, Great room with terrace and huge round bath in the middle was the best Sant Valentine s present for us Thank for all the staff who was caring about and for richest breakfast with cava and salmon 
399194,Eurostars Bcn Design, Worst room service i have tried It doesnt look like a 5 start hotel , Modern big room Nice view of Paseig de Gracia superior room Great loacation at 3 minutes from Catalunya square 
399195,Eurostars Bcn Design, Everything is fantastic If I must critize toilets could ve been more private, The place of the hotel is so central Nice and helpful staff The terrace is gougeous
399196,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, It was a nice place we enjoyed the bath was very relaxing We liked the concept The location is great if u book hop on hop off they will let you in front if the hotel green line number 16 and orange one number 19 It was a bit smelly on the corridor because of the vacuum the cleaner forgot to clean the bath also she forgot to supply us with coffee and milk but as soon I call the reception in less than 5 minutes we had coffee and milk I love the location and the room Also the price was good We like this place 
399197,Eurostars Bcn Design, It was really annoying I asked and asked for breakfast tea bags and milk as they were not refreshed each day in our room House keeping simply wouldn t do it When I asked at front desk I got hot milk and green tea Really Small things make a big difference , We were upgraded to a superior bedroom Location was fantastic city was fantastic 
399198,Eurostars Bcn Design, Normal Breakfast Expensive over rated No Lobby as other 5 hotels, fantastic location rooms are ok shower is good tho staff is very friendly and smiling which was very comfortable
399199,Eurostars Bcn Design, Bad Sleep on first night due to argument going on in next room however was dealt with by staff and upgraded us next night to compensate , Great location comfy bed and helpful staff moved us to better room due to adjacent room having noisy couple arguing during night
399200,Eurostars Bcn Design, The design of the room is very cool but impractical There is a huge sharp edged pillar nearly in front of the entrance door and the toilet so if you re not attentive you can easily hurt yourself The two seperate sinks are a nice idea but the size is horrible There is no way you can use it without spilling water everywhere it s too tiny , Friendly and helpful staff fantastic location the hotel was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint The style of the hotel room is that of a small apartment studio 
399201,Eurostars Bcn Design, We booked the suit the upstairs guests keep throwing cigarettes on our balcony The staff was indifferent about that Will not be coming back again , Room was nice bit too tacy 
399202,Eurostars Bcn Design, TV in the room can be bigger and sinks were tiny Bathroom design not amazing, Excellent location on Passeig de Gracia all boutiques in walking distance as well as Casa Batllo and Casa Mila Excellent breakfast we had brunch everyday and service was great thanks to Fran 
399203,Eurostars Bcn Design, The sink in the bathroom are so small that you can not wash yourself and there is no place to put your things And the light I can say that you don t have light in bathroom It is very uncomfortable , The location is very good and the staff is very friendly and helpful 
399204,Eurostars Bcn Design, the room was unventilated damp and impossible to stay in The aircondition was turned off b management so had to open th windw LOUD nois from the streef below made the whole stay almost unbareable Requests to turn AC on were turned down Nightmare , Friendly staff
399205,Eurostars Bcn Design, Gym is very simple rooms very warm and street is a bit noisy, Big spacious room friendly staff very central breakfast good price perfect located for shopping

399207,Eurostars Bcn Design, In TV there were not much TV channels to watch Plus after cleaning room service it was not much diferrence before and after , Modern look of the apartment with excellent idea about bathtub in the middle of the room 
399208,Eurostars Bcn Design, Found room 507 a bit hard to find Couldnt drain the bath Nothing really to complain about , The suite was amazing Only surpassed by the reception staff and bar staff who were more than helpful and so very friendly The location is perfect the metro right outside the door near the Ramblas right in the middle of the premium shopping district We will be back and I will be recommending to others 
399209,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, Beautiful room with feature decor balcony and bath in the middle of the room Located a block down from famous Gaudi house Easy to find great location 
399210,Eurostars Bcn Design, Poor quality rooms hotel set up was subpar lobby too small pictures of rooms on internet are deceiving We switched to the Cotton House Hotel and was much happier , Location
399211,Eurostars Bcn Design, Free wi fi was very very slow at evening time Elevators break down very often Hotel aisles were noisy at the night sometimes I wondered and opened my door I saw some stuff were trying to do their job But that was disturbing, Breakfast was excellent Croissants cakes cheeses very very ok Cleaning lady and receptionists were very kind and helpful Great location I could go almost everywhere by walking
399212,Eurostars Bcn Design, breakfast not included but worth it for 16euros , location is great and near everything rooms are spacious and very clean you only see other guests at breakfast super comfy beds staff is friendly and helpful 
399213,Eurostars Bcn Design, reception staff were not so welcoming dark dull rooms and not so clean No one to assist with baggage would not recommend again, Location was excellent
399214,Eurostars Bcn Design, Voyeur toilets are out of date now and embarrassing for some people The small TV only had a couple of bad Spanish channels The very dark ground floor lobby is perfect for bag snatchers We were followed through the door by two males and it was only when I turned round and walked at them did they cover their faces and make off Asked for an early check in and was told We didn t know about it and your rooms not ready , Good soundproofing and comfortable room The location is great 
399215,Eurostars Bcn Design, Very thin walls you can hear everything from next room no bathroom slippers no clock on the wall only one person at reception so sometimes you call it s busy , Room is great very nice decoration great location of hotel staff was great helpful and food was great English speaking staff great 
399216,Eurostars Bcn Design, The bathroom sinks were very small round bowls with the shelf right over them My face did not fit over the sink for washing or brushing my teeth I had to wash my face in the shower with the shower wand The walls are very thin and noise from other guests was very disturbing , Location was great Breakfast was very good with cured meats fresh fruit bread and pastry assortment and a toaster Cereal and milk was available Eggs and omelets to order Tea water juices Cava was readily available The King size room was spacious and had a sitting area The bed was comfortable and had 4 pillows with extra blankets in the spacious closet 
399217,Eurostars Bcn Design, The bed was not comfortable two very hard twin sized beds pushed together The small vanity area lacked sufficient lighting for putting on makeup etc the open floor plan and black tile dark furnishings made the room very dark , The location was perfect and centrally located near shopping restaurants and transportation We liked the boutique feel of the hotel The room was cool and quiet 
399218,Eurostars Bcn Design, Even though the modern finish is beautiful is not very useful comfortable The Open concept of the Bathroom with the room is some kind of awkward Our room was close to the room service deposit so it was kind of noisy in the mornings , The Staff was super friendly the location is great if you re on a leisure plan Metro station is close Bus Turistic is Close Pla a Catalunya is close Breakfast was delicious Bed was super Comfortable A C was superb 
399219,Eurostars Bcn Design, They charge to mi credit card and I ask not to The terrace was not clean The shower was not fix very damage The stair to the terrace is huge Not practical for washing your hands horrible This is not a 5 star hotel Views are not cool People can see us from the stairs not cool Tv aux didn t work menu is only for tourist I will never recommend this place to no one And I won t visit another of this chaine Thanks a lot , Nice gin tonics
399220,Eurostars Bcn Design, All great until the last day where It was only one problem that happened where I was disrespected by a staff and no one bothered even to apologise even though the manager was extremely close and im sure she knew about it, Everything is great from room to food to everything
399221,Eurostars Bcn Design, Nothing at all, Every single thing was perfect Staff in the hotel and specailly on the reception are fantastic and very helpful and trys their best to make the stay in the hotel great I extended another 4 nights in the hotel for how good it is
399222,Eurostars Bcn Design, The shower and toilet area were a little awkward to get in and out of because of the doors, I love the entrance to the hotel and the reception a floor above with easy access through the elevators The balcony of the room was huge and room was bigger than I thought it would be excellent value for money 
399223,Eurostars Bcn Design, Normal rates somewhat pricy Bar area very basic and no restaurant no problem for me but so you know , Awesome service great staff Rooms are very nice 
399224,Eurostars Bcn Design, Breakfast is priced too high and there could have been more choice buffet style Don t really have much else to say negative , Nice rooms great staff and service private and very quiet in building no disturbances our room was nice and spacious with a balcony with front view of passage de gracia Wifi in rooms was a huge plus for us Amazing stay overall 
399225,Eurostars Bcn Design, I was suprised that they don t provide hair conditioner nor cotton buds considering that it is a five star hotel Their gluten free breakfast is boring and tasteless , The personnel are really friendly and nice The location is great close to the shops restaurants and communication Clean spacious room with cool design 
399226,Eurostars Bcn Design, the hotel is not a 5 star It should be no more than a 3 star The toilets are facing the bed they have a smoked glass door that does not shut completely Adios any intimacy, the location is excellent
399227,Eurostars Bcn Design, Breakfast quality very poor also the housekeeping will attempt to clean your room only one time a day if you are in bed they do not return, Friendly staff and great location
399228,Eurostars Bcn Design, bed was a bit hard toilet and show not that private frosted glass hard to get your own privacy with friends, in the centre of Gaudi buildings just 5 mins from gothic district
399229,Eurostars Bcn Design, I would have liked the fridge to have been restocked of the water bottles that we drank Milk pods not replaced Otherwise fine , Breakfast was a good mix of foods the decor was bold and interesting the staff were helpful and the location excellent Gaudi s Casa Battlo is a 2 min walk 
399230,Eurostars Bcn Design, Despite boasting of various pillows and despite me requesting a softer pillow I was not impressed with the pillows I definitely did not have a feather down pillow Gym very basic shame about no pool, Size of bed and block out curtains Friendly and helpful staff Location
399231,Eurostars Bcn Design, The room is a prime example of design over function Looks great but shower floods the room basins difficult to use and a huge ugly terrace overlooking the backside of the city , Great staff fabulous location very comfortable bed Good for one night only 
399232,Eurostars Bcn Design, Gym was a bit tired but after walking all day I did not have the energy to use it anyway , Very helpful and welcoming staff Great location in the heart of the city The room was very quiet even though we were situated on a fairly busy road Would definitely stay there again 
399233,Eurostars Bcn Design, TV channels were limited on one or two days not sure why Toilet door did not shut properly but we did not let the hotel know , The location for us was perfect since we needed to use public transport Staff were also great 
399234,Eurostars Bcn Design, Not sure how it got a 5 star status but you can tell that from the description of the hotel before booking it Would still highly recommend however, Staff were very helpful and very friendly really helped with any queries we had Location super spotless clean too
399235,Eurostars Bcn Design, Bit noisy on lower floor 2nd Could have done more with the back terrace pool , Very friendly front desk staff Very welcoming Overall great deal and value for money Liked the room design But it was special deal on booking com i think
399236,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, The receptionists were very friendly and helpful The room was a delight and very clean and comfortable whilst stylish The location was perfect I will be back 
399237,Eurostars Bcn Design, Not really 5 star hotel At most 4 but good altogether , Location is amazing Right where you have to stay to enjoy the city Very helpful staff and very quiet 
399238,Eurostars Bcn Design, The bathroom open to the room the belows not comfertable the stiyle is dark colors , Hotel location one of the best clean nighberhood very close to the most attractive places in bercalona just in the best street in bercalona shopping tourest buses ramplace street is fiew minets do not moss the location the bathroom was open to the room totally open The food service amaizing the pracies also 
399239,Eurostars Bcn Design, the strange corridor area and the location of reception No sunlight in the room at all but I would not complain about this , Size of the room wass big enough The bed was very comfortable Their staff were all very friendly and helpful 
399240,Eurostars Bcn Design,No Negative, The hotel is very central in the heart of the designer shops and just a few metres from Gaudi House Gorgeous boutique rooms Wonderful decor Staff are excellent 
399241,Eurostars Bcn Design, Combined with Ikea furniture Unusable wash tables Name combination take a biz card or you sleep on the street , Nice mosaic decor Perfect staff Bar
399242,Eurostars Bcn Design, We were given a room on the third floor first but the bed was rock hard twin bed If you like a good night sleep then ask to check the bed first or move you to another room The staff was very helpful and let us change to one on the fourth floor double bed which was much better The only issue is that the room had a musty smell behind the bed frame slightly annoying , Great location It is in one of the main shopping areas in Barcelona and near the train station direct to the airport The d cor of the hotel is quite funky and nice It is close to the main tourist attractions and about 30 minutes walk from the beach There are also loads of restaurants to eat near by so if you do not fancy a big buffet breakfast or pay 15 euros for it you can go out and eat in any of the places around There are cheap and the food is great We spent about 10 15 euros for two people depending on what you order 
399243,Eurostars Bcn Design, I paid for breakfast but they gave me receipt and I had to pay The breakfast was included but never got the chance to have it Price per room, Location and room 
399244,Eurostars Bcn Design, Only thing that I didint liked it there is not too much hot water on the shower , Location and the view from room was perfect Room cleaned every day the bed was so comfortable 
399245,Eurostars Bcn Design, People slamming doors once in a while, The room and bathroom Awesome bed Great bedlinen Staff adorable All of them super friendly and super happy to help 
399246,Eurostars Bcn Design, Really did not like the open plan bathroom with see through doors No one wants to see and hear others going to the toilet or having a wash while trying to relax in the bedroom , Bed lovely and comfy
399247,Eurostars Bcn Design, The design of the rooms were very poor the open plan toilet facilities into the room were not good and would restrict us staying again The room was lacking in small touches like no soap holder and no hooks for towels near the shower limited shelving for toilettres, The location staff and breakfast were very good The cleanliness of the room very good but more tea and milk required 
399248,Eurostars Bcn Design, sometimes noisy from the street the bathroom and toilet are missing privecy, the staff were very nice helpfull friendly and generally amazing the location is perfect the room is good looking
399249,Eurostars Bcn Design, I did not like the structure of the room and its bathroom , I like the staff and their approach but the bathroom was not good The reception is in the first floor with no good singn to advise you 
399250,Eurostars Bcn Design, breakfast is poor and not good and whom treating and cleaning the room don t put enough shompoo and towle and water for every day after cleaning, design and location is very good
399251,Eurostars Bcn Design, I do not class this Hotel as a 5 star hotel to be honest i have stayed in better 3 star hotels the design in the rooms looks great but it does not work at all , STAFF LOCATION
399252,Eurostars Bcn Design, The bath was in the middle of the room which was very awkward Its ok if you re traveling in couples It s got another shower room and a toilet by the side The hotel provided basic toilettes but no toothpaste and toothbrush which was normal in most Europe hotel The balcony faces the main street which would have some noise from the people in the street The air conditioner was not working well but it was ok as its just around 15 20 degrees in April The cleansing lady didn t refill the towels and minibar We ll have to ask for ourselves , A great place to stay in Barcelona as its near to all the attractions Very convenient as its just few minutes walk from Metro Passeig de Gracia and very close to the station Catalunya Just walking distance to the Casa Batllo Casa Mila Just 3 stations to Sagrada Familia 3 stations to the Port de Barcelona And you can take the Metro line L3 directly to Camp Nou to watch the UEFA match The hotel was in the street of Passeig de Gracia You can go shopping directly when you go out from the hotel There are plenty of restaurants cafes fast food shops and supermarkets around I ve booked a double room with fair price We were so impressed that we ve got a very big room with a special balcony which was the only one in the hotel at Level one 108 It was worth of money The lobby and room was very fashionable Wifi was all over the hotel and very good connections even in the room The bed and pillows were very comfortable and clean It got a big wardrobe and a big table an electric kettle were available A small fridge with the minibar was available and some instant coffee and tea bags also The breakfast looks great but we didn t try it as its not included in the room charge and you ll need to pay 15 each person The reception were very helpful and nice to provide us the information of the metro and city map and the directions 
399253,Eurostars Bcn Design, the room service is a bit limited in terms of choices the WC was very small , Location Location It s a perfect place if you want to see Barcelona The staff also was very polite 
399254,Eurostars Bcn Design, Only criticism would be the lack of coffee supplied to the room daily But the is a little picky as a quick call to reception puts this right , The staff where excellentalways smiling and happy to help The location is ideal everything pretty much within 30 minute walk The room on the 6th floor large super bed with a nice little balcony All topped of with a complimentary Cava in the evening 
399255,Eurostars Bcn Design, I really was shocked to find out that next to the building is renovation work done from 8 30AM to 8PM where you were always hearing horrible noice You need to check the situation before offering hotels if there is anything going on as renovation work next to building or at the building Really not happy with it ,No Positive
399256,Eurostars Bcn Design, The air conditioning was switched off and I don t like a warm room when I sleep I had to sleep with the patio doors open all night , The location was amazing I had a suite room and the patio area was very nice but a little too cold to use not exactly the fault of the hotel 8 
399257,Eurostars Bcn Design, Walls and doors of room only light and not sound proof Housekeeping service and overall appearance of the room not 5 star level , Excellently located Just walking minutes to major sights Easy to reach by public transportation from the airport Good bed in large room with amazing terrace

399259,Eurostars Bcn Design, This probably relates to room 309 only as the other 102 lacked those drawbacks So layout of the room is at least very questionable Imagine one is sitting in Ferrari s driving seat What a dream but it happened to be a WC almost in the center of the room With lights and sounds on in well thought and designed Ferrari cabin everybody in the room will enjoy your night party Washing basins thanks God they were two fit to wash either apple or orange not both Well a bit of more living comfort at the expense of great design that s what I was missing P S If Ferrari lights are off mind black solid column on your way to bed , Great location reception did excellent job by extending room for another 4 hours free of charge and was generally very positive and helpful restaurants and taxi bookings
