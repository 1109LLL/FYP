355888,Canal House,No Negative, This property is one of the most exquisite boutique hotels we have stayed in There are so many lovely things the wonderful architecture and stylish yet comfortable furnishings the beautiful gardens and an amazing staff Everything was perfect The bed and pillows were so comfortable I am going to buy the pillows for my home The location was so romantic it is right on a lovely street on the canal and we could hear the horse drawn carriages going down the street ever so slightly we had the window open Just wonderful we will be coming back 
355889,Canal House, I cannot think of a thing , The staff makes this hotel They were great Location is excellent for vacation facilities are the best and the outdoor space is so relaxing Could not be better 
355890,Canal House, Would expect richer breakfast for a room of those rates , Excellent staff They were helpful with all of our queries Hotel is very clean and the bed was very comfortable 
355891,Canal House, Nothing, What a fabulous small boutique hotel with a lovely quiet courtyard garden to relax in and in a great location too The staff were so friendly and helpful All the rooms are wonderful with amazing attention to detail to make your stay as luxurious as possible we loved everything about it and hope to visit again 
355892,Canal House, Leaving , From the moment we checked in we knew we had chosen the right hotel Every single staff person made us feel welcome and the facilities were wonderful from the living room overlooking the canal to the lush and lovely garden to the comfortable and stylish room itself Breakfasts were among the best we ve enjoyed in Europe from fresh juices made to order coffees and pastries to generous assortments of cheese meats and granolas Strongly recommend 
355893,Canal House, Nothing, The Room courtyard other guest the staff location could not be better the staff soon learned or needs and our habits quickly Never been in a better location nor hotel ever 
355894,Canal House, The hotel is decorated mainly black inside which is great for the dining and leisure areas but much too dark in the bedroom and bathroom Couldn t see in the wardrobe very well and lighting for making up poor Also there was a hair dryer provided but no mirror near a plug socket to see what you are doing I find this often in hotels and cannot understand why that is especially given the room rates Continental breakfast was included which was fine but anything hot extra which again I think should all be included in the rate , Excellent location Beautiful building Close to main centre but not noisy Great staff and service 
355895,Canal House, Very late check in 3 PM With such a high price for a room it is shocking that guest can t check in to their room before 3 PM , Superb design
355896,Canal House, Only one thing On booking com the different room categories are described in detail I chose a category that said view over the canal or garden but this time I got a room with curtains that didn t open because there was a grey wall outside the window , This was my second stay The staff is really friendly and helpful The rooms are super comfortable and beautifully decorated and everything is clean and looks new There s a garden that must be heaven during summer Nice breakfast The stairs are really steep so wear sensible shoes The photos are from both visits 
355897,Canal House, The bar felt a little sterile with uncomfortable seats I would recommend walking a few doors down to The Toren hotel which has a much superior stylish setting and luxury sofas It was also hard to get the attention of staff in the bar as they do a dual role with the reception , Location is excellent Its not in the deep heart of Amsterdam but within minutes walking distance to the main square and attractions The rooms are stylish and well appointed and we particularly liked the shower 
355898,Canal House, Nothing, The hotel was seriously LUXE but not ostentatious the neighbourhood was amazing the staff courteous and polite The food was delicious the decor beautiful everything was perfect I have no complaints at all
355899,Canal House, it says breakfast included but every warm meal eggs avo toast etc was not the WiFi was wonky almost half the time, very central location but still quiet the garden is a gem cozy little place friendly staff 
355900,Canal House, The stairs to the upper floors are a bit steep and crazy , Owen really made a huge difference in our stay at Canal House He was so helpful with suggestions and directions and just an overall pleasant service attitude The breakfast that Michael had out each morning was also a great value and wonderful 
355901,Canal House, The interior is very dark tiles on the walls even in the bedroom area and therefore very masculine in its feel If you like that it s great For two women friends getting together a little more feminine softness would have been nicer The breakfast was very underwhelming and the Wifi in our room was not functioning well enough to rely on it For the price we paid for an exceptional room it did not feel exceptional or special enough , The location is lovely and above all the garden is spectacular 
355902,Canal House,No Negative, I first stayed in the Canal House at the end of the 1980 s It was one of the most genuine hotels in Amsterdam with the feel of staying in a grand house on one of the grandest canals The current owners have updated and expanded the hotel but they have retained that same feel and added a bit of individuality and luxury Very impressive 
355903,Canal House, There was absolutely nothing not to like , Excellent buffet breakfast A lovely garden in which to sit and relax The rooms were well appointed and the beds very comfortable The staff were superb and made us very welcome and genuinely pleased to help The hotel is sited on a beautiful stretch of the Keizersgracht and handy for trams restaurants and shops It would be my first choice for every visit to Amsterdam 
355904,Canal House, Grade of room on the website could mirror those on Booking com, Staff are extremely attentive and helpful They make great cocktails especially the Bramble Great central location beautifully decorated 
355905,Canal House, It was a little bit cold in the toilet , Great rooms with nice design very polite staff good location The breakfast is ok with a view towards a beautiful garden 
355906,Canal House,No Negative, The staff where really attentive and nice The room had a huge window that looked onto the gardens at the back of the hotel the view was lovely The restaurant area was also bright and airy with nice views onto the gardens 
355907,Canal House,No Negative, We had a very nice stay at the Canal house for two nights We booked the smallest room which was absolutely big enough for us very cosy and charming Our bathtub and sink were part of the room as you can see on many pictures For us this was a nice little detail which we enjoyed Maybe someone else would prefer more privacy though The stuff was very friendly and helpful und happy to fulfill any special request Altogether for our needs and expectations the canal house was a perfect choice 
355908,Canal House, The dark furniture and it was a bit difficult to figure out how the light system works in the room , Loved the breakfast and the back garden The bath tub and bath products were lovely 
355909,Canal House, Not much to complain about really The door lock is not intuitive , Cool and elegant place Very engaged staff and great breakfast Well designed lobby room and lounge 
355910,Canal House, We only stayed one night and the one night we did they closed the bar to paint it so stuck homemade signs warning of wet paint around the bar and reception area Consequently the small communal ground floor smelt of wet paint so we had to go out and go to The Toren for a drink instead Unacceptable to do maintenance during the day when guests are in residence They should do it at night so the chemical fumes and unsightliness of the painting is confined and didn t spoil the guest experience, Stunning location interior design and the Christmas decorations were incredibly beautiful
355911,Canal House, We did not stay long enough , We love sitting in the bar with a glass of champagne and nibbles We love the easy pace of the hotel the excellent service and friendliness of the staff We love the ambiance We love that it is so central with lots of lovely shops restaurants and bars close by 
355912,Canal House,No Negative, Excellent hotel in great location with professional friendly staff Room was very good spacious clean and very cosy Really good bed linens and bathroom products good quality Would recommend this hotel 
355913,Canal House, The breakfast buffet was somehow economical Less variety of bread cheese For scambled egg you have to pay extra 6 p p , The breakfast room was gorgeous I enjoyed the cofee and cheese 
355914,Canal House, If anything I would have liked a bigger tub , The decoration of the place is amazing and I loved our spacious room The staff is amazing Loved their toiletries Is definitely more than just a hotel 
355915,Canal House,No Negative, This is a luxurious hotel the staff couldn t have been more helpful It s located in a quiet part of town with wonderful restaurants within an easy walk 
355916,Canal House, Lack of coat hooks in the rooms a couple would be useful to air outdoor coats and for the dressing gowns provided , All of it if you book direct with Canal House you get upgraded better room hot breakfast and a couple of other perks but we found the standard cold buffet excellent fresh juices salamis cheeses crudites and beautiful quality breads pastries and cereals of course Our room had no view which was a slight disappointment but as we were out all day that didn t matter It was very well appointed and you are provided with slippers dressing gowns and very good quality bath gels lotions Tip earplugs disposable razor cream toothbrush paste provided enough for a short stay Lovely garden friendly and informative staff pleasant bar and pleasant eating area which looks out across the pretty garden
355917,Canal House,No Negative, Fantastic property situated on a quiet canal street with gracious staff and striking decor Peaceful garden courtyard and nice breakfast included in price 
355918,Canal House, Heat in hallways getting up to Pent House it was Sept at 99 degrees F the room air conditioner didn t feel like it could always operate at full capacity We visited at an unusually hot time so that will seldom be an issue again I have a bad knee and my daughter has multiple scerolsis so it was concerning that there WERE stairs to our room even though the elevator took you a far part of it You HAVE to deal with stairs to get inside the hotel up to the elevator or dining room and down two sets of stairs to the courtyard and up two small runs to get to the Pent house FAR more steps than I had hoped for I had requested a room near the elevator and verified there was an elevator before reserving the room When they said yes it did not occur for me to still ask how many stairs We managed and loved our stay OH Ice had to be obtained from the bar and we had a very small ice bucket If I did it over again I would have turned a waste basket into our ice bucket My daughter was really enjoying making her own iced drinks because it was so hot There was very little noise outside our window and the view of the canal couldn t have been more picturesque , I LOVED the location so close to so many things to see and do We took the Pent House and WOW was that wonderful with a grand view We LOVED the courtyard garden and the red cat that visited in the courtyard The lattes and included breakfast was great and everything we purchased for lunch or dinner was really tasty too They call them bites but there is a full meal in one of their bite dishes We were treated like royalty everyone was professional and personable and made you really feel welcome I can t say enough about the facility staff food and location 
355919,Canal House, Nieuwe Kerk situated near by the hotel ring the bells every 15 minutes or may be it was the chiming clock It disturbs a little bit especially early in the morning and late in the evening , Lovely place Historical Amsterdam building close to the city center delightful interior wonderful garden and views especially canal view 
355920,Canal House, Steep narrow stairs might be a problem for some people, Stylish friendly relaxed classy Good location on quiet canal street Nice garden is a bonus Next door s friendly cat in garden an extra bonus 
355921,Canal House, Breakfast selection was very poor i e no eggs just one kind of cheese and ham They offer a la carte breakfast eggs or toast but that comes with extra cost not ok for the room price they charge Very poor smell in the bathroom , Well located nice design very friendly staff
355922,Canal House, Nothing , Staff are fantastic so welcoming friendly and helpful The welcome drink and fresh towel on arrival was a lovely touch Breakfast was delicious 
355923,Canal House, There is steps to going up to the rooms with make it difficult with luggage , I like te boutique style and the location rooms are amazing and very clean toiletteries are vey nice and excellent quality The staff is very friendly and helpful I will give them a 100 try are truly good and well trained 
355924,Canal House, There was no air conditioning When I made the reservation and when I called the week before to confirm my reservation I asked if there was AC as I had read in some reviews that the AC sometimes did not work When I called I was told that some rooms did not have it but that mine definitely would When we arrived we got a shrug of the shoulders and the statement that the AC was not working Since we were only staying for one night we stayed but that untruthful statement influenced our view of the Canal House since they obviously did not give us accurate information Fortunately the night was not particularly hot and the did give us a small fan , The hotel looked lovely and was well designed to maximize the use of small spaces The garden was really lovely and welcoming The breakfast was good The employees were friendly The bed was comfortable 
355925,Canal House, I suggest just having a coffee machine where guests can help themselves Yes it s a little less posh But we wouldn t have to wait for coffee refills Of which I have many , Beautiful garden to relax in
355926,Canal House, Didn t care for the shower tub being in the middle of the room The fan was a great touch , Front desk staff was great Very polite Rooms and property was gorgeous 
355927,Canal House, The air con was not working during our stay so it was s little warm but windows opened and they provided fans , A warm welcome from all the staff at this beautiful characterful property with a tranquil canal side location Church bells rang out hourly throughout the night which we thought added to the character but could be irritating to some The garden at the back of the property was a lovely spot for an aperitif or a snack Breakfast was excellent too The room included a coffee maker and complementary tea was delivered to your room pretty much instantly Very convenient for great restaurants and the major attractions all within walking distance 
355928,Canal House, Toilet was a little claustrophobic, Understated elegance Sultry dark rooms Garden was a peaceful oasis Location was perfect Staff were attentive and helpful Great room was stylish with a decent coffee machine 
355929,Canal House, Our room which we paid the same price as if we had a canal view or garden view but we had NO view at all except on a wall Quite sad to have to same price for all the rooms when they all offer different options then you can just be lucky or very unlucky when checking in , Location was great Nice garden very relaxing Good tips for restaurants 
355930,Canal House, Nothing , The location is perfect It is in walking distance to Anne Frank House Dam Square and Central station We also walked to museums although this was a bit further There is a bus tram stop close by The staff was helpful and extremely friendly and luggage storage was very useful for before and after checkout The area was quiet and we enjoyed the garden area after a hard day touring 
355931,Canal House, All black decor is bit gloomy We asked to change rooms after the first night because our first one a good room see top left in website pictures was very small and cramped had very little storage space to stow clothes and had no power outlet within a hair dryer s reach of any mirror Our second room an exceptional room see bottom left in website pictures was extraordinarily spacious and comfortable but suffered from the same hair dryer power outlet problem , Restful hotel really helpful knowledgeable staff The hotel s recommendations for restaurants were exceptionally good and we enjoyed our stay 
355932,Canal House, too much black coloured walls everywhere black clothes on staff no room in the room for clothes no place to hang clothes, comfort of bed cleanliness kindness of staff nice breakfast
355933,Canal House, Absolutely no complaints My stay was perfect , The staff were exceptional engaging knowledgeable courteous and attentive This charming hotel is in a perfect location on a quiet canal street and easily accessible to the major attractions of Amsterdam 
355934,Canal House, I can t fault it perfection , Wow perfection Beautiful in every way Gorgeous luxurious stunning garden so peaceful lovely staff And yes probably the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in too I can t and wouldn t want to fault it Just perfect 
355935,Canal House, no aircon mattress a bit unconfortable, Canal House is just 2 min walking from Anne Frank House walking distance to main attractions Staff was very helpful and attentive Very clean and stylish accommodation 
355936,Canal House, No real bad points just a church clock ticking the hours nearby but it stops at midnight and one can just close the window which is sound proof , Top location in Amsterdam near a very cool area Styling might not accommodate everyone s taste spacey room caring personnel 
355937,Canal House, It was rather expensive but probably comparable to lots of other boutique hotels in Amsterdam , Staff were exceptionally friendly accommodating Location decor great 
355938,Canal House, For the price paid breakfast was lacking hot items ie eggs at extra cost Even with elevator we needed to climb stairs to room , Good Location Nice Room
355939,Canal House, No air condition it broke down and we got there temp was in twenties we were there four days and still wasn t working when we left, Location was the best central able to walk to everything and the staff especially was welcoming and willing to assist near good restaurants as well
355940,Canal House, If I was being super fussy I don t like a bath and shower in the actual bedroom but that is purely a personal preference , We loved the courtyard garden The room was excellent tea coffee and water provided We loved looking out over the canal The bed and pillows were very comfortable Nice bath and shower products provided I liked the bath oil nice and relaxing after sightseeing The room overlooking the garden for breakfast was lovely The breakfast was delicious and nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were friendly and efficient The reception staff even printed our boarding passes for our return flight 
355941,Canal House, Nothing really but if being picky a little more wardrobe space and some drawers would be nice , The beds and in particular the pillows were very comfortable I usually end up with neck ache Breakfast was very good Staff friendly and very helpful 
355942,Canal House, We had a second floor room which was a bit cramped for space around the bed WiFi reception in the room was poor , The bed was very comfortable and the hotel location is excellent quiet and peaceful but within easy walking distance of many of the main attractions The staff were all very helpful and friendly 
355943,Canal House, I did not like the fact that the bath and shower were actually in the bedroom rather than in a separate room I did not like the view from my room which was essentially that of a blank wall , The beautiful garden and the helpful staff who were very good at suggesting restaurants and booking tickets The bar was also very pleasant and the breakfast good 
355944,Canal House, Nothing really it was all good just maybe a little expensive compared to other hotels But the location made up for that , Absolutely brilliant Accomodation very central excellent service from staff who couldn t do enough for you 
355945,Canal House, Just the stairs leading to the room as they were a bit tough to maneuver with bags but the staff are always there to help with them so nothing to worry about, Great staff Great location Great amenities and products in the room and excellent design
355946,Canal House, We liked it all, Fabulous position wonderful atmosphere perfect for a relaxing break staff couldn t do enough to help great recommendations for where to eat
355947,Canal House, No restaurant for evening meals , Stylish spacious room Friendly helpful staff Great location Bar snacks surprisingly good and plenty big enough for us Canal view Really can t fault the hotel 
355948,Canal House, I just thought it was overpriced although overall a good hotel, The black and purple decor was great although a little scuffed looking in some area s We asked for a quiet room and thats what we got very peaceful and looking out onto wonderful canal view 
355949,Canal House,No Negative, Amazing hotel located in a very central area but not on a busy street quiet room The hotel design is superlative and details cared Romantic room ideal for couples Bathtub inside the room it is a fantastic idea Superb bath and body products are provided The room comes with a complimentary coffee tea maker Nice buffet breakfast served in a cosy and relaxing atmosphere Friendly and helpful staff 
355950,Canal House, breakfast was inclusive but could have had a larger variety Additional items had to be purchased from a menu , Location was excellent to visit Amsterdam downtown we had a very comfortable room somehow larger than most rooms right in front of the garden
355951,Canal House, Everything was great we would however have preferred a kettle to a drinks machine in the room , Friendly staff who made our anniversary special with a few extra touches such as balloons a heart designed on the bed and complimentary drinks 
355952,Canal House, Service is not always what you would expect from such a high end hotel they don t go the extra mile to make sure you re a satisfied customer I felt like they didn t care that I was unhappy about my room We had to complain to 2 different people before they admitted having an equivalent room they could mive us to Also they first charged me extra for something we didn t take from the mini bar I had to insist we hadn t consumed anything and they made it clear that they doubted our word didn t apologize and finally gave me CASH back because they couldn t return money to a debit card , Beautiful hotel and delicious breakfast
355953,Canal House, The only slight annoyance we had was the lift located outside our room other hotel residents chatting loudly every morning from 6am while they waited for the lift to arrive but this is unavoidable in any hotel was only an issue for me as I m a light sleeper my husband wasn t disturbed at all , Beautiful hotel in a beautiful location Quite possibly the most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in Staff members were wonderful so friendly and helpful We were e mailed a few days before we arrived and asked if they could arrange transfers or restaurant reservations which I was really impressed by I asked if we could be allocated a room at the back of the hotel which we were given and when we checked in we were told we had been upgraded How fabulous We will definitely be returning next year and recommending this hotel to all our friends 
355954,Canal House, Loved everything, Friendly staff great location beautiful room and use of products and a lovely breakfast I would love to come back and stay here again 
355955,Canal House,No Negative, The staff is brilliant Very pleasant and always eager to help Excellent check in system at the bar Everyone was smiling and greeting us all the time Loved them Cheers 
355956,Canal House, Booked with booking com Upgraded to another room when arrived for 100 euros for exceptional room over looking canal The payment was a disaster They held funds before I arrived which was find but even after me wxplaning they took further payment on checking out which I thought ment just releasing what they had held bit no So here goes My bill was 600 00 euros but the hotel held a further 1000 00 yes a thousand A week later I still have not received this back Which has left me severely out of pocket Many phone calls and emails later still not resolved Had to cancel new year crlebrations as had no cash Also for a 300 British ponds a night room You would have to pay extra for hot items at breakfast Bathroom smelt a bit of sewage And don t take the toiletries or they will tell you it s the hotels properties, Location was good
355957,Canal House, A couple of cocktails didn t quite hit the spot however their G T was amazing , Canal house is the kind of boutique hotel we love The staff couldn t do enough for us and were clearly focused on providing the highest customer service The hotel is located in our favourite part of Amsterdam Quiet sophisticated and away from the tourist traps We loved it 
355958,Canal House, Room slightly cramped Noise from Guests walking in room above us was slightly annoying at times Better soundproofing , Good communication before arrival Staff offered to book restaurants for us over Christmas period Relaxed friendly atmosphere and helpful staff Great decor and easy access to public transport and many sights within walking distance Very comfortable bed

355962,Canal House, Nothing, The staff in Canal House are exceptional They literally could not do enough whether it was booking a restaurant giving sight seeing recommendations or general advice It makes a pleasant experience to stay in a hotel with its own personality as to the faceless chain hotels which seem to be so dominant nowadays 
355963,Canal House,No Negative, Staff were wonderful very helpful and gave us an excellent city map with suggestions on how best to make the most of our stay Hotel was beautiful and suited our needs perfectly Couldn t fault a single thing Only wish we d been able to stay longer

355968,Canal House, As stated above the Bathroom IN the bedroom without any privacy at all Bizarre for two friends to share a room or a new couple to stay in , Beautiful hotel with exquisite premises Great location and breakfast included is awesome However bathroom is IN the bedroom no privacy at all You are physically bathing and washing next to the bed Awkward if you are a new couple or sharing a room with a friend Quite bizarre 
355969,Canal House,No Negative, Entire staff went above and beyond Could not be friendlier nor more helpful with directions reservations or sightseeing suggestions Service was impeccable Staff also followed up to ensure our dining experience as suggested by them was satisfactory Rooms well appointed with European linens warm and cozy 
355970,Canal House, The breakfast buffet included in room rate was delightful however instead of charging 7 to 10 Euro extra for hot breakfast options why not just include those items as well especially for the nightly room rate we paid Don t like to feel nickeled and dimed , Lovely accommodation and outstanding staff Beautiful interior keeping much of the historic feel 
355971,Canal House,No Negative, The beds are SO comfortable and the room shades made the room dark enough to sleep late The staff was really friendly and accommodating We especially loved the garden

355979,Canal House, Nothing negative to report really Do note that the free breakfast is just standard continental though cooked options are available for a charge , The hotel property is absolutely lovely located literally around the corner from the Anne Frank House and countless boutique stores and restaurants Our room 21 was probably the nicest in the hotel very spacious with a lofty ceiling and a wall of windows overlooking the canal The staff was very friendly and accommodating 
355980,Canal House, Avoid Room 4 unless you enjoy limited daylight no view and being woken early by enthusiastic staff using the adjacent service staircase , Friendly helpful and attentive staff relaxing and well laid out courtyard garden best historic features and decoration kept alongside good modern design great location close to everything you would wish to see and transport but on a quiet and elegant stretch of canal 
355981,Canal House, My only suggestion would be a grab bar in the bath tub It was very deep and I had trouble getting out , I love this hotel it is small but the rooms are very large and well equipped The location is perfect and the staff are all very friendly and helpful I will definitely stay here again
