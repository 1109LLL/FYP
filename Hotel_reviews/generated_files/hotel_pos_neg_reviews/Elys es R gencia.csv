185096,Elys es R gencia, Apparently free coffee and Tea in bar area We were not aware and actually paid for a coffee , Excellent Location with easy walking to the Champs Elysees and the Eiffel Tower Spoiled for choice with the restaurants and bars within a 10 minute walk of the hotel Very comfortable bed with the quietest most consistent Air Conditioning I have experienced Normally I have to live without Air Con because it keeps the wife awake no such problem here Rooms very clean and towels changed daily Tea and coffee making facilities in room which is rare in some parts of France these days No pressure to use the hotel facilities 
185097,Elys es R gencia, The lack of a bar No one was ever there in the evenings Very slow and unreliable wifi , The location was great The women at the front desk was great She gave us a lot of great tips on getting around the city and provided nice suggestions on where to eat
185098,Elys es R gencia, Hotel couldn t arrange for early check in due to fully being booked issue Limited electrical sockets whereas all of f them used for lighting and TV, Location room was spacious and hygiene set in the bathroom all L occitane brand 
185099,Elys es R gencia, The hotel has a lot to do to meet parisian hotel standards It wasn t pleasant at all waking in the early morning every day because of the staff making too much noise and the fact that it was easy to hear everything that was going on the floor due their thin doors After 2 days in the hotel you just give up using the elevator and all the other guests too I don t know why but their elevator is extremely slow and one day it took 10 minutes to get to my floor The SPA is not operational when I went down to use the sauna it was turned off the staff couldnt help me until one recepcionist told me that I had to let them know 1 hour before so I told them I would like to use it in 1 hour after a while they told me it wasn t working Another issue was with the check out we had 3 rooms and wanted to stay until 18h or pay for another day to stay until later The hotel was almost fully booked and they told me that they would be able to provide 1 room until that time I asked them which one and they told me to choose between room 14 or 24 I chose 14 After a while he calls me and tells me that only 24 is available The whole hotel needs to be reshaped I ll never going back to this one and dont recomend it at all , nothing

185104,Elys es R gencia, The room was cleaned but supplies not replenished nor were the bathroom glasses cleaned and refreshed Not as easy to get to from Airport as once thought You could tell Breakfast was leftovers from the day before But lovely people in the dining room , Conveniently located to Metro stops Nice Amenities The Concierge very helpful with all types of information Room was in great condition Was within walking distance for good walkers to landmarks and bridges 
185105,Elys es R gencia, Everything , This hotel can NOT be rate as a 4 star hotel even by europien standarts IN MY OPINION For the money you get a small room very modest breakfast a cracking bed etc Stuff was ok but good will is not enough

185107,Elys es R gencia,No Negative, First I was given a room with the view to the wall which made me clostrofobic but after me asking for another room everything was sorted out in no time and I received the upgrade to the best room in their sister hotel just a minute away with excellent view which I am very thankful to The receptionist lady at the sister hotel was extremely nice and helpful 10 out of 10 for her service 
185108,Elys es R gencia, Everything Not like the photos at all it doesnt deserve a 2 stars hotel, The photos in booking com dont reflect the reality one of the worst hotel experience Regards Ahmad

185112,Elys es R gencia, this hotel belongs to the fifties decoration service toilet amenities entrance and lobby very un comfortable for people who can not tolerate noise i was annoyed by the noise coming from a man coughing all night in the next room plus people talking in the street you basically should think of this place as bed and breakfast motel and not a four stars hotel , how confident the staff despite thier poor hotel and facilities
185113,Elys es R gencia, If they would add more English speaking channels , Everything The staff were super friendly and helpful the location was incredible close to everything yet far from the crowd the room was spacious and clean beds were comfortable would definitely recommend this hotel

185118,Elys es R gencia, Internet was not great at room 65 Although I did expect more for a 4 star but didn t deliver it Although been upgraded to superior room I find it small for a space in a 4 star Separate toilet from bathroom which we didn t like as no wash basin and separated from the bathroom , Breakfast was great and the location too Staff are friendly Had an upgrade too Hotel was easy to navigate as its close to city centre Love love love l occitane shampoo and body wash of the hotel 
185119,Elys es R gencia, The rooms were very small for the price I was expecting better I have a problem with the advertising that we could get a better price if we booked directly I was told I payed to much using booking com and I felt like a chump I really did not like this hotel especially for that reason , The location was great and the staff very nice and helpful 
185120,Elys es R gencia, Very small room and very small bed better to say short If you are taller than 180 be ready that your feets will hang off out the bed The lack of sound insulation and the room is very dark and everything is pretty old The breakfast is terrible for 25 EUR very poor, Good location Early Check in for 25 euros Kind and friendly staff willing to help everyone Offered to move to a neighbouring hotel to the large room but I refused Perhaps in vain 
185121,Elys es R gencia, Nothing , Staff were very friendly and accommodating regarding special requests The room was comfortable We enjoyed the location of the hotel seeing as it was between the Eiffel tower and the Arc de Triomphe

185125,Elys es R gencia, not impressed with the superior room very small bathroom no minibar and basic amenities in room no iron board , location was excellent Breakfast was decent Private car park I like the fact they send email prior to arrival where you can book extras 
185126,Elys es R gencia, Lift broken which isnt good when tour eon the 5th floor Area very noisy and rooms bad acousticly both between rooms and through windows Could hear every car go past Breakfast poor, Location

185129,Elys es R gencia, no sleepers in the rooms WC is not in the bathroom I felt like I stayed in hostel because of separate WC Bathroom AC not working properly, friendly staff breakfast location clean same quality for my second stay after 1 year

185131,Elys es R gencia, TV size was small for the room size TV channels lacked the entertaining English channels Lighting can be better in the rooms in the evening the lighting is not enough , All Staff especially Jasmine She is very professional and friendly L Occitane toiletries 
185132,Elys es R gencia, The lobby area could be cheered up justa bit The corridors on y floor could use a little sprucing up, Location was good for my needs on this trip The location was priced adequately In the event it s gone into my private listing of Paris Hotels 
185133,Elys es R gencia, too few electrical sockets TV remote not working very bad curtain configuration leaves 25 cm of street light leave the room lit at night , general classy interior venue location personnel grateful for critical input good breakfast

185137,Elys es R gencia, The pillows were not that comfortable which did not represent a major issue , The staff were exceptionally nice and responsive The cleanliness of the hotel was remarkable 
185138,Elys es R gencia, Only one key issued per room inconvenient if you want to split up the location is ok close to subway and the champs elysee but if you ve been to Paris before it s a bit far from the other major sites walking Purely based on personal preference , Staff is friendly and wonderful Rooms were pretty spacious for Paris standards 
185139,Elys es R gencia, The shower wasn t high enough and the bath was too short so you either had to bathe with bent legs or crouch down under the shower which also caused the bathroom to flood , the location and staff were all amazing the bed was comfy and the room very clean was a minute walk to the arch de triomphe and 10 minute walk to the Eiffel tower the closest metro was George V which was about a 2 minute walk and took you everywhere you needed to go for I euro 40 a day 
185140,Elys es R gencia, noise at 4am in morning from other people in the hotel , this time as the weather was excellent we didnt eat in the hotel as we wanted to eat outside in the lovely weather i liked the fact the toilet was away from the shower room bliss in the morning 
185141,Elys es R gencia, Nothing Everything was excellent, Excellent Hotel Location is amazing Staff are very professional Yassmin and Magy even night staff All are excellent This is my second time staying in the same hotel Wish to visit Paris again and stay in the same hotel
185142,Elys es R gencia, Old elevator takes a lot of time We reserved two rooms same price but totally different in quality One was very large and bright whereas the other one was smaller and darker Electrical outlets are connected to the lighting switch Woke up to find my phone with no battery , Good location Quiet rooms
185143,Elys es R gencia, Nothing, Excellent location within walking distance of the arc de triomphe the eiffel tower and numerous metro stops Our superior room was very spacious by Parisian standards and even had a balcony The staff in reception had excellent english and were willing to assist at any small query will stay again 
185144,Elys es R gencia, The room is not sound proof at least at the 2nd floor you can hear what people are talking on the hallway I guess that goes both ways You also need to leave the key at the reception when you leave the hotel which is pretty uncommon We asked if we could work on our laptops from the hotel s lobby and we were politely told no , Location is really great about 5 minutes walk from the Arc de Triomphe de l toile or 10 minutes walk from the Eiffel Tower Staff was nice room was pretty nice cozy Bed was confortable but the pillows not so much I m used to smaller pillows so I chose to sleep without The toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom Quality shampoo and shower gel from L Occitane 
185145,Elys es R gencia, There was little in the way of places to eat or get food Many of the local places were closed on the weekend and we had to stoop to getting McDonald s for our Sunday breakfast because there was nothing open The restaurants around the hotel were all closed on the weekend Our eating experience was dismal at best but that is not the fault of the hotel , The location was excellent for walking to all the sites and activities we wanted to do The staff was more than helpful and told us about the 57E maximum on the taxi cost to the airport We were overcharged by 30E and reported it to the hote when we returned to the USl The hotel got back to us immediately and said they would report it to the taxi company We appreciate that they took the time to address our concern even after we had left the country 
185146,Elys es R gencia, Communication was bad the elevator was not working no work out facility and too dark A connecting room is not what they say it is, The bed was comfortable and the location was good
185147,Elys es R gencia, We booked a standard room which turned out to be tiny and shower was broken Paper thin walls and were kept awake all night on our first night , Friendliness of staff Close to l arc de triomphe champs lys es Free upgrade on 2nd night and late check out 
185148,Elys es R gencia, Wifi connection is not so good The hotel was noisy for most of the time especially during early morning probably due to the old building , The hotel location is excellent close to all attraction sites Rooms are very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful especially Ali from reception 
185149,Elys es R gencia, The internet access is free but runs through a portal that requires you to log in and jump through a few hoops every time you check in again Very tedious and not very fast either , Great location spacious rooms by Paris standards very friendly staff The breakfast is very nice a little pricey although not more so than an alternative we tried one day just down the street Nice and clean bathrooms daily turn down service overall a great experience 
185150,Elys es R gencia, The room is very small and the toilet is separated with the shower without even a sank , The location is great and convenient and service is absolutely out of expectation They come to make your bed and clean the shower room everyday and left with a block of chocolate on the pillow 
185151,Elys es R gencia, You have to be aware that there is not a lot of privacy for showering etc , I loved the room it was super cute Location is amazing plenty of room for 3 of us 
185152,Elys es R gencia, i felt that the cleanliness in the rooms were not up to the mark got stuck in the lift and we had to wait for nearly 20 min before the lift could start the emergency bell did not seem to work and we were not able to get the connection luckily i had the hotel no so i called them and we got rescued, good location friendly staff always ready to help when we checked in we got two of the three rooms before the promised check in time was good for us
185153,Elys es R gencia, It gets a little noisy both from the morning traffic and from loud doors why do all the hotels have those banging doors It was pretty expensive not just the room but also the breakfast and the laundry service Then again we went during Euro 2016 so I cannot hold it against them , The rooms were nice and spotless clean We had a view of Avenue Marceau not breathtaking but ample and pretty The staff were friendly we found macarons upon arrival We went to Paris for a Euro 2016 match so location wasn t our first concern Even so the hotel is close enough to several Metro lines There are many good bistros and brasseries nearby 
185154,Elys es R gencia, rooms weren t huge but it is central Paris shower wasn t great, nice central location good value for money staff very friendly and helpful
185155,Elys es R gencia, Price is too high 170 euro for one night small room lights was broken bed legs were already bent as there was dozens of honeymoons out there for 30euro i couldve take a pullman hotel in front of tour eiffel bigger room no broken lights beds or something like that ,No Positive
185156,Elys es R gencia, Rooms needed a way of letting a little more air and the room was quite small not for a large person , Breakfast was good and efficiently served rooms comfortable and clean Excellent location and very friendly staff 
185157,Elys es R gencia, Bathroom sink was stained and not clean No shower curtain so bathroom floor was always wet every time we take shower Room is not really as spacious as in photos My girlfriend was sad that there were no flower pots in the balcony as other rooms had , The hotel is located in the center of Paris 5 minutes walk from L Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees and Crazy Horse Paris show 10 minutes walking along the beautiful Seine river will take you to Eiffel Tower Staff are very nice and friendly they will help you out the best they could 
185158,Elys es R gencia, No complaints , Very nice staff the room was typically European small but very nice bed and great bathroom amenities Location is perfect we were able to walk to Eiffel Tower and Arch de Triumph and plenty of good restaurants in the vicinity Neighborhood felt safe 
185159,Elys es R gencia, The only thing I can mention is extra 19 euros for breakfast but the breakfast itself and service worth it If you try to go outside for a breakfast you can never find something comparable for this price , This hotel completely deserves high rating and 4 stars given to it It is located in the very center of Paris 5 minutes walk from L Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees It is nice boutique hotel clean fully equipped quiet suitable for families with children and couples as well as for business trips In the room they have tea coffee making facilities bathroom and bed are comfortable Shampoo soap and shower gel in the bathroom need to be mentioned separately as it is top quality brand with charming fragrance scent I liked scent very much and even bought a big bottle for taking home

185162,Elys es R gencia, Although we had a superior room it was rather small with very small windows one of which did not properly close so the street noise was disturbing almost throughout entire night TV was extremely small Towels that I left on the floor were not changed just hanged up again Coffee at the breakfast was very bad quality , Reception was very friendly and helpful Bed and pillows comfortable Location is ok and we were lucky finding a place in front of the hotel to park our car

185181,Elys es R gencia, Moquette Rugs Carpets in the room and the elevators is dirty Staff at the reception is a bit too sport dressed and easy It should be more professional and serious Staff at breakfast is perfectly operating Cheap paper posters into the elevator Gives you flavor of cheap hotel which for the rate is not at all The chairs at breakfast are obsolete and cheap All needs a re branding for what the Hotel pretends to be of standing , Position Calm side internal
