424226,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, There were several things that we were unhappy with throughout the course of our stay 1 The staff gave us 2 single beds to sleep in we requested one double bed when we asked to move they allowed it to happen one day later but without even an apology for the inconvenience 2 The housekeeping staff walked into the room when we were in it a total of 4 times throughout our short stay They did not knock but simply used their access key to come into the room at various points throughout the day 3 Staff weren t outright rude but made no attempt to ensure a pleasant stay very apathetic , The location was excellent Close to main district but the nicer end away from the hustle and bustle The lollies around the lobby were a nice touch 
424227,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, We only had 3 nights , Absolutely fantastic hotel in a perfect location with fantastic staff and Lucretia accommodation The pools were lovely and very relaxed Pool bar excellent and fanstatic value for money Will be back next year and the year after that too 
424228,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Maid service was slightly erratic Sometime clearing items that we needed like an unfinished bottle of wine and sometime leaving items like empty water bottles and rubbish rather should have been cleared Standard of cleanliness otherwise good, Excellent hotel in a central location Lovely decor and very comfortable rooms Welcome drink on arrival was an added bonus
424229,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Breakfast room in a basement No bar on the rooftop, Late check out Great bedroom even though de Luxe is not worth it just a bath on your terrace terrace on the 1st floor with no view 
424230,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, WiFi connection not that good on arrival we were asked for the debit card that we booked the hotel on which we did not take with us and the receptionist was quite aggressive towards us demanding that we provide it We didn t need that after travelling All the other staff were lovely , We liked the position of the hotel very easy to walk to everything complimentary drink in the reception very nice touch Most of the staff were lovely and very helpful especially the concierge 
424231,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, More knowledge in gluten free foods and ability to access a room to freshen up before flying home, Attention to detail hidden extras Plus staff were incredible 
424232,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, The pools were more plunge pools than actual pools but were still nice Our A C wouldn t cool the room down to the temperature we wanted I had called the front desk and was told the temp would kick in within 10 mins of us setting the temperature but it never did We were there for 4 days and the room never cooled down below 25 degrees even though the thermostat was set for 19 degrees I also think the temperature was locked to be eco friendly because we couldn t get the temperature to set to anything below 19 degrees either Not a big deal since we were only there to shower and sleep but it is the reason I gave it a good rating vs an excellent rating for room facilities I prefer my room on the cool side to sleep Hotel breakfast was good but a bit pricey at 23 euros per person We only ate there on our last day , Hotel was nicely situated in the heart of Barcelona s most popular areas The ladies at the bar Paola and Adriana were fantastic and took great care of us each evening Definitely a very nice hotel with great decor They also provided gummy candies throughout the on the main level and bar areas along with coffee stations for when the bar was closed Nice lobby and bar seating areas We stayed in room 609 and it was a nice sized room with a view of the internal area elevator shaft 
424233,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, nothing comes to mind, great location for all that Barcelona has to offer Staff were excellent from check in right the way through Breakfast very good Hotel decor is great will definitely stay again

424235,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, No glasses cleared from the room for our entire stay The pool photo is exceptionally well taken the pool is actually pretty small and situated by the bar with people drinking smoking eating we didn t use it once in the end Drinks on arrival we didn t receive anything until we raised this even though we saw multiple guests arrive and receive a much warmer welcome than we had , Breakfast was very nice a little steep if you re not going to destroy the all you can eat side of things Great location for all things touristy Local cava served in the hotel was very nice and reasonably priced 
424236,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup,No Negative, The location is excellent It s just steps off of Plaza Catalunya the hottest hub in the city but it s quiet The staff couldn t be nicer or more helpful The bottle of wine and chocolate truffles in my room upon arrival were lovely and there is a gourmet coffee machine and tea in the room with free bottled water replenished daily 
424237,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, nothing , we booked the cheapest room via booking com upon arrival we like many others were upgraded to a room with a balcony facing the lower pool the room was well decorated the linens and layout stylish the bed very comfortable we enjoyed the upgraded room the less expensive rooms look out into a central courtyard elevator shaft which would have been a bit claustrophobic or to the main street a word of warning though we were on the 2nd floor and for those people who book the 1st floor rooms with the private hot tubs all the rooms above can see down into your private hot tub since the triangular shade over the spa doesn t completely block the view from above we were surprised and happy to receive a complementary bottle of wine and chocolates on our first night the in room espresso maker was appreciated I didn t realize that the property had two pools prior to booking which was nice The vibe of the hotel is hip but still very comfortable and relaxed Front desk services very friendly We did not eat there nor did we get breakfast but we were very pleased with the hotel the linens the amenities he location is superb very central to shopping the Gothic quarter transportation airport bus subway La Rambla restaurants If I return to Barcelona I would definitely stay there again and would recommend to friends 
424238,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Lack of natural light from windows due to being on 1st floor facing atrium I also arrived late at night but it was very quiet at night as requested away from the busy street I would like to see an improvement on english tv channels besides just BBC World News As a solo female traveller i don t stay out too long after dinner and i like to relax with a movie or some other comedy entertainment show This was seriously lacking , In the lobby reception area they had jars of sweet treats that guests were able to help themselves to they left a stack of napkins and a pair of tongs for picking up sweets The complimentary water that were in glass bottles placed in the room really makes a difference Walking distance from hotel to alot of major sights and attractions Wifi is decent Never dropped signal during my stay Shower had excellent pressure and bathroom came with luxurious bathrobes 
424239,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Only a couple of small niggles At check in they didn t give us any information about the surrounding area or show us where to find our room which are the small things that make a difference to a stay Also the used glasses from out welcome drink and complementary wine didn t get cleared from the room during our stay , Bed really comfy the room was clean and the shower was great The view from our balcony was nice our room was on the back of the hotel overlooking the pool and seating area The lobby bar area was smart and the sweets in the bar were a nice touch

424246,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, No microwave In the room but there was a fridge I read the breakfast was pricey so we skipped it and ate elsewhere The staff looked at me a little crazy when I asked to reheat my food likely very American of me but it was cool , The room we stayed in had a private jacuzzi and was great It was not 100 private as far as visibility from other guests and apartments were concerned but it was ours only to use with some privacy The bed was great and the bathroom was perfect as well The size of the room could have been slightly larger around the bed but it was not a deal breaker The lobby is very stylish clean and chic They offer you sparkling wine water or juice upon arrival Overall the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful I would stay here again Shopping restaurants bars 24 grocery and many tourists attractions are all within blocks of the hotel A location this hotel is in the middle of it ALL

424293,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, I may be asking too much but I wished that the receptionist checking me in could have been a little more attentive to my telling her that I didn t have the time right now as I was 1 hour late for a meeting and a little more lenient flexible and not try to get everything done upon check in but leave things for later if it was possible , everything else was excellent I wish I could have stayed a little longer

424315,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, 2 singles beds instead of real large bed even if we reserved a real large bed Rooftop pool is sadly very very quiet Maybe music Something to make it more attractive Gym is not worth to mention But better than nothing if you need to stretch up your legs and burns calories, Best breakfast buffet Great hotel clean well decorated Friendly staff

424332,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, One strange moment was a bottle of water out of the mini bar miraculously became half full after we had been out for the day This was very odd and it was not like this when we arrived at the hotel A little bit worrying to think it was someone like a cleaner who drank it as they are trusted to enter your room where all your possessions are However no times of ours were touched or taken in any way so no issue but just a little odd that s all , The hotel is in an excellent location we were able to shop sight see sun bathe and nip out for food and then pop back to the room to freshen up easily The staff were always friendly and happy to help when ever called upon The staff at the bar pool side were very good especially one man who was always darting about and waiting upon us like we were royalty Amazing The room was very clean very comfortable and perfect for escaping the busy city

424424,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, A misunderstood with the breakfast in room we ordered at 9 30a a breakfast on terrace in room and they thought it was down on their terrace We finally had to pay more than 45 Euros for a simple tray with orange juice yogurt and few viennoiseries croissants etc Anyway this wasn t really efficient , The atmosphere and the decoration are really original the wood experience is full and this natural comfort embrace this place and envelop your soul 
424425,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Bedroom looks great but is impractical With very little space in wardrobe and drawers for storing clothes and other normal holiday things OK if you are just there on an overnight stay , Exceptional staff who do their very best to help a new visitor to the city Stylish decor with some very quiet and comfortable areas A good retreat from the lively and busy road outside

424429,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Nothing I didn t like at all , Everything about this hotel is just perfect The styling is incredible The staff were all very charming and helpful Also the prices in the bar were the best we have come across in nearly a month of travelling in Europe Will definitely stay at this hotel next time we are in Barcelona 
424430,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Had requested some extras be left in the room for our arrival as it was our honeymoon I had to contact reception at 6pm to remind them of this , Selection at breakfast was brilliant Food was lovely

424432,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, We would be struggling to find any fault with this hotel other than the lounge area s closing very early at around midnight even for guests It would have been nice to have the option to remain outdoors in the seating area by the pool with a coffee later in the evening , The location of this hotel and the room facilities were excellent and well worth paying just a little bit more for As a young muslim couple food is always a consideration for us but the breakfast options were very wide and we definitely didn t go hungry The service from reception staff was also of a very high standard every request was met with a smile and we found them to be incredibly helpful particularly Maria 
424433,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Nothing, Beautiful hotel in the city centre Beds were so comfortable The staff were all so friendly and even presented my boyfriend with a cake and cava for his birthday We stayed in a room with terrace and hot tub and well worth the extra cost for an extra special weekend Would return without a doubt
424434,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, A mirror in a bathroom fall over my kid I ve expected at least a little compensation some gesture on behalf of the management but nothing Charged me 40 euro for the breakfast and wish us a wonderful day Not so customer oriented service , The location
424435,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, I booked the room 8 month in advance and asked for a late checkout This was the answer H10 Metropolitan informed us that it s possible to arrange this but they can t guarantee it therefore the request is subject to availability at the time of check in I Explained that I don t mine paying for extra time Bottom line NO LATE CHECKOUT , Great location Very good breakfast 
424436,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, The receptionist called NAIMA she is so racist not polite at all super rude Hated her service she doesnt even know how to speak english , The rooms
424437,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, Bit pricy for breakfast wifi limited e g VOI was not available nor were outgoing emails Promised possibility of late check out for days prior to checkout but refused to confirm asked us to call the morning of checkout and only then declined request without seemingly checking very hard would have preferred to have been told no possibility from day one A few housekeeping omissions but were made good as soon as notified to reception , Perfect Location very friendly and helpful staff sparkling wine reception 
424438,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, No UK TV but this was a minor point as we were not there to watch TV although a catch up on the news would have been good , Great location very comfortable clean breakfast was superb with just about anything you would want Staff were very friendly Would definitely stay again

424441,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, The rooms are smallish with next to no wardrobe space or an area to open cases , Has to be one of the best breakfast offerings we have come across The staff were very friendly and helpful Right in the middle of Barcelona so very convenient There was a Car Park adjacent to the Hotel that did cost 27 Euro that was a good thing considering the central position A great bathroom with double basins making washing clothes easy as well as a large shower that was not over a bath The bed was comfortable

424443,H10 Metropolitan 4 Sup, The courtyard is overlooked by offices and flats in all directions and both pools are smaller than they look in the picture , As far as service style and amenities it s one of the best 4 hotels I ve stayed in Great location for exploring the city however it s an enjoyable stroll 45 minutes 1hour if the beach is more what you re after The staff went out of their way to make customers feel like welcome guests and the hotel includes some unannounced complimentary amenities you usually only see in hotels with private club floors Not as luxurious as a top end 5 hotel but much more on offer than an average 4 Happily exceeded my expectations
