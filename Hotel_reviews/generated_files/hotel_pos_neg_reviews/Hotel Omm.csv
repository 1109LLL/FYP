434836,Hotel Omm, Staff kinda not up to the level you would expect from a 5 star hotel Breakfast is with very few options and limited Not even a good morning when arrived in the breakfast area Asked for a cafe latte as coffee and they could not make it in any morning , Location is very good In walking distance to all the epic landmarks of Barcelona 
434837,Hotel Omm,No Negative, The view from the balcones The terrace At the top Of the hotel with a very nice view to La Pedrera Wounderful natural juicies An also with a small swimming pool The Location is just perfect Very close for everywhere
434838,Hotel Omm, Nothing , The staff was so kind and helpfull I really enjoyed their way of communication Additionally hotel was so good and really enjoyed the room and the roof 
434839,Hotel Omm, overpriced hotel can stay cheaper near area somewhere for half the price So cslled hip hotel music in lobby sends you too sleep Many ither hip hotels in area Breakfast was overpriced so went outside to eat Only news channels in English , Style amd location and terrace
434840,Hotel Omm, Lighting in the bathroom was not good Having the closet in the bathroom area was strange No tea coffee facilities in the room but were obtained on request , Breakfast was amazing Staff were bright cheery so helpful Super location Rooms were large airy very comfortable Would definitely stay again
434841,Hotel Omm,No Negative, The Lobby bar is exceptional The service the stuff the quality of food and beverages are the best At night it is a great party place as well as during the daytime you could comfortably eat your Roca ice cream there or enjoy a glass of lunch cava 
434842,Hotel Omm, If you are a family with kids or teens If you like fresh air and open windows If you like when reception really takes care and send portiers by your check out to help with your luggage do not book this hotel ,No Positive
434843,Hotel Omm, The shower could have been together with the rest of the bathroom facilities , The room was very clean spacious and serviced brilliantly The bed was very comfortable Our room had a great view The tube station was just across the street 
434844,Hotel Omm,No Negative, Location was quite good In spite of facing to main street the room was very quiet Inside the hotel there is a Michelin stared restaurant Of course it was quite good 
434845,Hotel Omm, They were rennpvating club facility in the 1 fllor so all usual parties took place in the lobby if you are staying at the floors 1 to 3 you can hear the music quite well But this should be fixed by April 17 , My place to stay in Barcelona Everything is perfect starting from location and ending with very efficient and friendly staff Best value for money Hint pick a room facing inner yard on higher floors 
434846,Hotel Omm, The pool wasnt open on the terrace but I guess it was Feb although it was 20 degrees and sunny 1st world issues , Really friendly reception staff happy to help Kindly organised a birthday cake for my son s 18th without me asking 
434847,Hotel Omm, At check in there was a 100 charge put on my credit card per night for any unforseen incidentals I stayed 2nights and it will take 10 15 days to refundo this to me I am told How is this legal when we had fully paid for our trip up front This was the only thing I could complain about , Live music daily in the bar great selection of complimentary toiletries in the room cocktails were fantastic and good serving sizes for the price concierge were so helpful recommending restaurants and making reservations for us 
434848,Hotel Omm, The design is modern but the open concept of the washroom with a separate toilet area far from the shower area is not too convenient The hardware and furniture are starting to be worn and needs some updating , The staff was very very helpful and friendly when we asked to change room and for help in locating embassies The restaurant downstairs is excellent Ambience is great and location is unbeatable 
434849,Hotel Omm, We were close to laundry room and it was too noisy at night and in the mornings but just a small minus , location is just perfect and surrounded by good restaurants and shops Really good quality of sleep and staff really caring and efficient 
434850,Hotel Omm, the beds were not very comfy mattress far too firm the breakfast personal was much less helpful friendly, the great atmosphere the very comfortable room where you feel at home good wifi the reception men and door guys were very helpful and friendly
434851,Hotel Omm,No Negative, Hotel was very cozy and comfortable Staff was very friendly also Loved our room Bed was comfortable Great location close to many restaurants and shopping areas 
434852,Hotel Omm, Bad experience 2 30 am and I woke up with the party my neighbours where enjoying Despite calling to reception party where on until 3 am in the morning Beside the party rooms are not soundproof so avoid this hotel if you want to sleep and rest well ,No Positive
434853,Hotel Omm, For such a fantastic 5 start hotel the breakfast was extremely disappointing It wasn t a continental breakfast at all it lacked lots of options Plus I had to wait too long for my cappuccino after requesting it to the staff , Fantastic bedroom in minimalist style very comfortable bed nice spa center very cosy lobby where I could relax and work a bit on my MacBook 
434854,Hotel Omm, I didn t find the bed very comfortable and the room was very small considering how much it cost Room service very slow and expensive , The location of this hotel is very good 
434855,Hotel Omm, The door staff reception staff should have greeted me every time I walked in there are many times I walked in from my day and no greeting at all Other hotels I have stayed at of this calibre acknowledge you every time you enter The corridors to the room had an odd smell perhaps the carpet Little bit annoying having the bathroom separate from the shower and having to walk across the bedroom to reach the other , The architectural design of the hotel is amazing I really appreciated the design and style of the room and the hotel The spa was nice the roof top terrace and the bar were good Service at Roca Moo was very good 
434856,Hotel Omm,No Negative, The location is just perfect staff are friendly rooms are spacious and comfortable They have a rooftop which is also very nice Overall very happy with our stay and definitely great value for money
434857,Hotel Omm, Nothing to add here this hotel has everything , The room gorgeous The rooftop bar divine The service flawless They brought a chocolate cake to my room and my birthday was 3 days prior When I went out for the evening I came back to a box of truffles on my pillow with my window shades lowered What else could you ask for 
434858,Hotel Omm, A bit too cool for us Maybe not relaxed enough A bit pricy too , Great location View from terrace of la pedrera is great too Close to metro too Staff very helpful with restaurant bookings 
434859,Hotel Omm, The rooms were getting run down needed some upkeep If you stay more than overnight the standard rooms with balcony where we stayed had zero space to put your luggage and hardly any space to hang clothes for a couple , Service food and location were excellent to the main city Centre The staff were very helpful and attentive 
434860,Hotel Omm, Dark hallway Noisy hallway from the design of the lighting plates the guests chatting or housekeeping cart can easily be heard The room needs to get some maintainance Peeling off wall paints Over priced breakfast Better options around the corner , Great location for both vacation and business travels Near to major gaudi sites Tentative staffs Good pool bar drinks Perfect pool for kids since it s so small The swimming pool is an excellent and quiet place to relax and get a great tan Taxi waiting at the front door anytime
434861,Hotel Omm, The TV was a little blurred because it was a projector and projected in large format onto the wall prob just out of focus and too big for our room size, There wasn t much we didn t like the location the staff the pool area our room and best of all was the amazing dinner and service we had at Roco Moo I d definitely recommend Hotel Omm and we will be back 
434862,Hotel Omm, You need a torch to see in the corridors poor lighting in rooms no iron could not find mini bar for hours Very disappointing never five star W Hotel 100 times better , The location
434863,Hotel Omm, Design of room separate toilet to bathroom No iron Room key activated lights and you couldn t isolate them No hooks in bathroom, Friendly accommodating staff Comfy beds Delicious cocktails 
434864,Hotel Omm, Swimming pool on the roof is more for show rather than swimming Corridors to room are very dark and light strips were not that clean , Fantastic location right next to metro Diagonal close to designer stores and exclusive restaurants Fantastic staff friendly helpful attentive and outstanding Michelin star restaurant 
434865,Hotel Omm,No Negative, Omm hotel is in the hearth of Barcelona Very nica view and the restaurant Roca Moo is perfect Weekends are very fun because the hotel has a nice club The terrace is very romantic I love it 
434866,Hotel Omm, A small point but there is nowhere to hang the bathrobe in the room, The location the helpful staff the comfortable room the bar and restaurant It was our anniversary and the management did everything to make our stay memorable
434867,Hotel Omm, The toilet area was very open so make sure you are fully comfortable around your partner as no soundproofing Beds a little hard but that s a personal preference , Enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel Friendly and very helpful staff Very clean Lovely toiletries
434868,Hotel Omm, Very poor breakfast silly bar music Elvis walls paper thin with lots of noise transference Also garden view a ridiculous description the view was of the back of nearby houses apartments, Location
434869,Hotel Omm, I would have liked the room floor to be cleaned daily I stayed for 4 days and it was not swiped once The gym equipment should be upgraded , Loved the room very comfortable great lighting system and especially the balcony The addition of Bose mini Link made it even more pleasant The WiFi was working perfectly everywhere Personnel was efficient and professional 
434870,Hotel Omm, Staff at the front desk might have been more helpful sadly the steam room in the spa was not working the time we chose to use our water circuit vouchers a shame , Loved the little touches in the room laundry basket toilettries and SOFT towels Balcony was perfect Spa staff were lovely and highly professional my massage with Diego was excellent 
434871,Hotel Omm, The Michelin restaurant is a disappointment We ordered the beef cooked on a mini stove and it s very difficult to chew Probably too dry or over cook Informed to the waitress but there is no feedback from them , location is good Helpful and friendly staffs 
434872,Hotel Omm, None, Amazing hotel very friendly and helpful staff Really funky bar brilliant food and we recovered from all our excesses in the lovely spa Can t recommend it enough and will be back 
434873,Hotel Omm, The walls are too thin you can hear everyone who passes in the corridor cleaning of the room was late almost every day , Location is great the spa is great the staff in the front desk and in the hotel are very friendly and helpful nice lobby and excellent food 
434874,Hotel Omm, our waitress Maria in Roca Moo was not very friendly or helpful , the staff couldn t have been nicer and more gracious a special shout out to Jaime Javier and Marc they were awesome 
434875,Hotel Omm,No Negative, Everything Fabulous hotel in an amazing location Sleek spa splendid staff fine food refined design I m now returning with my husband to celebrate our anniversary 
434876,Hotel Omm, Our room was very close to the elevators and we were woken up at night by noisy people waiting for them Service at breakfast was very slow , The very comfortable rooms and superb bathrooms Very lively atmosphere downstairs 
434877,Hotel Omm, As a North American I would like a washcloth , The staff was very friendly and helpful The location is excellent The bar and restaurant are superb The breakfast is memorable 
434878,Hotel Omm, The Roca Moo does not compare with the original Moo Too in love with the process and not the customer , Having stayed here before we like the location and the general layout and ambiance Friendly staff and easy to stay 
434879,Hotel Omm,No Negative, The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful this is not a stuffy hotel at all It is design driven and yet not so precious you feel uncomfortable with children in our case aged 7 and 10 
434880,Hotel Omm,No Negative, Hotel Omm exceeded all expectations Comfortable stay all around Great location friendly staff outstanding rooftop bar close to everything Will definitely be back 
434881,Hotel Omm, That they didn t have wash cloths in the bathroom but not the biggest deal , We liked the breakfast and the family suite was perfect space and comfort for our family of 5 Also they give you a lot of little toiletry items in the bathroom in case you forgot something 
434882,Hotel Omm, There is a deceptive mirror on the wall and it makes the room bigger in photos It s only effect is that you end up walking straight into it and breaking your nose The owner must think we are all clowns It s boycott this hotel , The staff at reception are excellent 
434883,Hotel Omm, No bad experience , Hotel was amazing service more than perfect staff very polite and helpful Special thanks to Javi from the frond office He was very proffessional and helful Give us some great tips for the city
