459453,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I had to ask for another room the first one we got smelled like smoke and there is no way to open a window to air it There is no way to eat something in the hotel between 10 00 and 12 00 Breakfast closes at 10 rooftop restaurant only opens at 12 00 Not a big problem of course but if you re hungry , The room was large enough and practical 
459454,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Couldn t open windows in room , Nice hotel good helpful staff great peaceful location nr bus stop which gets into the centre in only 15 minutes Beautiful scenery along the way The Dutch people most helpful Had a fab time 
459455,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Great Hotel Not exactly in the city but a tram station is right outside it and the line goes straight to Dam Square Very clean comfortable rooms If you re lucky and get a corner room you ll get a fabulous view of Amsterdam
459456,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I am extremely unhappy about my stay at Ramada Apollo Amsterdam My clothes were taken from my room by the housekeepers and put through the laundry service ON THE FIRST NIGHT I was charged for this even though I did not want my laundry to be taken and cleaned Also I asked for fresh toilet paper because housekeeping didn t bother to show up for the first two days and the housekeepers didn t deliver it I also asked for fresh towels and extra milk twice Once it didn t come and the second time I was assured the receptionist will bring it up personally but I was ignored I had to come to reception to get the requested items To top things off I was charged on my card despite it being taken off the system on my check in Also I lost my watch charger in my room 1216 and despite numerous attempts to get through to the hotel I didn t get a reply from them , I liked the croissants at the caf Perfect 
459457,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We paid in full on arrival which was requested by reception I paid cash and was not given a receipt which I did not think to ask for after a long day of travelling When checking out reception requested we pay for our second night I told them that I had paid in full on arrival They repeatedly told me that the system said I had only paid for one night I was asked to wait in reception while they reviewed the security footage to make sure I had paid It was embarrassing to be held in the reception area with all my luggage while 4 members of staff stood around a computer screen trying to see wether I had paid or not Reception was also dirty on arrival with leaves and dirt on the floor and the pillows were tiny and uncomfortable seems small after the payment issue but they were small things I noticed , We requested a double bed but we re checked into a twin bed room When I went back to reception to ask for a double bed we were given another room with no problems 
459458,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It could of had a better cafe with light lunches like quick meals and the bar could of had a better selection for dinner, Breakfast was great Not far from airport Also not far from city center
459459,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I contacted on 2 occasions that we needed the bus transfer from the airport We waited an hour in the cold and rain for their bus which did not turn up So we had to catch a taxi which cost us 55euros ,No Positive
459460,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I emailed them to be picked up from the airport but we didn t get any response That s the only thing but I have emailed them via booking com so not sure if they received or not , The staff was always lovely and very helpful They have been very considerate and left baloons etc as it was my hubby s birthday It was lovely and put a smile on our faces The hotel itself was great Had all the facilities we needed Top terrace was amazing I definitely would recommend this hotel 
459461,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, More option for room service I e Cold drinks tea coffee and snacks, The bed was huge and so comfortable the room view was spectacular and the bathroom was amazing Tram 13 which you can get from outside hotel takes you straight to dam square but we couldn t of asked for a better location easy to get into the hustle and bustle but can come home to peace and quite at end of night 
459462,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The pillows were too high and meant I did not get a great sleep Despite air conditioning the room was too warm at night , This was a great place to stay Shuttle was so easy and drivers were very friendly Chantal on reception could not have been friendlier The rooms are not spacious but have everything you need Our view from the 15th floor was stunning So easy to get into the city fifteen minutes by tram and trams run every 7 8 minutes the stop is a three minute walk from the hotel I would definitely stay here again 
459463,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bed was not great mattress kept falling off but apart from this everything spot on, The hotel was very nice and good value for money Bit far from central amsterdam however the facilities offered were very good 
459464,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Don t know if a lot of staff were new but serviice was slow but friendly At reception you jad to wait even though there were 3 staff as all 3 would serve one customer Room type booked wasn t ready when arrived but accepted different option , Location ideal as next to tram Friendly staff Skybar 17th Floor great for views over city 
459465,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Even though it is not so close to the historic center the hotel is very comfortable The staff is very kind Very close to the hotel there is a tram stop that takes you to downtown 
459466,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Apparently the bed was a little strange my dad is already older and he fell out of bed because the upper mattrass was not really attached to the bed Happily he didnt hurt himself but maybe something to look at , I made the reservation for my parents They were very happy except that they were missing a fridge When reported to the reception they however arranged a fridge for them for the following night which they found really good service 
459467,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Long time waiting to check out a bit expensive but I think all hotels in Amsterdam are expensives, The room and bathroom are awesome and the roof bar as well
459468,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Everything was perfect, The room exceeded my expectations and was a lot bigger than I expected Upon arrival the lady at reception I wish I remembered her name instantly greeted us and told us everywhere to go and where not to go in Amsterdam She spent the best part of 20 minutes making us feel welcome and willingly giving us her advice We had booked at Spa Zuiver you HAVE to go for the next day and she rang them up asking directions to get to the hotel and made it so easy for us Make sure you use the airport shuttle free of charge on your way to the hotel as it makes your trip so much easier The hotel itself was beautiful and so was the standard room although it was definitely more than standard I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and the staff were so lovely and decorated the room for him as I requested I m not one to stay in the same hotel twice as I like to experience different hotels but I am 100 booking this again next time we are in Amsterdam The skybar was incredible and makes the hotel even better than it is and gives you a real feel of luxury at an affordable price I honestly had the best time at this hotel the only negative thing that happened was on our first night we were told we could go up to the skybar with our drinks and when we got up to the top the bar man was clearly not in a good mood and was rushing us to leave when it was only 11 15pm and shut at midnight However everything else was perfect so he s lucky his colleagues made everything else so nice for us otherwise I would be giving a completely different review All in all stunning hotel lovely sized rooms and bathroom friendly staff apart from one good location tram stop is situated 100m from building and takes 15mins to get into central station skybar is a bonus and hotel airport shuttle taking all the stress away from getting to and from the hotel Thank you Ramada see you again 
459469,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing really my stay was perfect Only thing I could say is that the shower could have a door or curtain on it to stop the water leaking onto the floor, Staff were brilliant rooftop bar excellent and beautiful views luggage storing after checkout was very helpful Loved the location next to the park Easy tram access into town Excellent shuttle service
459470,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I didn t like the way the beds in the bedroom looked it had space in between so you can realy lean back from the middle you had to always lean from the sides that was a bad experience , I liked that the breackfast and staff were great
459471,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There always seemed to be a question at the check in desk where people had to wait long times , I really liked this place beautiful green area outside with benches to chill out on and the tram is a 3 minute walk I love the rooftop bar or the idea of it anyway tried it one evening but left soon after arriving as it was way overpriced 7 50 for a Heineken Other than that it was great The room was lovely and really spacious considering amsterdam room sizes are normally minature TV with some decent channels too 
459472,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Service was shocking We were giving two single beds pushed together asked if we could have double blanket and never received Ordered food and drinks didn t come on two occasions both times had to re order and received wrong food got drinks when food was finished that s how long we waited Paid for shuttle bus staff didn t take note and was asked for it again Room was filthy dirty underware left under bed room very dusty and unclean Staff not very professional When we arrived we were told there was a rooftop party and we couldn t go because tickets where sold out would have been nice to be told about this party when we booked room Instead we had to listen to the music from our room below same evening lifts broke and we were all stuck downstairs with all the party goers for 30 minutes Not a pleasent stay for such a pleasent place , The 17th floor bar food was nice Mattress was comfy even if it did slip apart Shuttle bus made things easier Nice walk to city but takes an hour 
459473,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Taxi from airport was the most convenient at 37EUR as Rail or Airport Bus followed by Tram is a cheap but less convenient way of getting to the hotel for the first time , Very modern clean and comfortable hotel with very helpful staff Tram to city centre only a few hundred meters away leaving every 20 mins which runs right through to train station 24Hr tram ticket was perfect for getting aorund 
459474,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, As always I miss my pillow while traveling The 2 pillows provided were just huge , Everything was clean or at least they did a good job at hiding faults Of course things can t be perfect but they came pretty close The breakfast buffet was great nice selection but not over the top The tram stops very close and there are two lines 7 and 13 that go close to the centre and attractions 
459475,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The sink was clogged the whole syphon came loose while washing hands That can happen but the repair eventually was not quite that simple While I was gone they repaired when I came back I found a filthy bathroom floor The next day I thought the floor would be cleaned but when I came back my room was not cleaned at all Part of it was me because I had the Do not disturb sign on the door but in the afternoon I took it off the room should have been cleaned then Most people at the Front desk are just doing their job On check out the hostess moved to another computer we followed her but then she went back to the one where we had been waiting for so long Other people were standing there now too and when we approached the desk so she could finally help us she looked at the other people and she seemed to be irritated that we were standing there now She could have told us just a moment I ll help you soon or wait for me I ll be back shortly And when I told the hostess at check out the story about the syphon she just shrugged did not ask any questions and let me go Breakfast is ok nothing special at all cold eggs scrambled eggs were tasteless luckily there were some vegetables The servers were nice but nothing exceptional The hostess was actually unfriendly on our last morning I think because we arrived 5 minutes before the breakfast restaurant closes Price is too high for a hotel like this , The bed was comfy The hostess who helped us check in was very helpful The guy who came in for sink repair was super friendly and helpful 
459476,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, there was a rooftop movie on one night that we would definitely have gone to if we had known about it but we weren t aware that was a pity but not a big deal in the scheme of a great stay, The room was really nice the bed was so comfy and the bathroom was really great i loved everything about the hotel especially the rooftop which was such a cool addition i would go back and have already recommended it to family and friends the tram stop outside was a real bonus 
459477,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The rooftop bar was a large part of booking this hotel We asked on arrival for opening times and went about our day However later when asked to go to rooftop bar was informed that it was closed for a private function This was very disappointing especially as we had asked on arrival The floor 17 bar was good but did prevent us fully enjoying the views There should be an information section or advise when booking as we spoke to others staying there who had also selected the hotel for this reason , Hotel was in a great location the staff were friendly and accommodating Travel into central was simple and the hotel room was spotless and comfortable Needed extra pillows for bed in our opinion 
459478,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Mattress far too thin and slipped off base only one pillow provided Element in room kettle filthy and had a pungent smell, Floor 17 Great Roof Top Bar
459479,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The spare pillows had hairs in the case , The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful they gave great reccommendations of places to eat and things to do The bed was really comfortable The rooftop bar was a great bonus 
459480,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Someone went to the bar and gave our room number in the bill The hotel staff did not check his signature We were forced to pay his bill In spite of repeated requests the hotel has not refunded our wrong payment,No Positive
459481,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, closet was a bar almost 7 feet off floor and in a bad location 120 Volt ac outlets with no adapters available small amount of soap supplied Step up into bathroom, breakfast was good
459482,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Rooftop terrace well organised and pleasant area to have lunch rooms very clean and comfortable no noise interference staff very helpful pleasant and good English as I don t speak Dutch Hotel central to airport city centre with a tram stop virtually outside the door Would recommend 
459483,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Disinterested staff I checked in very late no wardrobes in room no iron or board terribly uncomfortable bed with mattress falling off edge all night Lacklustre shower for the price and distance from city centre its old tired and there are far better hotels I will not be back,No Positive
459484,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Don t think there is enough staff on reception for when booking in and didn t help the fact people were just coming and pushing in front, we stayed to celebrate my 30th birthday and they had decorated the room with balloons and a message and we got given floor 15 with a great view
459485,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A little far from town but the tram stop is right outside the hotel They don t tell you that the tram stops at midnight though So If you re out late have money for a taxi, Good breakfast buffet Included in our price Has something for everyone
459486,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Gym facilities entrance dirty and different to rest of hotel standards , Staff brilliant throughout the stay Comfortable and attractive room although was fairly low even though requesting high floor 
459487,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Very comfortable place Rooms are very nice and they provide a place to store luggage which is a major plus Breakfast was amazing with a huge selection 
459488,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The stairway entrance to the gym smelt absolutely dire so much so that we turned on our heels and didn t go to the gym Our drains in the sink smelt very bad as well , Breakfasts were great rooms and beds brilliant size and very comfortable 
459489,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was very small and the d cor almost wholly unimaginative It is a well run but completely soulless place to stay I can not think that I will ever stay there again The special offer from Booking com turned out to be nothing of the sort paying over 150 euros per night gives an expectation in Amsterdam of something special , The breakfast was plentiful and generously restocked The Hotel is too far from the Centre to be comfortable but the tram service was nearby and is excellent It is a very large hotel with a mixed clientele who mainly seemed to be there for business or conferences 
459490,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact that there was no windows that we could open in the hotel room, The choice of not having your room cleaned in exchange for a 5 voucher to use in the bar 
459491,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was too far from the centre the shuttle bus from the airport stops at 21 40 The room was smaller than expected the toilet door didn t shut properly the step up into the toilet was poorly marked The light in the closet came on randomly The choice of beers was very limited The Sky bar was small and seating limited , The night manager Milad was very helpful 
459492,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was nothing that we did nt like , The location of the hotel was excellent The hotel shuttle fetched from the airport and didnt charge us The staff had the hotel were very helpful I felt that the Ramada Apollo Amsterdam welcomed visitors and made it very easy for tourists to visit Amsterdam The room was spacious and very cleverly designed as there was lots of packing space It was very clean I wish I could have spent a few more days in Amsterdam at the hotel 
459493,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bar facilities in reception area are lacking Check in time is at a very awkward time Needs to be at least 1hr earlier 3pm is half the day wasted Because of location it would benefit from a more substantial hotel shop , Breakfast was very good Waffles make waking up worth it Roof top bar is a nice feature with great views Park right next to hotel and staff were professional and friendly Really enjoyed the touches in the room to help us enjoy our anniversary trip even more 
459494,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The air conditioning was terrible The shower hose was leaking Bed was hard and pillows uncomfortable Cold water has low pressure Maintenance walked in the room while I was in the shower even though tv was on and shower on they didn t think that someone might be inside, Not in a crowded area Behind the tram station 
459495,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Parking and breakfast a bit pricy there is as much as you can eat without stuffing yourself so almomist 20 for cereals with yoghurt is too much , Great comfy room Good location close to the ring
459496,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Cleaners didnt clean either of our rooms for our entire stay 4 days 3 nights no beds made no new towels no tea and coffee materials replaced no bins removed etc A receptionist called Abdul was very rude , Comfy beds
459497,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Kettle in the room is broken It had to be unplugged as the switch off button don t work The handle got very hot and water is dripping out of handle this is perhaps why switch off button don t work It was reported at the reception but has not been replaced , Very friendly staff Very good price for bike hire plus no deposit which is good idea Excellent room service 
459498,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast quite pricey No fridge in rooms, On arrival staff friendly and knowledgable Looked after cases Was our anniversary and staff had made up our room with balloons Great location
459499,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, My room was a bit tight The bathroom box doesn t have door so when you are having a shower the water floods every bathroom Th breakfast is very expensive 19 euros per person , The airport shuttle is good but to come back to the airport you need to pay 7 50 euros person
459500,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hidden not mentioned city taxes Poor room service not satisfied with cleaning of the room No refridgerator Terrible service at the skybar on our first visit we waited for an overall of 20 minutes to get our drinks and despite showing our disgruntlement we did not get any kind of attention , Amazing view
459501,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It s a bit dark coming back to the hotel in the evening Needs more lighting in the area , The tram number13 was very close so you can get to The Dam centre easily The roof too terrace was lovely and staff friendly hotel was clean 
459502,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, If the food was less expensive we probably would have eaten there too, The rooms were beautifully decorated and the view was amazing We didn t eat there but we had drinks in the bar we wound them reasonable for a hotel and matching the price you would pay in England for a cocktail The staff were so friendly and helpful This place is worth the money you pay for if you wish to stay in a nice hotel the tram stop was outadie the hotel and a unlimited ticket we could but from the gift shop for under 20 euros per person Twenty minutes on the tram and you could hope off at dam square of central station 
459503,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Bed is comfy There is AC Staff members are very attentive and helpful The room was clean Less than 5 minutes walk to the tram stop Nice park across the hotel KFC is only about 8 10 mins walk The bathroom is adequate and with basic toiletries The pressure of the shower was really good Good location Good value 
459504,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The dinner menu in the restaurant was very limited we ate the same things a couple of times , There was a problem with the booking I had booked two rooms and had received confirmation But on arrival Booking com had somehow made an error and there was only one room booked the staff immediately phoned Booking com and sorted it out and managed to give us adjoining rooms Great job and extremely friendly
459505,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The breakfast and parking prices are quite steep , More than enough parking in a safe environment Near a tram station which makes travelling into Amsterdam central very convenient Very friendly staff Easy access from highway 
459506,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Awesome place to go close to transport 13 tram takes you to central station rooftop was amazing staff very friendly will be back in 2 months time
459507,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Negatives Breakfast too expensive at 18 50 each and drinks expensive on roof top bar , Positives 100 metres from tram stop in to city takes 10 to 15 mins to get to City centre tickets can be bought for tram in shop at hotel Free shuttle bus purely for hotel guests from stop A9 at airport costs 7 when going back payable at reception Friendly hotel staff in safe clean area Rooms are clean modern and spacious
459508,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, I discovered I left my mobile in the room when I got to the airport and was able to contact the hotel The mobile was found and put onto your shuttle bus and I could then check in as all my details were on the phone A very big thank you 
459509,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room cleaning service was a bit haphazard, Excellent friendly hotel modern style but staff were very helpful Good shuttlebus service from airport Breakfast was really good with plenty of hot or cold choices Didn t eat in restaurant but looked a bit pricey Good quiet location within easy reach of Amsterdam centre by tram 
459510,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room slightly too small lots of light in the mornings even with the curtains closed Located a bit too far from the city centre public transport nearby but 5km walk , Very good breakfast lovely views from the room and the 17th floor
459511,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bed was not particularly comfortable We waited an hour for the airport shuttle at the airport , Rooftop terrace excellent view and good bar but very pricey Staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was brilliant
459512,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our room had an executive king size bed that was enormous BUT the mattress itself was only about 10cm thick and pretty hard to sleep on for us , It is very easy to travel to the centre of Amsterdam on the tram The panoramic view from our room was great We loved the decor and the way the rooms were laid out around the central lift shaft to gave every room a good aspect The choices at breakfast were amazing We chose this hotel partly because of the shuttle to the airport 
459513,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Beds were very uncomfortable and cheap looking Very thin soft mattress that kept sliding off the base I woke up with back pain every morning The food in floor 17 was poor Very poor selection and overpriced I only saw people order the burger The maids woke us up most mornings at 9am even when we had a sign on the door One morning they woke us up just to tell us we had walked in some dust from the park outside This place is not worth the money we paid I wouldn t stay here again , Nice view of the city
459514,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bad experience after coming back after a meal to the Sky bar spoilt our evening Be warned that you will be refused entrance if wearing track pants and trainers even brand new ones despite the fact that many were in jeans and that they had happily taken quite a bit of money from us earlier when dressed in the same manner This dress restriction was not mentioned on our confirmation from booking com, The hotel shuttle was efficient and very cheap convenient location tram 13 straight to heart of the city and room comfort and views were excellent
459515,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We thought that the Hotel is located in the city centre however it takes like 15 20min by train to get there Unfortunately the Hotel doesn t have swimming pool and there is not much to do around when the weather is crap , The staff is so friendly they helped us to locate the attractions we wanted to go for and showed us the way how to get there We really enjoyed the breakfast at Ramada Apollo the variety of options was huge and I am pretty sure that everyone can find something for themselves The Hotel is clean and tidy and the interior design is really nice Me and my partner really enjoyed a sky lounge with an overall view above the city where you can chill and enjoy your drinks 
459516,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location is outside main part of Amsterdam but local transportation is great so not an issue On the plus side it s closer to the airport so easier quicker ride to from airport , Nice sized rooms rooftop restaurant friendly staff fantastic views from rooms 
459517,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Restaurant facilities could have been better There was only a bistro available and the breakfast layout very hard to negotiate , Good location from the airport and close to tram to the city A quiet area 
459518,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, From check in I was angry The man that checked us in never informed me that they were taking 200 euro room deposit from my bank account I would have liked to pay him in cash for that I then questioned him and he apologised for not informing me and told Me would receive it back on checkout It took 5 days to come through He then told me it s better to buy our tram tickets from the shop in the hotel rather then on the tram as they would be cheaper He lied We paid 445 for 4 nights pulse 20 euro city tax change that s not including breakfast or anything and they took 200 off me I m still waiting for it to come back into my account I didn t think it was worth that money anyway I wouldn t recommend this hotel for young people the roof top bar closes at 8 o clock There s no entertainment You can t bring your drinks into the smoking area The prices are ridiculous The food menu is bad Other then that it s very comfortable and our room was fabulous Staff could have been more helpful about things like where to eat etc I found the food was all unhealthy and way overpriced, Bed was very comfortable Rooms were kept very clean and the roof top bar was beautiful but it is only open till 8 pm witch is ridiculous and the price for a drink I could get 3 drinks at home for one there Most the staff were friendly but I was lied to by one witch annoyed me very much 
459519,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel prices for food service are much too high There is a 10 euro charge for room service on top of the high prices , The location is quiet beside a lovely park Staff shared tips on local attractions best routes and good places to eat 
459520,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Couldn t smoke weed in smoking area I understand that s it s a hotel and you have shops for that but if would make the place 10 times more enjoyable for visitors in my view but other than that was great place no problems , The view from the room was amazing
459521,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, First day was a disaster We arrived early so we know that we are not able to check in Given a pass key for the storage room but door cannot be opened had to go up to reception to ask for help We returned at 3 30pm to check in only to be told that we are not registered From the very start I was the one to speak to the front desk as booking was in my name I told her that I have paid the room in full had given the front desk desk in the morning the form duly completed by me So with all these how can I they not find the registration After 15 minutes they found the completed form but the registration was in my husband s name She looked at me with accusing eyes meaning you should know that the room was not in your name How on earth can this happened is beyond me Everything was in my name even the credit card used was in my name she did not even see my husband who was busy putting the luggage in the storage room two floors down So I asked if I can check in now and she replied that she will have to check if the room is ready But it is nearly 4 00pm by now and checkin is supposed to be at 3 00pm and they already know way before hand that someone will be checking in Housekeeping left much to be desired Our room was not cleaned for two days we came back in the evening and called front desk and they said they will send someone to clean immediately We declined the offer as we were tired and want to take a shower and told them to ensure that the room gets cleaned the next day It was but the following day it was not cleaned again My husband went to look for the housekeeping person the next morning to get the room cleaned The room for the rest of our stay was eventually cleaned , The breakfast buffet was excellent 
459522,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hated that there was no headboard on the bed found it completely uncomfortable to read watch t v, Breakfast was gorgeous lots of choice and so tasty Husband is Coeliac gluten intolerant they did their best to accommodate him but with the wide availability of gluten free food menu for Coeliac should be comparable to the non coeliac as prices are the same for both 
459523,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Providing ice without ice bucket open face closet with restricted access simple breakfast buffet should be included with room rate instead of charging 18 per person, Easy access to old town by tram
459524,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Couple of mediocre experiences with staff The shuttle driver who picked us up and one checkout person was quite unfriendly , Clean comfortable and near excellent transport 
459525,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The food and beverage staff ingored us every time and would not serve us breakfast is deplorable and not worth the money , Although the property is located outside the city the tram is out the hotel and easy to use The front office staff and courtesy bus driver are fantastic 
459526,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Gym was poor No swimming pool which I should have checked but assumed there would be one when I saw sauna present No fridge mini bar in room , Beds comfortable quiet rooms
459527,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The restaurant was closed in the weekend because they are understaffed The king size bed felt very small but more importantly was very uncomfortable and the room in general was much smaller than anticipated and dirty in several areas The room was also very dusty so I would not recommend this to anyone with an allergy and on top of that the windows in the room could not be opened The breakfast area and skylounge offered limited seating and were often overcrowded Several breakfast items Sausages eggs were very overcooked every day and in the skylounge they would often be out of certain drinks Roomservice is only limited to breakfast and missing toiletries, Wifi was working at all times and there were 2 friendly staff members There are plenty of elevators to choose from so most of the times the elevator isn t crowded 
459528,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bathroom flooded due to blocked drainage resulting me drying the bathroom for my partner I really didn t want the hotel staff doing that when I was ready to go to sleep Bed was really bad the right side was slanted which resulted in a horrible back pain the next morning The welcome letter was addressed to somebody else The previous day we had another room and the breakfast which also had issues The bathroom door was blocked and we needed to yank it open The breakfast room was dirty In the corner of the breakfast room there were some loose panels just laying about The breakfast itself was of the stuff we had bread was dry crackers were not crackling ham was chewy I actually expect more from a four star hotel so I rate the price quality ratio to be really bad We were not compensated for any of these issues after telling the staff However we were offered a coffee thee which I find not satisfying enough for the bad experience we had , Nice view Clean room Friendly staff Good food on the 17th floor Nice atmosphere on the roof terrace
459529,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The aircon system wasn t fantastic but didn t ruin our experience , The huge bed was so comfy and the views from the corner room we had were absolutely amazing Such a beautiful hotel 
459530,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, nothing, Beautiful room with amazing views would happily recommend this hotel to anyone stayed for 3 nights and as soon as we got home we booked again for 5nights amazing experience
459531,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Poor cleanliness No facilities around the hotel No restaurants except the inhouse bar on 17th floor It too was smelling of sea food It says Ramada Apollo centre It s misleading as it s nowhere around centre of Amsterdam Overall a bad experience, Nothing around the hotel Have to take a tram Cleanliness was bad Nobody cleaned the toilet tea properly after being polite for 3 days with them Too pricy for the location 
459532,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I was there for only 1 night and left after the breakfast There was nothing i did not enjoy , I enjoyed the salm as starter and the beef was also good Room and bed were ok
459533,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Lovely and clean hotel the staff where lovely and very helpful too comfortable beds Location was okay as it was not far from the tram to go into the city centre but nothing else really around for tourist my own fault for not staying more central 
459534,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I am unable to fault the hotel to be honest everything was excellent , Our whole experience was amazing from lovely staff very very helpful to an amazing breakfast which is served between 6 30am 10pm really reasonable if you don t want to get up too early The rooftop terrace Floor 17 was incredible also lovely views great service 
459535,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Me and my boyfriend booked the romada for his 21st birthday The hotel was absolutely beautiful and the staff really helpful and friendly One of the hotel staff even gave us free complimentary drinks when I mentioned it being my other halfs birthday We will definitely be coming back in the near future 
459536,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Limited facilities No room service charges for room service at 10 and after 10 30 pm no service even for just plates and cutlery, Hotel by itself was good Limited facilities
459537,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We had trouble arranging early check in it was requested upon booking but upon arrival our room was still not ready there wasn t much within walking distance maybe a coffeeshop coffee shop and grocery store within 10 minutes only restaurant we saw was the hotel s and we had to wait over 2 5 hours for the hotel shuttle to arrive at the airport after landing the hotel kept saying it was on its way and on schedule but it was not we saw at least 3 other hotel shuttles come and go multiple times before ours arrived , Hotel was clean close to tram line 13 which as able to get us to most places in the city and Wi Fi was strong 
459538,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A voucher was meant to be offered every time you didn t need the room service but this system didn t work nicely yet However the staff were trying hard to fix these inconveniences Rooms lack fridges Only one size thick pillows were available , We loved the staff They were excellent in everything The hotel was beautiful and the room was excellent with magnificent views Air conditioning worked well so did the shower also Tap water tasted good Airport hotel shuttle worked nicely and free seats were available every time 17th floor bar restaurant and fine dining restaurant were both very good 
459539,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location to me was quite far from tram metro stops, The room is very comfortable and modern It is also cozy and tea coffee making facilities are provided in the room The wifi is very fast with no interruptions The hotel has an amazing rooftop bar with amazing views of Amsterdam 
459540,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, First time staying in Amsterdam it was for my partners birthday and they had decorated the room with rose petals and balloons which was a lovely surprise The view was amazing and all staff were friendly and helpful with showing us what to do and where to go Really made our trip 
459541,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only trouble I had was that I could not get any fresh air into the room as there is no windows to open the air conditioning was okay but it can t beat fresh air ,No Positive
459542,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was rubbish left from the previous occupant of the room It was very difficult to get service in the restaurant at lunch time Baggage lockers instructions were in Dutch only so we could not understand how to use them Roof top bar was not open as advertised However we sat up to look at the view in the evening and were chucked out by staff who closed it early with no notice Staff in general were very unhelpful and did not volunteer any information ,No Positive
459543,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the team in the hotel could have done with a little more direction they were not tight or slick ie couldn t easily find things service was a little slow felt like they needed a leader , the staff were great very welcoming great view from both the bedroom and the hotel lounge we ate in first night and food was well presented and tasty 
459544,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No real sense of customer value from the front desk Apparently I was told their main customers are large corporates sending staff and airlines As a business man and also for personal stay I was not offered any form of loyalty discounts after extending numerous times to stay at the hotel This makes you feel undervalued unlike other hotel chains that would try to on board you through loyalty programmes or discounted rates if you continue to re book with them Maybe they should think about it , Location is good atmosphere is nice
459545,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Roof bar was East facing means there was no sunshine at all kind of missing the point of having a roof bar Rooms are modern but standard room is very small Very uncomfortable pillows Staff were friendly but under trained , Reasonably good location Staff were very friendly Very good breakfast 
459546,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Clean smart rooms Comfy beds large shower and a pleasant environment in general around the hotel Great facilities roof top bar was beautiful Easy team service straight outside hotel as well as a scenic walk through a park 
459547,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We had a problem with our safe and requested help over a period of 2 days On the 3rd day we had to demand that the safe be open to get our passports so we could leave ,No Positive
459548,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The service in the restaurant was a little slow We were left with empty plates in front of us for half an hour whilst waiting for the bill and the staff didn t come to ask if we wanted any further drinks They were busy on the first night we went but it was considerably quieter on the second night we visited and the service was the same It wasn t enough to ruin our meal but definitely something that could have been improved upon as many of the staff seemed to notice we were waiting but didn t serve us , The hotel was lovely we had a great room an amazing view the bed was so comfy We ate in the restaurant on the 17th floor twice the second time was because the first visit was so nice we had the burger and me my partner both said it was the nicest burger we d ever had We had the same on the second visit Getting in to the city center is easy and there was lots of space and lovely parks surrounding the hotel Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy and the reception staff were very helpful 
459549,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room not serviced until 1830hrs one day Room safe locked on arrival TV had no picture 1st night Room keys lost ability to open room each day and needed reprogramming but you only found that out when you reached the room door Back to reception , Staff friendly and helpful
459550,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Actually it is not close to city centre but near the tram station Restaurants are far from here , The staff was helpful and friendly The room was clean and tidy with a good view since the room was in high floor The park near the hotel is very great 
459551,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Though the 17 th floor bar has an awesome view they didn t serve a full meal , Clean and easily accessible both from the airport and from the city center if you use public transport 
459552,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, My only downside is that pillows on the bed are too big but this is my personal preference my partner loves them , We always stay at the Ramada Apollo and highly recommend it to everyone we speak to
459553,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was a lack of attention to detail our menu card for breakfast in bed was not collected overnight meaning we didn t get it The duvet was too small for the bed we had to request another duvet rather than a single bed sheet there were two smaller ones tucked in horizontally the fan in the bathroom was noisy and constantly on The hotel was described as being in central Amsterdam it was actually a 40 minute walk to town , The bar was good and the views from the roof terrace were lovely
459554,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The airport shuttle only runs every 40minutes and there were three times as many people as seats so we were unable to take it to the hotel It would be better if it could be booked and then if they provided a larger bus or more frequency if it is overbooked as this was one of the reasons i booked this hotel , A comfy bed a special message for my partners birthday and a bottle of wine on the house were all very kind Also an excellent breakfast buffet which set us up for the day We also liked the rooftop bar it had a nice atmosphere 
459555,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The noise from the above floor was quite disturbing especially trolleys up and down the floor at 4 am Not good In fact there was noise on and off throughout the night and in the morning Beware taking a discount room This is what you may be allocated We did not take the breakfast as it was 15 euro each and considering the cost of the room and the past 2 months having breakfast as an inclusion it was too expensive , This hotel is large has professional staff and great views It is quite a distance from the canal district so you require a daily tram ticket for 7 50 euro walk a lot or use a bike to get around The room is comfortable but noisy on the 16th floor with the 17th floor being the bar restaurant and breakfast area The room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom excellent except for the half shower wall which meant water ended up on the floor no matter how hard you tried There was an environmental option to not have room serviced daily We took that option and were allocated a 5 euro voucher for the bar or restaurant good marketing really The best part was that when there was no noise from above it was a very quiet location 
459556,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Needed one good light in the bedroom mattress was a topper which travelled during the night often six inches over the base The mattress needed a spring clean I woke every morning with swollen eyes and a sore throat My friend in the next bed did not , Room size good desk small bench seat 
459557,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Everything was perfect , Was my boyfriends birthday and I emailed hotel to explain this and they had placed balloons all over the room wrote happy birthday on the mirror So thoughtful Very close to public transport Bed was so comfy So much to do in Amsterdam Shower was very enjoyable Hotel roof top bar was amazing staff were so friendly and helpful especially the lovely ladies in the front desk
459558,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Another guest was checked into our room and came into our bedroom in the middle of the night Was very disturbing The staff didn t seem too bothered about it the next morning blamed a computer glitch I complained to the hotel and have had no response Not good , The roof top bar 
459559,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Very lovely staff and made my boyfriend s 30th Birthday celebration really special Amazing value for money and will definitely be returning Very good location with plenty of shops nearby aswell as easy access to the city centre via the metro Room was very clean and tidy and I would recommend checking out the bar on the 17th floor Staff were always happy to help and were very friendly Plus we were able to store our luggage after check out on our last day and returned to pick it up nearer the time of our late flight home which was very convenient I was recommended this hotel and it didn t disappoint I would highly recommend staying in an executive room as the room was very spacious and had amazing views of the city and nearby park 
459560,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The menu on rooftop bar was limited No hair dryer in room , Good sized room Comfortable bed Quiet Awesome rooftop bar Close to tram into centre Very helpful staff
459561,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Uncomfortable mattress too firm and it kept moving off of the bed Only one cup in the room for hot drinks and the cups were tiny , Breakfast choice was out of this world Rooftop bar was great Staff helpful and friendly Rooms sufficient 
459562,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The price was over rated for the room At movenpick I changed hotels to ramada it was cheaper and the rooms were identical I would stay with at movenpick again even the break wasn t that nice,No Positive
459563,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was quite away out of the centre travelling by tram can be hard if your older or disabled it would help if they had a shuttle to a Central Station as well as the airport, Bed was very warm and comfy it was two pushed together so very large loads of choice at Breakfast 
459564,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, They could have put out a little more cash for the countertop in the bathroom It s a kind of plastic or Formica that stains Also the plug for the bathtub was the wrong size so I was not able to take a bath in the tub , The hotel is located right next to a park Modern d cor spacious elegantly appointed room 
459565,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was no fridge in the room The staff were not very helpful I had to request a cot for my son 4 times There was no highchair offered when we went for breakfast , The room was clean and comfortable The location was brilliant for a family with a children s farm and play park opposite as well as a huge park Also a supermarket near by was handy 
459566,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the bathroom floor and couch in the room was dirty soap dispenser loose on the wall horrible mattress that slides from the bed when you move no possibility to open any windows had to ask for correction of my invoice 3 times before I got a correct one room was registered under a wrong name when I gave room number at breakfast Also they make you sign a document when you check in saying it is the non smoking policy while it includes statements on their liability for health safety issues and allows them to send you advertisement so please read it carefully , Good breakfast fast wireless spacious room airport shuttle
459567,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, we were there for our honeymoon and we were given twin beds although we had booked a queen double in fairness the staff did change our room but they were not overly apologetic and had an attitude remarking they did not have many available rooms Furthermore they charged 100 euros to my card without consulting us first for a security deposit despite us paying the room in full when we arrived , The hotel was clean and luckily the tram station was close despite the hotel location being no where near the city centre the bar on the 17th floor was nice but it was a mediocre hotel 
459568,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our room was VERY cold and the staff gave us some heater but it was still cold The staff was not helpful at all , The location was perfect we loved the garden beside the hotel very nice spot to relax and enjoy the nature The lobby was also very elegant and welcoming 
459569,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our only problem was that we wanted an evening meal and the restaurant only offered A La Carte menu or bar snacks , The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly and it s ideally located to the city centre and still near the airport 
459570,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, They did not give any extra time for late checkout for free but charged 10 Euros per hour although the rate was high The breakfast staff were not very professional as they refused to fill the food tray even before the time finishes and I quote If the food is not there then it is not there This is not how you treat your customers One hour walk to the city center , The view was amazing overlooking the city of Amsterdam if you are lucky to have one 
459571,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The staff was the only major disappointment The check in was managed well but later the staff failed to do anything correctly later Most of the time the reception even failed to answer the phone , The bed was very comfortable The floor 17 and the overall facilities provided was great The property had good access to public transport 24 hours
459572,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I Check in early and they didn t do anything to try to accommodate us even when I can back at 3 pm I have to complain about my room , Public transportation airport shuttle and friendly staff 
459573,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A bizarre email exchange in which they offered us to upgrade to the executive room a bottle of prosecco a cake for 90 Well we d already paid for the executive room When we pointed this out they then offered just the prosecco and the cake for 75 Very let down by that we d have been cheaper booking the double then upgrading it considering the difference is apparently only 15 Not impressed at all Also bit of a stretch calling it Amsterdam centre as it s nearly a 20 minute tram to the centre , The view Hotel modern clean cool interior etc Bathroom spacious massive bed and large tv at the foot of the bed 
459574,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bathroom especially the toilet was really dirty There was no information material about the hotel s facilities in the room There was no wardrobe in the room only shelves We ordered breakfast with roomservice The first morning it came the second day it didn t come There was a kettle in the room with teabags and coffee but not one single teaspoon or anything else to stir the coffee with There was only one extra pillow in the room which was a double room There was a minibar but it was empty The room was also really small , Nothing
459575,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, House keeping needs improvement I stayed for 4 nights with my family Was disappointed when we returned to our room everyday when we found the room was not vacuum cleaned All they did was to change the towels and nothing else It doesn t help the brand name of Ramada , The staff at the front desk were very helpful I would also like to add that the rooms were quite spacious and comfortable
459576,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, fitness centre is in a windowless basement reached by ugly stairway machines are OK but are old l, very nice big room large windows good size bathroom couch by window overlooks Rembrandt park
459577,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Although hotel comfortable they could do with adding extra facilities such as a general shop not just tourist shop pool and possibly another restaurant Due to its location once we left in the morning we stayed out all day and we didn t want to head out again after coming back The bar at times struggled to provide enough seating Sheets on bed a bit on the lean side We were on 14th floor and the views were brilliant but room tight for 2 adults however we were probably on a budget room so I suppose cannot complain too much Would I go back for the staff and views yes For the choice of food in restaurant no very limited For location well I m not sure It was pleasantly quiet but a bit out of the centre , Friendly helpful staff Views were fabulous and bed very comfortable Hotel very quiet at night and early morning and well sound proofed We really enjoyed our stay Breakfast although not included in our booking was excellent 
459578,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff were so welcoming Chantal a member of staff found out it was my partners birthday and filled our room with balloons and rose petals She also got us free drinks all on her 
459579,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, only small things can be faulted the room did feel slightly cold at times however this just had to be adjusted on the aircon but with so many windows the room was heated with the sun Also the bed was very large but the duvet did not cover the whole bed When leaving the hotel we left our luggage there as our flight was later They have a system where you store your luggage in lockers however all instructions where in Dutch which made it time consuming using Google translate shame as all staff were fluent in English which made check in out and questions easy, Stayed in the executive king room and would recommend The room was modern and spacious and with 5 large windows had an excellent view of the surrounding area The room was clean and had all the facilities you would need iron ironing board hairdryer safe and even extras such as bath robes for the both of us and had a large bathroom with both shower and bath Would recommend the rooftop bar amazing views and great bar snacks with friendly staff throughout Taxis are expensive but there is a tram that goes straight to central station with different ticket types starting at 3 euros Overall excellent hotel with friendly staff would stay again 
459580,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Distance from City Centre was not as indicated It is about 20 mins tram ride away from City Centre Also no closet or bar fridge in the room , The daily clean up of the room is very good Clean sheets and towels daily although it was unnecessary to change the towels daily 
459581,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bed seemed like a university student s mattress The pillows were soo deflated and me and my partner had neck pain duvet cover couldnt even fit over the entire bed Everything was rubbish considering we paid for a queen room No robes in the rooms who does that , The location quiteness
459582,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room was cold We was out on 15 floor because the room we was meant to have was unavailable Hotel was far from place if u was walking but had a metro stop near which was easier to access the city centre and dam square, The room and hotel in general was very clean and nice The lady in gift shop was very helpful
459583,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No info in the room bout hotel and facilities The quilt was way too small for the bed which was a pain Price of the breakfast when not included considering the price of the room , 17th floor exceptional views Nice big bed 
459584,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The thermostat was funky made that room extremely hot sporadically Our room did not get cleaned the last night Constantly having to ask for more towels and having to wait or call them again to remind them The bathroom shower is tiny and has no door making you wet the entire bathroom floor bed was two twins put together room was stuffy and small , Location was great Staff was decent something that would forgot to bring her things out to the hotel and one of the days are did not get cleaned The hotel was clean the lobby was nice and the front entrance of the hotel is super accessible to uber and taxis cleaning ladies were nice Lounge looks cool and a good place to grab a drink 
459585,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Promised panaramic view was not on park side Hotel reserved money from my card twice and still 3 day pass not realise it Receptionists could not answer this question,No Positive
459586,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Very small room and the bed was not comfortable , Amazing breakfast beaultifull roof top Great 360 view to amsterdam bar female manager from roterdam was top 5 didnt get her name 
459587,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not enough lighting in hotel room When we went down to the breakfast buffet only my partner wanted to eat and I didn t want to but they wouldn t let me in unless I paid 18 50 This upset us as I didn t eat anything so paid that amount for a tiny coffee and glass of water , Nice staff Good location close to the trams Lovely hotel and very clean 
459588,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No soap in the shower windows a bit too dirty pity considering good weather and nice view Furniture in need of a restyle Breakfast could be improved that building with that view could give so much more , Terrace even if it was a bit abandoned and staff courtesy 
459589,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Rooms are very small and we had been given a free upgrade I dread to think how small the standard double is we had originally booked you can t turn the heating up in your room past a certain temperature and it got quite cold one of the nights also the bus from the airport to the hotel only has eight seats so don t expect to get the first bus if staying at a busy time they come evey 40 min so you may have to wait quite a while, Quiet location friendly staff and clean
459590,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The front desk staff including Meike Rianne and Renzo at the front desk were ALL first rate POLITE and delightful demeanor very attentive Our favorite hotel in Amsterdam we ve stayed there 7 different times on stopovers to Europe Quick to airport and quick to downtown dam square Breakfast staff including Georgios were AMA big abd the food and view all A 
459591,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The beds were surprisingly uncomfortable for a good hotel Mattress toppers have been added to try to improve but to no avail they tended to slide off with me on them at night , Very friendly and professional staff great welcome to Hotel and Cool bar on the 17th Floor 
459592,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I have stayed in the hotel before On my previous stay as well there was a good level of mismanagement Anyway i will talk about this stay only The shuttle system is very disorganised on the way in way back to airport is okay There is no way for people to queue up I missed my first shuttle The second one arrived after 40 minutes but that one got full and I wasn t allowed to board The driver took luggage from everyone in one large group some of whom joined the queue after me My wife who actually had no luggage to check in was sitting in the bus and she had to get off after having boarded the bus It was not the driver s fault It is just that the hotel management has not come up with a system whereby passengers arriving could book a seat on the shuttle This should be simple enough to do in 2017 I requested an early check in To be fair the hotel did offer me a different room for early check in but I didn t avail it as I wanted the room I booked I locked my luggage and went out to kill some time so the hotel would prepare my room by 3pm The hotel management were aware that I had arrived I locked my luggage went through my ID and booking details etc by 12ish They knew I was going out to kill time and will return by 3pm When I returned at 3pm I realised my room wasn t ready and they offered me a different room We had gone through this earlier that I didn t want a different room just the room I paid for Ultimately I had to wait another 45 minutes or so to get a check in to my room In the end I was extremely tired and a good part of my time planned for entertainment was spent dealing with a mismanaged hotel , The hotel was nice and clean There was a fairly frequent tram that would get you to city centre and the dam square so location was also reasonable The bar was also nice and much more reasonably priced than bars in other 4 star hotels 
459593,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Taxi cost 40 each way to airport Check in was over complicated and it wouldn t take my debit card and I had to walk 10 minutes at midnight in freezing weather to an ATM After which I was informed I also needed A 100 deposit on the room Thankfully they just took the last 50 I had as the deposit The airport shuttle was all booked and check out took ages because of people skipping ques and staff working in pairs not individually , Bed was huge room and bathroom were spotless Charging connections near bed is a nice touch 
459594,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shuttle service from the airport is unreliable and only has 8 seats so you may not get on We waited 40 mins The hotel is quite remote you have to use tram to centre no bars or restaurants nearby The young manager in the bar is very rude Witnessed him arguing with a couple visting the hotel and he was completely unprofessional pointing at them including the female and arguing and then fetched security and had them removed I couldnt see what they did to deserve that but they certainly werent being argumentative The couple were much older than this young lad who was pranching round like he owned the bar and revelling in relaying to all the bar staff what he was arguing about Not what you want when youre enjoying a drink and very disrespectful to his elders and an unprofessional way to handle customers Our shower dripped fast constantly and wasnt fixed despite a request We stayed 2 nights and it was annoying , Hotel room was lovely and clean Hotel was very quiet Tram stop is right outside the hotel into Amsterdam centre in 10 minutes and run regularly Recommend you book return shuttle as soon as you arrive as its only 8 seats and they get booked up
459595,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel was very nice overall the room size wasn t big but didn t need to be for our 3night stay I would say could do with an extra pillow as was only given one but I m sure if I asked reception they would have didn t at the time , Hotel was nice clean not in Amsterdam centre but didn t take long via tram tram station is very close
459596,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bathroom in the lobby was very dirty That is the only negative thing I have to say about this hotel We were VERY pleased with the overall stay and will be returning for sure , Comfortable bed lovely facilities and amazing staff 
459597,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our mattress had a dip in it at my side but otherwise the bed was comfortable and we still slept well , Excellent choice for breakfast Hotel was very clean and staff were also very friendly and helpful Balloons on our bed and message on mirror for my husband s special birthday were a nice surprise for him as was the complementary cocktail to celebrate Great location Easy access to centre via tram across the road Loved our visit to the Hotel School of the Hague next door Van Gogh Museum was excellent and Anne Frank House was worth the wait in a long queue Our first visit to Amsterdam and the Ramada will not be our last 
459598,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Excellent shower the staff were extremely helpful especially after I had an incident with a cyclist and injured my elbow top marks to Sebastian 
459599,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room could do with decorating our room wall had a massive mark on it as did the couch next to the window and paint had been chipped away in the bathroom where the mirror had been bashed against the wall The manager also sent us to the wrong room in the first place and seemed horrified when he realised his mistake Also the staff questioned us at times when I asked for extra pillows she seemed horrified that I d asked for 3 seeing as the extra one in the room never had a pillow case , Property was a good distance from Dam Square not too close and not too far away The room was great and we had a nice view 
459600,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Asked for queen room got 2 twin beds had to switch rooms had to go desk back up to get suitcase back to lockers and return after 3 to get new room Also you need to inform of the charge of your airport shuttle in the states that s part of your stay ,No Positive
459601,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, On our first night we visited the rooftop bar on the 17th floor Much to our surprise we caught a glimpse of a mouse running across the floor This was disgusting and not what we expected to see , The shower and the free wifi 
459602,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Have tried to think of things and to be honest can t Everything was just as we expected and nicely so , Loved the hotel transfer from airport Beds also exceptionally comfortable We didn t have breakfast at the hotel so can t comment but everything was just great for us a couple getting away for the weekend having left the kids with granny at home A wonderful weekend 
459603,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Cheaper drinks might have got us drinking at the hotel first, Hotel was wonderfull very helpful tram line very close and easy to use kfc less than 10 mins walk
459604,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Service in the bar at the hotel was very slow, Staff very friendly Room very comfortable Panoramic views were amazing Breakfast was really good Staff decorated the room with balloons and a birthday cake for my partners birthday A bottle of prosecco was also in the room Staff were very helpful with any questions about the local area
459605,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I had booked a queen sized room and paid 290 for a 3 night stay i didnt mind the price of almost 100 a night if it was a queen sized room however it wasn t Although the decor mirrors bed bathroom was modern the room was not spacious at all and the only room was around the edges of the bed it had a fantastic view of Amsterdam but For the price I would have liked something bigger than a basic premier inn we also were not allowed to check in until 3 pm even though we arrived at 10am A long time to wait after travelling from 2am This was stated however and I would not have minded but on the day off check out 12pm that day the same cleaning staff knocked on our door 5 times the first time was at 10am 2 hours before check out there was no rush from the staff to check us in however we were very rushed to check out We explained the young lady we would not be leaving until 12 11 50 as we didn t need to be at the airport until 3 so didn t see the point after all we had paid an expensive price However she continued to return and disturb us I was also charged 150 deposit on checking in which I wasn t aware of and had to use half of my spending money to do so and then go into savings whilst there I checked the terms and conditions of the property and found that it was explained so did not complain however during the trip this money cleared from my bank and after checking out took 5 days to be put back into it a lot MORE money spent on a very average property After all this I still had an amazing time on my trip and didn t let the hotel bother me until afterwards when I called to explain I hadn t been paid back and was spoken to very rudely and actually hung up on which left me feeling very sour about the hotel and the staff , The hotel was well decorate so a really good location with the tram stop just outside so if you don t mind getting the tram to and from the centre it is perfect for you The sky bar was unavailable closed due to weather but the 17th floor bar was lovely with a lot of gorgeous cocktails and a free tram service from the airport and a cheap one back after your stay which is good if you find the tram and get lucky on timing
459606,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The completly unexpected 150 deposit on top of out payment for the room it completly ruined our holiday as we had very little spemding money left after it Was no where on the booking com website We also asked for a double room but got two single beds pushed together with 2 single duvets it felt like we were sleeping on rocks Not a hotel for couples , Easy to get to on the tram not far from the city center 
459607,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We paid extra for a room with a view and they gave us a room with a view of a main road and flats when the picture on the website was of the park We requested to change room and they gave us the same room just higher up therefore wrong again They apologised by giving us 1 free breakfast each and the shuttle back to the airport free I feel they could have just charged us for a normal room with no view as this is what we got Also we got there early so understood we couldn t check in but our room was literally ready just intime and we were sat there for a few hours whilst everyone else was able to get their room straight away So we waited hours for a room which was the wrong one wasn t a good start , Rooms are spacious bathroom is very big with a separate bath and shower cubicle The bed is very big and comfy with a TV on the end Breakfast was good but expensive 
459608,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, I had a problem with my credit card and the receptionist was very kind and flexible I really appreciated it The breakfast on the 17floor is an experience you can t miss All you can eat buffet and view of Amsterdam are absolutely fantastic Highly recommended 
459609,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, for out of town centre location there are other hotels of same rating with equal or better levels of comfort but for better value they ran out of cold beer at 3 a m a signal for bed time , tranquil location next to park but with good transport links nice late check out
459610,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shower in room has glass panel no door This does not keep water from flooding the bathroom floor We had to wring the towel out after each use , Staff were friendly on arrival Room was big enough for our short stay Very clean Location a little out of town centre but a 3km walk and you are there We enjoy the walking and purposely choose those distances on holidays so was perfect Otherwise tram right outside hotel Cafes and restaurants also short walking distance from hotel 
459611,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Everything was great , The location was fantastic with a tram stop right outside that went straight to the city center The staff were friendly and very helpful The bed was comfortable the room was nice the restaurants were good and reasonable Best decision we made on the trip was staying here 
459612,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, For me the bed was firm but didn t impact on the overall stay at all , Transport was just down the road and the staff where very pleasant and helpful 
459613,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bathroom on the small side, Excellent front desk staff during the day helpful and competent Nice clear room design with big windows and good views Pleasant rooftop restaurant for breakfast with panoramic views Garage with direct elevator access to the rooms Sauna and fitness beyond expectations Ideal for jogging in adjacent Rembrandt Parc
459614,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the information on the website isn t exactly what i expected to have for my room It said i can get bathtub but i have shower instead , The wifi is good and i got an upgrade to Twin room 
459615,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The menu for the restaurant was a little posh for our taste selling things like fig ice cream and caviar We re more of a burger and chips type of couple and it was very high priced too , This hotel is in a perfect location Far enough out of the centre of Amsterdam for the peace and quiet but only a very short tram ride away from dam square and the trams are about every 8 10 minutes and very reasonably priced The hotel staff and the airport bus driver couldn t be more helpful and polite if they tried everyone of them gave us more than enough information and even called the room 10 minutes after us checking in to see if everything was ok or if we needed anything The room was cleaned with the beds made and fresh towels put in every day The beds were very comfortable and the rooms have a television with English Channels and tea and coffee making facilities The view from the hotel is lovely All in all I d recommend this hotel to anyone and if I go back to Amsterdam I will definitely be staying here again 
459616,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, breakfast was extremely expensive the restaurant Floor 17 was expensive and the food was not that great Much better food in town it is a bit far from the centre but the tram service is good at least, Great value for the price we paid
459617,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Only one thing was on Wednesday 1st March it was my birthday and we had decided to come back to the hotel early and get ready for a night in the bar bistro 17 We arrived and were seated straight away and got a drink but then we tried to order food and another drink for 25 mins but no one even looked at us as there was an argument with one of the waiters and the chef for taking a customer order wrong and having to take it back twice so we felt an atmosphere and were a bit put off so we paid the bill and left the hotel in the rain to go to a local restaurant as by this time we were really hungry It s not put us off the hotel at all just disappointing as I was looking forward to it being a birthday treat , The staff were so lovely and helpful on the reception The view from our room was brilliant and the size of the bed was fab Great stay and will definitely book again 
459618,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Prices of food and drink in rooftop bar were slightly pricey but the view made it worth it, Easy airport transfers Very friendly staff Beautiful hotel cosy and clean 
459619,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, If I m being fussy the beds were a little uncomfortable and hard The room we had standard twin also didn t have a fridge which is usually always the case or a wardrobe with the ability to hang any items , The hotel location was fantastic and the access to it via the hotel shuttle bus and tram were very straightforward The decor was gorgeous and the staff were very helpful with regards to any questions we had The rooftop terrace was stunning and the bar was had a great atmosphere We had a meal there on our second night and it was lovely I would stay again 
459620,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the room was standard a crisp packet was under the bed when we arrived and still there when we left toilet roll holder was falling off as did the soap dispenser every use mattress kept sliding off the bed meals were expensive and served in the bar restaurant area was always closed in the evening DJ enjoyed her set more than the customers reception not very helpful and unfriendly, the bar staff were friendly and the views were spectacular from the bar and the room public transport was nearby and easy to use for town centre very quiet rooms
459621,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I had been informed that there was a shuttle bus every 40 minutes to 21 40 pm We arrived after 8pm and after waiting 30 minutes for the shuttle rang the hotel Couldn t understand on the phone what the situation was so ended up getting a taxi 40E Was told at the hotel between 8 21 45 there isn t a shuttle as the guy has a break So be aware Also was a bit peckish so ordered cheese and biscuits off the desert menu 13E on the sky bar to say it was pathetic is an understatement 3 tiny pieces of cheese even less when the rind came off and 2 broken cheese biscuits My partner got a huge burger for 17E , Staff were lovely and very helpful We had initially got flights which were cancelled that arrived quite early and were given an early book in without any hassle 
459622,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The views of Amsterdam from the 17th floor where the restaurant is are amazing The easy access to the city centre just fifteen minutes by tram 13 from the back of the hotel Lovely rooms very clean and comfy beds
459623,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We did book a double room and had two single beds pushed together was rather annoying , Excellent friendly and helpful staff Amazing view from our room 
459624,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact that the top mattress on the bed moved a bit was inconvenient but it was very comfortable anyways , We were given a beautiful room on the fifteenth floor The view was lovely there was lots of storage space and the bathroom was very nice The staff were extremely helpful also 
459625,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel was situated further from the city centre than we expected but the tram service no 13 ran about every 10 mins and the stop was situated close to the hotel , Rooms were modern and very clean 
459626,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our Queen Double Standard room was small not much space to move around i expected a bit bigger better room Luckily we only had a hand luggage otherwise we would ve really struggled I also was not aware of the deposit you have to pay at the desk 150 which automatically sets people back on money Then the smoking MOST people who visit Amsterdam come for the same reason like myself I was located on the 13th floor which was absolutely fine I requested a high floor for a view however I hated the fact that I had to go down 13 floors every time I wanted to smoke I had to get dressed at 2 4am whenever I wanted a fag I had to stand outside in the rain to smoke I think balconies would be a great option , Housekeeping was excellent 
459627,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Only negative thing was the second night we d been out all day to be greeted in our room with a sewage smell from the bathroom not pleasant however we phoned reception and the woman apologised a manager came up not to long after and moved us rooms and offered us 2 drinks and complimentary shuttle bus back to airport usually 7 50 per person this still hasn t put me off staying here again and would defiantly recommend to friends Thank you for a lovely stay , Staff couldn t have been more helpful rooms were modern and had what we needed for a few nights stay Can t thank them enough i mentioned when booking this hotel this was a trip away for my partners birthday and when arriving to the room there were balloons and a little message on the mirror just an extra touch that i really appreciate
459628,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Stayed here twice and really enjoyed the experience They have an airport shuttle which picks up right outside the airport and drops off right outside the hotel Nice staff There is a tram outside the hotel which is 15 mins into the centre Really easy to get 
459629,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Double room was just twin beds pushed together We couldnt even cuddle properly without falling down the middle Bar prices very expensive Cleaners left a card saying if we opted out of cleaning we would get a 5 euro voucher But they didnt leave this until the night before our departure so we couldnt benefit from this , We liked the modern decor We liked the view out the window We liked the tram stop just outside We liked the 24hr breakfast bag Airport shuttle service and luggage locker room Friendly staff 
459630,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Wi Fi in 7 9 and 12 floors is weak , The staff is exceptional kindly helps with every problem Also the calm relaxing atmosphere in whole hotel really helps to get in the laidback mood of Amsterdam 
459631,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bed was uncomfortable the mattress would go down a few inches when laying down I weigh 180lbs Location was not excellent but I was aware of that it takes about 15 20 minutes to get to the centraal station taking the tram , Room was modern and clean Wifi was pretty fast I was able to stream music and watch netflix in HD without any bumps 
459632,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Located a bit too far from the centre of town 45 minute walk or a 20 taxi Breakfast was expensive 16 per person especially when food allergies limit what you can eat buffet or not Amenities were not in the room that were meant to be there e g additional pillows ironing board iron We were not left with a spare toilet roll so the one we had ran out by day 4 10 fee for having drinks delivered to the room seems excessive , Big room comfortable bed Good wifi Good shower Very friendly helpful staff Good cocktails in the bar 
459633,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Absolutely amazing breakfast spread Staff were always friendly and happy to help It s a little out of the centre but easy to get to on the tram Would definitely recommend and stay again 
459634,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Food and drink in the hotel is quite pricey , Staff were amazing Very friendly and helpful Rooms were very clean Beds were spacious Hotel is a bit far out but very easily accessible 
459635,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I wasn t aware of the 5 city tax until checkout which was a little disappointing It would have been helpful if they let us know when checking in We also had to pay a deposit of 50 Euro a night which I wasn t aware of when making the booking , That the staff were very helpful We felt our room was too cold so they brought us an extra blanket and additional heater The breakfast was amazing but we didn t get to go onto the rooftop as it was closed due to snow
459636,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our bed was two singles pushed together but we were aware of this before offered an upgrade Lightin in the room a bit dim , Check in and check out went smoothly we were given an upgrade upon arrival 
459637,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We didnt like the rooftop terrace as the outdoor heating wasnt working so although we wanted to spend longer up there we couldnt as it got a bit chilly Also in the hotel room we noticed that the heating didnt go any higher than 23 cooler to what we would have considered warm comfortable , We liked the hotel bed as the bed was really comfy and spacious The staff at Ramada were very friendly and very helpful if something was of inconvienience they would try their hardest to keep us happy at which they succeded my partner had a great birthday we will be staying here again Excellent 
459638,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bathroom was not very clean Furniture and equipment are visibly worn sometimes But that could be expected for such price , Friendly and helpful staff nice view through windows quite calm location easy to reach by tram Good breakfast 
459639,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact there is a gym is really good but there s a picture on the website of free weights when there isn t any weights there it s a little misleading Also there is a charge for city tax which is fine but this didn t get mentioned on check in which I think it should have rather than just telling me it needs to be paid when checking out Reception staff not as friendly as the rest of the staff floor 17 bar staff are excellent , Comfy bed tram stop is a 2 min walk away which is very handy The transfer to and from the airport is very good Floor 17 is lovely and there are excellent views 
459640,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not much Only a few points the shuttle to the airport is 7 50 pp whereas most hotel shuttle s are free Also n b last airport shuttle to the hotel is at 21 20 Just a personal note that it would be great to have soya almond milk as an option lactose intolerant , Both the frontdesk staff and cleaners were very friendly and helpful The location is great it is not too far from the airport and Dam central is about 10 minutes by tram plus the tram stop is just around the corner from the hotel Interior is beaut 
459641,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The morning receptionists was lovely however the night staff was very rude The safe in our room had locked itself and we needed our belongings and passports for flights in the morning I phoned down To reception and they said they was busy and would be up in twenty minutes They did not arrive to our room until 2 hours later When the man arrived he was very rude and his attitude towards us was disgusting , The room itself was beautiful and a great location 
459642,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our shower We arrived at the hotel around 11am and my partner noticed a slight wet patch on the bathroom floor next to the shower We both thought nothing of it We then went out for the day came back to get ready to go out again in the evening Whilst getting ready my partner noticed that the shower was not draining very well But we thought nothing of it as showers and drains can be slightly temperamental and the rest of the room was so perfect we were not in a pedantic mood The following morning my partner and I both had showers and went out for the day again when we returned the floor was soaking wet and my partner used already wet towels to soak up the excess water Then I went and informed reception who were extremely helpful and apologetic and offered us a room upgrade which we did not accept as we saw the issue as only a minor inconvenience and were only informing them so it did not effect our deposit The receptionist then came up with new towels and dried the floor herself She then got maintenance to look at it the following day whilst we were out The shower did still leak slightly the following day but we both understand that it is not a problem that can be fixed quickly and especially not whilst the room in occupied , The hotel was clean a true reflection of the images online welcoming and friendly staff who on your arrival make sure you know everything regarding facilities transport etc excellent location near a tram stop which takes everywhere you need to go as a tourist The breakfast was superb We did not eat there in the evenings choosing instead to go into the city centre The minibus which picks up guests from the airport upon arrival and takes them back for departure is a great valued useful touch The rooms were comfortable accommodating and perfectly sized Would certainly stay at the hotel again 
459643,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Myself and my girlfriend went to the hotel with friends Both couples booked the hotel at the same time and paid the same amount of money My room was on the 8th floor and it was tiny Our friends room on the 16th floor and was huge compared to ours I was not impressed to say the least I did go to reception to say this but no help was given to me , the rooftop terrace was great 
459644,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It did not work well for me to book a place on the shutel Also transfer was EUR 5 on my reservation but the price was changed to EUR 7 50 without any explanation ,No Positive
459645,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I loved everything, I loved my stay at the ramada the staff couldn t do enough to cater for us excellent customer service hotel was very clean and modern throughout rooms are gorgeous we upgraded to an executive room worth every penny and the view was stunning especially as it had snowed in Amsterdam and it was a blanket of white snow everywhere Thank you ramada apollo I will most certainly be coming back I am looking already to book to come for Easter 
459646,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bed was very hard and had a slope on it so we kept rolling to one side could ve had better pillows didnt have great sleeps, Lay out of room view from room was lovely Bar was good on level 17

459649,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 150 deposit to be paid at check in which we weren t ever made aware of Girl taking the money manager I believe was rude and abrupt Could not fault the rest of the staff however , The bed was unbelievably comfortable and the shower was heaven sent 
459650,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The table in the room was not wiped on any of the 5 days that we were there The coffee stains on the table were there and I had to clean the room after it was cleaned The soap bottle on the wall fell by itself on the first day we were there it was not fixed till we left The shampoo bottles were never changed in the bathroom either It was pretty pricey for a 4 night stay and we were expecting a little more cleanliness on the behalf of the hotel At least SHAMPOO , We were there for a business trip and we appreciated the transportation from and to the exhibition Didn t use much of the hotel otherwise
459651,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Payment was taken without authoritisation apparently I can t speak to a manager as this isn t a valid complaint Pay at your accommodation is not accurate I paid for 4 people s holidays as I was the lead passenger resulting in being charged over 35 in fees for paying using my debit card ,No Positive
459652,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location is nice for peaceful sleeping but you need to calculate about 15 EUR to get to the city center with taxi , The Ramada Hotel is a nice big clean and well equipped hotel I would recommend it to anyone Very friendly peoples taking excellent care of you 
459653,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The little thing that we did not like was that you have to ask for things like milk and tea bags They were not restored when they come to make the bed and clean the bathroom , Staff was very friendly and helpful
459654,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We couldn t get into the bar on Saturday night as it was full didn t look like it to us which was a shame as we were paying guests, Great location really friendly staff
459655,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location is pretty far from centre but that s my fault for not checking Checkout was also quite slow and the staff seemed unsure how the deposit refund worked , Very quiet had a room next to the lift and wasn t woken up once Great staff at the bar Comfortable bed

459658,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Great staff and lovely breakfast We were especially keen on the make your own waffles yummy Only thing i can criticise is I booked the room 6 months before and ordered a deluxe double and we requested a high room with a view When we arrived to check in the reception were telling everyone that the rooms were not ready so they were upgrading us to a better room The room was a twin it was our anniversary and was smelly and on the bottom floor We were very disappointed and went to complain To be fair to the reception they did find us a better room but we saw and spoke to several others that were not so lucky As I say the reception did handle matters eventually but we did have to make a fuss Apart from that it was a great stay loved the facilities and the location lots of great places around the hotel that are much more Dutch than central Amsterdam and we enjoyed that Have a good stay
459659,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The tram outside the hotel was ideal to travel into the city centre as it is 20 mins from hotel I would recommend to get a city pass on tram we got a 2 day one which was very handy and cheap
459660,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was described as central but it was a 20 minute tram journey into the centre so not too far but I would have preferred to be more central , It s a good hotel with friendly helpful staff and most amenities that you would want 
459661,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The pillows were too hard The receptionist told us to use the phone inside the room was completely free and when I checked out I was told we had a phone bill which they then took from the security deposit That was only to calls the reception btw Didn t have a fridge to store snacks and basics like milk , Hotel in general was very nice and comfortable tram line was right behind the hotel which made travelling into the centre very quick and easy Wifi in the room and throughout the hotel was very good

459676,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Weather but that s not the hotels fault Pricey coffee in the lobby The room was in need of a full cleaning At check out we had to pay for the city tax Booking com should NOT state in the booking confirmation that city tax is prepaid It s just included in the total price but has to be paid at check out , Very nice rooms Good size Lovely tub Efficient elevator Good service at check in Comfy bead though a bit on the hard side Great new years eve party with awesome food 
459677,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only downside to this hotel was the location It was a 10 minute taxi ride into Amsterdam or 25 minutes on the tram but even so with how s he really enjoyed our stay it wasn t enough to upset us or put us off to hotel , The staff couldn t have been any more helpful or attentive They were happy to bring extra pillows and towels to our room as well as tea and coffee

459696,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Very luxurious hotel with spacious rooms and great facilities The rooftop restaurant is asbolutely breathtaking Very helpful friendly staff let us check in early and arranged hotel transportation 
459697,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Housekeeping was sloppy No soap shower gel in the room when we arrived cleaning of the bathroom superficial no additional blankets in the room very basic gym for a 4 hotel , Quiet location not that far from the centre still 
459698,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I was rather disappointed with the Ramada after having read the description and positive reviews Firstly the room was not clean floor not vacuumed someone had spilled liquids on the wall which was not removed Shower was open which meant the bathroom floor flooded toiletpaper holder was loose The restaurant has a nice view However I was not allowed to sit by the window Being alone I was directed to a single s table away from the window But everything would be made up by the sauna Or so I thought the infrared sauna gets hardly lukewarm not nearly hot enough to take a sauna very disappointing , What I liked most was the proper desk in the room and the comfortable bed 
459699,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The breakfast is really expansive for what they offer quite basic but fresh though A little far from the old town but the tram isn t far at all Room was a bit cold and the thermostat didn t work well, I had an executive room so it had a huge room and bed Bathroom with both shower and bath The view from the room was great The bar at the 1th floor is good and the smoking area is really good so you don t need to go out Very helpul people to help out with directions etc Free shuttle to the airport tramway stop 2 mn away 
459700,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room design and service are such a disaster there is no any cabinet for clothes only same shelfs air conditioner works terrible and very very slow heating up and max temperature is 25C there is no minibar in rooms there is no shower curtain in toilet because of this when you take shower all toilet getting wet there is no any disposal slippery tooth brush or sewing kit only one type shampoo and towel when room service come daily they only change towels not bed sheets when you sleep if someone go to toilet toilet lights directly shining to you your eyes and last thing when you order a water for 3 euro only from room service you have to pay extra 10 euros, Only good thing there is a hotel shuttle from to airport
459701,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Rooms are not as big as most 4 star hotels We were upgraded for free from a standard to a deluxe room and still the size was regular small Not all bedrooms have a king queen size bed so be careful since sharing 2 bed together is definitely not the same Breakfast is too expensive 18 50 per person which is a lot and because of that we never had breakfast in the hotel Lunch Dinner is simple but good and the prices are reasonable , The hotel is super modern and comfortable The view from my room in the 15th floor was amazing and the bar in the 17th floor too They offer a free shuttle from the airport and for only 5 per person from the hotel to the airport We were upgraded for free The location is much better than the way it looks on a map You can take the tram 100m away from the hotel and it takes you straight to the city center I would stay in Ramada again if they keep these discounts 
459702,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Finish in the bathroom was a little poor Shower tray leaked a little and fan was constantly running which was luckily not to bad when the door to the bathroom was closed Also the soap dispenser in the shower was stuck the wall with what I m pretty sure was just silicone was about ready to fall off each time I used it When I first arrived I had to ask the staff to come and fix the tv which wasn t working properly and open the safe to enable me to use it Staff were friendly and very helpful and came to get the problem sorted straight away but just a few little details would be nice not to have to sort out , Nice big room cleaned regularly to a high standard Staff were friendly and v helpful

459706,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location very out of the way Team stops so if you want to go out taxi is 30 home There was meant to be a bus from airport to hotel and this never arrived after digging the hotel 3 times People were not nice at all and it was crazy expensive We rang reception a couple of times and were told to walk down to reception as nobody could drop anything up to room Better off staying in a hostel, Nohing
459707,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We did end up having two twin beds pushed together the staff did ask for the maid to put a cover sheet on the beds but this didn t happen Beds were comfy however Also one morning the cleaner walked into our room without knocking and just stood there expecting us to leave which was a little strange but apart from that I can t fault it , Staff very friendly we got a free upgrade as I d specifically requested a room on higher floor for the view and there were no standard rooms left up there 
459708,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff were absolutely amazing very friendly and accommodating throughout our entire stay The bed and room facilities were second to none The restaurant and bar on the 18th floor were also lovely 
459709,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact we had to pay 150 deposit which was taken straight away but will take 2 3 business days till it gets put back in There also was a crack in our mirror, The bed was very comfortable and the staff were very helpful Trams were easy to use and the fact I could buy a travel ticket from the gift shop was great 
459710,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Away from the noise in the city plus there is a tram that goes to the city right across the street Very good restaurant A big park outside was a bonus 
459711,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Very easy to navigate to and from just follow one road to city centre its either a 45 minute walk or a ten minute tram just outside the hotel Nice clean room friendly staff more than expected for the money 
459712,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bar on 17 floor closed on Friday night for private party we were sent to lobby where they only had plastic glasses for wine which only came in small bottles and no glasses at all for beer us oldies do like glasses and a normal bottle of wine between 3 Staff in bar on Saturday night most unhelpful and service very slow After a long day sightseeing it would have been nice to relax in a pleasant bar with staff as good as on reception , Staff on reception were so helpful and friendly Booked restaurants and told us where to go and how to get there Shuttle worked very well to and from airport Bed very comfortable 
459713,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 17th floor bar was closed on Friday night for a private party but there is so much space on that floor get another bar bar staff on Saturday unfriendly and couldn t even acknowledge that we were there tall guy in the grey suit who appeared to be in charge could do with a few lessons in manners , Front office team were freindly professional and very helpful nothing was too much trouble so much better than their counterparts in the bar
459714,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Loved the fact that they had an indoor smoking area Saved us going outdoors in the cold The staff were absolutely brilliant and helped us with any questions and always greeted us in the morning and night time Seen a lot of reviews about the location but we thought the location was beautiful and even if it is a fair distance from the centre it states this when booking and plus there are trams to take you to the centre so it wasn t a problem for us The room was exactly how it was pictured Stunning rooms and very comfy beds Always cleaned and was completely spotless 
459715,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Check in took a while Had to put down a deposit which if paying by card you don t get back the same day you check out , Lovely hotel Roof top bar was gorgeous 
459716,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Poor location Quite far away from the centrum but the tram stop is near around the hotel Poor providing the info The staffs only inform the breakfast info without about not free They acted like the free breakfast is provided Shame on u, Very clean comfort facilities Low price
459717,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The hotel charge 3 00 for a can of coke You can not get room service you have to call a local take away delivery The mini bar is not stocked The 17th floor restaurant only serves 1 2 pints of beer and only one size glass of wine The restaurant prices are high for average food I E a burger is 19 It cost from 25 30 to get a taxi to town from the hotel location , The rooms are a very good size and views are lovely Lovely big bathroom with bath and shower area 
459718,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, breakfast should be more diverse shower section needs door a guide for downtown transportation would be good, very friendly personnel nicely decorated room good lighting quiet nice view of city

459720,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Staff especially Sebastiaan and Rianne were very friendly and helpful It was our anniversary and we got a room with a view and the bed was decorated with a heart towel and balloons Nice touch Great location Tram stop 2 second walk from hotel the no13 takes you right into centre in 5 10 mins Shuttle bus picks you up at airport and takes back to hotel for free and only 5 each to get back to hotel so saves you getting trains or trams and saves you money too Hotel bar was nice a little expensive but Amsterdam is expensive no matter where you go 
459721,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Some areas need a bit of maintenance The room cleaning service wasn t great beds were never made and they should have changed the sheets after 3 nights that s their policy Apart from clean cups every day I wouldn t have know that anyone had been in We did mention about the beds after the second night but nothing was done about it , Having the gym facilities English tv and excellent free wi fi
459722,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The towel was too old shower gel wasn t top up no bottles with water in the room and no minibar , Good facilities including comfortable bed and sofa nice view from the room and restaurant

459724,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast was a little bit expensive but ok everything in holland is The menu of restaurant is not so big I suggest some new plates and snacks , Very polite stuff They helped us in anything we need immediate I requested food at 1 o clock midnight and they ordered just for us whatever we wanted and it was very good quality I felt cold and they bring me extra blankets and calorifer in 3 minutes on my room Service is A quality in everything I ve Been there for 3 times and I will be much more that s sure Highly recommended

459726,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, i didn t like the bed and pillows as it was not comfy at all i didn t like the menu for the room service as it has nothing for vegetarians and they charge extra per order this was the biggest disappointment, i liked how the executive room was big and enough room to move The staff was very helpful and kind the hotel was around 6 stops away from the dam square 
459727,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The matress of the bed was knackered and needed replacing as it dipped in the middle on both sides We could have asked for it to be changed but didn t as we were still able to sleep , The building is great the bar has awesome views and its really easy to get to and from the centre the cocktails were really nice as well and the rooms were clean and well designed The staff were very friendly and helpful 
459728,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, check in seems long winded various forms a deposit is required, good views very friendly and helpful staff comfortable and quiet rooms easily reached by tram so being a bit outside the centre is not a problem

459730,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only thing is the room was a bit cold when you come had to put a heating on and wait for an hour for the room to heat, It was great the receptionists were very nice always able to help gave us even a package of cookies that they had at the reception Location 15 min in tramway to the central sqaure
459731,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, breakfast was expensive Sauna takes long time to heat up, bed comfortable Coffee supplied was good Views of the city very good Location was good next to Rembrandt Park good place to run Walking distance into center however Tram station very close
459732,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, For a 4 star hotel toilet wasn t clean Empty fridge if asked for a bottle of water to be brought to the room there is a charge of 10 euro for the room service Except the soap dispensers and a piece of soap the toiletries were missing same as for slippers and bathrobes Chair visiby dirty a wet cloth could solve the issue but obviously the responsible person for this matter seams not to care for such details , Helpful and friendly staff the reception and 17th floor breakfast and dinner 
459733,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 50 euros per night is a little bit too much for a deposit , I liked absolutely everything The hotel was nice and cozy the staff was very pleasant and helpful the room was really good and comfortable the location was perfect as well direct tram to the city center it takes less than 15 minutes to get there Didn t expect less from Ramada 
459734,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, When making the booking I was not made aware of the compulsory deposit on arrival or the city tax The double bed was two single beds pushed together the sheets weren t changed everyday or every other day for that matter , Easy access to tram line but just a little bit too far out of town
459735,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel had only 8 seats and there was a mad crush to get on, Roof top bar was nice and location was brill as it was right outside tram stop
459736,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No cafe s shops right near the hotel , The rooms were spacious and very modern Staff were absolutely fantastic Tram stop right out the front to get into the centre

459738,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, We were on the 10th floor the view of the city and park was great The bed was perfect for me co comfortable The bar on the 17th floor and very cool we only had a couple of drinks The looked nice even we didn t try it There is the number 7 and 13 tram just outside the hotel both bring you into the centre I didn t no when I booked that they have a free shuttle bus from the airport but we got the shuttle from the hotel to the airport with 5 change Book this in advance The hotel isn t walking from the city centre but if you rent a bike its only a 10 15 ride out from the city centre The ken market is not far from the hotel this is a must for all foodies and people who enjoy a good drink 
459739,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Didn t realise it was so far from centre of the city but trams are regular but can be crowded , Upgraded to executive suite for special birthday well worth the extra money Super king size bed was one of the comfiest I ve ever slept in and the panoramic views were amazing hotel airport bus handy and hotel staff very friendly 
459740,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, transfer from airport not in time and full some problems with air con at the beginning but solved from staff breakfast too expensive, close to the tram very friendly and helpful staff nice restaurant in the 17th floor modern and nice equipped rooms I can recommend the hotel 
459741,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The city tax was ridiculous at 25 and room service was 10 alone Considering the food in the restaurant was expensive , The room was better than expected and so comfy The staff were the nicest friendliest people we ve ever met 
459742,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact that booking com didn t specify clearly enough that we had to pay 150euro for holding deposit Also quite far from the city 15minutes on a tram in and out, Lovely hotel and staff
459743,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, PAYMENT ISSUES CONTINUE I HAVE BEEN CHARGED TWICE SPLIT THE COST WITH A FRIEND IM BACK IN THE UK AND BEEN CHARGED THE FULL AMMOUNT MESS UP FROM START TO FINISH NO REPLY FROM MY EMAILS The room itself for the price should have a fridge and also shower hose came out if the pressure was too high complete nightmare and let sown expected a lot better , Bed was comfy
459744,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Toilets do not have exhaust Did not receive toiletries initially and had to ask them separately , Staff was very friendly and courteous Location is pretty good considering public transport to tourist destination 
459745,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It s pricey but if you are affordable the hotel is good enough Btw they ask my credit card during check in then suddenly take the deposit without noticing me in advance It was almost one week ago and I haven t received my money back Hopefully it just arrives late , 2 minutes walking to tram station Everytime we are back from city centre the tram driver reminds us by calling Ramada apollo It s really funny 
459746,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I didn t like not having a headboard as it was uncomfortable watching television and only found spare pillow when I was leaving, Rooms were lovely and cosy and liked the ice machine
459747,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Someone at the check in desk gave us the wrong time for the shuttle bus we were almost late and would have missed our flight, The room s coffee was awesome i took some home with me
459748,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Didn t realise how far out from city centre it was own fault not enough research , The room and hotel in general were clean and tidy The rooftop bar and restaurant was really good nice food and amazing food Reception staff were helpful and friendly
459749,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The hotel shuttle is driving guests from the airport to the hotel every 40 minutes It cannot accomodate every guest so people have to wait for the next shuttle This hotel has to arrange more frequent pick ups every 15 20 minutes or use a bigger vehicle Amsterdam has a busy airport When my husband and I entered the shuttle the driver asked us to leave the van cause there were people who should be on the bus who he could not accomodate on his last trip from the airport to the hotel If I would have known I would not have waited for this bus and taken a taxi which we did anyway The evening before we arrived I inquired about the shuttle via phone call to the Ramada front desk Someone said not to use the public transport it would take too much time and rather take the hotel shuttle The staff could make people aware on the phone that the bus might run out of space It was just a waste of time and experiencing a rude treatment from the driver and we paid a taxi at the end we should have done before We explained the situation to a lady at the reception of the hotel she listened to us and made sure we were taken care of which was nice Overall I have been to the Apollo Ramada before and will again and I would suggest the hotel , Nice breakfast buffet friendly staff green surroundings near tram stop clean and modern rooms 
459750,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room was strangely arranged bed had no headboard so sitting up to read or watch TV was difficult and uncomfortable Bathroom badly designed so that shower overflowed onto bathroom floor Heating too slow to operate and adjust and unable to open window for ventiltion , 17th floor restaurant and breakfast was good Staff were friendly and helpful
459751,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No refrigerator mini bar in the room that would have also needed more lighting The hotel is a bit away from downtown it takes a 17 min tram ride to reach it , Very helpful staff modern and quiet hotel next to Rembrandtpark Spacious room Efficient shuttle service from to the airport Bargain rates 
459752,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact that when the booking is made months in advance through booking com the money isn t taken straight away and on the last day you are left with a bill , Rooms are modern
459753,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Really comfy room we booked an executive with complimentary bathrobes and slippers safe sky bar is fab it was my birthday weekend so the hotel put surprise balloons in the room and gave us complimentary cocktail for 2 as a treat lovely touch thank you staff are very helpful and the number 13 tram stops right outside the hotel to take you into town takes about 7mins def would stay here again great hotel and value 
459754,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing the place is perfect , This place is just amazing the staff are so friendly and the hotel itself of stunning the rooms and the view are fab the picture below is the view from our room Second time coming back and will definitely go back again 
459755,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location is not very convenient in Amsterdam there a lot of the other hotels closer to the city center This hotel is too business but with lack of the needed service restaurant is expensive with poor taste of dishes fitness area is very small sauna is not very comfortable and not enough hot Even conference facilities could be better I would not recommend this hotel taking into account alternatives in Amsterdam , Staff was supportive and very positive Good proposal from the hotel on the free transfer from airport 
459756,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The heating wasn t working in our room The WiFi was terrible , The view from the 15th floor was beautiful The rooms are decorated to a lovely standard 
459757,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No answer, It was my girlfriends birthday and they decorated the room for her Also the room was beautifully decorated and very modern there was a tram stop right outside the hotel that brought us directly to Dam square Overall great hotel and staff Floor 17 was amazing also
459758,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The coffee facility was not stocked on our second day no milk for tea but that was the only thing , The staff where very friendly and helpful the hotel was clean and location good easy to get to centre on the tram 
459759,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Very expensive breakfast 18 50 , Hotel reception staff couldn t do enough for you excellent customer service Free shuttle is a great service also and when left early without us for our return journey hotel manager arranged and paid for a taxi honestly best hotel service I ve ever received was no trouble at all Rooms clean and beds really comfy 
459760,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The shuttle bus issue we had Although a great service of free shuttle from airport being able to reserve a slot on production of your passport would be something you should think about as people that just exited the airport jumped on bus while we were putting our bags on as we were already first there waiting and then we had to remove our bags and shared a taxi with other people rather than wait another 40 mins for the shuttle to return , The friendliness of the staff comfy beds great city view from our room nice bathroom with great shower Wonderful bar on floor 17 with a rooftop area above I m sure I m the summer months this is a great place to spend time as temperatures were very low these days we stayed The immediate resolvement of the 2 issue we had We needed kettle replacing as the one in room was bit rusty inside replaced immediately although prob shouldn t have been in the room in first place house keeping issue there and gave us complimentary coffees from reception while waiting for kettle to be brought to room Also needed someone to come show us how to work the heater in room Called reception and nice guy came immediately and showed us The free shuttle from airport to hotel also super bonus and the 5 charge for return is good Great savings as would be much more expensive to organise transport 
459761,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, I stay often when on business in Amsterdam I have tried many hotels in the area over the years This one is my favourite Great staff comfortable beds and good value for money 
459762,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We were charged a city charge which was 5 of the total cost of our booking which I hadn t been aware until they told us on arrival at the hotel , Rooftop bar had really good views All staff were friendly and welcoming Hotel was clean and tidy Shuttle service is excellent idea to and from the hotel Tram stop to the centre is right outside the hotel Really enjoyed our stay here 
459763,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Poor service to rooms Our booking was for 4 nights and our room was only cleaned once Had to request new towels and bathroom necessities , Great location Executive room great size and view Friendly staff Easy access to Amsterdam via tram Lovely parklands adjacent to wander and ride through Good local restaurants within walking distance plus local shops and services 
459764,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, On check in we were asked to pay 150 deposit but our friends only had to pay 100 and they were staying the exact same length of time as us The lady at the desk told us the city tax was 5 per day but it turned out that it was only 5 overall The heating system in the room did not work The food and drink was very expensive and did not warrant the price paid , Tram stops right outside hotel number 13 takes you to main areas nice views no noise 
459765,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, One member of staff was rude when we came in to check in so we moved to another person and the transport from airport to hotel the guy was also rude told us to get of the bus because we hadn t asked if we could go on but we just followed everyone else and we was there before some of the other people so had to mKe our own way to the hotel it should be properly organised rather than just deciding who goes and who doesn t it should be who as be waiting the longest not who gets on first, Roof top view and restaurant cleanliness of room and hotel
459766,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The towel was not changed, Staff are friendly and pleasant Room is nice and spacious Close to the airport It takes 10 minutes to get to the city centre by tram Amazing park nearby
459767,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Each day something was out of place after the room was straightened One day there were no coffee stirrers Another day dirty towels left on bathrm floor Another day blank key left in key holder and trash cans not replaced , The room was so quiet yet very comfortable 
459768,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bathroom towels were too small , Bed was soo comfortable Nice view Close to public transportation and stores Personal very nice and helpful Definitely recommend it 
459769,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Poor food bar restaurant menu only one size of beer glass small didn t sell Port which is my main alcoholic drink Told we were upgraded for free as our first room hadn t been cleaned but it was exactly the same SMALL But clean Hotel too far away for us , Comfy beds lovely staff gorgeous breakfast 
459770,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Prices for food too high so didn t eat here at all , Large and very comfortable Great walk in shower Although staff said the hotel was full we never heard a sound and slept really well Loved the roof top terrace 
459771,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Staff and their clear dislike to their job Poor service and communication Extortionate snack prices Staff not willing to assist and if they do it s not sincere Misleading hotel advert No where near Amsterdam centre Hotel not sticking to what I purchased Paying for a shuttle return and it being overbooked twice Not safe to walk around alone without being harassed I m a female in mid 20s Having to ask for fresh towels on both days Worst place and service I ve ever received and I m a frequent traveller Overall Amsterdam was a let down , The view from the room wasn t too bad I guess 
459772,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Price of breakfast was a little pricey hence why we only had it one day , Beds were extra extra comfy and rooms were perfect for a few days away Hotel always clean and accessible Staff went above and beyond to make our stay perfect Extra towels and toiletries supplied at demand Staff were the highlight of the stay one member didn t explain the deposit situation clearly enough which led to lack of faith in the staff but every other member was helpful pleasant and extremely approachable for any needs City centre dam square easily accessible from tram station Lovely hotel and quiet surroundings lovely views from room and 17th floor terrace Also lovely food from 17th floor restaurant best burger I ve ever tasted 
459773,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, My third time staying at The Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre The only place i stay when taking short trips to Amsterdam Shuttle bus service from Schiphol Airport every 30 mins Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful Floor 17 Sky Bar is a added bonus to the hotel with panoramic views over Amsterdam Tram stop is right outside the hotel Anne Franks house is 5 mins away by tram then Central Station is 10 mins away The Ramada is a very modern and elegant property best suited for couples wanting to get away for a couple of days im counting down the days till my next visit 
459774,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, When I booked the room I was supposed to pay 350 when I got there I had to pay 490 That is completely ridiculous having not told me about the price increase either We stayed for three nights Got there at 1 on Thursday and our room wasn t ready until half five when check in is at 3 Also took a deposit off us that was 150 that was supposed to be refunded straight away two days later still nothing No compensation for any of this Ridiculous prices Very far away from the centre so the name is all smoke and mirrors Not impressed at all, The staff were quite helpful 
459775,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Water pressure could have been better and I wish the shower had a door , Great hotel My friend and I arrived way earlier than expected They had a room ready and allowed us to check in very early 11 30am This allowed us to unload and start our day so much sooner Room bed was comfortable and the view was great Staff held our luggage way past checkout free of charge Location was great Tram stop right outside of the hotel direct to center 
459776,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bed was kind of weird Thin topper placed on top of the matrasses All together way too soft Couldn t sleep without breaking my neck , Friendly staff Clean Good location 15 minutes by tram to the city center 
459777,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Wen we book out On Sunday morning they try to charge extra for things charge to the room from the couple who stay in the room the days before drinks at the bar and breakfast they try to charge me for, The place was nice and clean
459778,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel room not cleaned properly coffee not replaced each morning and prices for breakfast meals and drinks in the restaurant were very high , Staff were friendly
459779,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Expensive breakfast and the double bed it wasn t a double bed but TWO small twin beds and it was very hard to sleep on them we were falling in the middle all night And there was no swimming pool , I liked the setting of the hotel near the park and very close to the tram station from where you can get to the city centre in 10 minutes 
459780,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room was a bit tight for 2 suitcases , The hotel is located in front of a park and the tram and bus stops are on the main road Check in staff are friendly helpful Lobby is spacious Hotel provides a room for left luggage Free and transport to Schiphol Airport for a small fee Tram from Centraal Station to Ramada takes about 15min Being environment friendly the hotel does not provide a fridge in the room 
459781,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I thought the amenities such as the toilet paper and towels are a let down as they are thin and not very adequate for a four star hotel Although it wasn t an issue for us the hotel is a good 10 15 minutes by tram ride to the centre This may not be ideal for everyone , I loved the modern layout of the rooms the bathroom and cleanliness The hotel was in a peaceful location by rembrandt park and it had good facilities like airport shuttle 
459782,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Wi fi in 5th floor weak signal and slow , Got an upgraded room and late check out the staff is absolutely perfect smiling always help with whatever questions richly accomodated rooms nice 17th floor restaurant with panorama 3min to the tram 10min to the market 15min to metro but its worth it its not 4 but 5 star hotel believe me 
459783,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, As I booked a queen size bed room a few months back and on arrival I received a double room but it was with two single beds pushed together I didn t mind But the fact that I paid for a big room and didn t get it I did try and find out why this was We got upgraded to the top floor which I had already requested from the start yet the beds were still two singles As me and my partner this was our first holiday away together I paid enough for the hotel to not give me the room I wanted Very disappointed ,No Positive
459784,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Staff unhelpful as arrived before room ready Told leave bags in storeroom and collect keys when finished sighseeing in Amsterdam When we arrived back keys were not ready and were interrogated wuth the staff member demanding our passports Staff not at all helpful about how to get around city Breakfast v expensive so did not opt for this Tap in bathroom leaked water all over sink and over personal belongings , Nearby tram convenient and inexpensive 
459785,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The staff in the mid morning time in the roof top lounge seemed less interested in being there , The front desk were very friendly and helpful The shop at reception that sold tram tickets was very useful Option of a number of trams near by The shuttle bus was very good
459786,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact they asked for another 150 on arrival which they took off our bank card Then on leaving they kept 30 saying it was for tax for staying in the city To date the 120 still hasn t gone back in our bank So beware of this extra money needed on arrival because we were not told about this, The roof terrace was a bonus Great Area to stay Clean and friendly on arrival 
459787,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Staff were a little clueless took 385 euro out of my card instead of 100 for a safety deposit for the room I had no money left as they took it on the 3rd day of my stay and I had 4 days left with literally no money They did nothing to help me with their own mistake The room wasn t ready when we arrived which wasn t bad but we were given a room on the 12th floor instead of the 13th floor that I paid for Room was gorgeous but very small for the price that I paid Also when we went onto the 17th floor bar for food and drinks we were told to go change our clothes as we didn t meet dress code standards which was extremely rude as we were dressed very nice and neatly By the time we went back to the room and got changed and went back up to the bar we were told oh you were gone for so long that we haven t a table for you anymore so after telling us to go change they gave away our table then told us that we were gone too long In the end we got a table so far at the back that we didn t get served for 30 mins when I finally asked for some service it was again another 30 mins I asked to be moved to somewhere where we would actually be seen We decided not to go to floor 17s bar again , Tram was directly across from the hotel that brought you right into dam square tram is very cheap Rooms were clean and modern the view was alright 
459788,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The gym is a total health hazard and needs to be managed and monitored before someone seriously hurts themselves Water should be in the room as complimentary charging euros for it is really bad, Quiet clean room friendly staff and easy to get into town 
459789,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I couldn t really fault this hotel and will be back to stay, The proximity to the tram was excellent the airport pick up an added bonus and the skybar is a great place to relax after a day around Amsterdam
459790,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Rooms were cold and bad smell coming from sewers awoke one morning to find food had come up plug hole off shower stains also on side off matress , Beautiful sky lounge and location
459791,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room too dark Room carpet was wet and musty when we checked in Drinking cup disposable was not replenished daily Insufficient towels, Location was food
459792,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the fitness center was poor and the bath at the sauna was not working I had looked forward to both , All the staff was very helpful and didn t mind that our group was messing around 
459793,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast was 15 Euros but not quite worth that money Double bed was 2 singles pushed together with 2 separate blankets So really you sleep on one single bed, Location of hotel was just outside city but with excellent views of Amsterdam Tram to the city was outside the door and was a 10 minute trip 
459794,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was far from the center Bycle is the best solution to this problem Fitness center is a lie It is not a place for exercise They should shut it down , The terrace restaurant was amazing Breakfast was very good 
459795,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No wardrobe Weren t allowed in the sky bar due to a private function Very pricey in the sky bar , Comfortable bed Good shower Friendly staff Good shuttle to and from the airport Close to tram stop 
459796,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No Wardrobe Room wasn t cleaned on one of the days despite informing the staff Telephone in the room didn t work and wasn t repaired throughout the stay 6 nights , The Hotel is very close to a Tram Stop 13 
459797,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Having to leave early but nothing to do with the hotel , When we had to suddenly leave before time for UK due to family illness Staff were extremely efficient helpful and calming in the frantic hour of packing checking out getting to Airport on time for last flight of the evening Facilities excellent Bed very comfortable for sound sleep breakfast was as always good and plentiful Staff always willing to give advice when asked Executive Room on the 11th floor sth east cnr had excellent view looking over Rembrant Park

459800,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location was a lot further time wise from the centre of Amsterdam than it appears in distance on a map Cleaning staff don t seem to understand the Do Not Disturb sign every single day they would knock on the door with the sign on waking me up I was out all night for ADE and sleeping all day so as the sign suggested I didn t want to be disturbed Also no mini bar in the room which seemed odd , All round good hotel clean modern and comfortable The staff were excellent and happy to help 
459801,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We got an upgrade for a deluxe room however they gave us twin room not a double as initially booked Laundry service is really poor cost me 20 EUR for a jacket and came back destroyed , Decent room size the bed is amazing and there s a nice bar at 17th floor with 360 view of the city 
459802,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bar at the 17 floor used on a average basis 20 min to get you a drink They told us tahat it awas becouse of all the peplie there but there were 6 7 people working and there was maybe 50 guests nice location cool menu poor staff , The drain in the shower was cloged We told the front desk but they didnt do anything about it for two days Housekeeping was not at there best either For the rest of out stay the front office staff was polite and kind Nice room 
459803,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Great 5 night stay with the Romantic upgrade package Nice suites The bar on the 17th floor could be faster to serve thy lose revenue on that 
459804,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Could have had more pillows on the bed , Everything Great service staff extremely helpful Went for our 5th yr anniversary nice special touches offered by the hotel 
459805,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, This 17 storey hotel offers the most splendid panoramic views of Amsterdam from its rooftop It is located in a quiet neighborhood next to Rembrandtpark However the city center Dam Centraal is only a 10 15 minutes ride tram 13 It s a standard 4 star hotel with all its expected facilities and comfort We were accommodated in the 16th floor as per our request with a staggering view of the entire city from our room Furthermore our breakfast was made complimentary during our entire stay a rare gesture well appreciated 
459806,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location was the only downside to this hotel as we had to travel quite a lot to get to the city centre among other places , It was a very nice hotel kept very clean and very friendly staff 
459807,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Staff very friendly helpful Level 17 Bar was cool Hotel was class will definitely return would highly recommend Tram was right beside the hotel and brought us into the centre of Amsterdam in about 10mins Shuttle bus to from airport was a nice touch
459808,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Storage for clothing Lack of mini bar , Great location Rooms are great strange storage for your clothes and a mini bar would have been a good advantage Roof bar and the sky lounge was excellent Definitely stay there again 
459809,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Some stain on the table in the hotel room that was missed by the cleaning person It is not too serious but stil , Friendly staff Nice bed Good facilities 
459810,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No problems everything was very good, Great location very professional staff good value for the money and the flavored strawberry water was wonderful 
459811,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Overall our stay was comfortable and our expectations were met One point of improvement are the pillows I found the pillows to be very hard Might be a good idea to place a soft pillow in the room as well , Great location public transportation takes you to Dam Square and Central Station in 15 minutes Friendly and helpful staff Clean rooms Plenty of parking space 
459812,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, 10of1o Magnificet hotel with excelent staff The rooms are very co0mftebel free chatell to anb airport And tramp no 13 araund the corner to city center 10 mn U can wallk ezyly 20 mn Ramada pollo amsterdam is 1 of the best hotels in amsterdam city I say it is agood choic Defenetly go 4 it 
459813,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, we were refused entry to the bar because there were no tables free when the entire section used for breakfast right next to it was empty and just hadn t been opened Our room was originally on 16th floor music from 17th floor bar blasting till 2 oclock in the morning We moved room Breakfast a bit pricey at 15 but we added it as an option when we checked in We then had an argument with a receptionist because we cancelled one day s and she didn t want to remove from bill Double bed was actually two singles with 2 single duvets , restaurant on 17th floor with great views 
459814,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Can t think of any negatives Possibly the airport shuttle only being every 40 mins could be more frequent , Very helpful staff who provided great assistance when asked Tram right outside the hotel where the city is just 15 minutes away Easy to purchase tickets for this from the hotel too Bed very very comfy Room provided at checkin in the morning well before the 3pm check in time Room very clean with good facilities e g Kettle and hair drier Overall good value for the price compared to other hotels Good facilities in room and in general Sky bar great for a nice evening of drinks 
459815,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Lovely hotel Fantastic views The executive King was very spacious and worth the extra cost Very comfy bed Ideal if you need access to metro but also only short tram ride into centre 
459816,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Always coming back to this place every time when visiting Amsterdam quality guaranteed Very comfortable and spacious rooms unlikely for Amsterdam hotels Various and delicious breakfast with a stunning view on Amsterdam from the 17th floor Nice helpful and pleasant stuff that welcomes you warmly at the reception desk that your travel just can t start badly The area is close to amazing Rembrandtpark which is suitable for training run walks or just chill out For those who are keen on exploring the city you can go on foot to Voldenpark and Rijksmuseum in half an hour but also in very front of the hotel there is a tram stop that takes you directly to Dam Central Station in 15 minutes Finally if you like to rest and enjoy in quiet evenings hotel has truly good sound proof insulation so good that you can oversleep your clock alarm But for those who would like to party the bar on the 17th floor and roof top when open offer various of chill out and party amusement 
459817,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Rooms are tidy but dated and this is the trade off in price , Great location good value for money 100 metres away from bus to from the international airports 400 metres walk to Eiffel Tower 
459818,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I didn t like the fact it was quite away from the city centre as transportation was expensive , I loved how modern the hotel was with friendly staff and being put on the 16th floor was amazing being able to look at a beautiful city view 
459819,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Fantastic welcome with all friendly faces Special touch with wedding anniversary wine as a gift note and balloons left on the bed The staff even changed the wine from red to white without a blink of an eye Fantastic Cant wait to come back Thank you for a memorable trip 
459820,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel because it was too expensive at 18 euros per person or 15 euros if booked in advance the pound being worth only 1 10 euros at present We tended to have a coffee and croissant at a bar in town On the last day we got up earlier than usual and could only get luke warm water from the taps There was no plug in the hand basin which seemed to be a deliberate policy , The location was great on the edge of a lovely park with a lake and a running cycling perimeter track only 15 minutes or so from the city centre by tram We had a very clean and comfortable room on the 14th floor with a terrific view The busy bar restaurant on the 17th floor was great with panoramic views and a vast range of cocktails and other drinks There was also a kiosk in reception where you could buy a drink and a snack 24 7 All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful N B There is a free dedicated shuttle service from the airport direct to the hotel running every 20 minutes phone the hotel for full details The return service has to be booked but costs only 5 euros p p 
459821,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, None, The shuttle service to and fro to airport is a big plus Hotel staff service was excellent helpful and courteous We had our dinner on the 17th floor was given a table by the window with a lovely view Restaurant staff service is good very polite and helpful Even the staff that you happen to meet in the elevator they are all very service oriented and polite Rooms are big big bed a large sofa and desk area Bathroom size is big too Loved our room on the 14th floor with city view Metro stop is just round the corner 2 3 mins walk The convenience store in the hotel sells the days cards which is very convenient and thumbs up for providing this service We bought the 72 hour card Hotel area is safe lovely and relaxing in fact Rembrandt Park is in beside hotel but we never to to explore it cos didn t have time Wifi is good Hubby said to stay here again should we come this way again 
459822,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No restaurant open Sunday after they let us book in for it Room directly under stairs so noise mist of the night hairdryer no good and kettle leaked everywhere , Staff ok Stayed before 1 year ago and had great time but different this time would not go back 
459823,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was very small When we booked online the room looked a lot bigger than what it actually was No fridge in the room , The breakfast buffet is a plus Very well served and a great variety The hotel is very close to a tram stop and a few stops away from the city centre 
459824,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, See above We were charged city tax and for shuttle bus that ran to airport which we were unaware of , I was very uncomfortable in bed and fell out due to mattress falling off the side of bed the drink food prices were rediculously high We had to pay 150 as a deposit which we did not know about which reduced our spending money I felt the hotel needs a bit of an overall as felt it was a bit shabby The furniture in the lobby was stained and not nice to sit on The staff were polite that was the only positive 
459825,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 1 We were not informed in advance that the bar and restaurant were closed for one night and therefore there was no dinner available Then we had to order from an italian restaurant indicated by the concierge food not so good for the price charged 2 Room smaller than we expected 3 Would be better if there was a small refrigerator in the room 4 Would love to have decaf tea in the room only regular tea was available , Breakfast was very good 
459826,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Review of Ramada Apollo Hotel in Amsterdam My husband and I recently spent four very pleasant nights at the Ramada Apollo hotel in Amsterdam While the hotel s location was not in the city core it was easily reached in 16 minutes on the 13 tram from Centraal train station With Amsterdam s amazing system of trams there was no site within the city core that we couldn t reach from our hotel within about 30 minutes or so thus making it convenient but less expensive than a closer location might be When we asked for a room with a view on a high floor at the registration desk we were instantly upgraded to such a room a step up from the standard smaller room we had booked We enjoyed our room very much as well as the amenities delivered daily tea and coffee The room was modern attractive and comfortable and it met all of our needs and expectations The hotel was located in a safe neighbourhood within a park setting and was a mere one minute walk from where the tram deposited us Even though we arrived back at the hotel quite late each night we always felt safe especially as there were usually other hotel guests alighting from the tram with us plus other passersby on the street I think what we liked best about the hotel however was the friendly very helpful and enthusiastic staff we encountered at the reception desk We probably dealt with about four or five different staff during our stay and each one was extremely attentive knowledgeable and service oriented Any questions we asked were met with instant smiles internet research maps circled with our destinations etc A note left behind for maintenance staff advised we were out of body wash in the shower resulted in a timely refill and a handful of those little sample bottles We also availed ourselves of the hotel s airport shuttle service which cost a modest 5 euros apiece and whisked us off to Schiphol airport on time and within 15 minutes of departure 
459827,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We had to wait to get the 2nd bed in our room Even though we had told prior to check in So to find at 12 00am when we got that spare bad wasn t good However it was quick fix but not ideal, Bathroom faculties for disabled guests
459828,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing This is one of the best hotels I ve ever stayed in and I ve traveled all over the world , Phenomenally good views of Amsterdam from our room and the 17th floor breakfast room There is a lovely rooftop terrace as well 
459829,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Another excellent stay at the ramada apollo Great location Fantastic staff The staff do all they can to accomodate an early check in when possible The mattresses in the rooms are to die for 10 10
459830,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not a fan of the room charging facility that is in place as it is open to being abused as i discovered someone charged my room with food and drinks but the hotel very quickly investigated and refunded my money , Very friendly and professional staff excellent location with fantastic assess to the public transport system The sky bar is a great place to dine or have a drink but found the reception area bar was cheaper and still a nice environment
459831,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Would have liked more choices for food in the bar restaurant Key card to the sauna didn t work so needed to call reception inconvenient , staff were very helpful and polite 
459832,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel restaurant feels more like a pub which is fine if you want to grab a drink but not so much for a quiet meal , Good size bedroom and very comfortable beds Very good breakfast also and very nice staff Very good shuttle service to and from the airport 
459833,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A little bit dark inside Especially the closet place , Good view on the top restaurant Nice staff Convenient location with bus stop and a quite place 
459834,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was too small and has bad smell so we asked to be moved to another room they offered us a room with twin bed And refused to give us better room as they should do to satisfy us, The view from the room
459835,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable The hotel is 2 mins from A10 highway and also next to a tramstop The bar on the 17th floor is super cool The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful and efficient 
459836,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The small round mirror fell off the wall whilst I was in the room I called the reception and they offered to fix it straight away though The room was a little smaller than I thought but I only booked a double so for more space I would recommend upgrading to a King size room I wasn t aware that there wouldn t be any shampoo conditioner amenities in the room and I actually didn t bring my own I just assumed the hotel would offer these my bad , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly I ve gotten used to the terrible service that the Dutch offer so it was so refreshing to have lovely and friendly Dutch staff who actually smiled and seemed like they enjoyed their work The bed was comfortable The 17th floor had beautiful views and the food was decent 
459837,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Just the price of the breakfast , We booked this hotel as we wanted to spoil ourselves at the end of a 6 week UK European holiday It didn t disappoint Hotel provided a free shuttle from the airport The hotel is located about 15 minutes from Amsterdam by tram Their is a tram stop right around the corner The reception staff were great and we enjoyed a free upgrade to an spacious executive corner room on the floor Breakfast was good with lots of choice but not cheap at 18 pounds each person each morning 
459838,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not much really the location is kinda far out so that was the only negative but nothing that can be done about that , The bar was excellent the staff were really friendly and helpful the sauna was lovely and the view at the breakfast bar was beautiful 
459839,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and accommodating Took the time to ask what we planned to do see at check in and gave detailed information on this including writing instructions and pointing out things like where to get on off public transport on a map Great location close enough to city centre on public transport but also far enough out to get peace Also great shuttle service to and from the Airport aswell as a very secure luggage room to leave bags on the final day after wend checked out instead of dragging them round with us all day 
459840,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Absolutely perfect If one were to complain that it could be closer it would negate the reality that closer hotels are more expensive with often less features and smaller rooms , Absolutely best fit in all categories Location free cheap shuttle to Schipol On a direct metro stop to Centraal Modern Clean Full Featured rooms and facility with all bells and whistles Professional Friendly staff who bend over backward to make your stay not only comfortable but special Rooftop bar Restaurant with food available at all hours with great view and ambiance Value is phenomenal when you compare it to typical AMS hotels perfect balance of features price and location
459841,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Poor housekeeping they don t clean the room very well some of the reception staff not very helpful no luggage porter only one small mirror in the room , Nice Location near ramprandt park and tram stop very close You can also rent bicycles from the hotel executive room is spacious amazing room view needs some work but we will Book it again if we ever come to Amsterdam 
459842,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No bar or coffee shop in ground floor Very soulless no toiletries in the bathroom apart from liquid soap No water or mini bar in room No pool, Rooms clean stylish and comfortable 17th floor bar restaurant very nice with great views
459843,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The seating in the bar and breakfast area is uncomfortable We were not allowed to have our evening meal in the restaurant seating area as we were eating from the bar menu The high bar like seats are ok for having a drink but not for eating breakfast or dinner Didn t like the big space behind the bed We couldn t prop up pillows to read as they fell through the gap We stayed for three nights but would not be able to hang clothes if we stayed for a longer period Not enough hanging space , We liked the hotel and the staff were very friendly
459844,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, We travelled to Amsterdam to stay in the Ramada Apollo for my mams 50th birthday There was a group of 20 of us It wasn t only a celebration for my mam as my boyfriend decided to suprise me with asking me to marry him The hotel staff went above and beyound to help him and were so lovely to us after I can t thank them enough and couldn t recommend the hotel enough It was actually our second time to stay in the hotel which says it all really we recommended it to our family as we had such a lovely time on our first trip It s a weekend I will never forget and can t praise the staff enough 
459845,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We were out for The Day coming back at the hotel at 5 p m the room wasn t done We had to wait till 6 30 before The room was done The standard cleaning is poor,No Positive
459846,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Perhaps it is a cultural difference in how things are done but clarity on shuttle AIRPORT PICK UP and RETURN procedure at the time of booking with Booking com would have been helpful Ended up corresponding directly with the hotel to get all my questions answered Why not save everyone time and provide that information beforehand Free shuttle pick up every 20 minutes from 0620 to 2130 at the last covered stand portion for shuttles outside and to the right of Terminals 3 4 look for Ramada Apollo listing on an overhead sign crowded with other hotel names But be forewarned there is also another Ramada Apollo shuttle which goes to Wynham only Look for the printed sign in the side window not just the red painted sign on the silver color 8 passenger van Outside of those shuttle hours you ll need to take a cab There is a charge for the return trip and it needs to be reserved the day before The 5 charge per person is added to your hotel bill Don t misplace the business card receipt which has your shuttle departure time and room number It s your ticket for the next day Drop off is at the same place as pick up arrival level Our driver fetched and loaded a luggage cart for us That was unexpected and appreciated service well deserving of a significant tip You ll need to take the cart escalator or lift elevstor up one floor to the departure level This may be a minor point to some but not others We simply put up with it Not a deal breaker for us Facilities at the Ramada Apollo Hotel were great except for the design of the shower stall Not too functional Plenty of towels are available just ask to deal with the splash through the entry way an open half of the stall no shower curtain possible in the design without destroying the aesthetic appeal Not a very green approach , View was spectacular asked for high floor and 6th floor was assigned Breakfast on the 17th floor was even better But a bit pricey affecting the Value for Money score The neighborhood Dirk supermarket in view from the next tram stop toward Central Station would ve been a better value Front desk staff was courteous and helpful with instructions on how to find sights via Tram 13 in front of the hotel which ran frequently Location to visit the nearby sights as a convenience factor drove our decision to reserve this hotel Also the beautiful adjacent park one of the largest in Amsterdam was part of that decision There is an abundance of mature trees And safety is never an issue It is well used by bicyclists and saw a couple of police officers standing OUTSIDE of their vehicle on one of the inner paths 
459847,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was not obvious that therewas a regular shuttle service FROM Schiphol No plug in bathroom sink No shampoo skin cream etc in bathroom Breakfast area was dirty and chaotic No door on shower so almost whole bathroom floor ended up wet, Friendliness and helpfulness of staff Shuttle to airport as advertised
459848,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Only slight problem with check in which delayed our time in the center of amsterdam that evening but didnt spoil our break , Hotel is situated next to the park and tram lines Staff were very helpful Great breakfast choice 
459849,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, location very good tram stop right by the hotel to take you in ten minutes to the centre of Amsterdam We did have a problem to start with but the very kind staff soon sorted it out for us and the rest of our stay was very good 
459850,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bathroom could be a bit more clean The breakfast is a bit stressful A lot of people a large hotel running around tables without a lot of space Breakfast quality and variety can be significantly improved , The hotel is big having free space and a nice atmosphere The restaurant breakfast room at the 17th floor offers a spectacular view of the city 
459851,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The women at the front desk were very very kind and all of them tried to solve any issues that we had I don t remember their names but we arrived too early in the morning like 3 AM and they did their best to make us feel comfortable and to get a room as soon as possible Excellent all of them 
459852,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The service at the rooftop bar was too slow The system for ordering drinks and the time frame for getting your drinks was too long , Everything location rooms staff who couldn t have been more helpful when my Daughters partner had organized to secretly propose to her and they had everything organized candles music champagne the works I would highly recommend this hotel 
459853,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, quite noisy on the 16 floor around 2 00 am I had a bucket collecting air conditioning condensation water in front of my room One staff person trying to deal with incoming airline crews and guests departing on the first bus at 6 00 am wasn t enough and created some emotions The information that a shuttle runs every 40 minutes to from airport incorrect in my case I missed the one scheduled at 20 20h the next was at 21 40h Had a choice to pay 40 euro for a taxi for wait 1hour 20 minutes Paid the taxi , didn t have breakfast nice hotel
459854,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Everything about our stay was excellent from start to finish Location was great too My sister got engaged and the hotel staff could not have done enough to assist with the surprise Would definitely return and recommend to friends family
459855,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Everything was perfect, The staff were very attentive and polite the room was wonderful and the view amazing we really enjoyed staying at the hotel and will look forward to staying here again in the future 
459856,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We booked a double room and were given a room with 2 single beds pushed together with separate duvets not ideal at all Went for dinner in sky restaurant checked the time it was open but on arrival told it was shut and had to go to bar which had a very limited menu , Staff in reception very professional and polite 
459857,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A dedicated area to lock up your own bicycle securely would be good but not an issue All in all a great hotel and would definitely return , Great hotel Clean and modern and rooms a good size Rooftop bar excellent Very easy to get into the centre of the city and particularly easy if traveling by bike as it s just straight down the road Would def recommend and stay here again 
459858,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not a dislike as such but it is a little way out from Centrum and you will need the very local tram We bought IAmsterdam city cards though which included free use of public transport as well as free entry discounts in Museums etc , Staff were really helpful The room was excellent and there was a good selection at the breakfast buffet Particular shout out for the make your own fresh waffles Less than five minutes walk from the tram stop and right next to a tremendous park Free hotel shuttle from the airport and cheap shuttle back 
459859,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location too far out from centre to walk in Lack of proper restaurant facilities at hotel and no decent restaurants local to it meant having to travel out for evening meal , Helpful staff Efficient at breakfast Breakfast selection good Airport shuttle excellent Rooms well equipped service good 
459860,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shower floods the bathroom , Helpful pleasant staff Nice park next to the hotel A little bit far out of town if you are looking to explore the touristy stuff Public transport close by though Roof top bar is a sweet location if the sun is shining Coffee in the lobby is excellent
459861,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I like it place but for anybody is little bit far from center for walking , Comfortable by bike friendly staff nice view comfortable and not small rooms Amazing view from skylounge It is one of the tallest buildings in Amsterdam

459915,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It s all very expensive and not the most convenient location For most of my destinations it was better to walk 10 minutes or so to another bus or tram stop as the one nearest the hotel had limited reach A mini fridge would be a good addition to the rooms It s a bit difficult to prop pillows up for reading on the beds because of the way they are built , The breakfast is amazing the staff very friendly and the rooftop bar is gorgeous I also like the settee in the room

459958,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing everything was perfect , Loved this place 100 staying here every time we go to Amsterdam and we go quite a bit right beside a tram stop 10 mins from the heart of town beside the most beautiful park and a public swimming pool The staff were lovely and the room was gorgeous such beautiful views I cannot recommend this place enough I loved it 
459959,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, For some reason the bathroom got very wet every time we took a shower but as I have mentioned nothing serious , All the staff members were so helpful and friendly after a long 12 hour flight we arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in but the staff went out of their way to help us with an early check in We found all the people at the hotel to be friendly even the morning staff at the buffet breakfast Talking about the breakfast it had a good variety and was very tasty I also love the location of the hotel close to a tram 2 min walk but if the weather is nice you can take a nice stroll into the city which we did every day Our room was clean and comfortable just the shower made the bathroom pretty wet but that is something small and did not affect our stay This is one of the nicest 4 star hotels I have ever stayed at I can honestly say it is very good value for money especially if you book some time in advance during the bust summer months Thanks for making our stay memorable at this fine hotel 
459960,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, It was my 3rd stay in Amsterdam and this is by far the best The King executive room was exactly as expected very spacious clean and bright The bed and pillows were the comfiest of them all Also the view was very pleasant to wake up to as I was on the 9th floor I had a clear view of the city The 17th floor roof top area is such a beautiful relaxing open space with an incredible view equipped with a bar a comfy chill out area sunbeds and also lovely chairs sofas and tables to eat Staff were so welcoming and polite that I questioned whether anyone ever had a bad day They were very helpful and informative on what to do in Amsterdam and where the best spots were and even gave us a toothbrush and 2 adaptors to borrow when asked for no extra cost It s about 15 20 mins from Amsterdam central on tram and the tram stop is about a 3 minute walk so overall I would recommend this hotel for all types of stay because I will be returning with no doubt

459971,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, nothing comes to mind, the location of the hotel was perfect every place I needed to go to was in close proximity on tram bus ride away the staff was very helpful there was one incident where our room wasn t cleaned but our housekeeping manager sorted it out asap and even gave us a bottle of wine I would definitely stay there again

459974,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I had dinner in bar 17 which was nice but a little pricey for what I got, The beds were very comfortable shower was clean and powerful and when you got back after a long day sightseeing I had bbc and itv channels to watch
459975,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location, Everything nice about the hotel Location a bit far away takes about 20 25 mins to the main central station where all the action is Although the tram station is 5 mins away Very cooperative staff 
459976,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Beds are not so confortable they could be better , View from the room is great but view from the 17th floor is amazing The sunrise was incredible Staff is very gently and gave very good suggestions It is next to Rembrandt park thus you can enjoy a nice walk any time during your stay

459979,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the shuttle from airport was late around 30 minutes and the shuttle from the hotel to the airport wasn t working in the time we needed and was planned so we were forced to take expansive taxi to get to the airport on time , the view from the room was great the nearby parks are good and fun the staff and especially chantel who worked in the lobby was very kind and professional
459980,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Got charged after leaving because of a hotel mistake and they made an unauthorised transaction from my bank they were really hard to get contact about the situation and made it impossible to get the situation sorted out, The hotel room was nice
459981,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, While checking in we found the staff member to be inexperienced and that the reservation staff had failed to take into account a previous reservation that had been cancelled and as a result insisted that we had to pay for two rooms Luckily after calling Booking Com they called the hotel and advised them that the initial reservation had been cancelled months ago In addition the bedding was below standard and the double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together with single mattresses that tended to slide off the bed each sideways each night The choices for food each evening consisted of either bar food snacks or an overpriced degustation restaurant Overall a very unsatisfying and disappointing experience, Two of the ladies at the front desk were very helpful and easy to deal with 
459982,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Personally I would have preferred fewer mirrors and more convenient storage space in room Very odd wardrobe behind bed was too small and too dark to see properly and too high for me to reach easily I am 5 foot tall Also a proper bedside table would have been nice beside the bed not behind it so you had to twist round Another door to the shower would have stopped the bathroom flooding when my daughter washed her hair And a plug in the washbasin would have made it easier for me to put my contact lenses in without worrying about washing down the sink , Parking was convenient and hotel close to very frequent tram to get into Amsterdam Staff very helpful and efficient Everything in room looked lovely and was very clean Bed comfortable 
459983,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Food at the bar restaurant was not very filling mostly snacks , Great room friendly staff location near the park and very nice view from both the room and the bar restaurant

459987,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room had been prepaid including the city tax but on checkout we were required to pay the tax again The invoice clearly stated that the city tax was included in our pre payment,No Positive
459988,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, nothing, This was my 3th stay at this hotel in a 3 week period and I think my 2nd review of it and while writing these comments it is my 4th stay here Staying at a hotel 4 times during a 3 week period says enough You won t regret staying here it s worth it and you owe it to yourself to enjoy it while being in Amsterdam

459991,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, never got a reply if shuttle bus will be available to pick us from airport they only changed our towels once in 4 nights the receptionist who booked our shuttle back didn t actually booked we were told by other staff in the day we left luckily places were still available if there is a corporate event restaurant is not available for guests shame the very disappointing fact was that they didn t release our security deposit until we called in the hotel 5 working days later when we were told the person who checked us out never released the deposit so 72 hours more to wait overall nothing extraordinary just pay to sleep , view from 17th floor was nice some of the staff polite and nice place was overall clean and comfortable good position from city centre

459993,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We thought the hotel would inform us more on trams etc how to get around as we were not familiar with Amsterdam The bikes were also very expensive from the hotel at 16 a day where they were from 8 10 in the centre , The staff were very friendly made us feel very welcome
459994,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The shuttle bus service was quite an experience despite from calling early we ended up sitting on the floor of the bus for a 15mins drive on the highway putting our lives unnecessarily at risk The staff at the reception desk could did not see a problem with that On the other hand they clearly know the word security as they closed the rooftop terrace for the night security reasons just 5mins after they sold us drinks Overall we were not satisfied with our stay given the price paid and the reputation of the chain , Tram stop very close by 
459995,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location is quite out of city no toiletries strange for a 4 star and the room was just tidied but not clean everyday , This hotel is really value for money With great facilities gym bar Lobby is really grand with very friendly staff 
459996,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I didnt like that on the internet it advitised that they had mopeds when we got there we discovered there wernt any Wasnt too bad as there was a motorbike shop about a mile away that rented out mopeds , I liked that the hotel offered a bike rental service that was great for us we used them for 2 of our 4 day stay It gives you a great amsterdam experience Staff were friendly and the hotel was great The view from our room was beautiful it over looked the whole city 
459997,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Restaurant meals and breakfast pricey Shuttle from airport only carries 8 people so we had to wait more than 1 1 2 hours for pickup Most of the other hotels have larger buses , Rooftop bar offered great views Excellent idea to have the gift shop sell tram passes Short walk to the tram and the employees on board the tram are very helpful to ensure you get where you want to go

460007,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The staff were rather rude and not very welcoming They gave us a twin room initially and it took four phone calls down to reception over an entire hour for anyone to do anything The man at breakfast was particularly rude as well , Location was good it was a fairly short tram journey to Central Station and the two tram which ran close to the hotel 13 and 7 made all of the main area accessible The room was clean and well furnished The facilities were very good Breakfast was extensive though expensive The bar on the 17 floor had very good views although the roof top terrace was unavailable for our entire stay

460014,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It s a bit of a way out if you re planning to spend a lot of time in Centrum and surrounds and whilst not bad value it s not the cheapest for that sort of standard , The staff were very helpful and courteous The room was comfortable and well appointed 
460015,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shower area could use a little attention No good restaurants close by And the one at the hotel is a little bit pricy , Staff very helpful Rooms are a good size though not overly big View from the sky lounge was great A little far out of the city but the tram is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel which took right into the centre 
460016,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There is a nice restaurant on 17th floor I went to order something for take out and the staff was very rude completely ignoring me and then looking me up down Terrible experience I don t believe the restaurant is affiliated with hotel aside from sharing the building but it was a bad experience during my stay none the less , Very comfortable nice hotel It s away from city center but the train stop to city center is just a 2 minute walk from hotel Staff was friendly Hotel offers shuttle to from airport for add l 10 euro which is very convenient

460019,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Although the room has a modern design wear is evident The Cleaning was not through when I first arrived at the room for instance there was red stuff on the bathtub floor and water stains on the shower knobs The walls were dented with black lines and there was a huge stain on the sofa cushion I thought these imperfections would be corrected the second day s room cleaning but during the 8 hours I m not in the room there was no housekeeping service , The Room design seems relatively new it is surrounded by a park and it is fairly close to the tram stop

460023,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There really isnt anything not to like , We drove to Amsterdam as we were heading down to Dusseldorf afterwards so needed somewhere with easy parking as Amsterdam is not good for cars and parking nearer then centre is very expensive So great hotel with undergound parking and the tram stops just across the road so an easy 15 min tram ride to Dam Square which is the centre of Amsterdam and from there you can get anywhere Purchased tram tickets from the hotel shop 17euros per person for 72hours very good value for money if you are sightseeing Really nice mid priced hotel with trendy bar restaurent on the 17th floor with panoramic views and 24hr indoor smoking room Also a lovely sun terrace on the 19th floor perfect if the weather is in your favour The building has 4 central lifts so hit the button and there is always a quick response 
460024,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the room didn t have a minibar and even toiletteries were scarce the bed in particular was not so comfy and actually a bit dangerous the head has really sharp corners and bed sheets were not properly fitted , staff were great and generally the hotel was very clean 
460025,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A little bit more luggage space in the room and a marginally bigger bathroom would have been the icing on the cake But overall very happy with overall value for money of this hotel as a base for sight seeing A shuttle bus timetable on the hotel website would have been enlightening and information telling us that there is a timetable at the airport bus stop would also have allowed us to manage our time a bit better at the airport on arrival , Loved the friendly helpful shuttle bus driver hotel staff the very efficient left luggage service The hotel bar decor on the roof top is super and classy Beds were extremely comfortable Breakfast was excellent Tram stop beside the hotel a major plus and lovely park beside hotel gave a relaxed country feel 15 minutes to the airport easy

460034,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We almost did not get refund for our double payment for transportation cost from hotel to airport The reason the staff does not give receipt for cash payment we made the other staff just so easy to say that no record for the cash receipt without checking it But finally she wanted to check after some arguments , The cleanlines

460039,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Although we had proof of our receipt from dinner we were still questioned about whether he had actually paid or not They made up for it with 2 refreshing beers still providing great customer service, They welcomed us with chocolates and balloons for our anniversary and the lovely lady who checked us in wished us happy anniversary as well The food was also nice The room they gave us had beautiful views
460040,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only downside was the rooftop was expecting it to be open past midnight By the time we got back from the centre it was closed only downside would be great if it were open for a little longer, Great Staff very helpful and awesome shuttle service from the airport to the hotel
460041,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No conditioner We re pretty active walkers but 45 minutes to the center of everything was a little tiresome by the end of our stay Cab rides averaged 15 20 , Great people All the basics Perfect for a fun girls trip The park nearby is beautiful and the petting zoo is adorable

460112,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Check in was very busy and the main downstairs area was a bit strange , The room was excellent with panoramic views and really comfy bed We walked into Amsterdam past busy trendy bars and cafes Bar on the 17th floor was fabulous 
460113,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We were extremely disappointed with the 17th floor bar restaurant Not in terms of the quality of food and drink but because we were turned away on 2 occasions The bar was quite busy and we were told that we couldn t just go in and have drinks at the bar Even after informing the rather abrupt member of staff that we were hotel guests she told us that it didn t matter we still couldn t get in I specifically booked this hotel because of the roof terrace and 17th floor facilities I wanted to enjoy the fabulous views over Amsterdam and be able to smoke on the 18th floor terrace I m afraid what was otherwise a lovely experience at Ramada Apollo was very much spoiled by our experiences on the 17th floor I ve never stayed in any hotel before where guests could not use the bar restaurant facilities no matter how busy they were I d be very reluctant to stay again despite all other aspects of the hotel being very good , Good location only 10 15 mins by tram from Dam Square etc Tram stops outside hotel and at 12 50 for a 48hr tram ticket we were happy with the location and ease of travel into the city centre Rooms were clean and bright and the shower room was spacious bright and clean also Hotel reception is big open and has plenty of places to sit Reception staff were efficient and helpful at all times The minibus to and from airport was great value at 5 pp per trip much cheaper and quicker than a bus or taxi

460117,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We booked two rooms for two persons When we checked out found that had been charged shuttle bus fees to airport for three persons , Good loaction Transport to citycenter very convenient by Tram No 13 
460118,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The rooms could of had a little more lighting and a headboard so people don t have to sit apart from each other in order for them to lean against something Secondly I was asked to pay 50 deposit which I was told I was receive back when I checkout The staff member didn t make it clear that there would be a 5 61 city tax which I understand was on the terms and conditions but people don t usually read them therefore I think the staff members should give customers a little reminder about that to avoid any confusion Also I borrowed an adaptor and the lady that gave me it again didn t tell me there would be a charge to borrow it She handed me it and asked for my room number and that was it I was then told when getting the 50 deposit back that there was a charge which I was not happy with and I wasn t going to pay it as I wasn t aware Again staff should be clear about any payments and extra charges that will be given to their customers However in response to this a gentleman behind the reception gave me a complimentary shuttle ride to the airport which I was grateful for , The beds are extremely comfortable and the service from the staff overall was amazing They were so helpful and very welcoming to myself and my partner

460121,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 2 very unhappy experience from the staff 1 When I have made the booking I have requested if it is possible to upgrade to a room with bath tub The reply from the hotel was it is possible to arrange but cannot guarantee We have arrived early the check in day around 9am informed by the receptionist that we have been upgraded for free to an executive room which is still under cleaning so we would have to wait till later for the check in We went out for a few hours and got back to check in by the time around 3pm with a different shift of receptionist He had arranged us a standard room instead so we explained the situation to him about his colleague had said to us earlier about the upgrade His attitude was not at all good saying that we will need to pay extra for the executive room and no one had ever arranged to us the upgrade We have even told them the staff s name was Robyn Robin who had greeted us earlier Instead of checking with his colleague he insisted his opinion and ask us to show him prove in writing Of course we didn t have it in writing and he looked at us as if we were lying just trying to get some advantage After all we have paid money and time to fly a long way trying to have a nice holiday so we didn t insist and don t want to argue to ruin our mood Besides we understand totally that the upgrade was not guaranteed But wouldn t it nice if we were treated in a better attitude and if the upgrade was not existed we just get a standard room earlier than waiting specially for that executive room 2 Since there were no shops or restaurant close to the hotel we had checked especially on one of the day before we go out to ask if they still can serve food late , Lovely environment for those whom enjoys quiet The park next to it with lake is beautiful 
460122,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The layout of the contemporary designed room we stayed in was odd though thankfully clean The bed is set against a wall that if you do not place yourself far enough away from the head of the bed you can seriously bump it which did happen , The gentleman whom welcomed us was top of the line professional and any staff we spoke with were friendly and concise We were also pleased with the spacious and clean bathrooms There is a bar on the top floor that overlooks the city lights 
460123,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only thing I didn t like is early breakfast , The hotel is exceptionally good The staff is very kind and helpful They gave us all information we need They made our first impression of Amsterdam I will definitely stay there next time 
460124,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel is quite expensive at the bar and food we always eat out so didn t really affect us Sauna is quite big and has to be powered on by buttons on the wall was in there around half an hour 45 minutes and didn t really get hot at all Not sure if it s because it hadn t been used all day or the type of sauna it is like electric heaters behind a glass panel , Staff speak very good English and very friendly hotel is clean throughout and always seems quiet taxis are very quick although quite expensive tramline less than 5 minutes walk shops and cafes within walking distance Hotel shuttle is very efficient Wi fi good Although there are 17 floors the elevators always take less than a minute any time of the dayl
460125,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Didn t like the fact we had to give 100 euros as a safety deposit for the room this was unexpected and we didn t budget it for it The bed we had was comfy but was two single bed put together which split in half wasn t a double bed We asked for 2 extra pillows as we were only provides with 2 and no spares in the cupboard these pillows did not arrive with throughout our stay , Location was great very close to the nearest tram station Easy to find 
460126,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was hard to get my friend through the door on the wheelchair because there was no way to stop the door So I had to hold the door open with one arm and push the wheelchair with the other arm The curtains do not completely black out the lights from the window When the sun is shining the room is extremely illuminated even with all curtains closed As our room was a Special room there was a door that connected our room to another I think it s for couples who travel with their children but still want to sleep in a separate room There happened to be People in the other room and we could hear everything that was going on in the room quite loudly , I traveled with my friend which is a wheelchair user The staff was very comprehensive and we also got assigned a Special room with a shower which had a chair to sit on and a big bathtub The reception was very friendly there was a possibility to print out documents at the reception Breakfast was FABULOUS and there were SO many possibilities and Food to choose from I had a very pleasant stay 
460127,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We got told we had an upgrade but the room was standard Disappointed when we saw the room expecting more if they had said nothing it would of been fine , Nice staff helpful 
460128,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, First of all the room was empty no shower gel or shampoos no shaving kit no slippers and no dintal kit plus no path robs the reciptionest mark need to get an English course and commenication skills course once I forgot my key card and when I called the reciption they asked me to come down for it I asked for a wake up call no one called me and they blamed it on the system my room was 1128 it was a waste of money, Nothing
460129,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Didn t realise it was so far out of city ctre Seemed a dreary area and an ugly building, Helpful staff Floor 17 amazing for breakfast Free wi fi Tram stop not far
460130,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location of our room was next to the main entrance of the floor and it was quite noisy sometimes due to elevator noises etc , Apart from the comfy bed I was in love with the decoration at the lobby area the staff was so friendly that made us feel even more comfortable and they were there to answer every question The location could not be more perfect straight away to town centre within 10 minutes with the tram stop tram 13 being right across the hotel Great view from 11th floor 17th floor bar was lovely and we used to stay in at nights to enjoy the spectacular view from the top with fantastic drinks 
460131,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Dirty bed sheets on arrival quickly resolved by staff upon complaining however made the start of our stay very disappointing , Good location from centre 
460132,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We missed a headboard so we could sit up in bed and drink morning coffee or read before sleeping We missed breakfast at the hotel due to the high cost , The view was lovely over the park and we liked the window seat The bed was very comfy and the room and bathroom of a high quality Staff were particularly friendly 
460133,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Staff were super everyone I planned to stay 4 days and was so impressed with Sanders and his Team that I ended staying 2 weeks Would recommend to anyone Bravo Ramada Apollo
460134,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The overall experience was really nice the only thing that let the stay down was the attitude of the staff The lobby staff downstairs were immaculate with their manners always smiling and welcomed us every time we came back from being away from the hotel However staff up on floor 17 lacked the customer care quality On the second night when we arrived at the top bar for drinks at 11 45pm ish and took seats at the bar we waited for the two bartenders to come over and take our order After nearly 10 minutes neither of them made eye contact but knew we were there and when Emma from the restaurant came inside the bar and asked if we d been served she was shocked when we said no The female bartender then said to her we ve taken last orders already Although she failed to make myself and my other half aware of this which I found quite rude The following night when we went back are jackets were taken because apparently there is a house rule that jackets are not to be worn in the bar area Once we went into the bar about 6 people had their jackets either on or with them however ours had to go downstairs once pulling up the host and the bartender up on this we were told with some rude attitude by the young male bartender that we weren t being singled out and you don t wear jackets in bars anyway Just really unprofessional really and this was a let down to the stay , Overall the hotel was amazing Top quality luxury the bedroom was a beautiful comfort Clean on arrival and new sheets and towels every day of stay Really comfortable bed and hot power shower 
460135,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, All good no problems , Very comfortable room nice decor and great views from the window seat Good varied breakfast selection Restaurant on 17 floor with views over Amsterdam Secure underground parking Tram stop outside the hotel for easy and quick travel into city All the staff were very helpful and pleasant 
460136,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Small rooms No tourism agency in the hotel maybe because it s not a season, Good nice location away from the crowd Nice staff Beautiful restaurant looking at all the city from floor 17
460137,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I did know in advance that there was no minibar but a hotel of this class should have it At least there is a shop in the reception to buy drinks , Nice quiet clean good position Normal price is a bit high but in a Booking deal it is good 
460138,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The Ramada is a fine four star hotel with good amenities and an underground parking as asset The desk staff is patient and gives good explanation about food and must sees in Amsterdam The breakfast buffet on the 17th floor is very extensive and offers a nice view downtown At night there s a trendy cocktail bar on this floor 
460139,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The step to get into the bathroom , Great staf really helpful Clean and quiet Room Good breakfast Buffet It s quite expensive but worth a try Good location The Line 13 tram stop Admiraal Helfrichstraat is only about 5 min walk Dam square is only about 10 15 mins The Bar in the 17th floor is really nice though quite expensive but worth a try too Just keep in mind that they have a no coat jacket policy We will surely stay here again 
460140,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The Guest Structure war unacceptable I felt like I was on a Cow Workers Meeting Manner or even acceptable behaviour from Guests and Personnel not happens Very Very bad was the so called Sky Bar They really have had the nerves to serve us WARM Champagne and charge us for 15 Euro per glass And the waiter have never ever had a bottle of champagne in the hand unbelievable where do they find people like him Additionally the served me a Gordon s Gin I ordered Tanquerays That they serve a Tonic water that taste like wash water is another anoyence , Rum Ambiente 
460141,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, perfect hotel and great for an easy tram into the city Previously staying at a B and B in the uk has been difficult because the owners have been snooty about us being young 18 and we thought this may happen abroad but staff were excellent and as friendly to us as any customer 
460142,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Would have liked to go out on the terrace but only open in summer , Very friendly and obliging staff Nothing was too much trouble Bed comfortable Lovely views
460143,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, they collect a deposit from the bank account which is not indicated in the advertisement page of their hotel the return of the money takes several days, young staff very coopeartive
460144,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only negative which I can point out was a large white stain on the bathroom wall Which was either tooth paste or wear and tear from retiling , The staff at the Ramada were hands down the best I ve come across As it was my birthday they provided me and my partner with quite a few luxuries as well as giving us a room with brilliant view The food was also brilliant 
460145,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast is mainly focused to fat dishes and the staff is very slow in changing the empty bowls , Hotel is situated near the very nice park Internet connection is great 
460146,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We weren t told there was additional cost to the room when we booked it It was tax on the room per night this should ve been made aware prior to the online booking to allow us to budget for the extra cost , The room was perfect great bathroom too lovely and clean Fantastic view from our room and not too far from the centre walkable only took us 40 mins to walk Right next to tram service to the city centre too tram only took 25 mins or so Great shuttle bus to and from airport Friendly staff who were really helpful 
460147,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, music in the bar would suit jazz music better, Very quiet rooms well soundproofed great staff very understanding of customer needs airpot shuttle is great and very reasonable on price
460148,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Gym is poorly equipped , Great location for a keen runner close to parks and only 4kms out of town Helpful staff amazing skybar and yummy food 17 Floor restaurant Clean comfy rooms 
460149,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was quite difficult to settle a comfortable temperature inside the room Despite the fact that the station is beside the hotel to go to the city centre you need to get a tram or bus , Very clean great staff and lovely design 
460150,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Didn t get given milk for English tea in our room , The shower and the bed were both amazing we were on the 8th floor and the views overlooking Amsterdam were incredible 
460151,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Very nice hotel we stayed at the 8th floor with a very nice view Staff very friendly The city center is at a 15 minutes tram ride and the station at 2 minutes from the hotel 
460152,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It is a little bit out of town you have to get a tram which takes about 10 mins to get to Dam square We went out one night and had to get a taxi back and it cost 45 Euros I would suggest getting an Uber if you can There was a bit of a mess up with our transfer I called the night before to arrange the transfer and once I arrived to the reception 5 mins before we were meant to leave the bus was apparently full Luckily another couple never appeared so we were lucky to get their spots I would suggest getting written confirmation about these types of things which we stupidly did not For a big hotel the bus they use only has 8 seats so get there early to ensure your space especially when you land it was a free for all and we saw 3 groups of people being turned away and they were told it would take 1 hour 20 mins until the next one , Beds were really nice The place was clean and very modern which is cool We didn t really use the sky bar however we went to the roof top where you get a beautiful view of Amsterdam Drinks were reasonable priced and there is a really nice park just across from the hotel we chilled out there after a busy day in the town The Wifi in the rooms is really good make sure to book the trips Van Gogh museum Anne Frank s House etc online to skip the queues 
460153,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Mattress was uncomfortable as it was too soft and more pillows would be better , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful Good location with easy access to the tram when heading into the city 
460154,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We are not FB generation but the wifi is unusable Booking com did not communicate with the hotel about our booking , King room with panorama view is very lovely silent and comfortable Big bath Tram station is very near Crew is kind and helpful Breakfast with large selection Bar on 17th floor with great night view 
460155,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Over priced food room was cleaned once in a 4 night stay massively overcharged for my stay compared to the price it was on booking com lots of hidden charges , Room had a great view 
460156,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The food in the rooftop restaurant was nice but we found that there was quite a small choice and a bit fancy for our taste It s fine if you have a bit of money to spend but my Boyfriend and I couldn t really justify spending 22 Euro on a burger but other than that it was lovely Cocktails were fantastic , The beds were huge and so comfortable that my Partner and I actually found it really difficult to not succumb to an afternoon nap The room was beautiful and looked out over the city at night when it was all lit up it was breath taking 
460157,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The air conditioner aka heater was not working very good But it was still fine , The staff was extra helpful and nice Totally loved them Rooms were good everything worked properly Bed was really really soft Wifi worked everywhere There is a tea pot with tea and coffee in the room The restorant on the roof was also not so expensive The tram stop is right near the hotel and you can buy the transport tickets in the hotel shop Scuttle from and to the hotel was also good In the lobby you can buy coffee good tea and some pastries the price and quality are great Also there is park with animals right near the hotel We liked everything 
460158,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The standard double bedroom was very small The mattress was of poor quality and the room was extremely stuffy as the air conditioner didn t work I could go on but I guess you get what you pay for Definitely not a 4 star by any stretch of the imagination , The shuttle bus drivers were very friendly and informative 
460159,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing could be better, Staff were absolutely amazing very friendly and helpful Room was lovely and even when temperature gage wasn t working properly staff immediately stepped in to help Lovely modern hotel
460160,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, This is a nice hotel and I have no regrets booking it Bar restaurant gym sauna very comfortable bed and clean rooms Staff were friendly and helpful Tram just a minutes walk cabs on tap and a high street not far away with a supermarket reasonably priced restaurants fast food pubs etc Must go again in summer Oh and they have UK TV 
460161,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Distance to centre was too far for us , Room was clean heating could be regulated Breakfast was brilliant Staff were very friendly Room 17 was awesome could see most of Amsterdam Good valure for money 
460162,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was very very small And was very cold We informed the reception but was no difference of temperature Horrible bed Had back ache for a week Not 4 condition, The terrace lovely view
460163,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The smoking room could do with a air filtration system installed to give it a more outdoor feel , The staff were very friendly and the roof top bar gave a beautiful view over the city 
460164,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, One little hiccup before our stay I had emailed the hotel asking for directions from Eindhoven all directions were clear and easy to follow until we got to Amsterdam centraal we knew the stop we needed to get off at but did not know the tram number We spent an hour asking local people police information workers in the station and in the ticket office and not one person could help us Eventually we got a taxi and found out at the hotel This got our first day off to a poor start but you certainly made up for it after that , The staff were very friendly when we checked in the gentleman at the desk could not have been nicer He was very keen to help us and give us directions for the city The food in the restaurant for breakfast and dinner was delicious bar staff were also very friendly However the absolute highlight of our trip was staying on the 14th floor the view in the morning was spectacular 
460165,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, My company booked 2 executive rooms and 1 standard room for 6 nights at this hotel Everyday we will have some troubles First They told us they couldn t find our booking record in the system then check us in a downgrade room without inform us until we found out by ourselves After ask for change their staff make up some story about due to we pay less on booking com so we have to stay at lower floor their manager confirmed that this is totally a lie by the way the room they gave us bath tub faucet was broken room 213 Second our key card was invalid twice in different nights The house keeping didn t change our towel everyday the worse part 3 rooms check out at different day they managed to check out wrong rooms As for their front desk staff don t ever ask them about ISE shuttle bus they will tell you to go look at the time schedule by yourself After all our comment to this hotel is disappointed and will never ever recommend it to anyone or stay there again ,No Positive
460166,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Two single beds pushed together not the most romantic thing to sleep on , Reasonable hotel not too far out of the city 50 minute walk 25 minute cycle or a 15 minute tram 
460167,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We did not have the room we asked for in the first place and we had to go up and down because some miscommunication in their system Not very clean Inside and outside it will be very nice if they actually clean the windows from the outside They have an amazing view that you can not see because windows are really dirty Food and services are overpriced Interior design is pretty bad for dutch standards, The staff is really helpful The lack of quality in the facility is compensated with a very friendly staff
460168,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Myself and my partner went up to breakfast half an hour before it was due to close and could only get a handful of things as they were packing up annoying as we had paid The added city tax could have been mentioned at check in instead of sprung on to us at check out Each time we opened a tap it smelt of egg The prices at the skybar to eat and drink are extremely overpriced for what is offered , Everything in the hotel was exceptional The staff were very helpful and extremely friendly always had a smile on their faces 
460169,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Staff was some bad and some were very good Took a long time for us to order a drink it took a long time to get it but the waiteres was very friendly , Liked the bed and the overall quality 
460170,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Floor 17 restaurant was good but far too expensive for the hotel , The hotel felt very relaxed and the staff were excellent Service was great throughout the hotel Tram ride was 15 mins to Dam square Rooms were nice and the beds were superb 
460171,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We were unable to get a drink at the bar due to it being full and were advise to have a drink in the lobby once down in the lobby we were advised to drink in the bar, The king room is fantastic Double sink deep bath spacious shower were all great features Comfy bed was the highlight
460172,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff were ever so friendly and did everything they could to ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable The room was very clean and a perfect size with lots of storage space We were on the 5th floor and had a wonderful view of Rembrandt Park but we loved the experience of the 360 view of Amsterdam from the rooftop terrace which was beautiful both in the daytime and night time The hotel is located in a nice area and is in easy reach of Amsterdam Central by catching a tram from the nearby stop 
460173,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Fantastic simple transfer Very nice hotel clean and modern Staff was helpful at all times Facility ie skybar was very premium Nice vibe and different variety of drinks and food every night Recommended
460174,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Stuck up woman at the 17th floor Said we were not allowed to sit at the bar for a drink because the restaurant was full even though we could see the seats free at the bar and had done the same the night before Fine we spent our money else where , Hotel reception staff were great Chantelle really made us feel welcome and was lovely Easy to get a tram into town only takes 15 mins Room was very nice view was great Cocktails on 17th were really nice 
460175,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Staff Shuttle Service To And From Aiport Tram Stop Right Outside Hotel Floor 17 Skybar View Over Amsterdam Is Amazing At Night Will Be Back Again 
460176,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, was more of a commercial hotel catering for business and airline staff Boxy flatpack type of rooms Expected a better quality of food for price , Paul and turkish bar staff friendly reception staff close to tram line to city center
460177,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The no13 tram stop was next to the hotel 15 minutes away from Dam Square and 10 minutes from Anne Frank house Breakfast on the top floor was really good with the view of Amsterdam And you can hire bicycles from the Hotel 
460178,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, the breakfast is very very good but too expensive , cleanless helpfulness and courteousness of the staff The room was very big clean and modern the rooftop17 restaurant was very good and creative with waiter and waitress very nice very close to tram for the city centre there is an airport shuttle every 20 minutes for from hotel and the run from the airport to the hotel is free 
460179,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing , Everything about the hotel was great Staff were very friendly and helpful The location was perfect There was a tram stop right outside the hotel that brought you into the city center in 10 minutes or less Rooms were spacious clean and comfortable
460180,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The 17th floor bar s service was slow and had to remind bar staff of what you had ordered numerous times because they seemed like they had forgotten you Prices were a bit steep, Hotel was brilliant Very nice room over looking Amsterdam 
460181,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only minor fault I can think of is that I found the lighting in our room and in the lobby reception area very dim but hey ho no big deal , The room was delightful The bathroom excellent The staff most helpful and charming Will definitely stay there again 
460182,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, With a bathtub it would have been perfect , Well located by tram in 15min to the heart of the city The room was comfy We were at the 6th floor and had a nice view of the city Try the breakfast at the 17th floor the view is amazing and the food is fine 
460183,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Location is a bit far from amsterdam centre so you have to take a tram Perhaps they should have shuttle buses to the centre hourly , Staff extremely friendly and very helpful 
460184,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was nothing we didn t like, The hotel had a friendly atmosphere and staff were very helpful and polite The hotel made my partners stay even more enjoyable by decorating our room and giving her a free cocktail for her birthday 
460185,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We had booked the King executive room for 2 night There should have been robes in the room but they never appeared This is my only complaint , The King executive rooms were just fantastic Everything we needed was in the room including a fridge The bath was fantastic 
460186,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, They need to better look after the rooms basically they are OK but in our room 1324 the door only opened if you kicked the bottom from outside or pulled heavily from inside Several of the safe numerals did not work but then sometimes did so it was hard to be sure whether to use the safe or not Only 1 extra pillow per room plus you had to remove the ironing board to use the wardrobe space etc etc etc Not good for the rates paid to be honest Finally we had specifically asked for a view over Amsterdam centre but got a room at the back , We cannot fault the staff and quality of food etc
460187,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The bed was super comfy staff very friendly and helpful would definitely stay longer if I could and will come to that hotel again when i visit Amsterdam
460188,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Good variety for breakfast it is slightly expensive per person but there is something for everyone The view from our room was amazing as we were on the 16th floor we overlooked Amsterdam s skyline Our room was super spacious and just what we expected The hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam and there aren t many nice shops around but getting the tram every day let us engage with the culture more Plus the hotel itself has a tram stop straight outside so going to the city centre was no problem 
460189,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, On the second day we were there the room wasn t cleaned as well as the first The bed wasn t as tidy and bits we re missed Wasn t a massive issue, The room was lovely we had an executive King suit on the 16th floor the staff were helpful also
460190,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The staff at the 17th floor restaurant was a little unpleasant but maybe they were having a bad day , Staff was very friendly and nice at the front desk and they helped out as best they could with any questions you had 
460191,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Perfect views Deluxe King room was amazing Comfiest bed ever Lovely staff Easy shuttle to and from airport Tram just across the road about ten min journey loved our stay 
460192,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Pretty confusing Room set up Double vs Twin it can be both and really average breakfast for 4 and 19 50 EUR Expencive Restaurant on 17th floor food drinks usual like in all Amsterdam and I haven t been to fine dining part , Excellent polite and informative Staff Really good WiFi Not in the centre but only 9 tram stations to Damm square cca 15 min Very clean and modern Rooms Sauna for free and paid Garage Great view from the bar restaurant on the 17th floor 
460193,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, there wasnt much we didnt like We didnt like the fact we had to pay 150euros deposit upfront when we arrived when it stated on our booking we didnt need to pay it There was a male staff member in the 17th floor bar who wasnt very polite My partner asked him did they have magners and he just replied with a no not even sorry we dont have that but we have this He didnt look at us in the eye when he said no he just kept his head down making cocktails apart from these two things we had a fantastic stay and would stay here again, Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights 22 1 16 25 1 16 We absolutely loved this hotel The bed was by far the best hotel bed we have ever stayed in The room was a decent size and the view of the city was incredible at night One staff member stood out to us She was one of the girls on reception She was extremely friendly She explained to us about the tram outside took you straight to the city centre She will probably remember who we are We got told by the central train station to get two trains a tram and a 30 minute walk when in actual fact we could of got 1 train and a tram without the 30 minute walk Sorry i cant remember the girls name 
460194,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Would not recommend it if you are looking for a hotel closer to the Historical City Centre since the location of this property is a little bit far , Always stay at this property when visiting Amsterdam for an annual meeting from my company The room is really comfortable good options on Cable TV and the Restaurant on the TOP Floor is great excelent food and the view of the skyline of Amsterdam is beautiful Staff is also very helpful and friendly always at your disposal 
460195,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The 17th floor sky bar had a great view very nice place to grab a drink before heading downtown The tram was super easy to navigate and was right next to the hotel 
460196,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, i found beds are not comfortable Rooms have no wardrope there is just a small shelf on the back side of the beds, Staff is friendly and very helpful breakfast is much better than many hotels in Amaterdam
460197,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The receptionists appeared to be all students Maybe from the hotel school next door While appearing enthusiastic to help they might need a little more training before actually working But apart from being slightly inefficient they were friendly and appeared eager to help , Great value for price While a little out of the centre very good tram connection and the quality of the room and breakfast make up for it 
460198,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There is no changing area for the sauna nowhere to leave your belongings so we were unable to use this facility , The bed was very nice Tram to the centre is close by 
460199,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was a problem in the rooms lighting system one lamp went randomly on off all night long disturbing my sleep Resturant staff at Breakfast time was not helpful and looked stressed by the high number of customers There were no clean forks available a some point during the service and also customers had to wait a long time for used to tables to be cleaned up to actually have a place to eat, Reception desk Staff was friendly and effective 
460200,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Lady at reception was very rude and patronising so that let our stay down, Room was clean and very nice view 17th floor was very nice for a few drinks at reasonable prices
460201,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Lighting was abysmal and cupboard space a joke We has to open our suitcases on the floor Luggage holder rack was simply inadequate Hard to read Suited to business people not to oldie travellers , Reception staff very pleasant efficient and helpful Bar staff too very friendly and willing Taxi summonsed promptly
460202,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The beds were quite uncomfortable hard mattresses and strange pillows we struggled to sleep I was also a little disappointed that the hotel advertised itself as Amsterdam Centre The hotel is a 15 minute team journey outside of the centre I didn t mind it too much once I was here but i felt it wasn t very honest , The staff were very friendly and we really liked the hotel in general Free wifi is always a bonus we really didn t spend long in the hotel but always nice to be able to send a quick update to your family at the end of each day Breakfast was good and the decoration in the hotel was modern and tasteful We also really liked the bar on the 17th floor and roof terrace There is a cute little farm opposite with a few animals nice little touch 
460203,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The breakfast although a little pricier than I expected was very nice and the was an array of selection to cater for everyone The staff the room and the general service was flawless The location was a little further out but still very central with a frequent tram stop just in front of the hotel we were in the City centre in 10 mins To compensate for the less than central location we were rewarded with fantastic views of the city and the nearby park made for a lovely place to go for a stroll and work out some of weight gained after having breakfast Other good points include the shuttle bus service from the airport to the hotel and the return journey there was a charge for this but it still worked cheaper and less hassle than a private cab public transport 
460204,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Slightly cold in room when you go back to it as heating gets turned off warms up lovely once back in , Brilliant hotel we both enjoyed it shuttle to and from hotel saves extra hassle and the number 13 tram which stops just outside hotel gets you into centre in 15 mins breakfast was amazing as was the bar on floor 17 all staff very attentive room very comfortable and modern 
460205,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Most of the taxis from the hotel were taking me the long routes for extra money 30 euro from hotel to central station The cost is 20 Example , Food and staff 
460206,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No, Very friendly and helpful staff Easy access from to airport and hotel Only 15 mins trams from to central station Clear and nice view room I saw the rainbow Nice 17th floor sky bar Excellent and value of money hotel Must stay again
460207,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff was extremely helpful because we had some issue when arrived They assisted with everything and made sure we had a nice time The service and hotel facilities are just amazing The bar upstairs is very nice too overlook Amsterdam
460208,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The first thing the receptionist said was that breakfast was not included even though we paid extra for it when booking When we showed the recervation from booking where it said breakfast is included they said it was ok but the receptionists attitude was not so nice , Breakfast location great view
460209,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, restaurant was not very good didn t use breakfast ridiculously priced tourist tax not included in booking price had to pay extra on checkout , stayed one night location suited us room was fine clean good beds 
460210,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The house keeping could be improved on , The entire hotel staff were amazing friendly and always willing to assist no matter how big or small the request may have been The stars of the team would definitely have to be Joanne and Roelof who really made us feel welcomed and made our first experience in Amsterdam memorable The breakfast selection was good and view from restaurant was spectacular especially at night The metro point was easy accessible approximately 5 minutes walk from the hotel and connected us to major city attractions in record time 
460211,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was too cold in winter, Location is quite convenient 2 min to tram station The room is comfortable and well furnished Wi fi is fast and stable The spacious garage is available 
460212,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Overall very nice hotel downfall is that we had to constantly ask for information such as check out times and how to order and no information was provided about the shuttle bus and the charge going back and that we had to pre book,No Positive
460213,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The only thing I missed was a bath in the room After a long day of walking a soak in a bath would have been wonderful , From our arrival at the hotel until check out we received excellent service from every member of staff we encountered at the hotel especially from Chantal one of the hotel receptionists We were given a free drink at the bar as it was my partner s birthday we had complimentary coffees given to us as we had to wait a little while for our room and we were given lots of recommendations for restaurants and things to do for New Year s Eve We had potentially wanted to go to the hotel s bar on Floor 17 for NYE and had emailed prior to our visit to find out about this We received no return correspondence but when we spoke to the F B Manager he was more than happy to offer us tickets for the evening He also gave us a range of ideas for other options to see in the new year which we decided to do and the manager could not have been more helpful He advised the best place for fireworks a restaurant and a bar for drinks We really did have a great time at the hotel and would definitely recommend it as a place to stay in Amsterdam The trams stop right next to the hotel and goes straight into the centre You can even buy your tram tickets at the hotel shop Overall an excellent 4 nights in Amsterdam for new year 
460214,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The rooftop bar was booked out for New Year s meaning that regular guests were unable to have use of the bar Bit of an inconvenience, Beautiful view of the skyline of central Amsterdam
460215,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Good location tram stop right outside and 10 15 mins to dam square Hotel runs shuttle bus to and from the airport great value for money but needs to be booked 
460216,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Everything was spot on Great location close to the town Tram stop right outside hotel Very clean greAt views as we were on 11th floor Staff very friendly Would recommend and use again 
460217,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Cleanliness can be improved Especially in the bath rooms where hairs and finger nails found , Friendly support staffs Skyline view was beautiful and comfortable rooms 
460218,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It is too cold in the room and the water is coming out of the douche so we Had to put some towels on the floor , I liked the Room and i liked the beautiful view from the 17th floor skylounge 
460219,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Reception staff isn t very professional doesn t know much of how they should treat a customer In a luxury hotel Bar closes super early and they basically kick you out even if you re staying in the hotel , Staff is very unfriendly Didn t even explain you have to use your card on the main hotel entrance in the evening Only said they don t open doors 
460220,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Paid parking is steep at 15 EUR per day but still cheaper than street parking Standard room is very small and bed design is slightly odd as it misses a headboard , clean comfortable quiet great shower and good wifi 
460221,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A minibar in the room would have been nice , Great location if you re driving on the edge of town so you don t have to drive through the narrow city streets but conveniently located near a tram stop so just 15 minutes into the heart of town Friendly and helpful staff 
460222,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I was charged twice for the room and the refund when it came was less than I had been charged They said it was an exchange rate thing Also We had to pay a security deposit of 50 Euros a night Seems like the longer you stay the bigger risk you become We only stayed 3 nights so it was 150 euros Bur 10 nights would have been 500 euros which is a lot of money There was no mention of this on your website which is pretty poor Also the room was cold The thermostat said 22 5 C but it was more like 15C I have never slept in a sweater before , The staff were delightful 
460223,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We found the reception staff very friendly however we witnessed the restaurant staff being very rude to a couple who wanted to go into the restaurant before us This made us not want to eat there and we decided to go elsewhere , The hotel prove was good value for money clean modern and the breakfast was excellent 
460224,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The gym needs some updating Broken equipment and lack of free weights was very disappointing for a Ramada , Staff location right by tram and bus stops airport shuttle service 
460225,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The hotel is not central located although I was aware of it when I booked but the tram station is close by and get you in 20 minutes to the city centre , The hotel is great Everything was clean and in order Staff was very friendly and helpful at all times We got a room with a stunning view from Amsterdam 
460226,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room was tiny no bath Arrived Friday dinner time no restaurant or room service available due to private party 15 minutes tram journey to center or 50 minute walk Won t be returning , The 17th floor restaurant for breakfast
460227,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, On leaving we removed and folded the bed sheets as usual to assist the room staff only to notice a Very large dark red Blood stain which while obviously dried was non the less neither hygenic nor welcome However this did seem to go along with the standard for the room dirt under the bed and in the bathroom Add in the fact that the only room service offered over the weekend was on Sunday evening this is the third time we have stayed here and certainly not or best experience Dining and drinking facilities reduced by 25 by turning those same facilities booked and payed for over to a Private function without any advance notice and leaving little in the way of choice for food on the night when needed ,No Positive
460228,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Floor 17 restaurant was not as good as it looked There was a door man who was unfriendly and not very helpfull It seemed an effort for staff to help us be seated and took 25 minutes to receive our first drink No apology given and there was only 30 people in the restaurant, The rooms were tidy and reception an nice area to sit in I d go again to this hotel simply because it was easy access to the city via tram 
460229,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room could have been cleaner I was travelling with my 15yr son so when I pulled the beds apart to create space the carpet had quite a lot of debris on The bathroom had no toiletries in only 2 bottles of the same cream in the basin and shower no shampoos etc I also had problems gaining access to the room and had to go between the 14th floor and reception 3 times to learn that the door entry system was faulty , Views from the room were amazing The beds were VERY comfortable but the pillows could do with updating as they are starting to clump together in the middles so quite lumpy in places only 1 additional pillow available

460232,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The price of drinks and food on the 17th floor and due to our flight home being so early there was no form of transport other than a pricey cab ride, The comfort layout and cleanliness of the room the staff where very helpfull and friendly Good transport location to dam square and central station
460233,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Mattress very small and kept slipping off the bed Restaurant on top floor expensive , Location perfect just around the corner from tram the brings you straight into the centre Staff couldn t be more helpful Hotel excepional We arrived early and they gave us our room straight away

460238,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There is no possible to go to stairs from base stage and for us like for sportists it is unusually to go with lift after running breakfest to expensive, Very good location tram is 200m from hotel and 15min drive from center quite location in park wonderful view from top of hotel I like interior and cleanlines 
460239,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Weather was raining until I was there came back to UK it s sunny down here , Breakfast was presented high class it a shame didn t get time to try lunch or dinner 
460240,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It s a few kilometers from the central station so taking the tram is inevitable unless you really like to walk , It s a Ramada after all so you can expect it to be good I stayed at a 15th floor which has a really nice view Staffs were funny and helpful Shuttle bus to the airport is a plus

460247,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The Apollo states that its in Amsterdam Centre However it is almost 20 euro in a taxi from the centre which is disgracefully misleading Trams bring you to the hotel but in order to travel around business meetings this was inadequate I was extremely unhappy with this , Nothing
460248,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, 2 of the morning we arrived for breakfast 15 20 mins before the breakfast finishes which in my opinion is quite sufficent It is un necessary to be told by staff we you have only 15mins left before we close This is actually quite rude , We got an upgrade to a delux room on the 16th floor which was great Staff were very helpful with information on local attractions directions etc The rooms and the beds were very comfortable Overall great hotel and location is a little bit out of the city but the tram is very convenient straight across the road

460255,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Reception was indeed welcoming All information and assistance were provided with perfect English The location is awesome wifi is great and I did enjoy my stay there 
460256,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, When I reached and entered to the hotel small bathroom shampoos were missing and empty Internal shampoo box was empty either It is unacceptabke for this kind of luxury hotel , Hotel location is good Very close to city center Train connection is an advantage 
460257,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No mention of deposit on website or that they were going to freeze the money in my bank account as the website said it would be cash only Spent 80 euro on room service and the food took over and hour and arrived cold Was extremely poor service for such high price, Suitably close to both bus and tram lines that go frequently to and from the city center Staff extremely friendly

460259,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was cold in the room the AC wasn t working properly and it took 40 min and 3 calls for someone to bring an extra duvet, Location is quite good around 10 min away by tram from Dam Square Also very comfortable and beautiful view 
460260,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel has goT A big skycrap Style building for that reason wind sound heating is a big problem at the room If u stay at north city bire rooms I want a extra fan heater to my room One day after day provide the fan Thanks for the Fast service manager The breakfast buFFet need some sea food diabet gluten free parts which wiLL makes the buFFet perfec customer care , Hotel AirPort ShuttLe is working perfectly you wiLL join the city center by tramway 13 than Take 7 Gym Sauna WiFi working So good The food at the 17floor is delicious and the coctails are ok for the hotel standart I love the room desigN the city view working chair relaXx sofa wonderfuLL The mobile bathroom is sOo genious idea but mind your step 
460261,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It was very cold in the room and heating is very slow it takes 3 hours to heat the room and it is very cold when heating is not working the hotel card is not in the special place in the room 150 euro of deposit till the check out is really bad thing because you should have extra money for that besides the hotel is not cheap I paid all the amount for the hotel on checking in and plus deposit 150 euros but on checking out they asked me how would I pay buy cash or credit card it was a mistake but I was shocked The other bad thing there is the light behind the bad in room and it is turns on of automatically on moving sensor But in late evening when we were lying in our bad and this light turned on and off and on and off etc It was awful There is a shuttle bus for taking guests to the airport and it is not free for the hotel guests travelling back to the airport But it is not the real problem This shuttle is only for 8 passengers and you should buy the tickets for it beforehand at the reception But they didn t told us this fact so when the shuttle arrived driver said it is fully booked It was one more bad experience with this hotel There is no minibar in the room In the restaurant on the 17th floor after dinner they tried to charge from us extra 60 euros when the waiter gave us the bill it was 60 euros higher than should be We asked the waiter why our bill is so big and in a few minutes he bring another one with the right amount I will not recommend this hotel to other travellers , Nice view from the top floors
460262,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast not included or shampoo or conditioner or shower cap Too expensive for the standard of accommodation in my opinion Bit too far out of town , Nice view from my room over bushland and lake Cheap shuttle bus to airport 
460263,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Most staff are not friendly or professional Not top rate on cleanliness Don t stay on 16 F noise from bar upstairs stays on till 1am , Accessible by public transport Nice views Spacious room compared to staying in city center Few of the staffs are exceptionally professional 
460264,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, lack of certain tourist information and waiting staff not adequately trained even tough they were all helpful, the club upstairs with adjoining smoking room spectacular views
460265,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I am generally a grumpy person but I found no fault in this hotel the room was lovely the staff were very helpful and the location was exactly what we wanted , The view over the city from the 17th floor bar and the roof top terrace were amazing
460266,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Rooms are quite small there are no bathroom amenities like shower gels etc There is the sky lounge on 17th floor to eat but it s very expensive Would be nice to have a more affordable option if one wanted to eat in hotel , Very friendly and helpful staff No problems in getting to central Amsterdam via tram We travelled with a 7 month old baby and it was an enjoyable experience The coffee cart in the lobby is an excellent idea with very reasonably priced coffee treats 
460267,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Booked a deluxe double room for single use and got a three 3 bed room With the additional bed there were no further space to move in that room The WIFI was of poor quality and always with interruption , Breakfast was great 
460268,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Plug socket broke Forgot to fill Shampoo but gave us bottled Was very comfortable , Quite location near park Walkable to centre Near metro Link to airport for 10 euro was good in a 6 person taxi very good 
460269,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Very disappointed with food Booked table in restaurant and chose fish of the day from the menu we were told it was a whitefish similar to sole or plaice We we brought two bowls full of squid and a bowl of chips delicious plus a bowl of salad each The chef who brought the meal could not explain why we had been given squid and not whitefish so we gave up and ate it not at all pleasant I think the hotel slightly exaggerates when it calls its eating facilities a restaurant , Every thing about the hotel is excellent except the dining facilities which are very poor seemingly serving only bar snacks and not proper meals 
460270,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing except having to leave, The staff were very friendly and helpful There is a great restaurant on the 17th floor with fabulous views over the city The number 13 tram stopped outside the hotel and it took about 10 minutes into the centre Had a fabulous stay and would definitely go back again if in the area 
460271,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, im really struggling to find fault Everything was perfect , Staff were fantastic They decorated the room for my boyfriends birthday with balloons and a voucher for 2 free drinks and one of their amazing cocktails The trip was amazing and if we could stay longer we would We will be back 
460272,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Bed was really weird in my room It had no headrest So I had to build some kind of pillow fort to support my head against while watching TV and to place myself diagonally on the bed so if my wife did the same we couldn t hug which is an issue for us Mattress is also weird it s raised in the middle which doesn t help cuddling either So if you re a couple who fancies cuddling I wouldn t recommend this , Almost everything was fine
460273,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The staff were warm and welcoming especially the young man who signed us in Vim The hotel is perfectly located just a little out of the bustle of the city centre but well serviced by a close by efficient tram
460274,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Just a little too far from Central station and hotel is lacking some comforts by way of a spa Gym , Staff are friendly and there is good access to public transport Also very convenient for those travelling by car having a car park and located just off main motorway 
460275,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The fact that we got there and hadto pay a deposit which was not mentioned in booking com and I had booked a standard double but ended up with a twin so was not happy and the staff was not willing to rectify this as they were busy but I booked the room in September so this should have been dealt it The staff never really cared , The location wasn t to ba a 10 min tram ride to the centre 
460276,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We have to cancel the travel to Amsterdam and did little late for cancellation So we did not stay there any night But the hotel still charged us for me night We know we may wrong for the late cancellation but the hotel should communicate with us in advance as well , None
460277,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Our first room on the west side of the building overlooking a freeway was intolerably noisy The avante garde menu in the restaurant was not to our taste More importantly it had almost nothing for vegetarians , The staff were excellent especially when they heard that we were celebrating an anniversary They also went out of their way to reaccommodate us when our first room was unsatisfactory 
460278,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We had a very small room we could barely fit our two suitcases in the room It was a little but far away from the city centre but was easy to catch a tram just outside the hotel , The hotel was great Breakfast buffet was huge but found it a bit pricey 
460279,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shower little bit of water soft stream Expensive breakfast Weak wifi Windows dirty in rooms so hardly any view No mini fridge , Staff was friendly and helpful Bed was big enough but too soft and we did remove the top mattres to not have backpain Bar on 17th floor nice panoramic view but stop serving tea coffee after 22 00 Parking under hotel easy to do with outlets for electrical cars 
460280,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Food and drinks are expensive For example the breakfast That was around 22 euro per person , The view from the rooftop Room was clean and comfy Staff was very friendly and professional 
460281,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, some staff are rude and not smiling maybe for the cold weather, all was perfect all clean great views comfortable beds and the tram 13 is less than 100 mts and you can go very quickly to the Dam or the Central station Also is very convenient the shuttle transport from the airport to the hotel
460282,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room service could have been more carefull in changing the coffee mugs availlable in the room we have used them since the first day and where not changed during our 3 nights stay, Very comfortable beds Our room was on a corner in the 9 th floor so we had a panoramic view Clean and nice bathroom Great bar restaurant on the top floor
460283,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Not enough light in the rooms though one might get a really nice view of the city , Very nice and professional staff especially people in the reception 
460284,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I had no bad experiences, The view from the room was amazing Hotel is located in a park which is scenic and quiet I felt it is just the right distance from central Sometimes you just want to get away from all the hustle and bustle The staff were great with us and dealt with us in a professional and caring manner Even when we did have a slight issue they dealt with it swiftly and went over and above to make sure we were happy Id like to thank the staff for the way they treated us and a special mention to the reception manager Breakfast was great everything you could think of was there Also the view from the 17th 18th floor was special You must check out the bar on the 17th floor the atmosphere and the food was fantastic 
460285,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, There was an unexpected tourist tax we were required to pay on checking out which felt a little sneaky Also its a long walk into town however the trams are super regular and easy to get back and forth , Really comfortable beds and great staff The breakfasts and bar area right at the top of the hotel was a favourite It was a great stay overall 
460286,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A cold room with a blocked shower tray that flooded the bathroom the courtesy meal of swordfish was only flashed seared each side so ostensibly totally raw and cold the same as the rooms , Fair location FINALLY being upgraded to a new room Leaving the place 
460287,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We felt that the room should have been cleaned better We had to demand our beds changed We were disappointed in that Also the shuttle from airport to hotel was not reliable It did not turn up and this happened to other guests too We have used other ramada hotels The best was in Basel and I suppose we were always comparing it to that one , Really nice hotel modern Very good for transport into city Staff were pleasant enough 
460288,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The walls in the bathroom and the inside of the windows were not clean Parking is expensive 15 Euros per night , Location views from restaurant fantastic breakfast spread and access to and from old town by tram 
460289,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Some staff with 3star service Bathroom amenities only all in one bathroom gel disposable plastic cup no shower cap no box tissue paper No fridge Level below restaurant bar noisy till 1am Tiny no door closet , Some staff with 5star service Quiet area with easy tram ride to city centre Nice park town view Spacious room compared to city centre hotels of same rate International English newspaper 
460290,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Dress code in the restaurant bar in the evening, Very friendly and helpful staff breakfast excellent Airport shuttle service to and from the hotel is good value 
460291,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Hotel shuttle faiked to turn up waited 1 hour ten mins then drive was very rude told us that he didnt care then drove like a man possessed Bar bears very expensive service really poor took ten minutes just to catch somebodys attention best to eat somewhere else also got back to hotel at 5pm after a full marsthon to find that room had not been cleaned This hotel needs a major changes would not recomment hotek tp snyone hotel general manager never avaliable and duty managers appear not to have the authority to sort things You have been warned Premiere inn far better for customer service, Location perfect nice rooms
460292,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Check out is 12 o clock and there is no shuttle bus to the airport until 20 past 1 I thought that was terrible as we planned to take the shuttle back but would have missed our flight had we waited, Staff were very helpful Hotel was very clean 
460293,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The price for the breakfast is a bit exaggerated , The tram stop is right next to the hotel and the trip to Dam Square takes about 15 20 minutes The hotel is clean but this is what you would expect when staying at Ramada 
460294,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The bathroom pipes smelled bad all the time It was quite cold in the room We put the heater on but in general the feeling was cold The temperature was controlable but the bathroom smell is quite a bad minus maybe it doesn t have an easy solution but it s good you know it We were fine anyway so don t worry too much , Great views from the 15th floor helpful staff easy access to public transport and in general a very good option 
460295,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Shuttle bus to and from airport did not run as sceduled Some services did not run at all We had to wait almost one hour for the bus from the airport, Good access to tram network
460296,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The hotel was quite a way out from the city centre although there was a team stop right outside which was handy , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable and modern 
460297,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The rooms where cold The restaurant on the top floor slow service and food wasn t any special You had to ask for shampoo conditioner etc There was nothing in the bathroom , Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful 
460298,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, It is a bit far from the city center you can get there using the tram in 20 mts which is great but if you are staying late at the center after 12 am you have to look for night busses or cabs If it was closer you simply go back walking or by a bicycle There is no spa you can find a fitness room and a sauna But no real spa i think this would be a perfect addition The beds were good but not excelent from a comfort point of view , I liked the view of the hotel and the location for a walk through parks the staff is extra friendly the hotel is super clean located very close to tram station 
460299,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The location is a bit awkward to get to The roof bar is very pricey , The breakfast and the roof bar are delightful The room is nicely furnished The views at the top are great 
460300,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The shower had some dirty spots in the silicone coner seals Every time we ve been out of the room it was freezing upon return and we never got the room temperature up to 21 No Minibar facilities while they asked 150 deposit and overpriced room service 10 service charge just to bring you a drink at night , We booked a panoramic view superiour double and first got a room in the centre of the 8th floor Aparently the panoramic view starts at 8 which is too low to call panoramic in my opinion They moved us to the 16nd upper floor corner room 1602 Which was bigger with twice as much windows and an amazing view over Amsterdam Very friendly and helpfull staff A plus is that the amsterdam metro stops in front of the building every 8 minutes and it just takes 15 min to get to the Dam 
460301,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Party of 7 of us stayed here and all 3 rooms had cracked bathroom walls Then there is a stench of dampness in all the bathrooms since the shower door is half a fixed door and only manages to cover half the shower so all the water gets out and floor is soaking which probably explains the dampy smell We were also not made aware there is a dress code to use their hyped up 17th floor restaurant After driving 5 hours with a young child to get there you just want to go in and eat Sorry we do not make long drives about in our suits on a road trip For a 4 star hotel I would say 3 at most No toiletries at all except a bar of soap , Staff are helpful
460302,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Very poor location in terms of restaurants close by and too far from the central tourist area , Rooms were large and clean very comfortable bed Breakfast buffet was outstanding and the view spectacular 
460303,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, a bit far from city center breakfast was not included room rate and also toilet accessories was not there , Area of Hotel and landscape around it Supportive staff

460306,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The room was lovely but the two single beds pushed together with what looked like a camping mattress instead of a proper bed was a bit strange, Fantastic restaurant and rooftop bar with great views across Amsterdam
460307,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Minor thing dust and a better clean up in the bedrooms , The reception staff were very welcoming and were more than happy answered all our question Also the hotel has a very good style inside

460311,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, We were stranded in Amsterdam due to KLM problems We felt like family with Eline Robin and Celesti spoiling us and taking good care of us for three days and 2 nights The restaurant bar were terrific in service food libations and view

460314,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The hotel blocks the certain amount of money on your card which must be refunded later but the problem is that we have problems with refund We even didn t get the answer why ,No Positive
460315,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Small room poor lighting and awkward shape and location of wardrobes We got terrible Caesars salad at the restaurant for lunch , quiet rooms ok bathroom
460316,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The beds were really poor Twin beds with mattresses that slid off the bed frame constantly Should have double beds and better matresses, Sky Lounge 17 lobby bathroom facilities views

460322,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Roof top bar very relaxing Rooms very clean Staff on reception very helpful when checking in and out especially the young man when checking out very friendly n helpful Shuttle bus to airport fantastic value for money would recommend it
460323,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Spectacular views from our room and the restaurant food Is amazing This is the best hotel I have stayed in and very clean I would recommend this hotel because it is outside the city centre so it s qiuiet but easy to get a tram on a 24 hour ticket 
460324,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Quality of food in the restaurant upstairs was pretty shocking and expensive 17 50 for a chicken Caesar salad very little chicken and fatty as well Rib Eye bun had Parma Ham on it not good, Great room Executive Dbl Great bed great service
460325,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We didn t eat at the hotel as we could not work out how to use the crazy menu in the restaurant , Clean modern rooms Easy access to the tram for a ten minute journey to dam square Perfect for what we wanted 
460326,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Entrance to the gym was nor encouraging spooky at night going through the stairs ALONE Neighborhood is not that comfortable, Staff are superfriendly
460327,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing you need a 20 minute tram ride to center , Just perfect room service cleanliness Staff such a pleasure to deal with Would use again Great restaurant on the 17th floor 
460328,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The breakfast is pretty bad I guess they charge 17 00 Euro person and it is definitely not worth it Apart from the eggs there was nothing which was t convenience food of a poor quality Well done Ramada management Probably the most impressing discrepancy between rates and performance I have seen for years ,No Positive
460329,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, room was not clean But if you talk with reception they can take care of your complaint , staff was really good helpful location was good easily reach to city center with tram 
460330,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Nothing really warranted a complaint it was stunning all round Happy days , The Ramada Apollo is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at in terms of virtually everything you could want in accommodation in a major city value for money facilities transport connections location cleanliness niceness of staff everything A shuttle bus directly to the hotel is free arriving in Amsterdam at Schipol Airport just go to the Hotel Buses bus stops outside we were offered a free complimentary upgrade when we arrived and we had the most amazing corner room on the 15th floor with epic views of the entire city at night definitely request a high level room On the last morning I woke my girlfriend up to watch the sunrise casting a golden glow across the entire cityscape it was more romantic than The Notebook Titanic and Brief Encounter all rolled into one super lovestory Memories like that are what you remember about a hotel and that moment was just perfect And my girlfriend still really fancies me too The beds were massive and comfier than a thousand LaZyBoys lined with sheep fur floating in space Everything about the room was perfect from the mood lighting to the chairs the desk telly shower room The hotel is in a wonderful location if you like doing it all on foot you re about 40 minutes from the main centre so be prepared for epic walks home although there s still plenty to see The number 13 tram outside the hotel is the obvious option for most people though going right the way into town within 5 or 10 minutes The best way though for me honestly would be by bike you can rent them at the hotel and its just a great time efficient way to travel around a city that looks do able on foot but is actually enormous in terms of scale 
460331,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I wasn t too keen on the breakfast and the layout was abit all over the place eg bacon sausage egg and beans were all in different places would have been good if they were all together It was very pricey for a breakfast We also went up to floor 17 for dinner looking at the website it described the bar menu which we thought we were getting instead it was the fine dining restaurant the menu was very confusing the food was good but would have been nice if we were asked which part we wanted to eat in as we hadn t been up there before and weren t aware they were separate , Hotel was great the view from floor 17 was really Nice 
460332,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The restaurant was too busy So you have to book well in advance for a table I guess as we didn t get to eat there , Everything was excellent The staff were very friendly and helpful the beds were very comfy the shower and bath in the rooms were excellent The bar at the 17th floor was very good 
460333,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, A little far from town but tram very easy to use and cheap, Very helpful staff and a special thank u to the head of security for helping find my partners wallet

460335,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, No swimming pool but this is probably the only thing that could have improved it , Great breakfast super friendly staff very clean great top floor bar and restaurant 
460336,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast was quite expensive for what it was We don t eat a lot for breakfast as a couple so thought it was a little too much to pay for us , Staff were so friendly and helpful Location was ideal Out of the business of the city but only a short tram ride or a nice easy bike ride to the centre 
460337,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Staff at front desk very pleasant helpful and attentive at both checkin out Hotel was spotlessly clean and very comfortable Would certainly recommend to anyone visiting Amsterdam 
460338,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We initially were put in a twin room rather than a double which took over three hours and several calls to reception to sort The new room has been cleaned in a hurry and still had a dirty coffee cup and full waste bin , Modern comfortable rooms friendly staff nice views from rooftop bar Close to tram stop and not too far into centre Good value for money 
460339,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, hotel outside city centre, Staff and room were of excellent standard Trams were regular and the stop was beside the hotel Reception staff took time to answer all my questions and helped me to decide on the timing and possible routes to were i wanted to visit
460340,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, My air conditioning was broke I recieved a free drink voucher had to wait a long time to get a room change which made me miss my dinner appointment that night with ftiends who drive from germany it was an inconvenienced everybody as they drove to the hotel to meet me then I had to drop there car off the following day I received nothing in compensation apart from free parking a few drinks after the manager said he would arrange food drinks in the end I got sick of asking leaving him messages at the reception to none he replied too , Close to the tram

460349,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, The wi fi didnt work properly and would either cut out or have very poor signal the fitness room was also very basic with 2 running machines and a few other very basic machines which would be more suited to home use as opposed to commercial There was also no free weights , The executive room was very spacious and the bed was excellent The bathroom was very good too The location is a quiet suburb and tram station is a 2 minute walk and this takes you straight into the city centre past many of the tourist sites such as Anne Franks house There is also a good park next to the hotel The staff were extremely helpful and the shuttle bus service is also very good 
460350,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, sometimes bad smell in the bathroom dont book the 16th floor you can here the moving chairs and tables from the restaurant on the 17th floor the plastic cups in the room, I liked the rooftop outside of Amsterdam quiet and still close easy to go to downtown by tram good transfer to airport staff very nice

460352,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, We were not told we had to pay a deposit Nor where we told at the end of the trip when we had little money left that we would have to pay city tax Both these events really put a downer on our trip , The view was simply amazing from our room Also the comfort of the bed was something we both very much enjoyed coming back to sleep on

460361,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, Room was very small and the location was slightly out of town Although the tram No 13 located just behind the hotel took you straight into Central Station The trams do close around midnight during the week so if you are planing late nights this hotel not for you as you will have to take a taxi home Also no vending machines which I think would be a plus as they charge 3 for a very small bottle of water which I think is a rip off , Staff were pleasant Sun roof terrace great No 13 tram stop just located at back of hotel

460376,Ramada Apollo Amsterdam Centre, I thought that being slightly outside of the town centre might be an issue but there is tram stop immediately outside the hotel with a frequent service in to the city centre which only took ten minutes or so so in reality location wasn t an issue and we would stay here again , The hotel was a little way out of the city centre but clean and well appointed The one thing that stood out was the service from all the staff on reception they were all extremely polite and very helpful
