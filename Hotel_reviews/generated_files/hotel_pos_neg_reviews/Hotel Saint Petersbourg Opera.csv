159493,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The wifi in the hotel is catastrophic Its very slow and most of the time is not working , The hotel is located in a very good area close to opera We had superior room and it was a very good size 
159494,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The breakfast was not good We only went for breakfast on the Sunday so don t know if it was a one off but was totally understaffed We went at 9 30 and breakfast was until 10 a m but there were no glasses for the orange juice and virtually no orange juice no knives no croissants and the cold buffet was virtually empty and nobody was replacing anything There were only 2 staff who were working extremely hard but just couldn t cope It took us 20 minutes to get a hot drink It was certainly not worth 15 euros , The main positive is the location of the property The hotel was comfy and the staff pleasant and helpful 
159495,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The breakfast buffet was very limited Don t take the hotel for the view out of the windows , The aircondition worked splendidly A great place regarding transport metro in general and connection to airport Charles de Gaulle Lots of restaurants not high class nor high price in the area 
159496,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Nothing , Staff were very helpful Family room was perfect and also ready on arrival It was nice to get an email from the hotel prior to arrival asking if they could prepare anything in advance 
159497,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, My only minor complaint was that the towels were very thin Didn t match the luxury of everything else , We had a wonderful extended stay at this hotel Everything felt luxury and looked newly renovated The bathrooms were brand new with a very good shower Large rooms by European standards and the beds were quite comfortable We had a balcony room for some of the time and it was so beautiful and lovely to sit out and look over the Paris rooftops I choose this hotel in part because it looked close to everything and I wasn t disappointed Steps from Opera and big shopping district just 15 min walk or easy bus subway ride to Tulleries and the Louvre Staff was super friendly and all spoke excellent English Definitely recommend 
159498,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Honestly That s very bad experience I can t believe cost those money for this hotel The water from toilet keep flow to the room all the carpet front of washroom are wet all the time never come again , location staff
159499,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Not enough band width for internet service and the tv channels in English were almost unwatchable because of pixelisation , The breakfasts were excellent and the staff of the hotel were extremely helpful 
159500,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The room was very small with no iron and wallpaper peeling in places Also very limited toiletries The sheets were not changed in the 4 nights of our stay there was a notable stain so it was easy to tell which I think is pushing it a bit , The location was fantastic easy to get everywhere The bathroom was also clean and updated Staff very friendly 
159501,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The pastry shop across the street was closed on Saturday and Sunday , The staff was very helpful in recommending restaurants each evening They also gave excellent options and directions in assisting me to get to the airport They were very pleasant to work with and my lack of any fluency in French was not a problem here The location was very central to all the sites I wanted to see for my first trip to Paris Wonderful pastry shop across the street to start my explorations 
159502,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Imagine there was no quilt cover for the quilt instead the housekeeper prepared our bed by using 2 bed sheets to cover the quilt It was really weird On the day of checkout we asked 45 min in advance to call a taxi to Gare de Lyon The concierge staff said wait 5 minutes However we wait nearly half an hour till the taxi came We missed our train in the end and repurchased our tickets and we spend 3 extra hours waiting in the train station It was 38 degrees in Paris and there was no AC So disappointed , Excellent location close to shopping areas Only 5 minutes walk to Printemps and Lafayette The staffs in front office and concierge are nice and helpful 
159503,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, There is no chance for vegetarians at breakfast but our family liked the choice in general everything was tasty The only thing i could not get in this lovely hotel was bidet of special shower but if the hotel could solve this problem i can call it perfect place to stay in Paris, Wonderful hotel with perfect placement in center of Paris clean fresh comfortable We stayed a big family in few rooms and all our reqests were satisfied The street is full of cafes and restaurants 3 minutes to main shoping centers Reception was very friendly any time of day I d like to stay again in the same hotel
159504,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Internet is slow and erratic in our room room 212 , It is near places of interest Louvre is 25 minutes walk Opera is 10 minute walk It is near several Metro stations and a station that connects you to CDG airport Very near shopping areas Lafayette Printemps C A many more independent shops Restaurants are abundant Staff are friendly and warm breakfast buffet is generous 
159505,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The only thing that could be improved is an extra lift probably So that guest can go up and down faster There was only one lift in the hotel , I liked that it was located near shopping areas and a bakery right opposite it The hotel was clean and room service was good I liked the breakfast drink option sent to our table in an individual small jug The mini croissant were flaky and delicious Fruits at breakfast were sweet too 
159506,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera,No Negative, This is not my first stay in Paris but it was my favourite The rooms were beautiful and spacious balcony is a must Staff were incredibly friendly and facilities were perfect Could not recommend this wonderful hotel in a great location for local amenities restaurants shops landmarks transport links Thank you for making this a wonderful trip

159508,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The breakfast menu was very insufficient for people eating vegetarian food In spite of not eating breakfast as there was hardly any food for us we were charges 5 Euro person day One of the standard rooms out of the two were extremely small the other one was decent ,No Positive
159509,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Internet was not working the network was there but loading any page including google took over 5 min so it was unusable At this time and age tourists are relying on having internet access in the hotel hope they can improve fix this issue as we really enjoyed our stay otherwise , Highly recommend Excellent location friendly and welcoming staff decent breakfast clean rooms Good value for money given the location and how clean the rooms are Our room was overlooking the courtyard we were pleasantly surprised by how quiet it was at night 
159510,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, It was very warm in Paris when I was there and to get the air conditioning to be on you have to contact the front desk and they and only they control the fan speed and the temperature so when you want to be a little cooler or change the fan speed you have to wait for the front desk to do it I waited 20 mins and had ring again a nice hotel but the first in 30 years of hotel stays that I could not turn the A C on , Well located plenty of dinning choices within a short walk close to shopping and transport 
159511,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera,No Negative, Spacious room with very comfortable beds luxurious bathroom and extremely helpful and attentive staff Walking distance to Louvre and so much in Paris 
159512,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, A few staff members are not particularly friendly They are not rude but just not as keen to assist you , Some staff members are extremely friendly The windows were great as they allow cool breezes into the room and some morning sun ray as well
159513,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Traffic noise from the road outside Although a side street there very noisy delivery lorries and street cleaning during one of the nights , This hotel is in a great location with excellent transport links nearby RER station makes travel from CDG airport very convenient We chose it for its direct metro line to Roland Garros tennis yet a very central location near shops and restaurants Extremely helpful staff I would highly recommend this hotel Great choice of local restaurants within a few metres of the hotel helpful advice from hotel staff

159516,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera,No Negative, Firstly if you are coming from CDG Airport the RoissyBus arrives about 2 minutes walk from the hotel strongly recommended The hotel itself is spotless and welcoming in a reasonably quiet side street given its central location The room was large and comfortable and the bathroom modern and extremely clean Breakfast in the room was excellent although we did not try the breakfast buffet Our room had a small terrace definitely worth the extra if the weather is likely to be good Plenty of places to eat within five minutes of the hotel and close to Printemps and Galeries Lafayette for some luxury shopping or just looking We were also able to leave our luggage there on the morning of our departure since we didn t need to get the bus back until midday 
159517,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The hotel sent us a survey in advance of our visit to ask about things we might need assistance with Once we arrived there was no evidence that anything had been done with our responses , Great location close to the Opera House and convenient to the metro Room was very comfortable and spacious by European standards

159521,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, I stayed 2 times the first time my double standard room was ok even though the light in the bathroom was not working well and was not fixed during my stay Second time same category room was much worse small no big mirrors majority of cable channels were not working and was dark Ask for rooms that face the street and you are more likely to get a bigger room , Very friendly stuff and cozy small hotel different from majority that you can find in that area of paris
159522,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Nothing Price was a tad high but I did book last minute for work , Unexpectedly spacious rooms for central Paris And unexpectedly quiet I slept a lot better than I usually do in Continental European hotels Plenty of very good restaurants nearby 
159523,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Breaksfast should have much more alternatives for the price , The location is perfect for public transport Very clean and silent hotel The faces are smiling
159524,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Should have an internatinal keyboard in the public computer for easier use Also unberable noise from the street , Everything was really lovely starting from the staff location cleaness breakfest and price
159525,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Small room and quite boring breakfast would be better if omelette and fried eggs are included , Very attentive personnel Many thanks to Ilona who helped with the early check in reco around the city and taxi on the way Excellent central location though very quiet 
159526,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, From the pictures online I was hoping to get a balcony room with the table and view but unfortunately we did not But it s normal that not every single room can have the view and option This is the only thing I would change , The bed was nice big and comfortable I never wanted to get out of the shower rain shower The location was excellent we walked 5 mins to shop or 5 minutes to hop on the metro to go site see Was a very convenient location hotel staff were friendly and helpful with whatever we needed 
159527,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, There was no hotel bar which was a surprising omission The fitness room is very small and not well equipped with weights The air con in the gym didn t seem to work which meant that it was very hot to exercise The room itself was quite small and it lacked a mirror in the bedroom rather than the bathroom , Beds were very comfy and the bathroom shower were very nice The hotel was clean and it was extremely beneficial to have a fitness room The staff were friendly and helpful 
159528,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, We asked for a double bed and instead we noticed there was two beds put together The staff were not overly friendly and rooms did not look as nice compared to the photographs Limited bath soaps provided as well no conditioner For the price it is not justified sadly I went for this place because of the good reviews and location but actually it s very easy to get around Paris wherever you are with Uber walking or metro ,No Positive
159529,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Much cold air from the window Bad smell in the bathroom and nothing was done about it during our staying , Best location pleasant interior Full breakfast was quite tasty

159533,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, After staying in the 7th Arrondissment earlier we found this location to be more difficult for finding casual bistros Also the desk staff didn t make an extra effort to be friendly compared to other hotels in France where we had stayed earlier in our trip , The room was spacious and the bathroom delightful

159535,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The central heating system could not be adjusted nor could it be turned on or off from within our triple room We had to call reception repeatedly to have them manually adjust turn on off the heating and this caused some discomfort as we were frequently either too hot or too cold in our room The wifi connection was terrible It cut out several times and was very slow Perhaps this was isolated to our part of the floor , The location was good only a short walk to metro Havre Caumartin Palais Garnier and Galeries Lafayette The staff members were accommodating and polite and the hotel and reception area looked quite clean and polished 
159536,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Daily cleaning was lacking did not restock refrigerator each day Wi Fi internet would go down in the evening and breakfast should be included in the published rates need better value for money , Great location and space acceptable

159542,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Rooms can be small for other people but enough for us , Personel location and the other stuff were perfect You can reach to metro by walking from the hotel Breakfast was good Near to perfect places like Opera Rooms have seperate wc and bathroom As a result I can suggest this place to everyone 
159543,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Can t think of anything that I would expect to improve , Did not utilize the restaurant or the gym Loved the view from the 6th floor overlooking the top of the Palais Garnier Close proximity to Metro Roissy Bus restaurants shopping like Galleries Lafayette and Printemps Fauchon and entertainment all around Loved the place and will return

159549,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The bed was a bit under par compared to everything else I would think the mattress was fairly new because the room seemed to be recently redone however it was not very comfortable , The location was extremely good It is a pretty easy walk to major attractions Good restaurants are nearby The staff was very welcoming The room was quite nice very clean and the public areas were beautiful 
159550,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, I had important documents train tickets that must have been thrown in the bin without looking Had the hotel kept them I would have been able to get a refund on the extra ticket I needed to get So please inform the cleaners to hand in any important papers to lost property to keep a hold of for at least a couple of weeks , The fact that arriving 3 hours before check in was not at all a problem so they could work around customers who are outside the official rule times It s nice to see a hotel bending the rules when needed

159555,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, I did not stumble upon a convenient store nearby only restaurants and pharmacies , We got a junior suite and I think it was value for money The location was great I have never stayed twice in the same hotel in Paris but after my stay here I may choose to go back to this hotel

159558,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The pillows are a killer really hard to sleep on them not comfortable at all for six nights I slept without pillows The comfort of the bed compensates They should try to use a humidifier because the air in the room is really dry , The location is excellent at least 3 metro stations are near by lots of good restaurants and it is situated in a fancy area of Paris Printemps and Galeries Lafayette are 5 minutes walk
159559,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, vague information about parking options we had accepted it was expensive we were just looking for the best value option where we could leave our car for the duration of our stay 3 days , we had a superior double room and it was fantastic spacious and very comfortable almost difficult to leave Beautiful boutique hotel 
159560,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The croissant was not the genuine article but the real thing is becoming rare in Paris , It s a good idea to make breakfast optional especially if one is leaving early on a tour and will not have time for it in the hotel There was a good range for breakfast but there could be more seasonal fruit 
159561,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, there is no ashtray at the entrance of the hotel , location adn the Street of the hotel are really great easy access to metro also by walk to all places 
159562,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, We booked a room for three people One of the beds was a sofa bed not a proper bed They didn t change glasses and mugs every day , Excellent location Cute interior Helpfull staff

159564,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Smoking occurs in the outside courtyard and noise echoes up, The rooms are quite large for Paris Location is so easy and accessible to shopping and metros Staff are perfectly welcoming and kind
159565,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Very noisy hotel A particular reception staff member was talking so loudly we could here him from our room window upstairs on the 4th floor I do not consider these rooms even remotely sound proof It was frustrating being constantly woken by traffic noise or late night diners leaving and chatting on the street before heading into taxis One night I had to open the window and tell some people who were standing there having an argument to shut up The hotel reception did nothing about asking them to take it elsewhere or to be considerate of other people Not impressed There were also renovations going on in the hotel and nearby I had to tell them to stop the drilling in the lower ground floor areas because it was vibrating extremely loudly through the walls and woke us about 6 30am It was so loud I thought it was coming from the room next door The breakfast was standard and for the price we ate a some gorgeous little cafe s that were in good walking distance Hotel did have a buffet that had more choice though if you eat a lot , Breakfast at hotel was convenient Bedrooms were lovely and clean 
159566,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, breakfast was the only disappointing area Choices too limited , I booked a triple room Very spacious and comfortable Kettle in room Bathroom clean and modern Excellent location yet quiet 
159567,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, There is no parking near the hotel which is on a single one lane street which means that if you are coming with a car you will have a problem Parking near the hotel can cost 25 euros for 12 hours so it s really not a good idea to come by car , The staff that we spoke to were exceptionally friendly and helpful The room was large and it was equipped with air conditioning which came in handy when we were there 
159568,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, It would have been nice to have a lounge more lively as its beautiful but no one goes there so no ambiance it s a shame as its well done , Location staff was nice rooms where we ll appointed 
159569,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera,No Negative, We liked everything The hotel is very clean and comfortable with all we as a mature couple could want for our stay wonderful shower room mini bar tea coffee making facilities etc When we next go to Paris we will definitely stay there again

159571,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, No bar or evening meal at the hotel Not to worry as lots of little places nearby would have just been nice to have a drink in the hotel , Excellent location very easy to get around Paris from there on our first visit Staff very accommodating in helping us with our travel plans 
159572,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, the TV channels do not have children channels, Location close to main Paris attractions shopping areas and Metro and bus suite was great for family with 2 young children Front desk cleaning staff were helpful 
159573,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, No basin in the seperate toilet , A great central location from where we were able to walk to many key attractions Louvre Magdalene Montmartre Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe and the bonus of great local eateries and don t forget the massive shopping opportunities nearby Galeries La Fayette for example 
159574,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, It was rather expensive the most expensive I ve ever booked , Very comfortable air conditioned room TV had channels from several countries Helpful staff Excellent central location 
159575,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Breakfast could ve been included And the staircase was under repair but this wasn t really an issue as there was a lift Overall the hotel is hard to fault , Central location Hotel was super clean possibly cleaner than five star hotels I ve stayed at Rooms were spacious and nicely decorated Friendly and helpful staff I m a harsh hotel critic and this hotel really impressed 
159576,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The cafeteria Honestly you need to make changes and more attractive in order to feel we are in Paris , We liked a lot your remodelation looks brighter neat and beautiful 
159577,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Our shower flooded the bathroom but more a design fault than the hotel s lack of attention , The staff were friendly and very helpful We found a wonderful quiet square with wonderful restaurants just over the road 
159578,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, No slippers Asked for extra coffee and they said can fill them up in the afternoon coz only once a day I needed coffee in the morning And they didn t come back to me , Location
159579,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, My Parent s room was on the same rate as our room but was of much poorer quality darker smaller older and looking out over the back It should have been lower price range The elevator is very small and does barely fit 2 parents with baby stroller I had to take the stairs with the stroller a couple of times because the elevator was already used by other guests , Our room was just like the picture on the website bright and nice Our crib was already set up when we arrived so that our little one could go in for a nap Staff is very friendly and helpful with maps and instructions e g how to get to Versailles by train There also is a small supermarket down the road and a large shopping center in the other direction not to mention restaurants all around and a bakery right opposite the hotel entrance 
159580,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Something to be aware of the king size beds are two beds pushed together but we found this no problem Also even if you have paid for the room upfront you pay the city tax on the last day which we forgot about and it would have been more convenient to pay at the beginning of our stay , Everything about the hotel was fantastic It is in a great busy location yet was not too loud at night times The staff were friendly and very helpful We had a superior room and our friend had the standard room both were adequate but the superior room was much larger and had a bath and separate toilet if you can afford to I would pay the extra When I next visit Paris I will be staying at Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera 
159581,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The shower was open and wet everything in the bathroom , The staff were very helpful and pleast The beds were comfy Rooms were spacious for center of Paris though American woman in our group found the rooms small by her standard 
159582,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Tourist tax surprised me but it was not the hotels fault and not that expensive just didnt know about it until checkout , Cozy hotel with close to many things like the opera and louvre 12 min walk Quiet and nice room with things you need Breakfast was nice even though it was not included in our booking Staff was helpful and willing to rebook our stay due to pilot strike in Sweden even though it said non rebookable much appreciated 
159583,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The elevator is small 2 people and 2 suitcases only do Not eat at the restaraunt across the street Restaraunt Pizza Firenze There are 2 stairs from the floor up to the door of your room very awkward trying to get inside with suitcases We were on the 2nd floor our room looked at a quad of the backs of several buildings The pictures online of the rooms decor are not what everyone should expect The lobby and the bathrooms are fairly acurrate our bathroom didn t have decorative tiling as an example Breakfast is an extra 16 Euros per person daily , The bed was comfortable Shelving in part of wall to not take up extra room This was great since hotels don t have space to 2 travelers that are platonic Guests are able to use a computer with a printer and not have to pay extra The shower was awesome 
159584,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, There is only 1 mirror in the bathroom and none in the room or near the room door Shampoo and tea were not replenished daily, The location is perfect if you plan to spend time shopping in lafayette or printemps Close to many other tourist attractions Bathtub in the bathroom 
159585,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, There was no bar but many bars across the street , Position of hotel was excellent walking distance of all the main attractions Eiffel Tower Arc de Triomphe Louvre Notre Dame Sacre Coeur etc All the staff were friendly and helpful Room was very comfortable and a good price We didn t try breakfast as wanted to be walking early Definitely recommend this hotel 
159586,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Price for breakfast could have been a bit cheaper , Excellent location Clean spotless room Beds were comfortable Wifi was strong and fast It was quiet All amenities were modern The front desk concierge were extremely helpful in every way They helped arrange taxi service and made restaurant area recommendations Location is also ideal for the Roissy bus from the airport only a 5 minute walk to the hotel from Opera L Open Tour Hop on and Hop off tour bus is only 3 minutes walk Gallerie Lafayette also a few minutes walk down the street Lots of restaurants across and down the street 
159587,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, The carpet was a little stained and there was a slight stale smell in the room maybe because the air was off and the windows were all closed when I arrived , I liked the quietness of the room the size of the room the Windows that could be opened easily and most of all the extremely professional helpful and welcoming staff 
159588,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera, Can t think of anything really , Comfortable beds very clean room Breakfast always very nice Location is excellent and by now we know where everything in central Paris is once we walk out the front door 
159589,Hotel Saint Petersbourg Opera,No Negative, The service was professional at the front desk and concierge The room was very nice and although normal in terms of size it did have very high ceilings and was very well finished The property is within a very short distance of all the major sites or an easy Uber or subway ride away Great location
