508485,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Room was hot aircon not working so a fan was used instead The window remained open all weekend to cool room down Luckily it wasn t hot outside, Comfy bed great bathroom
508486,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Room size incredibly small which made stay uncomfortable Air conditioner not working which also wasn t helpful Stairs to upper floors incredibly steep and difficult, Lovely staff great breakfast and wifi
508487,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Room in the top floor was very small , Breakfast was extremely good A lot better than most View to a canal was beautiful Good location somewhat long walking distance from everywhere in central Amsterdam 
508488,Amsterdam Canal Residence,No Negative, Nice small hotel at very good place Close to the centre close to tram stop and restaurants Very tasty and fresh breakfast friendly staff Nice view from the window channel side very quite room Problem could appear if you do not like steep chairs 
508489,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Unfortunately the AC in our room was not working and we were given a cooling fan which was quite noisy and we decided not to use it So we ended up sleeping with the windows open and had to bear the traffic noise from the street at night, Good staff and service The hotel was recently renovated so the room was very clean and well maintained We stayed in a suite and the size was quite good for European standards The complimentary breakfast was great and worth it The location was good as well not in the city centre but still a walking distance or tram ride away from the museums and other tourist attractions 
508490,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Wish we had know about the three flights of stairs prior to our visit or given the choice of a lower floor We travelled from the US and hoped we might have had a view of the canal Our friends who reserved their room long after we had made our reservation had a rather swanky room with a sensational canal view for their two night stay , Not sure we envisioned three very tall flights of stairs when we booked this hotel We stayed for a week and were surprised that they chose to give a long term guest the most inaccessible room The room itself was fine The breakfast was lovely The hotel seems somewhat short staffed as the women who checked us in was also the woman helping at breakfast and also carried the luggage both up and down the stairs She is a real gem and hope the hotel knows how lucky they are to have such a dedicated employee 
508491,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Overall Amsterdam is an expensive city and the hotel is no exception Downside of the canal in front of the window are the mosquitos you ll have to face if you leave the window open in summer Mattresses were too soft for our taste , Very friendly and helpful staff nice breakfast and buffet open until 11 00 am which is quite convenient nice atomsphere and style of the room The view from our room to the Gracht canal was well worth some extra money 
508492,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Air conditioning didn t work had ugly machine with vent out the window to try and cool down room which meant u couldn t close the window so very noisy or very hot and not so noisy as soundproofing could be better when windows were closed hot breakfast was very good but didn t replenish croissant etc at 10 am even though breakfast wasn t finished till 11 am, Room was very spacious bed extremely large and very comfortable we stayed in a suite bathroom modern very good facilities
508493,Amsterdam Canal Residence, There s no elevator or lift in the hotel if you bring big luggage and get the highest floor it will be a big trouble like me since I travelled with my mommy older people Fortunately hotel staffs really helpful in bringing our 2 big luggage to hotel room but my mom still complained because she still need to climb up to reach our hotel room, The staffs really great superb also the breakfast also good The location in the centre of city near to tram
508494,Amsterdam Canal Residence, The bathroom could have been more private with the frosted glass not covering the area fully It didn t matter though we were family but could have bothered some people , The staff were so friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fantastic they even did bubbles 
508495,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Only issues we had was that we were not happy with the quality of the cleaning and the replacement of new bed sheet toiletries , Location Breakfast is great Staff is very helpful The front lady was nice enough to take our heavy bag all the way to the top we had issue with the hot water and they attended within a few hours by replacing the entire shower set which we thought was very impressive 
508496,Amsterdam Canal Residence, The location was a good twenty minute walk from the main square and around a further ten minutes to get to central staition on top of that if you don t mind a bit of walking then there s no real down point to this place, Very modern and nicely styled bedroom very plain layout with two beds and a bathroom and mini fridge with some complementary soft drinks 
508497,Amsterdam Canal Residence, The bed was too soft and the room pretty small Had to go out to the next building to have breakfast , The room was very clean Friendly staff Location wasn t too bad the room was quiet last floor and view to the canal 
508498,Amsterdam Canal Residence, The residence has no elevator so you have to climb very narrow stairs with a suitcase we were on the top floor , We loved the location and the service of the staff as well as the food 
508499,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Too hot with windows closed at night time and so many mosquitos with windows opened , Visually beautiful Loved the decor and the beautiful bathrooms Wonderful breakfast Complimentary fridge Wonderful customer service 
508500,Amsterdam Canal Residence, We had a standard canal view room which was gorgeous and so efficiently laid out We barely spent any time in the room other than to sleep so the rooms smallness didn t hinder us at all but I would not recommend more than 2 people to stay in it There was a strange smell in the room just barely detectable I think it might be the canal though The three flights of stairs were no issue at all for us who are in shape and pack light but might be for others , The staff were extremely accommodating and polite It was actually the only time in Amsterdam that we encountered such nice people Also we think they might also all be models The breakfast was delicious We loved having our windows open and woke up every morning to birds singing on the quiet canal 
508501,Amsterdam Canal Residence,No Negative, Amazing people working at this hotel always trying to make you feel comfortable and they re very friendly and welcoming The location is great too quiet in a nice neighborhood but very close to main locations The hotel itself is classy and very comfortable Loved it definitely recommend it 
508502,Amsterdam Canal Residence, No air conditioning in the rooms We had to change the rooms THREE times There was no air conditioning in the first room we we given on the 3rd floor was very tiny and very hot The hostess proposed to have the window located behind our bed open This did not sound like a confortable sleeping arrangement to us so we asked for a cooler room and were given a second chance The room was on ground level big but hotter than the previous one perhaps 28C On our request the host opened the window just a little bit it was impossible to open the window more because of it s position The tram lines are located on the street the room was facing and garbage bins are located under the room Not confortable and very noisy all night Our booking was for five nights so we requested a better room or our money back The manager offered another room kindly explained that this is the last room change and that the weather is a bit hotter than usual in Amsterdam 22C is not hot in anyone s terms The third room had no aircon but a small window that we kept open during the night It was manageable but NOT confortable After all we came on holidays to Amsterdam and we wanted a confortable room What is disappointing is the fact that back in March 2016 we enquired if the room that we have booked had an aircon and received an email confirmation on the 26 March from Emma K stating YES Other issues The hairdrier is attached to the wall in the bathroom and a button has to be pressed on non stop while drying the hair These style of hairdryers belong well back to the past I preffer to sit while drying my hair not to stand in a hot bathroom pressing a button The floor of the shower cabin floor is sleek and slippery No tissue paper ear buds or cotton balls are available in the bathroom In my opinion this cute hotel would be good for younger audiences and perhaps more for guests accustomed to European standards of hotel services , The hotel staff hosts were very accomodating and kind always happy to assist with our requests and enquiries and always with a big smile on their faces Thank you all for that The hotel location is perfect the view on the canal peaceful and quite charming The room decor is cute and chic 
508503,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Shower room is not discreet for travelling with friends There is gaps where you can see through , Room was very big and spaceious Everywhere was very clean We arrived and the guy think his name was Yelly was very friendly and help us loads 
508504,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Hotel has a lovely terrace but you can t eat or drink on it Morning staff were noisy Adjoining family room very small for 2 teenagers , The bed was extremely comfortable breakfast was excellent our room had a lovely view over the canal excellent tram connections outside hotel to both Museum District and City centre 
508505,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Breakfast could be more international Wireless is weak Stairs were painted and wet while checkout at 12 00pm and it was hard to carry the luggages and trying to watch out the painted furnitures down by the narrow path , Nice for a short stay Comfortable rooms 
508506,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Air Conditioner not working in room, Nice bathroom and comfy beds good location easy access to trams Room nice and had small connected room with single bed 
508507,Amsterdam Canal Residence, For the room change they charged 35 as a cleaning fee although we were downgraded And the garage was very very small , we had the opportunity to change the room bec it was way too noisy 
508508,Amsterdam Canal Residence,No Negative, the complementary trip through the canals which we had not expected but enjoyed immensely We knew breakfast was included but only when we went down the first day did we learn that we could order a hot breakfast at no additional charge Each of the staff we met were nice young and helpful 
508509,Amsterdam Canal Residence,No Negative, This hotel seems to get better each time I stay I love the location the staff the quality and comfort of the rooms I also love that I am not paying for any amenities which I am not using there is no pool restaurant or large public spaces The hotel is intimate quiet and has exactly what I need a nice place to have a decent breakfast in the mornings a quiet place to enjoy a drink in the afternoons with beautiful views on a tranquil canal a short walk from some of the most beautiful museums in the world The hotel is delightful the staff are wonderfully attentive and the location is perfect for exploring some of the nicest parts of Amsterdam It is simply a perfect boutique hotel 
508510,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Rooms are beyond small tiny tiny and with a bathroom in it imagine the smallest studio room and it s smaller They have NO air conditioning working in this property even though the kit is installed they say it s not operational The rooms heat up and your only option is to open the window which then brings in flies from the canal which suck your blood during the night and you wake up with huge bites The property has no stairs so you have to walk up seriously steep stairs every time trust me this gets tiring even for fit people They have a minibar in the room which they don t tell you is free until you check out staff member tells us this is so you drink in the bar so why have a free minibar The place is just overly cramped tiny rooms stuffy and uncomfortable It is not a 4 star not even close 2 star definitely and at a push a 3 star Would never stay here again and we are far from the type who complain, Nothing
508511,Amsterdam Canal Residence, One member of staff wasn t very pleasant and let the whole team down , Pancakes amazing Bed extremely comfy Most staff went over and above One member of staff wasn t very pleasant and let the whole team down

508514,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Needs more storage space shelves A great pity that you cant take food or drink into the gardens The stairs are VERY steep , Fabulously friendly and helpful staff at a lovely boutique hotel ideally positioned just outside the centre of Amsterdam Very handy mini fridge and nice nespresso machine Lovely free canal cruise on the hotels own boat 
508515,Amsterdam Canal Residence,No Negative, The pancakes were delicious and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly The hotel was a short walk to the centre it took about 10 minutes to walk so we didnt need to catch any trams The hotel was beautifully decorated and the bed was very comfortable

508519,Amsterdam Canal Residence, Our room was above the kitchen so the smell of fried eggs and toast usually woke us up also in the evening and sometimes even in the night we had to listen to the cleaning of the kitchen , The view from the room was stunning the staff was very helpful and kind the breakfast was very good
