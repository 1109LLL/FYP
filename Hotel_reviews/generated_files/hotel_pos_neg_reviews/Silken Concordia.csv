395784,Silken Concordia, Not sure what to say here since it is mixed feeling for my group The hotel is 15 min walk away from La Rambla which is fine for me but the rest of my family felt it is far from the tourist attractions Hotel is few meters away from the underground train and get you everywhere within short time If back in Barcelona will definitely use again , Very friendly staff and provided lots of help on setting up tours visits and reservations Also staff explained best method of transportation for each visit Breakfast buffet was excellent with many choice to get the morning going Special thanks to front desk Ruben whom made our trip very comfortable and attended to all our family needs from arriving till departure 
395785,Silken Concordia, My room was not too far from the hostel pool As a result there was a very strong smell of chlorine all over the place , The staff is awesome Rooms are big and clean 
395786,Silken Concordia, shower leaked on bathroom floor, very comfortable and wide bed with good breakfast selection Overall location excellent Staff and facilities were brilliant and would definitely use this again
395787,Silken Concordia, When I ask for a twin bed room I expect to see the beds separate from each other but as nearly all hotels I visited in Spain they were placed next to each other Still I believe it s a Spanish thing , It is at a very good location and right across the street there is the Line 3 underground station that takes you to all the great locations around Barcelona You can also take the D 20 bus to the Barcelonate beach from about 50 metres from the hotel MNAC and other interesting places are within walking distance as well The staff were extremely helpful and the pool and the smallish jacuzzi on the 5th floor were a great change from Barcelona s heat at summer The bistro is a gem but has no visitors and it s a shame Its 3 course meal of the day is about Euro13 50 and very good value for money and the bar is also nice Breakfast offered a lot of choices and we were really pleased with it The room was comfortable but a bit smallish 
395788,Silken Concordia, The staff on reception were polite and friendly Frank and his collegue also another young gentleman who checked us out on the Tuesday were very helpful and allowed us to leave our bags with him whilst we explored the city We had the option for late check out at 12 noon However felt that if customers had a later flight they could use a spare room to freshen up before flying at a small cost and not 20 euros an hour for later check out possibly something to consider we had to use the reception toilets to change and wash ourselves I had to ask for someone to serve me at the bar when the bar and hotel reception wasn t busy It took roughly 15mins to be served as a member of staff was in the kitchen possibly doing something else or nothing at all Some staff members did come across as rude and unhelpful but some were very helpful Overall experience was good but I think standards could be improved with staff and the other things I have mentioned , Very nice room with spacious wardrobes Cleanliness was excellent and the bed was soft and spacious We liked that we were given refreshments to use in the room e g Shampoo etc Did like that there was a fridge in the room but pricey for the items that were inside I think this would be used more if was cheaper Cleaners were very friendly in the hallway passing 
395789,Silken Concordia, The roof top pool is small but it s not too bad also we wanted to play mini golf but they only had one ball and one set of clubs so had to wait for ages to play, Room was lovely and clean and comfortable staff was lovely location was great about a 10 minute walk to la rambla
395790,Silken Concordia, The pool was nice but a bit small Also i was expecting a bit more comfort and bigger size room for 4 star hotel , Very good breakfast with more than enough choice
395791,Silken Concordia, The coffee in the room was not replaced Had coffee pods for only the first night When asked I was told that it is only supplied as a present for first night but I paid the same amount for the second night but no present , The room upgrade was great 
395792,Silken Concordia,No Negative, I could have a good rest as the rooms are quite and silent at night less during the morning if you want to stay in bed late Staff are always available to assist you and meet your needs The position of the hotel is in one of my new favorite area of Barcelona full of good places to relax read a book work and have precious coffees and smoothies 
395793,Silken Concordia, Definitely a city hotel several homeless ppl in the area most didn t bother us , Close to a pedestrian street with lots of shops roof top pool was perfect for relaxing Also not too far from the port we boarded a cruise from Barcelona 
395794,Silken Concordia, Breakfast hotter food bacon was almost cold Toaster needs fixing choice of eggs would help The continental was good but 18 a bit pricey , Fantastic bed great night sleep Super location near tube better break than expected Great location for some great restaurants facilities
395795,Silken Concordia, Nothing , Great stay lovely staff that are very helpful and hotel very well located Good nights sleep every night and would definitely stay there again 
395796,Silken Concordia, Good hotel but a little over priced Paid 150 Eur per night It should have been cheaper as amenities were limited e g no bar and nice but very average rooms , Great Location 15 20 min walk to Plaza Espana and the Port 3 min walk to green line metro Lots of Restaurants and shops in the area 
395797,Silken Concordia, Room was facing the road outside and was a little noisy , Convenient location very close to metro which can take you anywhere 10 15 minute walk from Ramblas Very clean with helpful staff Would definitely stay here again 
395798,Silken Concordia, Unfortunately the other guests didn t realise talking loudly in the corridors travelled through the rooms So very noisy especially at night , Stayed in the hotel years ago and still got the impression of a clean safe and pleasant hotel 
395799,Silken Concordia, We were there 5 nights Shampoo shower gel not refilled 1 4 box of tissues emptied after 2 days but not replaced Walls paper thin could hear EVERYTHING in next room Street noise was annoying , Breakfast very nice staff friendly and helpful
395800,Silken Concordia, Coffee sachet in room only given for one night we were there for 4 never ever came across this before in all the hotels I have stayed in all over the world mean didn t like the bar part of the restaurant Strange set up, Bed was comfortable handy for some nice restaurants Lovely restaurant across the road basilco great food and sfaff
395801,Silken Concordia, you do get quite a bit of noise from the street the tea and coffee facilities are poor with a cardboard cup for drinking out of price for the items in the mini bar are expensive however that is normal Pool area look slightly tired, Found the room fine if slightly on the small side beds were very comfortable but Shower was good but Staff very polite and very helpful Location is fine and access to metro is just up from the hotel Main entrance and reception is all clean and fresh looking 
395802,Silken Concordia, The bed wobbled every time you moved The housekeeping does not replace the coffee coffee cups you have to pay to get extra after the first night No milk either The WIFI is totally useless it automatically disconnects every few minutes and is painfully slow You can t get a good night sleep as the black out curtains don t block out the sun completely and the housekeeping staff are very loud come 8am Very disappointing stay , The hotel was clean 
395803,Silken Concordia, The bed could have been more comfortable the wifi more reliable and it would be nice to have an iron and ironing board , Didn t eat there but overall was very happy Shower and bath fantastic
395804,Silken Concordia,No Negative, It was very nice The staf was very helpful and profesional About the room it was very clean and cozy we arived at 22 00 and next day in the morning they have already changed the bedding We really enjoyed 
395805,Silken Concordia, My shower leaked all over the bathroom floor Ended up like a swimming pool Shower head dirty Pillows are like concrete Hot tub outside was cold I put a DO NOT DISTURB on my door because I do not like cleaners staff coming in if I m only there for 48 hours but they still came in which I was not happy with at all , Location
395806,Silken Concordia, Paper cups for coffee in room and no milk for coffee in room Leak in bathroom No British channels on TV Maid service cleaning rooms around tea time , Friendly staff
395807,Silken Concordia, Breakfast warm food was cold and not replenished quickly over all the breakfast wasn t worth the money and I found the hotel a little expensive for the services provided, Beds were comfy and the room was clean
395808,Silken Concordia, We visited in January and the temperature in the room was too hot Couldn t get it cooler without opening the window Would have liked more english television stations on the tv Americans really like to have coffee in the room or at least free coffee available before 7 15 in morning , The desk staff were excellent Helping us find locations and a car for return flight to the airport The breakfast had everything we were expecting and more 
395809,Silken Concordia,No Negative, The hotel was amazing from the reception to the room and especially one staff member named John in particular As we had an early flight it meant we arrived to the hotel at around 10am about 4 hours earlier than expected Amazingly John had a room ready for us in minutes The room was beautiful spacious and very comfortable Couldn t recommend more 
395810,Silken Concordia, The rooms were extremel noisy the cleaners were talking very loud from early in the morning and the cleaning equipment was handled very noisily Everything that was going on the corridors was loudly heard in the rooms We asked the staff to be quiet but the next day I woke for a loud talking again at 7 am by the staff The hotel is not suitable if you need a rest The last night a drunk guest was making rumours so from the 6 nights there was only 1 2 that we could sleep properly , The room was cleaned every day The location is great few steps from the metro station and very close to sights and the downtown 
395811,Silken Concordia, The bedsheets smell bad the staff in Reception are not friendly as a matter of fact the girl who was there was a little bit concieted, The location only
395812,Silken Concordia, every thing was good I stayed for only a day so I didn t faced anything bad to be mention , the location was amazing less than 200 meters from the metro station also it s close the Catalonia square
395813,Silken Concordia, The bed was comfortable but a bit too large but that s just personal taste on not a fault on hotel, This hotel is right in the heart of the city ideal for sightseeing It offers great value for money The breakfast are very diverse and substantial and the staff are helpful
395814,Silken Concordia, Internet connectivity was extremely unreliable on some occasions it was unuseable This alone will prevent me from staying again I rely on email and basic internet for my job Breakfast was not great cooked food could have been fresher but there are plenty of cafes nearby, Location was good The room was good
395815,Silken Concordia, nothing really although I would have liked a bath , Excellent location Could walk into centre plenty of bars and restaurants close by Tea coffee making facilities and beds very comfortable All staff friendly and helpful
395816,Silken Concordia, Shower was not good hot water wasn t always working and water pressure was poor AC in the room took a long time to cool the room down so it was quite stuffy at times I think it was overpriced , Bed was comfortable staff was friendly
395817,Silken Concordia, Compared to the Silken Diagonal same number of stars on opposite side of the city the Concordia looks a bit old fashioned in particular the pool area , Opposite subway station quiet open area yet close to many landmarks 30 mins walk to marina 30 mins to Placa Catalynia Quiet rooms comfortable Many caf s bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood 
395818,Silken Concordia, Room too small Not much room left after fitting in the bed and the basic furniture Bed too soft for elders , The location is excellent Easy access to attractions The staff are very helpful Wifi free and very efficient 
395819,Silken Concordia, Shower leaked onto floor No tissue in the room Took a little while no signage to figure out that room key was required to operate thermostat and lights , Staff was very helpful we bought hop on hop off tour bus tickets received directions map as well as recommendation for dinner Was able to drop luggage off early in day prior to check in 
395820,Silken Concordia, No coffee tea making facilities in the room meaning we had to get ready and go to the restaurant and pay for them if we wanted it or pay for room service disappointing Also we had asked for a quiet room when booking it was fairly quiet but the window still faced the very busy road and so we were awakened by ambulance sirens etc in the morning The guest who booked in ahead of us was told he had a room at the back which faced nothing and so was very quiet we had wanted the same but were told our room was quiet because it was high up not quite what I had wanted, Bed was comfortable and staff helpful The room was a good size and very clean It was quiet inside with no noisy guests A large clean bathroom with a strong power shower and a bath Over all an enjoyable and restful stay
395821,Silken Concordia, Instructions for keeping the lights on by keeping the key card in a specific receptacle on the wall would have been appreciated A passing guest showed us how A mat on the shower floor it was slippery and we were very cautious , Great comfortable well appointed room Clock on phone was off by 12 minutes so we requested a wake up call We got up before the requested time but the phone never rang We did notice red and green lights flashing and wondered if that was the wake up call When the desk clerk saw our van pull up he came right out to help take the bags into the hotel 
395822,Silken Concordia, Pool water was cold especially from the Jacuzzi should be hot They have charged me double for the items I took out of mini bar I noticed it when I got back home , Location and staff are very friendly
395823,Silken Concordia, The room was noisy and you could hear the sound of other rooms and street and the metro Bad air conditioning in the room The quality of breakfast was not so good comparing its price , Great Location The stafs was so helpful and nice The room was clean 
395824,Silken Concordia, Could do with a shower changing facility for late check out if fully booked, Friendly helpful staff clean hotel with a spacious room and free upgrade on arrival 
395825,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Staff were lovely helpful and the cleaners did a perfect job of the room every day Pool area was nice and chilled Close enough walk to Las Ramblas and a bus ride from the beach 
395826,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Free use of sauna was a lovely touch Had no idea this was the case when booking Only a 15 minute walk to the beach and the gothic district of Barcelona Lots of shops bars restaurants close to hotel itself Staff very helpful Great stay 
395827,Silken Concordia, Cleaning staff should pay more attention they weren t replenishing used items properly like hand soap coffee etc Poor tea coffee making facilities in the room no milk paper tray foam cups not what I would expect from a 4 star Lobby decor is excellent but room decor is poor hideous wall art , Clean room comfortable large bed made up nicely every day Great location with good transport links and plenty of food options nearby My daughter loved the terrace pool and mini golf 
395828,Silken Concordia, some of the best and very friendly staff seemed to be temporarily contracted as seen from their Randstad T shirts give them full time employment they deserve it , staff were great loved the extra little attentions location superb faultless 
395829,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is in a great location walkable distance to the port and les rambles if you re active as well being very close to the metro Lots of restaurants to eat in nearby also 
395830,Silken Concordia, The room and the pool could have been bigger, Breakfast was very good although not so flexible on timing we slept in the first morning but didn t make the same mistake again 
395831,Silken Concordia, Struggled to get an opportunity to use the the sun beds by the pool Found that several guests were leaving their belongings on sun beds and were not at the pool This was un fair on other guests and should be monitored, Good size room with comfortable bed Good restaurants and cafes nearby Not very far from Las Ramblas and within walking distance to hop on hop off bus stop
395832,Silken Concordia, Could do with more sun loungers in the afternoon it got busy there were no dun loungers left so had to lie on the floor Crazy golf is very dirty and has bird poo all over it , Pool facilities
395833,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Nice location the beach bus is just outside the hotel and the subway on the other side of the street Lovely beds and luxurious linen Upgraded the room from Comfort room to Silken Club Room that was more suitable for my teenage daughter and me 
395834,Silken Concordia, There was a fire alarm on the day we were leaving but I think if we had been sleeping we would not have heard it You could only hear it if you were outside the reoom , The staff coped with the mix up in my reservation far exceding my expectations I explained that I had booked for 2 adults and one child but the Booking com website kept offering me a room for 2 which I assumed would have an extra bed added It didn t but they moved me to a bigger room for no extra charge Great service and I d like to thank Babriel in particular for his help 
395835,Silken Concordia, Standard comfort rooms are not to the quality as shown on website, Location is good Roof top pool is great to cool down after a day sight seeing
395836,Silken Concordia, Expensive for what you get wifi didnt work in my room on the 6th Floor i wouldnt class it as 4 rooms dont look as pictures swimming pool is very small only about 8 sun loungers, Staff were friendly nice atmosphere and location but quite a walk from the beach and centre
395837,Silken Concordia, Reality do not mach the photos on the booking webpage and standards of 4 star hotel I left hotel after first night and move to better one with lower price and better location And that was 3 star hotel Never again First negative experience with booking in almost 10 years I am using it , Location is only what can be considered regarding this hotel Everything else is very basic it is not 4 star hotel for sure I left hotel after first night being happy to do not feel cheated 
395838,Silken Concordia,No Negative, We arrived early and expected to have to leave our luggage but they already had a room available Great extra effort which made our live so much easier 
395839,Silken Concordia, We did not take breakfast as it is quite expensive, Friendly personell very helpfull Room was clean and comfortable tt is easy to navigate to other places as the hotel is located on a main road It is possible to walk to the center and the beach 20 30 min or take the subway which is very close to the hotel My son enjoyed jumping in the small pool on the roof 
395840,Silken Concordia, The tea bags and coffee were bad quality it could do with better tea and coffee facilities, The location was very good The breakfast had a good variety The room was spacious and bed was comfy The wifi was good The staff were friendly and helpful
395841,Silken Concordia, I would have preferred a variety of food for breakfast as they wasn t much I liked other than croissants A bit of issue with getting hold of an iron in the morning but managed to sort it , Staff at reception were lovely and helpful and the location was great room was comfy and clean so I can t really complain 
395842,Silken Concordia,No Negative, The room was excellent clean everyday with Lots of extra s such as shampoo lotion etc Good location close to metro station and restaurants in the street Would stay again
395843,Silken Concordia, Having to move from one room to another during the course of our stay Due to maintenance work If scheduled work Would have liked to be informed at beginning of stay If emergency work understandable but still unpleasant , The Location The friendliness of the staff and how helpful they were 
395844,Silken Concordia, The rooms have a kettle in but the hotel couldn t provide coffee and tea sachets for four days so we got our own though they did give us 2 free drinks at the bar as compensation Also the swimming pool is titchy , The rooms were extremely comfy and pleasant good air conditioning nice view very comfy bed well equipped The staff were very pleasant and helpful The sun terrace was great 
395845,Silken Concordia, Location a bit seedy hence watch out in the subway stop in Poble Sec for possible pickpockets Didn t get pick pocketed though but many of them obviously lurking for opportunity Our sink had a small leak and thought the marble countertop was dangerously close to the tub may cause a bad accident if someone were to slip the tub , Close to Adria s restaurants Tickets Pakta etc Quimet y Quimet Right in front of metro stop Poble Sec Room very large with complete amenities Staff very helpful 
395846,Silken Concordia, Size of the room was tight , Rooms were small Little noisy as I was on the street side and on the third floor Also Marathon run on the Sunday I was there so lots of cheering Sunday morning Carrer Parliment is close an upcoming stretch in the Raval 
395847,Silken Concordia, Parking isn t ideal for any medium sized to large size vehicles Also no fee was advertised for parking prior to booking , Very nice staff Xavi helpful too 
395848,Silken Concordia, When we booked the bedroom we were told the parking was included Stated in the page of the hotel When we checked out we were charged almost 20 for one day of parking This is a dishonest way of doing things I don t recommend this hotel It is a clean hotel nothing more than that ,No Positive
395849,Silken Concordia, I arrived after a long drive from France The room was so intoxicated with perfume spray I was physically sick I was told all the rooms were like that I left the window open and left the room for three hours The room was so hot and was impossible to cool Leaving the window open meant hearing Spanish ambulances throughout the night I specicifically e mailed ahead for a double bed Obviously I should have written it in Spanish la cama de matrimonio The two single beds were put together but one of the matress had a deep hole in it so it was impossible to sleep I changed rooms the following day but the heating was still a problem There should be a warning about taking large cars to this hotel Our stay in Barcelona was spoilt ny this hotel , Leaving after a very uncomfortable stay
395850,Silken Concordia, despite notification of early arrival you could check in after 15 pm, great location experienced and very helpful staff and opportunity to book the sauna on exclusivity
395851,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Really excellent customer service from the friendly staff They volunteered to reserve restaurants for us and even booked our tickets for Sagrada Familia 
395852,Silken Concordia, Not all rooms have air conditioning Listing makes it appear that there s a hot tub which there is not, Hotel was clean Staff member available 24 hours a day
395853,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Super comfy bed and clean rooom Nice staff and great location close to public transportation next to one of most caratteristic and nice area of the city and not superturistic 
395854,Silken Concordia,No Negative, Very close to the city centre the metro is 2 mins by walk as well as the Blai street where you can have great variation of pinchos The Rambla is about 10 mins by walk just as the harbour The hotel is clean all staff was helpful and smiley 
395855,Silken Concordia, The surrounding buildings and neighbourhood are of medium class The TV screen is small for a 4 star hotel as is the furniture the room curtains and the bath with a plastic curtain , The hotel is well situated opposite to the Metro stop and easy to go everywhere with the metro The staff very friendly
395856,Silken Concordia, When we arrived to the hotel the parking lot was full and we had to look for a parking around for two hours Ans the staff didnt try to help at first just after one hour they gave us a parking address that is so far In the web they said no need to reserve parking lot thats why we didnt ,No Positive
395857,Silken Concordia, Air conditioning hot considering not every people are the same For us even if it s winter we still needs some air flowing inside the room specially we have baby with us , cleanliness of room location of hotel quick access to transportation
395858,Silken Concordia,No Negative, few meters from Pablo Sec L3 metro line which is only 2 3 stops away from the La Bucharia and the Rambla at night nice small wine and hangout bars 
395859,Silken Concordia, the break fast was not that much pleasent It was good but not great parking was expensive 17 euro per night , location was great there was a metro station across the street it worth the price was quit clean staff behavior was freindly
395860,Silken Concordia, In my opinion this hotel is an acceptable 3 star establishment but NOT 4 star Girl on reception lacked warmth and not helpful Like other guests not allowed to enter room until just before 15 00 Asked for room overlooking the street room overlooked decrepit buildings typical Spanish but I elected to keep the room because it was at least quiet Room was far too hot upon entry Soundproofing poor Delighted to see kettle but in a four star hotel you at least expect ceramic cups and or mugs Styrofoam cups are NOT 4 star There was a very selection of tea coffee No milk NO SPOON Internet connection erratic even in Reception Handle to window was removable and did not connect well Refrigerator door was loose and difficult to close Bathroom poor quality fittings old taps shower curtain not glass screen No glasses in the bathroom just plastic beakers No plug for the sink and the bath plug was chained to the bath Asked at Reception for a sink plug and was made to feel uncomfortable in doing so Eventually offered four different sized plugs and selected two one of which was rusty Asked for a spoon and was told to get one from the bar staff If you go the pool area you will notice that some of the pictures used by the hotel have been Photoshopped so as not to reveal the true extent of the view and state of the pool area Chose not to have room cleaned on first morning Saw the maid and just exchanged towels The next morning the maid could be heard at 08 00 I left the room at 09 30 and put the card requesting a clean on the door handle I returned at 14 00 The room had not been cleaned I called Reception Housekeeper appeared 10 minutes later and apologised Said the Maid had two floors to do That is not my problem it is a lack of sufficient staffing The utility room was ONE door away the Maid would have passed my room all morning Surely if a room had not been done the day before it must be a priority the following day ,No Positive
395861,Silken Concordia, shower pressure was varied WiFi got lost some times I felt the pool was a little cold for me , Nice helpful staff good room clean and comfortable free WiFi good mini bar free to use room safe Right opposite a metro station 
395862,Silken Concordia, The elevator had a jerky landing Also they charged me for something after I checked out and after enquiring they said its for items I had taken from the mini fridge All was ok but what I didn t like was they charged to my card even without informing and only could know after I sent a message Since I had not taken one of the item which I conveyed they were courteous to say that they will refund Could be better if they charge to credit card they also inform the customer by email at least whenever they have records with them, Good location comfortable beds spacious room and value for money 
395863,Silken Concordia, When we arrived they had put us in a twin room instead of a double room as requested room was clearly for a disabled person and wasn t up to standard at all Requested to change room from the receptionist who was quite nice but advised we wouldn t be able to until the following day They changed us to a King room which was better but still not up to the standard for the price of the hotel Receptionist in the morning looked like she didn t know how to smile Wouldn t recommend , Location is probably the only good thing 
395864,Silken Concordia, Room service was terrible The food was served cold far too much salt and the icecream was completely melted When we asked for a double bed we were downgraded to a tiny bedroom with windows to a patio after paying for a huge bedroom with balcony We weren t told that a double bed would mean staying in THAT room and loosing the one we d paid for , The bed was comfortable and everything was clean Staff was friendly 
395865,Silken Concordia, Poor facilities worn and broken walls and tables and the box shell of the switches falls on the floor when we get in the room no quills cold at night it says 4 stars on the Internet and we paid twice the money than our next accommodation which is million times better Really disappointed worst experience, Breakfast
395866,Silken Concordia, All equipments are closing very early For example the coktail bar is closing 9PM and the swimming pool at 8pm As a result we couldnt enjoy them although they were the reasons why we booked this hotel In our room walls were dirty and the furnitures were a bit old and scrapped Too bad that you have to pay that price for the location No airport shuttles either , Location
