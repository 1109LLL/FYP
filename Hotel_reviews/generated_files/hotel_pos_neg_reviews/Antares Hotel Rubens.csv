486593,Antares Hotel Rubens, I would like just to suggest to improve the light of the mirror in the bathroom because it was difficult to perform make up or bear shaving also the light in the room might be improve using softer light for the night time , The hotel is really nice clean and well decorated The room was spatious with all needed and the bed very comfortable The breakfast is complete and rich you can soddisfy any type of exigencies For example they have a special menu for vegan ppl The position is very favourable to reach the metro which is well connected with the centre Stuff very kind and efficient 
486594,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, Everything was perfect from being allowed to check in early on the day of arrival to late check out on the day of departure The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly I loved the fact that once you get to your room there is a free phone for your use while you are in Milan with free internet and calls to Italy and the UK and it works all over the city So you can use google maps to find the best route to get where your going Overall I would rate them a 10 10

486596,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, They had a wonderful new service and handed us a cell phone to use during our stay free of charge even international Our rental car broke down and the staff assisted us in contacting the rental company Truly proffessional Was a lovely stay And breakfast was very good too 
486597,Antares Hotel Rubens, No coffee making facility Breakfast start too late 07 00 for business people needing to leave early, Excellent Breakfast I liked the possibility to make one s own juice Fruits vegetables at hand very practical and healthy I liked the bathtube with jacuzzi Perfect make up mirror Internet was quick 
486598,Antares Hotel Rubens, Didn t like the location Although it seems to be central the shops restaurant nearby are not that worth to see explore , Breakfast was very very good the staff was very helpful and kind as well 
486599,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, The staff and the supervisor were MOST accommodating We had some issues with our rental and our rooms electricity went out BUT the staff completely was on top of it and fixed the problem instantly You are never guaranteed a perfect experience anywhere but this hotel made sure the glitches were fixed Would stay there again and recommend this hotel Great restaurants within walking distance as well 
486600,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, If you are travelling to Milan this is the place to stay A comfortable and affordable 4 star hotel just a one minute walk to the subway and a 10 minute walk to one of the main shopping districts Marghera They are dog friendly and they provide parking so you can leave your car and visit Milan on foot The immediate area offers small shops and street food Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful a full buffet with flaky croissants excellent selection of coldcuts and cheese and scrambled eggs and bacon Very highly recommend the Antares Rubens for anyone visiting Milan 
486601,Antares Hotel Rubens, No negatives, Fabulous staff Massimo helping with our luggage Micaela and Roberto in the breakfast room We booked a superior room and it was at the back of the hotel very spacious and quiet Nothing was too much trouble for the staff My husband went down to organise an iron and ironing board and they delivered it to our room quicker than he returned from Reception Great location 10mins walk to great restaurants Casa Lucia and Centenove to name just 2 Almost forgot the free parking on site Fabulous thank you Antares Rubens

486603,Antares Hotel Rubens, The first room we got was noisy from the street and the toilet was dirty Have to say it was cleaned quickly Second night we got a room from the other side of the hotel which was perfect , Located nicely minutes away from the metro 8 stops and you re in the Duomo Big plus if you have a car as there is free parking
486604,Antares Hotel Rubens, There was nothing overly bad or that I did not like about this hotel slightly odd decor in the room with a light up shower head but if anything this added to the experience , Very close to a metro station which is really easy to get to the centre equally only a short walk from the theatre which has streets of places to eat night life around it Huge choice of breakfast and always loads of staff at reception breakfast so always some one to help 
486605,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, Would recommend this accommodation to Milan visitors Breakfast selection very good Room was clean comfortable Staff were lovely and assisted in every way Close to catching a bus and Metro to everywhere 
486606,Antares Hotel Rubens, Pets cannot enter the breakfast restaurant but this is OK Power outlets for charging are limited , Fee for pets and car parking are free Close to San Siro and the ring road View from the breakfast restaurant Bathtub with bubbles from the bottom Bathroom amenities Porter at the entrance 
486607,Antares Hotel Rubens, Breakfast ok not 4 but OK Parking crowded and with small parking slots but they try to offer you what s best Bathroom need more attention to details some cracks on the walls old bathtub , Great location at 5 min from metro station Gambara by walking Carrefour market also at 5 minutes Nice furniture and decoration inside Breakfast ok not 4 but OK Interesting view from the 5th floor during breakfast Air condition not noisy and discreet French and English TV channels 
486608,Antares Hotel Rubens, They seem not to have time to attend to you Didn t really understand your questions before reacting or answering , They had an iron and ironing board available 
486609,Antares Hotel Rubens, Quite a dated hotel which adds a bit of 80s charm but needs an update, Great old place friendly staff ice tea in reception and fruit blender WAFFLE MAKER at breakfast Close to metro for easy journey into centre of Milan
486610,Antares Hotel Rubens, Only minor the bathroom for instance could use some finetuning on its cranes etc , Walking distance from the subway free parking nice view during breakfeast Friendly staff Good price quality
486611,Antares Hotel Rubens, Book a taxi was the worst mistake and what gave to hotel a bad rating on my behalf What possessed the concierge to charge me 5 euro to book a taxi book , Very comfortable
486612,Antares Hotel Rubens, No covered smoking area breakfast variation some renovated rooms and some not We got old ones Rooms not as in the booking images, Room space staff cleanliness
486613,Antares Hotel Rubens, The tray where the tea coffee and sugar etc is stored was not cleaned properly , The beds were very comfortable and there was no smell of dust in the room at all Room was spacious bathroom was lovely Close to metro Staff were lovely Dinner in the restaurant was excellent Can t wait to come back 
486614,Antares Hotel Rubens, Only two free power outlets in the room outside the bathroom and both are somewhat inconveniently located Bought a splitter from the supermarket for 2 50 A couple of very minor instances where the staff could be considered rude Asked for early breakfast for the departure day not at reception though was told it s OK but the next morning had to wait till normal starting time On Sunday morning it took quite a while to refill the scrambled eggs and bacon at breakfast , Staff was generally extremely polite and helpful Room decor and stylish bathroom excellent shower Free parking was immediately arranged even when the parking lot was full Excellent and varied breakfast Close to metro for easy access to central Milan Quite easy to drive to and from Supermarket in the same block A number of good restaurants within walking distance depending on your standards of good of course Value for money 
486615,Antares Hotel Rubens, Keys are too old style and heavy probably done on purpose not to bring them with you outside the hotel Even though this detail could be improved , Super classic style hotel Room not big but quite comfortable Top notch breakfast Great Wi Fi 
486616,Antares Hotel Rubens, Nothing comes to mind , Very friendly old school polite staff Generous breakfast included in the price Short walk to 2 underground stations Easy 20 minute walk to San Siro stadium Lots of shops etc around the hotel Free wi fi Complimentary juice water in lobby of hotel
486617,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, We went for a San Siro event so it was very handy to walk to and from the venue and not bother driving or taking the public transport through the crowd The rooms are a charming 19th century kitsch with a super hi tec bathroom where it takes time to figure out how to turn on the tap And it s very clean comfortable and spacy The breakfast is served at the rooftop glass covered terace most lovely although I would have prefered some open space to have a smoke with my morning coffee The staff were all most charming as usual overly clumsily polite and most helpful 
486618,Antares Hotel Rubens, The don t disturb button was not working I reported twice but no one cared less There are problems with the treadmill in the fitness room nothing was done The lobby restaurant had nothing besides wine of course When we arrived we were tired and starving but not everything on menu could be offered not even pasta bolognese Then the 5th floor restaurant has a great view but it did not open for dinner strange , The Reception was good Especially Mr Massimo Very helpful 
486619,Antares Hotel Rubens, The room was very small not enough electrical plugs breakfast was ok but nothing special The price was high for the accommodation and location , The staff was nice
486620,Antares Hotel Rubens, The fitness rea They say they have a Fitness area but that s just a small room with an old bike cross trainer and one of these old multi use machine, The breakfast Its serve on the 5th floor with nice views The bathroom was quite big especially the shower that is always good
486621,Antares Hotel Rubens, The covers on the bed the toilet the door to the bathroom were weird design choices , The location the staff the climatisation in the room the wi fi the pancake machine at breakfast
486622,Antares Hotel Rubens, The parking was sometimes overloaded One gentlemen at the desk was very rude and shouted back when late at night he was requested to assist in showing the location of the parking He said he didn t care for the consequences and reviews Go and complain to whoever you want That s not quality service in my opinion , Location parking value
486623,Antares Hotel Rubens,No Negative, All was excellent friendly personnel clean room properly working amenities carefully thought and well prepared brekfast the room was ready immediately on arrival before the mandatory check in time
486624,Antares Hotel Rubens, The room they gave us first was old furnitured and was not like the ones in the pictures It was like a 2 star hotel room Then we requested to change our room and they showed us another room which was only slightly better The rooms like this should not be priced this much There was even no complimentary bottle of water in the price Not good value for money , Location is ok bit you still have to take a cab or train to go the center Breakfast Free parking and free wifi were good 
486625,Antares Hotel Rubens, Price was high for the size of room we got and there was a lot of noise from passing trams on the road below late into the night , Hotel was clean and tidy and in a good part of the city

486628,Antares Hotel Rubens, Front desk was a bit messy , Staff was friendly Breakfast was really cool with a great view over Milan and I loved the Pancake Machine it made pancakes right in front of your eyes 
486629,Antares Hotel Rubens, Lack of power outlets in the rooms there were only 3 and they were in awkward locations , They were very accommodating to our three dogs and no extra pet fees The breakfast is very good but go early because they don t seem too concerned with replenishing the food after 1000 The renovated rooms were very comfortable and modern the new showers are great The park right next to the hotel was super convenient for the dogs Wifi worked well in the rooms 
486630,Antares Hotel Rubens, Quite small standard room Very small parking facilities we have had the problem to find the place but I have to underline tha the staff was very helpful in this situation Breakfasts are till 11 00 am but when we came the range of food was very limited , Very friendly and nice staff Very convinient location 5 min to the metro station Nice restaurants in 10 min walking distance 
486631,Antares Hotel Rubens, Rooms are small and the hotel is far from the center even though there is a metro station at 5 minute distance The quality and position of the hotel does not justify the price , Internet worked well and the breakfast is very rich 
486632,Antares Hotel Rubens, Noise from the road despite being on the top floor Breakfast experience would improve if a self service coffee tea machine were installed , Friendly staff with a very personal approach Comfortable Location Car park
