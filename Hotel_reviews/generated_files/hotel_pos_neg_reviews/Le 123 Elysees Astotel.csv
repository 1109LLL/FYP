41648,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, The location was a little remote but close enough to a metro stop to get around easily enough , I arrived early and even though my room wasn t ready yet the staff made us feel welcome and got us settled for breakfast We don t speak French but their English was perfect so we understood each other perfectly Breakfast was ok but nothing too special compared to the Parisian cafes we enjoyed The shower had great hot water and pressure something we have learned is not common in Europe The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet 
41649,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Current GBP Euro exchange rate makes most of Europe feel expensive This hotel ended up at 200 per night without breakfast Probably British people s fault for voting for Brexit , Open buffet in afternoon evening was a nice touch 
41650,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Nothing, Promptly reply all my email cleanliness of room great location 5 minutes walk to Champs eleyees less 2 mins walk to metro station nearby hotel keep my luggage one week after I check in again Delicious breakfast 
41651,Le 123 Elysees Astotel,No Negative, The reception staff were friendly and delightful to offer help for example telling us the nearest currency exchange office and the routes to Versailles The location is good too many food places around it including Starbucks and Paul 2 minutes walk to Metro 9 and only 10 minutes walk to Champs Elysees

41654,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Small room but this is normal for Paris The room is very clean nicely decorated and equipped with all necessary facilities , Great location 5 mins walk from the Elysees A lot of good restaurants nearby The staff is friendly and helpful Good breakfast the free bar with snacks and soft drinks is available until 2 a m The free minibar in the room is replenished every day I would definitely like to come back again 
41655,Le 123 Elysees Astotel,No Negative, Remarquable hotel Great location staff very professional and friendly so friendly that my mom asked for a vase and they gave it Mini bar in the room for free Open bar daily till 2 am Close to everything I recommend it definitely and i would def come back 
41656,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Only one elevator, Excellent location near arc rhe triumph Very good restaurants aside Metro 3 min walk High floor quiet and with balcony whichis small just for standing Free refreshments from 12am to midnight also available at all astotal location
41657,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, The duvet was a little too warm for the season so slept on top of it , Fantastic central location next to metro station Very friendly and helpful staff Spacious room with large TV and wonderful bathroom Free food and drink in the bar all day and evening Complimentary mini bar Great breakfast Highly recommended 
41658,Le 123 Elysees Astotel,No Negative, The rooms were immaculate upon arrival and the staff were appeared very happy friendly and helpful both front of house and cleaning maintenence Luggage storage before check in and after check out was simple and very quick 
41659,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Shower head too low for me to fit under my only possible complaint apart from the lift being broken one evening soon fixed though , Excellent staff nice free snacks available very large bed Good location for Champs Elysee as well 
41660,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, nothing, I felt like i am the princess of the hotel All the staff was so friendly and helpful Location is the best in Paris I will definetely come to this hotel again 
41661,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, We would not usually have a problem with the breakfast times but on this occasion we had an early flight back and the bar area was not open until 7am That said the hotel staff did actually sort fresh coffee for us ahead of time and we did end up getting something to eat after all So even the slight negative ended up being a positive , The hotel is very well located with the Champs Elysees just a short stroll along Ave Franklin D Roosevelt to all the sights We found all of the staff to be most helpful and we couldn t fault our room with the rate charged real value for money Although the Hotel does not provide alcohol the rooms are equipped with a mini fridge for which we just stored our own supply without paying over the odds What more do you need 
41662,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, The overall experience was fantastic there could be more warm options for breakfast particularly to cater for vegetarians or non pork eaters however this is only a slight set back given that there are plenty of cold food choices , I have stayed in many hotels in Paris and not one has been as wonderful as this one The location is ideal for any traveller taxi s costing no more than 5 12 to go around to the most famous spots in Paris On entering the hotel you are greeted by wonderful beaming faces of staff who clearly love their job You can feel their warmth and gratitude towards each guest Everything is explained to you and they provide you with a care package to help you when getting around Paris equipped with a map of the city the metro map and a personal conversation to help you make the most of your time in the city The best part of the care package never feel hungry again The hotel is part of a group of hotels which all work together to provide you an open bar of food and drinks all around the city You can stop into any hotel and flash the special card and be led to a bar full of treats and drinks to enjoy at your hearts desire The rooms are gorgeous quirky enough without being over powering The beds are huge and this is a definite plus as my partner is a very tall man he didn t suffer from his usual feet hanging off the end of the bed The balconies in the room are a sweet little touch esprcially for those travelling in the warmer months The cleaning staff are amazing and so attentive most could speak fluent English too and were well equipped to answer all questions as perfectly as front of house I have travelled the world staying in some of the top hotels in different countries and none have come close to the attentiveness of this one The small treats thaybthey give you every evening as well as a handout with the next day s forecast is such a nice touch The M Ms and macaroons that greet you as you enter your room on first arrival really do sweeten the whole deal It was my boyfriends 25th birthday and the staff spoiled him with kind words and a bottle of champagne too 
41663,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Air conditioning was not working Its fine at this time of the year however opening window meant it was quite loud on account of traffic people cars etc , Free wi fi location and most importantly friendly staff who spoke english
41664,Le 123 Elysees Astotel, Room was a little on the noisy side We had a room with a view of a street corner I understand Paris is a busy city and there will be noise One evening at about 3am there was a man yelling for what seemed to be close to an hour My husband didn t hear a thing but it woke me up Other than that the hotel was great ,No Positive
