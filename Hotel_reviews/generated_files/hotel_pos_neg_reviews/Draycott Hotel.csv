124529,Draycott Hotel, Not sure if one can hear the upsatirs neighbours but it was not a problem for me on the top floor , The hotel is centrally located yet it is on a quiet side street By London starndards the single room was not too small other hotels would make a very stuffed double out of it It included all of the essentials and the bathroom was large and very clean 
124530,Draycott Hotel, It s an old fashion hotel a little dirty in the common parts , Location superb in one of London nicest areas The little hotel offers support at any time and this is very reassuring when travelling alone
124531,Draycott Hotel, Elegant gracious comfortable, It s an elegant warm and welcoming place in an elegant residential part of London that is five minutes from Sloane Square and the King s Road They upgraded me to a remarkably large beautifully furnished room with a gas fireplace Staff is lovely and low key It has some wonderfully old fashioned touches separate hot and cold taps in the bathroom sink for example but a perfectly modern shower but is extremely comfortable Like having a house in Belgravia 
124532,Draycott Hotel, There are few faults worth mentioning about the Draycott It is a shame however that tea and coffee facilities are not available in room That would be a nice touch and is expected these days Somehow the availability of these in the drawing room at 4pm is not quite the same as having your own , Draycott is a small hotel which prides itself on possessing unique qualities of the British nation many now past It is fusty a little tired and not at all modern but it has a charm which many visitors find attractive It has a loyal following and is in a good location the staff are universally friendly and obliging and they seem to know who you are A wonderful feature is the access to the traditional garden square which is available and you do not even need to cross the street to access it 
124533,Draycott Hotel, No tea or coffee making facility Some of fixtures shabby considering cost of room , The property was ideally placed for our visit to the Chelsea Flower Show Staff were friendly and helpful Hotel itself quiet and peaceful despite being so close to shops bars restaurants 
124534,Draycott Hotel, Very minor areas for improvements my room is probably ready for a bit of a decorating refresh it shows some signs of stays by many happy guests , I have stayed at the Draycott previously and their warm welcome and attention to your comfort continues to be outstanding I was in London for business and to attend the Chelsea Flower Show and their location is perfect for both They are easy walking distance to the flower show and the tube station is even closer The rooms are comfortable and always stocked with books to read as a bookseller I deeply appreciate this and the food was well done Chelsea and Sloane Square are wonderful neighborhoods for shopping and dining and beautifully decorated with flowers this week in May 
124535,Draycott Hotel, Difficult to get luggage into hotel and to rooms as no bellhop and steep steps at entrance Extremely slow elevators, Brilliant location Lovely breakfast Beautiful bedrooms
124536,Draycott Hotel, the bathrooms although nice and very clean could use a bit of maintenance , Excellent location feels at home in a quiet street at the end of your day Loved the entourage and the charming small shops just nearby a bakery a coffee shop etc The staff is amazing helpful and ready to assist at anytime my stay got better when my room was upgraded thanks to Carina at reception who is very professional and extremely efficient I thank them all again 
124537,Draycott Hotel, My room was around 8 square meters more of a baby room heated hot air coming out of a very loud air conditioner for 200 pounds in a 5 star hotel that is ridiculous I thought that at that price breakfast was included h las they needed an extra 20 pounds This room is attenant to one of the suites for children or personnel giving it to an adult customer should not be allowed ,No Positive
124538,Draycott Hotel, Nothing , The staff are outstanding many having been there for years which is always a good sign The peace of the hotel belies its position just off the Kings Road 
124539,Draycott Hotel, the bathroom was a bit small for me and the decoration with quiet a lot of items demands a top notch dust cleaning which was not the case in my room , we can t find a more british place to stay in London this is a real pleasure to get this the crown or Scherlock holmes ambiance with this guest house spirit i will return My room was very big with a coach and a lounge area in front of a fireplace Excellent 
124540,Draycott Hotel, Our room was under the ground I dont like to look up to see the street I wish I had another room , I liked the location charming with the little park in the backyard Very friendly and relaxed atmosphere 
124541,Draycott Hotel, Just a small thing but the staff member who showed me to the room gave me an erroneous wi fi code and the newspaper I ordered was not delivered to the room in the morning , Very friendly boutique hotel with well equipped room despite its small size 
124542,Draycott Hotel, There is simply nothing I did not like , The hotel is like home from home I felt instantly at home with its great drawing room its sofas the view over the garden the choice of decoration I appreciated the little things like tea and biscuits 3 4 champagne from 6 7 hot chocolate after 9 Staff was most attentive and polite always with a smile My room was spacious well furnished the bed comfortable the pillows soft The bathroom was extremely clean and looked brand new with proper power shower soft towels and nice toiletries The room had airconditioning which was handy The location could not be better with Peter Jones just around the corner and a 5 min walk to Sloane Sq station Just loved it 
124543,Draycott Hotel, The fact that the lift doesn t serve the top floor was slightly awkward with my far too heavy as usual suitcase but staff were there to help me when I needed it so it really wasn t a big deal , Everyone was very welcoming and helpful The hotel also had many nice touches to make one feel very much at home A lot of thought has gone into making this a more personal experience than you normally find in so many London hotels Bravo 
124544,Draycott Hotel, Small room but very convenient facilities You ned to use stairs to go to the rooms elevator too small , Staff always very friendly cleanliness attention to details Definitely a place to stay with the family 
124545,Draycott Hotel, The bathroom was spacious with quality fittings but lacked a surface for a toiletry and make up bag so we had to put them on top of the cistern The small shelf over the basin was full of hotel toiletries It would also benefit from better lighting over the mirror and a makeup shaving mirror There was nowhere in the bedroom to do make up The rainfall shower head was lovely but a hand held attachment is preferred by some people and would be a good addition , The Draycott is a very well located hotel and has a delightful personal and comfortable ambience It felt rather like visiting a beautiful home with butler service and the guest name card in the brass holder on the door added to that impression Although some guests may prefer anonymity and I m sure that would be respected Staff were always available pleasant and helpful The room was very spacious and comfortable and overlooked Cadogan garden which guests have access to from the hotel sitting room It was a wood panelled room which would multitask for small meetings rather than a pretty room but very comfortable nevertheless I was too busy on this trip to enjoy a walk in the gardens of their complimentary tea and champagne but I will be back 
124546,Draycott Hotel, Staff could have tried a bit harder to be friendly and personable , Location was central but very quiet and the room was extremely spacious and comfortable 
124547,Draycott Hotel, Wifi was a bit dodgy at times but mostly fine , Lovely staff amazing location cute single rooms for reasonable money wonderful afternoon champagne and evening hot chocolate and great little park in back 
124548,Draycott Hotel, Single rooms are very small but well furnished the lift was out of order during my stay but about to be fixed , Great service friendly staff Less than 5 minutes walk from Sloane Square tube station and some lovely restaurants Champagne on arrival at 6pm much appreciated The hotel is tucked away in a quiet area 
124549,Draycott Hotel, When I arrived with my friend she was told that she had a room upgrade and I didn t get one so I felt a bit disappointed She was given a nice room with a king size bed I had a single room and it was incredibly small There was also a lot of noise from an AC unit that one of the other guest had switched on the entire night as my room faced into the back of the building I asked the night porter for ear plugs but he hadn t any I paid for the continental breakfast and it was a bit sparse of choice with basic cereals The coffee was also like rocket fuel , Staff lovely Free glass of champagne in evening and free hot chocolate last thing at night Rooms very traditional and cosy Fantastic selection of books available for guests to read I could have stayed for days to get through them all Just round the corner from the King s Road 
124550,Draycott Hotel, Single bedroom although stylish was somewhat basic expensive cost does not equate to what a guest gets for their money, Excellent staff Facilities very good 
124551,Draycott Hotel, I guess a wash basin with a mixer will be more comfortable than the 2 hot cold taps As an engineer I understand the classical look of the 2 taps but it was not easy to deal with I would keep the classical look in the main bedroom and go a bit more modern in the bathroom , The bed was extra comfort But the greatest thing was the service quality of all staff members My wife and my little boy were feeling very pleased and relaxed Also the location is perfect Away from the busy oxford street but 100m away from a nicer shopping and walking area around the Sloan square 
124552,Draycott Hotel, I was unable to get the shower to turn on so ended up having a shallow bath instead There was very little room between the toilet handle and the wall radiator making it awkward when using the flush , The staff were very friendly and professional They sorted out an issue with my credit card which was greatly appreciated Champagne at 6p m The location is fantastic on a quiet street but only moments away from all the shops and restaurants in the area Also only a few minutes to where I was working 
124553,Draycott Hotel, Disappointed English full breakfast never choose it again Bathroom don t has necessaries such as toothbrush toothpaste comb etc I asked the staff why they just answered yes bathroom not contains these things Ok I can t believe it s a five star hotel , good location
124554,Draycott Hotel, Extremely small single room with no veiw from the window This should be reflected in the description more accurately , Friendly staff a beautiful old building with a cosy sitting room and a nice garden fantastic location 
124555,Draycott Hotel, This just wasn t the hotel for me Quite simply I didn t want to spend any time there Certainly not what I expect of a five star hotel I suppose one person s old world charm is another person s needs substantial upgrade and for me the Draycott falls into the latter category ,No Positive
124556,Draycott Hotel, Nothing , There was absolutely nothing about our short stay that was less than perfect from the initial greeting to the time of leaving the place is a gem Our room Olivier was superb with it s own direct access to the beautiful gardens 
124557,Draycott Hotel,No Negative, Upgraded to a larger room which was a pleasant surprise after a long flight Nice added touch of tea at 4pm and champagne at 6pm each day in the drawing room beautiful gardens behind the hotel Enjoyed the bath tub in the bathroom Room service was prompt with a nice menu I enjoyed my stay at The Draycott recommend to others 
124558,Draycott Hotel, Nothing, Everything Beautiful decor Wonderful helpful staff My room was tiny but comfortable Multiple power adapters inside the desk drawer a very handy touch Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice Great location few minutes walk to underground This is the best hotel of the many in which I have stayed in London
124559,Draycott Hotel, The bathroom was a bit dated Minibar prices were astronomical so I didn t use anything from it The TV could only be viewed from the bed BUT the room definitely had character No iron in the room , The staff are exceptionally helpful and good It has the feel of a house rather than a hotel The bed was very comfortable and my request for a quiet room was met 
124560,Draycott Hotel, No tea coffee making facilities in room and mini bar not housed in a fridge , Location and staff great Complimentary glass of champagne a nice touch
124561,Draycott Hotel, Single rooms the size of a prison cell Virtually no natural daylight or view No tea making facilities No refrigerator for the mini bar Very poor TV reception Decor shabby and tired Chairs in the dining room stained Electric plug sockets in the bedroom most at floor level Dirty laundry on the landings , Fantastic location Excellent staff and cooked breakfasts 
124562,Draycott Hotel,No Negative, I have been staying at your hotel for years both as a business and leisure traveler It feels like a second home and the staff feel like family the good kind I love The Draycott 
124563,Draycott Hotel,No Negative, Upgraded to huge room Booking com got me great deal much less than half price before upgrade so vfm outstanding Lounge bar area especially comfortable 
124564,Draycott Hotel, Tea coffee making facilities in the room would have made it just perfect , The room was very comfortable with a bed you could just sink into Free champagne 6pm each day hot chocolate and cookies at bedtime lovely touches Honesty bar facility was good Staff couldn t do enough to help very friendly attentive and helpful 
124565,Draycott Hotel, I would prefer to have Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room only so that I wouldn t have to trouble the staff , It was exquisite So well furnished beautiful decor large homely rooms The staff were all so very attentive with a kind demeanor and very good manners Nothing was too much trouble Location was perfect the room was quiet bed large and comfortable The added luxury of the offer of Champagne in the evening and hot choc during the night was a delight although I didn t partake on this visit it was lovely to know it was an option Breakfast delivered to my room was one of the best I have had in any hotel All fresh delicious generous quantities perfectly presented I will definitely stay again 
124566,Draycott Hotel, There are no bad points to mention , This hotel is a luxury home from home The rooms are homely and comfortable The lounge is welcoming with hot chocolate and biscuits available after a long day out 
124567,Draycott Hotel, Booked a superior double but the room we were allocated in the basement did not match images on website and room d cor was tired, Friendly staff wonderful location
124568,Draycott Hotel, A wee bit pricey for a hotel that does not have a dining room of any kind , A hotel of great charm in a splendidly handy location for transport and shopping 
124569,Draycott Hotel, The lift is tiny No car park and recommend you book a taxi as hard to get one on the street , Excellent location very friendly and efficient staff old fashioned service in a good way it was like staying in somebody s beautiful private home
