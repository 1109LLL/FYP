70751,Hotel La Place, My room was so small that the head and foot and side of the bed were up against the wall and at 5 feet 7 inches my feet hit the wall on the other end of the bed The bathroom was so small and cramped that you had to tight squeeze yourself between the wall and sink to get to the toilet and when you were on the toilet the sink was in your chest You couldn t stand in front of the toilet at all and it was very uncomfortable and inconvenient For the high rate it was poor value The breakfast was good but the wait staff frequently messes up orders or ignored people or forgot what they were going to get people , Good access to tube Could leave luggage there after check out 
70752,Hotel La Place, Very hot in my room Noise from outside , You have all you can need clean quiet hotel breakfast included Very close to undergrounds museum shops bars I would come back to this hotel Perfect for a few days in London 
70753,Hotel La Place, No place in the bathroom The room itself was tiny and the juice at breakfast is strait out of the box , City centre and clean I am not sure why they clain 4 but the place is decent Regent park nearby is a good point if you like to run Loads of restaurants and oxford street are at walking distance 
70754,Hotel La Place, The a c unit kept the room very chilly and when it was off and it got stuffy there was no way to open the window for fresh air The fridge was plugged in but was not cold , It is in a great location minutes from Baker Street tube station Regent s Park and a lot of great restaurants and shops Staffers were all very nice and helpful 
70755,Hotel La Place, Uncomfortable beds with completely worn out matresses The pillows were stiff AC didn t work even after it was left on for hours at the suggested temperature , Great location with a decent breakfast 
70756,Hotel La Place, Nothing, The hotel is very close to an underground station giving great access and with an array of different types of restaurants within a few minutes walk made it ideal also being on a quite road means you get a good nights sleep in the comfortable bed and being able to sit downstairs and relax with a drink is an added bonus but above all the staff were great pleasant and knowledgeable
70757,Hotel La Place, Sound proofing was awful No water in the room Website said there was 24 hour room service but when I got there they told me they could only give me a cheese sandwich or crisps, The location was good Seemed clean Staff were friendly
70758,Hotel La Place, English breakfast with no baked beans was under standard from my childhood memory or porridge Traditional building some parts of it could do with a face lift Family room 2 beds, Location superb for our needs Staff extremely friendly Breakfast cooked on demand Super fresh Calm at night
70759,Hotel La Place, My executive single room was smaller than those shown in the pictures Only one of the three occasional lamps was working the trouser press was not working and taking up some of the limited floor space was a large minibar which was empty and disconnected Not the best breakfasts for this level of hotels , Despite the lax maintenance the small team of staff were friendly welcoming and caring Quiet location 
70760,Hotel La Place, Like all London hotels in this price range the building and rooms are very old On the good side the bathroom was new and the lobby nice , Friendly staff and breakfast crew 
70761,Hotel La Place, The hotel was a little warm inside That s personal preference though , Perfect location for central sigh seeing etc The hotel is located on a really quiet street you won t have any issues with noise or drunk people 
70762,Hotel La Place, The breakfast contained boiled mushrooms which I do not like and the radiators were difficult to control, Staff friendly and great value for money for central London bed was comfortable and good wifi
70763,Hotel La Place, breakdast service very slow on borh days we were there i had eaten my breakfast before my husbands had arrived even though they were more or less the same Hotel a little grubby in places i e net curtains at windows dirty marks on walls little things i know but The hotel does have 4 diamonds, The bed was very comfortable and clean the room had air conditioning staff were very helpful
70764,Hotel La Place,No Negative, Very good location close to Madame Tussauds and Baker Street underground station All the staff are very friendly and helpful and breakfast is delicious 
70765,Hotel La Place, overpriced Decor is very tired with cheap plastic flowers Bathroom clean but the finish was very poor and showed evidence of poor workmanship This is really a 1 or 2 star hotel It was very overpriced The breakfast was poor The only thing I could eat was toast The whole hotel needs a makeover to justify the price they are charging, Staff were very friendly and location very good
70766,Hotel La Place, For what we paid and the location I wouldn t expect more, Very good position excellent breakfast and all the staff most friendly and helpful also a quiet location despite being near busy roads
70767,Hotel La Place, room was tiny Wifi a bit on and off difficult I know given the age of the building No offer to help with bags , Staff were friendly and very helpful Location was great Touches such as the crockery that was made in the UK and the teapot in the room were great Good having an iron in the room
70768,Hotel La Place, Thing walls matters if you have someone noisy in the next room no hair dryer that s quite strange for 4 star hotel no even a socket in the bathroom , Great location friendly staff good selection of tea coffee extras elevator in case you have heavy bags 2 options for single room the one deluxe single has quite decent size and double bed

70771,Hotel La Place, The internet connection was horrible in my room although it was just fine in the corridor OK for checking mail or texting definitely not good enough for skyping The hotel looks old on the inside and the bath tub was moldy , Great personnel very friendly and flexible Filling breakfasts Clean and neat public spaces 
70772,Hotel La Place, The breakfast was poor Very greasy sausage was disgusting Had to ask for milk for tea Toast never came Wanted to take my wife a bacon sandwich to the room and had to pay again for for room service which I though was a bit OTT for a small hotel , Location was great for Regents Park Room was comfortable but way too hot 
70773,Hotel La Place, The english breakfast the scrambled egg was not very eatable nor did the wholeness of that plate give you any apitite So please improve on this area and you will have a great complete Hotel stay , Great location Sweet and caring staff always with a smile The room was nice bright
70774,Hotel La Place, Sausages weren t very nice Better quality tea in room eg twinings would be good as this is a lively English hotel, The hotel was friendly but the breakfast staff didn t get the orders correct twice I think if you could offer other coffees eg Cappuccino it latte that would be a huge pls
70775,Hotel La Place, Went to the Bathroom before bed Turned off light an hour later the loud fan was still running spoke to reception they were not interested said it would eventually go off Ordered breakfast for 7 30 went down it was not ready It arrived at 7 50 which was when I had to leave , Location was handy for Lords where I was watching cricket Room was adequate if a little tired value could have been good 
70776,Hotel La Place, I was extremely disappointed with the whole experience Room was not ready breakfast was poor and the standard of the hotel was dated and smelt musty, Nothing
70777,Hotel La Place, They do not serve evening meals but as there are pleanty of restaurants cafes and pubs within 2 3 minutes walk it wasn t really a problem, Easy to reach from Oxford Street and 5 minutes walk from Baker Street underground station Bed very comfortable Room small as most london hotels but everything I needed was there including coffee making facilities Breakfast was excellent The staff are very helpful nothing is too much trouble This was my second visit and I will definitely stay again
70778,Hotel La Place, My room was very hot not with central heating but being south facing and 3rd floor But there was a modern aircon unit which worked well so they were doing all they could , The staff were excellent very friendly And the owner was around Loved the d cor very individual 24 hr bar

70781,Hotel La Place, This isn t a 4 star hotel and was very disappointed The fact that pre payment is taken doesn t give you an opportunity to negotiate on the quality of the hotel and stay ,No Positive
70782,Hotel La Place, Service was bad hotel out of date asked for a king size bed got 2 bed pulled together breakfast service was bad landed walking out hotel staff did not know what they were doing used wash room down stairs it smelled disgusting paint on walls were dirty, Nothing to right home a bout will make a point of not staying there again
70783,Hotel La Place, The internet connection was intermittent however a collegue staying at a 5 star hotel had the same problem the breakfast room was a bit small and only just adequate , Very comfortable rooms extremely helpful staff and an excellent location for my needs 
70784,Hotel La Place, Ensuite door hinge broken window looks as never been painted floor grout missing Advert photo makes it appear the bedroom is larger than it is , Staff were pleasant and bed was comfortable Breakfast would give 7 out of 10 
70785,Hotel La Place, Crappy heating band aid repairs getting locked in room due to sticky door lock empty bar fridge only budweiser and fosters as beer selection at lobby bar , Location is good roof didnt leak there were no earthquakes and the walls held there were no mosquitoes or other airborne pests there is no airport noise
70786,Hotel La Place, The room was far too hot even though the radiator wasn t on the window was sealed and couldn t be opened There was air con in the room but who expects to have to use it in February The bed was uncomfortably hard , The staff without exception were helpful and friendly The location is fantastic just a few minutes walk from Regent s Park or Marylebone High Street and down to Oxford Street The hotel feels safe and is in a quiet street 
70787,Hotel La Place,No Negative, We loved the feel of the family run cosy hotel which was walking distance to Oxford Street a variety of restaurants and a 10 minute walk to the Bond Street underground We felt safe at all times and loved the ambiance of the surrounding area 
70788,Hotel La Place, The room needed some maintenance as there were loose fittings in the bathroom and the walls were stained and in need of a refurb , This was a cosy but basic hotel in a good location The staff were very welcoming and friendly and the breakfast was good 
70789,Hotel La Place, Breakfast was very bad and well below expected standard for a four star hotel with low quality ingredients which friendly serving staff could not make up for , Staff were friendly and helpful Room was comfortable Location close to Marylebone High St was good
70790,Hotel La Place, Hotel is overall very outdated Curtains in my room were very dirty Furniture seems to be falling apart some pieces the desk in my room for example were patched up to stay together Room needs fresh paint There were dirt marks on the walls , Very helpful friendly and professional staff Clean sheets and towels Very comfortable bed Location couldn t be better for what I needed 
70791,Hotel La Place, A little expensive but that s London for you Ideal location for Marylebone but oh isn t London the most crowded city Breakfast room was tiny and claustrophobic Breakfast food was good and freshly cooked but staff were disorganised Seemed that one girl was new so the other was in a panic helping her The tables weren t being cleared and tidied properly or quickly enough so people came down to a messy table , Friendly welcome and kindly offered to look after our luggage when we left Beautiful roomy bedroom Junior Suite excellent by London standards Lots of eateries nearby some quite reasonably priced The room was quiet and comfortable 
70792,Hotel La Place, No beans on the cooked breakfast sorry you did ask , Liked the location liked the staff who were very very pleasant and informative of what to do where to go how to get there etc 
70793,Hotel La Place, to tiny for a 4 should be perfect you cannot invite someone to meetin this hotel for business, perfect breakfast nice staff serving it goog for tourist
70794,Hotel La Place, Really bad facilities bathroom cleaning elevator noise isolation breakfast area everything is old tired Water taps are so bad that you need a strong male hand to open close it Cleaning unwashed glass non replaced sheet even no Don t bother to put on the door Elevator for 2 people without bags and to 3rd floor only then coil stairs to 4th floor Breakfast area is so small and tight that you even think if you want to go to breakfast Flapping doors locks, Bed good Breakfast fair Location ok quiet and clean street although not quite close to the tourist sights Staff ok

70796,Hotel La Place, Not a thing , Only just back so thoughts are tired to say the least I absolutely loved this little place Everyone and I mean everyone there had a huge smile on their face every time I saw them All very very friendly dining room and reception both extremely likeable In my opinion I thought Geoffrey apols for any misspelling the best night staff person I ve ever met in any hotel anywhere I was a tour leader around the world for 15 years always a huge smile on his face and welcoming to everyone We got on like a house on fire it helped by me having visited his country several times admittedly before he was born I hope to go back sometime he s a huge asset to the hotel One of my favourite hotels in 60 odd years of travel Many many thanks all Small is definitely best
