483059,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The location not close to the city center at all It takes around 30 minutes walking and when choosing to go by subway we had to exchange 2 subways and walk an extra 8 minutes Not sure why it has city center in the name There was no option to get single beds in a standard double room which was inconvenient for us not being couples Also when it came to a second blanket there was this extra blanket in the closet the smelled pretty bad and was kind of itchy I would suggest cleaning those once in a while We also had a triple room and that was the exact same size as the double room but with one extra bed that s just blocking the couch And if you calculate the price per person it more expensive than the price per person in a double room Another minus for us was the bathroom You get either extremely hot or extremely cold water in the shower It takes a while to get it to be a nice medium Also the appliances there need some renewing There was something below the sink that was just about to fall off , The double room was pretty large and the bed comfy enough for a hotel bed 
483060,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The shower wasn t good and the bathroom was quite dated very dated The decor itself I d say was bordering on dated too but that is of course down to opinion , Excellent value for money The location looks wise can feel a little dingy but it s not too bad and there are several excellent chinese restaurants around if you fancy a change in cuisine It s still walkable to the city centre but after a long day sightseeing and shopping in Milan even I a keen walker rather than public transport driving didn t fancy the walk back Howevere public transport was excellent The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was perfectly airconditioned large and had a very comfy bed 
483061,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, On booking time wifi available in hotel rooms but no wifi working in room my room no was 122 and 123 I already complained to the hotel manager she said me I will check I complained on reception many time and request for room changing but she said wifi will work an hour pls wait but still not ok, Breakfast is good
483062,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, No breakfast included despite the considerable cost Pillows could have been more comfortable but they still did the job , Great room nice view everything very clean and up to standards Nice location too in Chinatown but also close to a lot of bars restaurants and cafes Walking distance to the subway station too 
483063,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The hotel is located in the Chinese town and away from the city center The stuff is not cheerful and the triple room is small as they put an extra bed in the double room also the hotel had a bad smell , The breakfast is good
483064,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Room Ac was not working after complaining staff refused to repair or change my room citing hotel fully booked though rooms were available Instead they provided small fan in the room i didnt wish to escalate further as it was my last day of the trip and didnt want it to end on bad notes The hotel should take guest complaint seriously because we dont stay free there we pay and stay so they dont do any favour by providing room to us I had paid for a Ac room n not room with fan Staff dont take guest complaints seriously , Nice big rooms good location
483065,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, With the exception of one great lady at the front desk the rest of staff we encountered varied from cordial to cold The food at dinner was big disappointment as was the SLOW service 4 couple sat there waiting for someone to take our orders My lasagna was cold Hotel is in middle of China town and can be loud at night In fact for over 2 hours a group of Chinese folks were yelling at each other across from our window making it impossible to sleep We were in Italy for 3 weeks and our bed at this hotel was by far least comfortable We read all the great reviews and is why we grabbed the room It is a good value considering overall , We liked the room in general The hotel has cool features in lobby etc 
483066,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center,No Negative, After running around all day returning to the hotel was easy and for each day we were in time for happy hour very enjoyable lounge drinks and food plus a big courtyard for those that wanted fresh air The hotel staff was extremely helpful in guiding us to all tourist spots and local restaurants We had dinner in the hotel one evening and it was outstanding Plus a terrific breakfast to start the day Thanks for taking care of us our raves about this beautiful hotel will continue for a long time The photos on the website are very accurate Thanks again 
483067,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Nothing, For the price I was a little worried what to expect but pleasantly surprised Lovely and clean great breakfast too Had a view over the courtyard garden although surrounded by high rise buildings it was lovely and quiet 
483068,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Wifi was very unstable and slow Electric sockets were in inconvenient locations The bathroom smelt a little bit like dirt , Great service staff was very kind Property was calm and near the center area of Milan 
483069,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Had dinner in the bar and the salmon was undercooked fortunately we noticed and didn t finish our honeymoon with food poisoning , Room was lovely and spacious and very comfortable staff were helpful and very polite 
483070,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Milano traffic is just TERRIBLE Dont use your car unless you really need to No complaints about the hotel If I go to Milano ever again I ll stay al LEONARDO again , Room great size Lots of space Such room even deserves additonal rest room but it was still great experience as it was Breakfest good enough No complaints Parking on location Great 
483071,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Nothing worth mentioning , The double room was huge with a very nice seating area This was a free upgrade to our booking Hotel staff really helpful Area is not that great for Milano China Town but proximity to Corso Como 10 min walk made it ideal for a base camp Great value for money 
483072,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, I m being very picky but one guy on reception was rude Didn t really want to help us when we asked about places to go etc , The hotel was in a very good location The rooms are a nice size and bed is very big and comfy Bathroom is also nice value for money for how close you are to the many wonderful things in Milan e g the Duomo which is around a 25 minute walk 
483073,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Wi fi we had to constantly log in Once logged in it was great But if you are not active on your device then you lose connection If you are expecting a message or just want to check email several times then you have to go through the log in process every time Very annoying The cost of parking is very high There is a fridge in the room but it is for their mini bar no microwave no desk if you need to work on laptop The bathroom is not 4 quality , Breakfast was great with amazing scrambled eggs and bacon along with all the usual breads cheeses etc The hotel is located in Chinatown so you if you like Asian food and grocery then this is perfect for you The bed was huge and we had a room for three so they had an extra bed in the room which we didn t need the extra bed took up most of the living space 
483074,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, We didn t like that we had to walk a lot around to findo stg to go to the centre and we didn t find always taxi The water was running out of the bath But when we said to the cleaning lady she called immediately somebody to fix it , We liked the bed the 2 big red chairs and the room generally 
483075,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The room lacked cleanliness you could see dust under the bed The facilities could be updated , The breakfast was nice the staff was attentive I liked the complimentary coffee and tea in the room as well as a bottle of water on our welcome day 
483076,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The room booked voucher said it was with breakfast but when we wanted to have our first day breakfast they said it was not included I checked the voucher inside my mobile and booking com app stated with breakfast Asked the girl at the reception counter and she checked inside the system only She did not even care to look at my phone which shows that the room was booked with breakfast So please check with the hotel first and foremost if you have booked your room even if it said that it was with breakfast meal , Very near to groceries McDonalds and ChinaTown 30mins walk to Duomo and Milano Centrale 
483077,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, I am pleased I took a taxi from the station which cost me 10 Euros Take care not to be ripped off with stories of a set charge being requested My driver wanted 15 Euros The area that the hotel is in gives little comfort to single travellers who may use tram 10 and then walk which was one suggestion made I admit I made a mistake in selecting this location from Central Station , The hotel satisfied my need for accommodation and breakfast at a reasonable price I stayed only one night before continuing my journey 
483078,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Beds were a wee bit firm for our liking and only one spare pillow and a single bath towel both rectified on asking Bar was a little pricey but I guess you expect that in a hotel Lots of good Chinese restaurants in immediate area but you will need to go further if you want Italian The immediate area is a bit of a rabbit warren and easy to get lost in the streets make sure you have a map either electronic or paper , Very nice interior clean modern and dare I say classy Not far on foot from the city centre 
483079,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center,No Negative, My stay in Leonardo hotel milan was wonderfull The staff is great and everything is thought out to the smallest detail I did not realized that I was in hotel For bussines or leisure Leonardo is right choice 
483080,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, They really need to increase the heating in winter We booked a premium room for three It was actually a bedroom for two with a small bed in the middle of the bedroom for that third guest , In general good but it could improve Food from the bar was better than we could have imagined 
483081,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, One of the barstaff Alberto was inconsistent in his drink sizes and he did not give us the same snacks that were provided when other staff were working My friend left a Rewards Card in the room after checkout when he tried to get it returned he was told that the card was not found in the room , The decor and styling of the rooms Easy to get in to see the sights of Milan on a tram Felt to be in a safe location and very easy to get a taxi The rooms were clean and is one of the few hotels that actually abide by the environmental standards and don t take every used towel they left the towels I hung up on the hook as per the enviro guidelines and I think that this is a great thing 
483082,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Parking facilities require agility of spiderman to get in Only for VERY experienced drivers with small cars One way driveway catering for both up and down traffic with no visibility and twisting round a corner Waiting to see what insurance company says about the accident we had due to oncoming car forcing us into a wall then refusing to apologise and driving off Specifically requested twin room in comments as booking com showed available but booking processed as a double My friend and I were initially told this was not possible to complete as housekeeping staff had gone home Upon further pleading they changed our room so why the initial fuss , Good value hotel for seeing Milan city centre Not far from public transport and easy trip to San Siro stadium for AC Milan match Decent buffet breakfast and friendly staff 
483083,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Uninspiring view from the window Wine glass left unwashed Cupboard door refuses to close The dinner choice at the the Bistro is pathetic Long walk to the Metro , Good breakfast friendly staff 
483084,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Our room could have done with redecoration but it was still very clean and everything worked well, Helpful and friendly staff very good cleaning staff good comfortable bed neat and tidy rooms excellent bar
483085,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center,No Negative, We were offered an upgrade to a bigger room that is sitiuated on the street side of the hotel and we got a water cooker with tea and coffee pads bed was comfortable 
483086,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Wi if didn t work very well Cot springs were broken so had to put mattress on floor because maintenance personnel had already gone home A c was not available so had to keep window open and there was a lot of noise from people pulling their suitcases over rough surfaces and talking loudly outside , Staff were helpful Room was comfortable 
483087,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The room smelled like cigarette smoke I thought I had a non smoking room but may not have specified so make sure you double check It was okay for us since it was one night but if you re sensitive to smoke you may want to make sure you re getting a non smoking room , Large comfortable room and bathroom Parking is available at the site in a parking garage next to the hotel There is public transit nearby with the Metro about a 10 minute walk from the hotel The staff was very helpful 
483088,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Please add extra pillows and keep the heating down , Great and helpful staff the room was very well appointed and quite comfortable Fantastic choice for breakfast
483089,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Wifi only can be connected on the first day Beds are combined with two single bed so there is a gap in the middle which is not very comfortable , Location is good only 10 mins from city center Lots of restaurants and markets around Facilities are very good except Wifi 
483090,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, If staff could speak some English that would be even better , The room was very spacious and high class The location happened to be in Milan s China Town Lots of Chinese restaurants were nearby We had dinner in different restaurant every night very enjoying and all in walking distance 
483091,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, 30 minute walk to Duomo far NOT City Centre Empty graffiti stores surrounding at night eerie feeling Very tiny room impossible to walk with added bed Old facilities and carpet smell in the hallway Shower have to step in the bathtub and unstable half door so water will leak Two different elevator access from ground to room and parking to ground inconvenient , Close to Chinatown and Asian markets Water and apples in lobby at night English speaking receptionist Toiletries provided with more available on request Parking available below 17 CHF 24 Hours 
483092,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, staff s behaviour was not respectfully and they didn t try their best to solve the problems The internet connection via WiFi was awfull Laundry service was disappointed as they mentioned that on Sunday they could not give any service and from Saturday till Monday afternoon I had to wait for a simple laundry The price for this level of service and facility is too much ,No Positive
483093,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, One of the young members of staff did not have a good attitude to a mature couple like us trying to work out how to obtain the internet on my mobile More patience required , The beds were extremely comfortable and the room had everything we required 
483094,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, I thought breakfast was included in tbe price so disappointed when it wasn t just 1 bottle of water in each room nothing for night 2 , Location was pretty good we left a bag in the bar one night but didnt miss it until morning it had been found and handed to reception all happy Close to tram but difficult to get a map of trams
483095,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The hotel is a bit far from most of the main sights For summer tourists in hot Milan it was less convenient and a bit exhausting sometimes On our last day One of the receptionists didn t give us a full information about traveling somewhere and this mistake had cost us lots of money if we would have known we wouldn t have chosen to travel to the place , The hotel itself is very nice and the rooms are very spacious 
483096,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The central air conditioning doesn t really cut it during the summer months And beware the 12 breakfast if it s not included in your rate ,No Positive

483098,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Beds weren t that comfortable some staff weren t helpful when asking for directions to attractions in Milan Along with not getting a coffee when asked for one at breakfast , Good selection for breakfast spacious rooms and close to tram lines for easy access around the city 
483099,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The shower was leaking to the floor as it was located in a bath with not a wide enough glass to cover the water spray Also beware that the hotel has smoking floors that have a very heavy smoke smell in the rooms and halls so this can be a problem for non smokers in high seasons Luckily we had a chance to change for non smoking floor room so this didn t get a problem for us , A good hotel with very helpful reception staff who quickly changed smoking floor room to non smoking one for us and even printed an updated flight booking upon request The room included everything necessary The breakfast for additional 12 per person was good The price was impressive making this hotel a great value for money 
483100,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The window handles were not functioning so not possible to open the windows In the evening it was a bit of noise coming from the hotel terrace There is indeed a big construction site behind the hotel but it didn t really bother me , The hotel is located in China town so plenty of Asian food around It is also close to the city center The interior is wonderful the room was lovely and wifi worked perfectly Breakfast was excellent 
483101,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Poor bar service Some reception and bar staff very abrupt when dealing with problems poor customer service Informed of poor flow to shower in room Was trickle at best and was informed that it would be looked at No better the next day and nobody confirmed whether it had actually been looked at or not Expensive laundry service , Location
483102,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, would have liked a kettle in the room , the rooms were very clean and comfortable the bed was large and very comfy nice carpeted floor made it luxurious excellent location in Chinatown very central 
483103,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The breakfast was ok but could be better given the charge rate , This hotel is beautiful just like the pictures the bed and pillows are comfy the hotel is very affordable given the location in China town it s very safe and has a mini bar and safety deposit box it s a very nice hotel the staff are ok not rude or overly polite just ok
483104,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, SPA BATH DIDN T WORK BAD SERVICE IN THE BAR AND RESTAURANT TOOK 15 MINUTES TO GET A DRINK DESPITE THERE BEING PLENTY OF STAFF AND NO CUSTOMERS , NICE ROOM CLEAN AND TIDY PLENTY OF SPACE HOTEL IN GENERAL WAS PLEASANT GOOD BREAKFAST GOOD WAITERS AT BREAKFAST 
483105,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, The breakfast is not included is the price of the room But in Milano life is easy a lot f small bakeries bars serving breakfast for reasonable prices, Great room air conditioned clean bathroom nice staff good location
483106,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, Not the most modern hotel but it is in very very good condition Also it is in the milanese China Town actually but we did not have any problem with that , Very well preserved Appreciated that items usually forgotten like toothpaste or shaving kit were available Staff were very friendly Close to restaurants

483116,Leonardo Hotel Milan City Center, I expect a 4 star hotel to change bed linen daily or at least on alternate days In my 3 nights stay I basically had to sleep in wrinkled damp sheets , Great location in an interesting neighborhood Chinatown which offers excellent options for eating out Park Sempione and the castle Sforza are just 5 mins walk away To go any further tram 12 10 stop right on a parallel street and take you to the historic center Also being a bit away from tram tracks offers quietness and good rest at night
