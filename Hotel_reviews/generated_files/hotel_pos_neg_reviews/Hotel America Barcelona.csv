422945,Hotel America Barcelona, A balcony would have made it perfect but the terrace more than made up for it , Loved the pool and terrace Quiet hotel with all the comforts Friendly staff
422946,Hotel America Barcelona, double rooms whose number is terminated to 10 in each floor is not recommended the room is so small that can not accomodate even a third person kid and also with no exterior window , location
422947,Hotel America Barcelona, The wall and chairs are not painted properly You could hear everyone and the rooms weren t sound proof at all The rooms were small and did not have pictures to describe the types of rooms nor did they have the size The pictures weren t as reality at all they put pictures of what they want us to see Don t book here because the price is way too high for the rooms , Some of the furniture was modern and great There was a pool at the roof that was cool 
422948,Hotel America Barcelona, The gym could have more machines , The staff were great the room was a bit small and cramped But the area was fabulous and everything we needed was accessible 
422949,Hotel America Barcelona, Our safe jammed everyday that would be the only negative I have , Had the most enjoyable stay here at Hotel America bed was mega comfy shower fantastic very powerful room cleaned every day with fresh towels I was very impressed Loved the roof terrace pool great way to unwind after a day sightseeing The staff were fantastic Would highly recommend this hotel 
422950,Hotel America Barcelona,No Negative, Beautiful reception area and rooftop terrace Very nice and accommodating staff Great location and very comfortable beds Great showers and air conditioning too 
422951,Hotel America Barcelona, I was only really staying here as my friends were in a hotel along the road and I couldn t get in there it was a very comfy hotel but i thought it was a bit expensive for what it was , Was upgraded for free when i arrived as I had booked an indoor courtyard facing room My Room was a good size with comfy bed and good Air con There was a capsule cappuccino maker in room which was welcomed Breakfast was a good spread of meats cheeses cereals etc and good coffee located in a quiet neighbourhood convenient for metro and lots of restaurants nearby I had forgotten my toothbrush and they gave me a free one and toothpaste at reception 
422952,Hotel America Barcelona, The coffee and water complimentary should be provided everyday of stay Not just the first day of stay This is very disappointing , The room and bathroom interiors are excellent The hotel is well located in the center of attractions restaurants and metro station within 5 10 minutes walking distance The roof top pool is a nice venue to relax and hang out 
422953,Hotel America Barcelona, I ve never been in a more expensive and worse room 150 euro per night the room like tomb without windows and light size less than 10 m2 in fact I spend time out of hotel as I couldn t sleep in so claustrophobic space Shame I do not recommend it anyone Dzezmir,No Positive
422954,Hotel America Barcelona, Double bed is maybe little small It s better option to chose two connected single bed , Clean rooms with kind and friendly staff on great location There is lots of stores bars restourants and 24h works supermarkets around Centar of town is on walking distance 15min and everything other is close up so you don t need car it is quite easy to travel around with metros and busses Absolutely recommendation very good value for money 
422955,Hotel America Barcelona, Our room had a moldy smell to it We asked to switch rooms however the hotel was full so it wasn t possible We were able to open the window to air it our a bit which seemed to help , Room was modern clean and comfortable The rooftop had a spectacular view and the pool was amazing Easy check in and check out 
422956,Hotel America Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent location and restaurants and bars not in a busy area which was great as Barcelonais very busy Staff were amazing couldn t do enough for you
422957,Hotel America Barcelona, There was an issue of bad smell coming from the bathroom maybe the airlock eater seal where the trap way is is malfunctioning or something This was very noticeable but housekeeping elected to ignore it all along , Good room good location helpful staff 
422958,Hotel America Barcelona, I wish breakfast room service was available but the roof terrace breakfast was far better than imagined , Very comfy beds staff were lovely and so helpful Welcome drink of juice or water on arrival and luggage bought up to our rooms Roof terrace was beautiful and we had the roof terrace breakfast on our last day for my birthday which was AMAZING bottle of bubbly meats cheeses croissants juice tea and coffee a box of chocolates and loads more Gorgeous roof terrace which was taken full advantage of in the sun Hotel wasn t busy or crowded at all and was peaceful Location was also fantastic with several restaurants just around the corner Overall fabulous stay would stay again highly recommend 
422959,Hotel America Barcelona, Nothing , Lovely hotel rooms clean and bed really comfortable staff friendly and helpful Good location within easy walking distance of Placa de Catalunya 
422960,Hotel America Barcelona,No Negative, Excellent service and friendly staff at a nice hotel for the price Very convenient transport links and the surrounding area was lovely with plenty of nice bars and restaurants The roof top terrace and pool where great 
422961,Hotel America Barcelona, the rooms weren t particularly sound proofed so you could audibly hear guests slamming their doors and talking loudly in the halls In our first room we could hear a lot of noise from an adjacent building which wasn t great That said the staff very readily moved us to a quieter room and were very accommodating The second night they didn t change the towels or refresh the soap after cleaning the room , The room was clean and they were able to easily accommodate a room change due to noise from an adjacent building It was also nice to have the little refreshment bar at the entrance of the hotel where you could have a quick glass of water or juice and grab an apple The nespresso in the room was nice but they could provide more than just three complementary capsules Or maybe a kettle for tea Pillows were particularly comfy The location was perfect for us and we could walk to practically everywhere 
422962,Hotel America Barcelona, Nothing , Very good hotel Excellent and friendly staff Very good breakfast Clean inside and out Great location We will return and recommend others

422964,Hotel America Barcelona,No Negative, More than helpful staff Our room was cleaned and refreshed daily Everything worked in the room the beds were comfortable and the shower was great 
422965,Hotel America Barcelona, It seems there is only one trash can in the washing room If there is another one a small one is enough in bed room I think it will be more convenient , I love this hotel very much Casa Mila Casa Batllo and many high rated restaurants are within walk distance Pharmacy bakery bookstore and small supermarket are in neighbourhood The room is clean and quiet The cosy bed makes me sleep well Every morning I could open the curtain and overlook the lovely crossroad from my window The staff are all very friendly Every morning when I went out for sightseeing they would deliver greetings which made me stay in good mood especially Francis at front desk I hope I spell his name correctly He is very friendly patient and responsible The trip in Barcelona was great and the hotel made the trip greater 
422966,Hotel America Barcelona, The only thing I would say that would be better would be if the Restaurant was open for Lunch Dinner aswell as Breakfast although room service was available throughout the day it would have been nice to sit in for Dinner some nights , Had a brilliant time in Barcelona staying at Hotel America the staff are so friendly and are good for recommending places to eat and how to get to different places The room was immaculate on arrival and every day when it was made up Unfortunately the roof top pool and bar area weren t open as it doesn t open til May however it was lovely and can imagine it to be very popular in hotter months

422969,Hotel America Barcelona, The fact that the bathroom was a part of the room , The person on the counter Francis is the best we have ever seen in any hotel He went out of his way to help us We were looking for halal food and he helped us find a place that was very close Overall he was extremely helpful
