477006,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The lifts are an issue long wait one lift doesn t seem to collect just drives up to floor 13 leaving one lift operational returning guests and still hasn t improved Chipped glasses in breakfast dining room a lot in fact staff just responded we know oh dear , Excellent location wonderful roof terrace for drinks rooms very nice and staff courteous Room service speedy and reception staff for visitor questions helpful 
477007,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The rooftop terrace was booked for private function Hotel guests are not allowed to use Should keep an area open for guest Very annoying Also no where does it say that the spa facilities are for adults only and it is only open in the evening , The decor was very nice The rooftop is very nice
477008,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, parking was full but alternative has been provided 25 30euro per day whole hotel is very dark elevators are really horribly slow plan some waiting time room rather small, Rooftop Bar Close by metro clean breakfast good
477009,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The bed although very comfortable had bed bugs I had bites all over my body and did my friend in another room , I liked the reception area the most 
477010,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Pillows to small definetely room for improvement Also the scrambled eggs for breakfast was not good too moist and first day mixed with overcooked boiled eggs centers so was partly blue colour should switch to fried eggs instead but rest of the breakfast was good this just gave it a major letdown , Location from trainstation was very good 3 km walk to Duomo so location also good very clean very nice rooftop bar with excellent view
477011,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The parking reservations is too much as it is 30 per night It is also hard to get to the parking lot You must pass 3 gates to reach the parking lot witch is in the basement Important thing that might happend just for me they didn t change my blanket when they were cleaning my room Also room service give them 1hr to bring what you asked for, Nice location and the designe of the hotel is unique
477012,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable with nice linen The pillows were great and there was an ability to change if you did not like what was on the bed The room was a disabled room with NO shower over the bath but a walk in shower Everything was new and spotlessly clean The staff was professional and very helpful 
477013,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I didn t like that upon check out they told me next time to book directly with them instead of booking com don t bite the hand that feeds you I don t like this would actually prevent me from going back as I happen to be a big fan of booking com, I stay in hotels in milano all the time this was first time here and I think it s great nice roof terrace super close to central station and walking distance to the city Rooms are comfortable and modern
477014,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, There was nothing we did not like about this hotel , After spending 3 nights doubled over in our previous accommodation see my review of Hintown Navigli lovers it was a great relief to enter our room here It was clean spacious well appointed and very quiet and comfortable The staff were very pleasant We did not try the restaurant but the rooftop bar is lovely Centrale train station is nearby so the hotel is handy to the Metro system and Malpensa airport We found a great cafe and our favourite Milano ristorante within easy walking distance Would definitely stay here again 
477015,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing that I didn t like about the hotel , The room has a modern design and the beds are comfortable The bathroom is spacious Very near to central station not difficult to find the hotel 
477016,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Room switches were brown on brown and a bit confusing And the people from outside the hotel accessing the roof bar clogged the lifts in the evening, Comfortable bed Excellent staff particularly in the restaurant
477017,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Not as close to the center of town as I thought we might be No shuttle to the airport, Nice room modern hotel location good for central train station
477018,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, This was my second trip to LaGare I love the hotel it s super stylish and located a very short walk to central station which makes it a great base to explore both the city via the metro and northern Italy such as Lake Como via trains which take around 45 minutes to get up to the lakes The hotel oozes style there is a fantastic lounge area where you can relax enjoy a coffee beer or wine and watch the day go by Both rooms have been excellent super comfy beds and incredibly clean en suite bathrooms 
477019,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I found the lighting a little awkward to work out at first as there are numerous switches in the rooms However this was quickly resolved by room service , The customer service from staff at all levels was excellent as was their knowledge of various languages and the local area They offered help with directions with translation flight check in and transport to the airport which saved me time and money My room was spacious and ready on arrival which was earlier than the regular check in time The food was very good and room service efficient The cafe terrace and rooftop bar and restaurant fabulous I had an amazing time and highly recommend LaGare for business or leisure Thank you LaGare I will not hesitate to visit you again 
477020,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Bacon and eggs should be included in the free breakfast But apart from that great place to stay , The rooms were nice and cool on an extremely hot European heatwave The showers has everything to make us feel fresh and comfortable again before we went downstairs and had a delicious dinner and some red wine Upstairs we sipped on some drinks and felt the cool breeze before heading back down to our extremely comfortable bed and watched some movies We were so tired from our trip and we didn t need to go anywhere for a great night it has it all 
477021,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The air conditioning never got the room temperature low enough We brought this to the staffs attention but it wasn t improved There wasn t enough power points in the room , Had a good shower and comfortable bed and pillows About one block from Central Railway Nice bar on rooftop and a wellness centre with Turkish bath and spa 
477022,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Staff could have been more helpful Italian people in general not friendly it seems it s all about the money and nothing else, Bed very comfy room on the small side breakfast ok not much choice staff a bit surly and things seem to go in one ear and out the other reception staff not overly knowledgeable some much better than others one who almost shrugged shoulders when asked about which tram to get
477023,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The air condition was not powerfull enough resulting in room temperature was too high , contemporary design international standard roof top terrace good restaurant public spaces
477024,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Very small room booked 1 king bed while they gave me 2 singles didn t change the room when I requested while by booking was confirmed for 1 king bed breakfast is very basic anf if you need omelette you have to pay extra while your room rate have breakfast included already you have to pay extra if you want to use the gym I didn t like it at all doesn t worth to pay this price for such hotel , Actually nothing
477025,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Airconditioner in room was extremely noisy and we couldn t find a way to turn it off So sleeping wasn t as easy as it should have been , Location to centrale station and restaurants around excellent choices and quality 
477026,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Wish I could ve had a bath instead of shower apparently there are not many rooms with baths but that s just a personal preference, The lights on the windows were such fun Really good value Wish I d had time to get to the Spa It sounded amazing
477027,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Having to pay an extra 15 euros for breakfast when the room rate was very high already annoyed me but facilities and location very good , 5 minute walk from central station easy to find lovely rooms very posh 
477028,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The rooftop bar area was not in service Has great views though , Staff at reception were very welcoming and super helpful Went out of their way to assist me with a problem I was having Room was very clean Beautifully fitted out and relaxing bar area Great service and interesting selection of books and mags to while away the time 
477029,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, breakfast should be improved and car park is expensive Also there was dust in the room so I got allergic , design of the hotel is nice and it seems to be quite new 
477030,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Extremely modern clean and comfortable room Amazing on the roof bar with a stunning view over the while City Milano Centrale Main Station is just around the Corner 
477031,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, The staff were wonderfully accommodating polite just very very nice The room was comfortable and well appointed Very clean and quiet Lovely view we were on 9th floor perfect stay 
477032,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Allergy causing products Square toilet seats Too few elevators , Hotel is near station has excellent gluten free breakfast BUT they spray rooms with perfume that gave me sore throats puffy eyes and coughs Our dry cleaning was washed instead of dry cleaned ruined by hot irons the hotel sain we d have to pay 1500 euros for a test to prove it wasn t their fault 
477033,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Complete lack of what should be classified as standard room equipment for a four star hotel No iron in the rooms or tea and coffee facilities Justified by saying it is a health and safety issue However feel free to pay extortionate rates for the hotel to iron it for you Hotels who have had this issue in the past have circumvented these non stringent and non enforced rules by opening a dedicated ironing room for guests If a hotel is rated four star I expect four star standards On another note guests have to also pay for leisure facilities which is restricted to two hours Would I return to this establishment NEVER , Location is good for transport from central station
477034,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The staff of the hotel was quite unfriendly Tourists seem to be present an unpleasant effort A warm welcome was missing especially at breakfast and on the rooftop bar Even if the hotel is only in the middle price segment it was very dissapointing for us ,No Positive
477035,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The corridors are dark and the heavy mocquette does not help the moving of suitcases around The entrance does not have an easy access as there are quite few steps to do The neighbouroud around the Stazione Centrale at night is not the best Must avoid walking alone around it , The hotel is 2 years old so pretty new plus its location near Stazione Centrale is important for access to Trains or buses to airports 
477036,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Away from the historic center and the area is not extraordinary Attention book your seats to enjoy the roof top bar The place is full of Milanese youth from outside , 5 10 min walking from the train station and metro Relaxing in the spa after visiting museum and shopping in the quadrilatero de oro Aperetivo time on the roof top bar and enjoying the view on bosco verticale and diamond towers Closed by the Excelsior Hotel and his cigar lounge
477037,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The TV and remote were very complicated to use and many of the channels were not available That is my only complaint , The amazing ceiling shower head and shower and bathroom Walking distance to the train station and restaurants and to Corso Buenos Aires Modern hotel impeccably maintained very nice and professional staff Love how all the windows light up at night 
477038,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, IT TAKES BIT LONG TIME FOR LIFT NEAR RECETION , FANTISTIC HOTEL FOR EITHER PURPOSE OF TRIP CLEAN COMFORTABLE AND CONVENIENT SERVICE GOOD AND STAFF COURTEOUS AND AVAIBLE ALWAYS ON REQUEST BREADFAST AND DINNER IN HOTEL DELICIOUS RELLY ENJOY STAYING HERE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO COME IN FUTURE AGAIN 
477039,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, nothing, Central location at down town Staff very kind rooms clean and comfortable All public traffic to be reached by walking within 5 minutes lots of good restaurants around late check out without surcharge 
477040,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Booked this hotel partly because of the rooftop bar However it was still closed during our stay It would have been helpful is Booking com was able to inform us of this beforehand Maybe a sidenote on the property s page , Nice modern interiors Reception staff were very warm and helpful Room was clean with an amazing view of the city Bathroom was clean with nice modern toilet fixtures 
477041,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, For a price of 160 euro per night I would expect to have at least Spa 15 euro additionally included if not also breakfast 12 if you add it when check in The tv did not work and had to be fixed by a technician Further I would expect more languages than Italian and English The rooftop bar was super crowded by people not living in the hotel and therefore uncomfortable to stay at Further the room Temperature was difficult to manage as it got super warm without air conditioning There is music in the halls which we also heard when within our room having the door closed ,No Positive
477042,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Quite a trek to the city centre through an interesting neighbourhood Parking was difficult even when calling beforehand The terrace bar was meant to be open from 1st April yet wasn t when I visited at the end of April , The hotel was modern and comfortable 
477043,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The view was just ok we are in the city so not much to see , Beautiful hotel conveniently located right down the street from the main train station lovely d cor an awesome front desk staff who spoke English Nice spacious room with electric black out blinds large bathroom with great shower and comfy bed No complaints We will definitely stay there again when we are in Milan Numerous restaurants nearby when we returned from dinner one night we were amazed to see the exterior lighting on our building multi colored neon around every window stunning Loved the hotel 
477044,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Small room The hotel corridors are very dark and gloomy part of the modern design but very oppressive Dark walls dark carpets not much lighting The Skyline bar which looked attractive on the photos was closed the evening we were there The breakfast restaurant was quite small and was very crowded It was very hot and stuffy in there to the extent it made me feel sick and I had to leave The breakfast selection was poor few choices of cereal little fresh fruit and you had to pay 8 extra for a fresh omelette The pastries and cakes looked good but they aren t my breakfast preference , The location of the hotel was the main plus for us Close to Milan Central train station so only a few minutes from the centre of Milan by Metro but also convenient to get to airport next morning by train The room had a good modern bathroom and the room had modern smart d cor 
477045,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The room was slightly crammed but cosy , The room was great with a very comfortable bed The overall interior design of the hotel is splendid and there are ample facilities including a gym The colour lights on the exterior of the window also made gave the hotel an overall warm ambience The neighbourhood was also quiet and void of loud noises even in the weekend Yet the location is convenient to get to by metro and is a stone throw s from the train station I would highly recommend this hotel and say that it is well worth the money 
477046,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Elevators were the worst They are super slow and at any time there s elevator traffic you have to wait very long for it On Friday there was an event and it was impossible to use the elevator We opted for stairs several times We booked hotel partly because it has nice rooftop terrace After we couldn t get an elevator to go up there we had to take the stairs and discovered that it didn t work Nice view no bar though Breakfast only had 3 warm choices It s only a 4 star hotel I know but I have stayed at 4 star with far better breakfast variety , Hotel is new and very clean walkable distance to the city center Really liked the design and style of rooms and hotel overall Chic Nice new equipment in the small fitness area 
477047,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The price might be a bit high and this was our second time here We got a smaller room than before despite paying higher than before Plus we could not have a late checkout even though I requested when booking , The deco of the room
477048,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Information at reception about the terrace It s a beautiful terrace with a fabulous view didn t know what time it opens, Breakfast was very good Lots of choices
477049,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The coffee in the cafe by the lobby is weak and portion is small and the pool in the spa way too much chlorine we couldn t use it too bad as its beautiful functional pool spa other than that all is good ,No Positive
477050,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, It would have been nice to have had a kettle and tea making facilities in the room , Great location very close to central train station Friendly and helpful staff Nice lobby with bar area Very quiet and comfortable 
477051,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The room was small and the toilet was dirty when we got in Staff were ok but not the most helpful or friendly Not a great location it s more a business district near to the main station but not much going on around there They also gave us two single beds pushed together instead of the double we requested , Nice spa but costs 15 euros extra and we cold only use in after 5pm
477052,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Automatic shutter blinds blocked sunlight completely providing excellent sleep in exceptionally comfortable bed Check in staff were extremely helpfull
477053,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, You have to pay for the SPA Is this a private gym or something Ridiculous Oh and ridiculous price too Staff couldn t help much at not having an international adapter a day later we found one in the breakfast room finally 2 days later we could get one in our room , The light in the facade
477054,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The lights were a bit confusing but in a short time we found how to operate them, Luxury accommodations very helpful staff who spoke English a short walk to the train station electric shades to keep out light and city noise We arrived one evening and were surprised to see each of the rooms lit with multi colored neon lights it was a spectacular sight Loved this hotel one of our favorites on our recent trip to Italy 
477055,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, No tea coffee facility in the room which was a little disappointing , Great room very close to Central Station Beautiful restaurant Varied choice at breakfast Helpful staff On site spa is lovely be aware there is a charge to use it 
477056,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The room was a little smaller than I expected Air con fan a tad noisy , Very clean The Roof terrace is fantastic Nice light room on the tenth floor with floor to ceiling windows and view of the city Trams almost at the front door and train and metro station a very short walk Cafe prices reasonable Staff pleasant and offered good restaurant suggestion for Easter Sunday night and had the tv fixed same day I reported a problem
477057,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing Loved it , Loved the wellness Centre and fun little touches to the hotel such as the curtain lights Restaurant was delicious Bar had a beautiful view 
477058,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The selling points of the hotel were not as good as I could have hoped for Roof bar shut sunny and 24 degrees outside opens in May I clearly didn t spot that in the website Spa hotel not exactly a wellness centre that only opens in the evening no option of any treatments Clearly I didn t spot that on the website either A hotel more suited to business clients I feel , Hotel was in a good location Staff were very helpful Room was as described
477059,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, There needs to be more focus on hygiene bed pillow and blanket are not a good idea on white sheets hair alert Rooftop terrace was disappointing no service and mes left behind by other guests was not cleaned , Very nice hotel Elegant modern style without being too pretentious I loved the bicycle facility Staff is very friendly and helpful 
477060,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The reason I rated facilities low was because the air conditioning made a lot of noise and the worst part was that the staff said it was normal I would also think that the room was far too small , Hotel is rather new and facilities are rather new 
477061,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, My small niggle could have done with a small teapot at breakfast rather than fishing around in a cup for an errant teabag otherwise range quality of breakfast available is very good , Clean bright and well appointed room V good bathroom shower room Well serviced Reception staff helpful and friendly Friendly staff in bistro good spot for a relaxing glass of something cool after a hard day sightseeing Well placed for access to central station with its travel links train underground trams buses 
477062,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Complimentary bottle of water is free just only 1 bottle per stay That s strange Also no response to any of your advance requests neither through booking com nor email , Elegant decoration Clean and comfort 
477063,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Location is close to the main train station but nowhere close to major sites in the city More suitable for business travel , Loved the hotel the design and room Did not try the food but the coffee was decent Staff was very helpful and friendly 
477064,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, small room size hardly can move around can t add an extra bed The TV was hard to use since all in Italian not friendly to use, pleasant staff breakfast cleanliness close to central train station and close to restaurants 
477065,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I wish they would have had a concierge , The bathroom had a lot of room and had a walking closet which is an asset when you are staying 6 days with a partner 
477066,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast service is not good at all very narrow restaurand and only one side of it is used something is missing all the time and before service personal has noticed that you have to raise attention Furthermore personell is not friendly at all , Location of hotel is good close to main station Rooms and bath are allright Lobby is quite nice
477067,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, We found the food in the restaurant was a bit fussy overpriced and just ok It was a shame that there was no iron in the room as the cost to have garments ironed was very expensive and this should have been an additional facility available in the room We would also have used the spa much more if it was open in the morning We were also disappointed that the Terrace bar was not open as we would have spent more time in the hotel enjoying evening drinks , The room was lovely and very comfortable with good facilities and cleaned to an excellent standard each day The spa was great to relax in especially the hydra pool and Turkish baths We enjoyed sitting outside the hotel lobby bar with a glass of wine and the accompanying snacks were a lovely touch Breakfast was really tasty with a fabulous selection of fruits pastries hot food and breads 
477068,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The shower cabin may be more comfortable and big, The hotel and room are very clear modern and comfortable Personnel are very nice polite and helpful The location is perfect Walking distance to centrale stazione 
477069,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Location a ittle nearer to the central station would be perfect The long flight of stairs from the road level to the hotel entrance made it difficult to carry my luggage up and down The porter was however very helpful , Very comfortable and modern room and facilities Linen were superb Breakfast items were healthy and very fresh Service always with a smile The fine dining restaurant on level 4 was excellent and reasonably priced 
477070,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The spa is not very spacious and costs 15 per person for 2 hours extra The shower in the bathroom was annoying as the water pressure was very low and the plates that were on the shower floor shifted and tilted while stepping on them I was afraid that I might fall The light in the bathroom and room is not good for applying makeup Confusing lighting system in the room , The bar on the ground floor was good The rooms are spacious and have a good modern design The bathroom offers a good hair dryer The spa is nice and offers some relaxing things like a steam bath a salt grotto almost like a pool and a Finnish sauna the spa is not suitable for children 
477071,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Weird cracking noises emitting from somewhere at night time From minibar or ventilation only heard when its off Lack of or broken ventilation in bathroom No way to lock the bathroom , Beautiful
477072,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Can honestly say their wasn t anything I didn t like , Room was spotless couldn t of been in a more central location and the staff were so polite 
477073,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The entire hotel is Oversee in gaudy lights which flash into every room The lights in the rooms were incredibly hard to turn on kept losing power Room was small Hotel hallway was also very dark Asked for restaurant recommendations and sent me to overpriced tourist joint around the corner , Bed was comfy room was clean shower was good stsff was nice
477074,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, My booking being cancelled by someone and this made me very very cross as I had booked this hotel and trip to milan to get engaged to my girlfriend so WHY would I cancel it also I had used the hotel main website 3 days before to ask about getting airport travel costs but got no response to this at all and then went on trip advisor to see best way to get into city centre The first time we had breakfast at the hotel we hadnt finished our meal and they had the table cleared and that they just wanted us in and out to suit them Getting charged for the spa after getting a room up grade and not getting told on 2 different times that it would go on the bill at the end or that we would have to pay for it Getting first charged 120 euro and then 150 euro by hotel staff with out giving me a paper bill for the cost When i got the bill it was only meant to be 108 50 euro which was the 2 meant to be free spa times if we hadnt got the upgrade We would have only went once to the spa as it was 15 euro each city tax 40 euro and coke and crisps 8 50 no problem paying city tax and coke and crisps because this is what we had to pay and wanted , I liked the roller shutters to keep light out 
477075,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The garage is not suitable for the cars So I have to park near the hotel , The hotel is nice and clean Good beds small room Modern well designed and clean 
477076,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Staff especially in the restaurant could have been a little better trained even though they were helpful and attentive Lighting switches in the bedrooms were a little confusing, Black out blinds in bedrooms were excellent Bathrooms were excellent with great showers Staff friendly and very helpful Location great
477077,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Receptionist not helpful and gave wrong informations To enter the hotel there is a flight of stairs and no one to help us with our luggages This hotel is not suitable for people using wheelchair prams or those who have back problems , Location

477081,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Window frame illumination look a bit flashy Metallic furniture feel a bit too cool , Easy access both to Central station for traditional Duomo area and Gioia station for trendy Porta Galibaldi area Nice view from roof terrace Delicious breakfast 
477082,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, loose tile on the bathroom floor need a tad bit more range of hot food for breakfast room service 7 euros and it s not the same as what could get downstairs , location was so convenient breakfast was lovely staff were beyond friendly a whole pizza for 6 euros at the bar downstairs spa the ambience was beautiful junior suite room with to die for and the bathroom was so clean modern hotel

477084,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The rooms are small as well as the bathrooms There is a spa in the hotel but it is supposed to be paid separately The breakfast which normally costs 18 Euros is not worth half this price at least , The hotel is conveniently close to the Central Station 
477085,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The only negative we had were the lifts our room was on the 10th floor and the lifts seemed to be very slow and also quite small often full having to wait for the next lift , Location of the hotel feel and design of the hotel and rooms very modern and contemporary Friendly and helpful staff on hand 24 7 and the views from the rooms and rooftop bar

477089,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, That you couldn t use the wellness centre before 5 30pm , Restaurant was superb Food was excellent We also used the wellness centre Although this was additional cost it was well worth the money and we would use it again 
477090,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Housekeeping could be doing a better job with preparing the bed cleaning floor , Location is perfect near centrale and metro stations Breakfast was good spa very private and cosy imitating sky in the night makes you relax and forget all problems and enjoy the moment

477099,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Extremely creaky furniture and by that I mean that I could not sleep half the night it was constant noise and very loud Not sure what was wrong but it was weird Also the windows have led lights on them which stay on all night They change colour which makes for a pretty interesting effect I m sure unless you are trying to sleep in which case it is a lot less fascinating I have trouble sleeping as it is I was exhausted after a long day and with all the creaking and the light it was pretty horrible Finally the problem with the lights was solved by lowering the blinds But I don t particularly see the point of having led lighted windows at night if you re asleep you won t see them anyway It looks pretty from the outside of the hotel but I don t really care how it looks from the outside I m just trying to get a decent night s sleep Could not get the TV to work properly I gave up in the end All buttons for switching on lights are difficult and frustrating to manoeuvre Next door neighbours arrived late at night and were talking loudly I heard every word every door every blind being closed All in all I was pretty annoyed with the place Could only get a couple of hours of decent sleep They charge a fortune for any item that you may inadvertently open from the minibar like a packet of crisps or gummy bears or nuts They were left on the desk I assumed they came free as courtesy as it does in some hotels Just before opening the bag I saw the notice the packet of crisps v small was 4 euros Pretty pricey and no breakfast came with that deal Avoid you can find better I did , Good points Cleanliness v clean Location v well located next to the Stazione Centrale Good Wi Fi fast connection no problem Very friendly and helpful staff 
477100,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, more selection for breakfast service was a bit slow value for money wasn t great didn t live up to the standards of the Sofitel breakfasts, convenient location within walking distance from the train station friendly sincere and helpful staff and service top standing Sofitel service and comfort good size rooms that were clean and modern comfortable bed excellent price and value for money
477101,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing, When I realized this was centrally located in the business district rather than the historic district and how great this hotel was I just decided this was a day to be pampered 
477102,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The price , Comfy and the location is perfect I liked that we lived far from the duomo which was peaceful And the central station was very near to us
477103,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Terrace restaurant for lunch was not good Undercooked food and poor service Shower floor was loose tiles , Front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly 
477104,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Stay away from this place On my last trip to Milan attracted by the Sofitel brand I made the mistake of staying in this lousy hotel The hotel has a rooftop bar frequented by very unpleasant people who used to circulate drunk on the halls pressing all the elevator buttons when going away To complete the horror of those days I was robbed in the lobby by the time of check out someone stole my brown backpack with all my travel memories plus camera tablet etc I made a Denuncia di Furto at the police station in Linate Airport but the hotel refused to pay for any damages claiming that I did not have that brown backpack Lagare Hotel Milano Centrale is a real tourist trap It was the worst hotel I stayed in in 40 years of world travel If you think of going to Milan forget this option , Nothing 
477105,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, It would have been good to know that the terrace was closed but since we had the same view from the hotel it was more than ok , We were upgraded to a junior suit on the top floor and we re thrilled 
477106,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The standard bedding was a duvet which was far too warm for the season and for which no alternative is provided , We thoroughly enjoyed the common areas cleanliness and staff All exceeded expectations and the access to the main train station is excellent 
477107,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Elevator was slow for such an updated place , Beautifully decorated modern hotel Close to train station Breakfast had a good assortment Beds comfortable

477109,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The rooms aren t sound proof and you will hear all you neighbors The construction of the floor in the bathroom is not so good a lot of bacteria could live there No cattle in the room and if you want to have a coffee or tee you will pay 7 EUR for the room service It is too much , The staff was friendly and helpful The room is modern and comfortable with the nice view
477110,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The rooms are smaller than they appear on the site and you have to pay extra to use the pool and sauna area which doesn t have nearly enough chairs for all the people trying to relax there which seems over the top We got a great deal on this hotel so it wasn t a huge issue but I wouldn t pay full price for the rooms and amenities you get , Very comfy bed and really enjoyed the sauna area a lot despite the added charge Convenient location when arriving by train airport and easy enough to get to the city center by metro or walking 
477111,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The staff were super friendly and willing to put up with me speaking poor Italian at them including twittering on about tartaughe I asked for some recommendations for places to eat and things to see and they were able to offer great suggestions The whole hotel oozed style and everything was exceptionally good quality including the bed which meant I had a great night s sleep Location was perfect great to serve as a base for exploring the city Milano Centrale offers both trains to beautiful locations just outside Milan and the underground network to explore the city 
477112,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, This hotel was a huge disappointment It was the most expensive in a 6 week holiday all other hotels we stayed at were accurate to the description and room rate except this hotel It listed an outdoor terrace bar that gave great views of Milan sadly both nights we tried to get access it was closed for private functions we were told we could sit at the bar on 1 of the nights but would have to move when asked There was also another outdoor lobby bar which was also closed for a private function on 1 of the nights A swimming pool loungers etc was also listed but this was in fact a spa which cost E15 to enter When we spoke the manager Marco we were told this was a Booking com translation error he seemed unable to grasp that the facilities that they boasted were not actually available to their guests Marco did little to appease us except offer a free spa that we did not want ,No Positive
477113,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, No wardrobe in room Elevator was stuck 3 times and got locked in Too many floors 13 and elevator slow and not nice if you have height fobia or clostrofobia, Great lobby and roof bar
477114,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Some extra pillows and a bathrobe in the room would have been nice and it was quite expensive There aren t many good restaurants or bars in the immediate vicinity but the metro is 5 mins away , Nice clean modern hotel Rooms are an adequate size Breakfast options were grand and the terraces are nice to sit and enjoy a drink The hotel is a 5 min walk to the Central station 
477115,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The breakfast was a shambles Staff were overrun and struggling to cope There was no water coffee half of the food was finished and very slow to be replaced Location of things was a bit awkward and not explained to us There were 3 separate stations spread across the room so people were walking up and down the room constantly We noticed people were starting to complain so decided to leave and avoid the controversy This was a real let down for us considering we had to pay more to have the breakfast included , The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming Shout out to Luigi and Margarita who were very helpful with dinner recommendations and things to do and see 
477116,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The neon lights in the frame of each window is an odd touch, Staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable to a first time couple in Milan

477118,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, It wasn t in central Milan but we did select it for its proximity to the train , A very modern hotel that was incredibly convenient to the train station for our early morning departure to MXP 
477119,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Stairs up to main Lobby are difficult to navigate with cases if there is no assistance The room was a little pokey but sufficient for our purpose A sign at the railway station would be helpful for those arriving by train as to the direction of the hotel , From the moment we arrived and greeted by the bell boy who immediately took our cases into reception we felt this was a nice place to stay pleasant and helpful reception staff had us registered and in our room quickly The breakfast was a great choice of food pleasantly and efficiently served My request for help in checking a transfer with Emirates was handled with courtesy and efficiency and followed up by an email left in our room confirming all the details The room though small provided adequate space for a 2 night stay 
477120,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, There are not a lot of food options immediately near the property Additional hotel services were quite expensive The front desk claimed not to be able to loan me a clothes iron citing fire regulations even though I ve had them in many other rooms I ve stayed in while visiting Milan Instead they wanted to charge me 3 euro per article of clothing I wanted pressed , Very large room comfortable bed 
477121,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, small room poor facilities unable cancel unless paying full fee altough booked as free cancellaion promotes free bike but u need pay deposit euro 300 its not a problem if this is clearly stated when booking not worth money and not upto 4 stars, friendly staff good location standard accor quality

477123,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Lousy management badly staffed in security and doorman bell boy My bag was stolen from inside the lobby during check in as shown by camera I just was told to report to police so they claim from insurance Told to me by reception person the manager did not bother to even talk to me, Reception staff were great and house keeping
477124,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Service is poor at times You must call several times before you get the service you need Room service food is also not that great, Great place to stay Amazing facilities 
477125,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, They ran out of beer all beer on Sunday and they generally showed to have lots of types of wine but again ran out of most of these There was also a very slow service in the cafe bar on the Saturday which resulted in us actually giving up and going out for a drink instead Beds hurt my back, The Parma ham and mozzarella starter in the restaurant was AMAZING My partner is Italian and agreed it was the best he d ever tasted The restaurant was pretty empty the night we tried it Saturday buy the food was exceptional Really top quality for all 3 courses

477128,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Staff weren t very on the ball It took 15 minutes for them to give us our luggage from the luggage room and that was because the staff failed to give our luggage ticket to the bell boy Staff gave us a restaurant recommendation for a place around the corner was awful , Loved the hotel and it s design Rooftop bar was great Not liking how they charge to use the pool bit ridiculous Italy is the only country to my knowledge to charge hotel guests to use the pool 
477129,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing really new hotel very stylish near the Centrale station so not central for the cathedral etc but lots of teams and underground to get aroumd, Great choice lovely atmosphere couldn t fault it a number of gluten free options too

477133,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, My check in was even more welcomed from Diana with a Burst of friendly smile and also given early check in as the room was available, When you have such a Warm greeting from the Doorman Demetrio I knew my stay will be pleasant
477134,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Front of house staff were extremely helpful however directions to the nearest eating precinct proved to be poor Best local eating seems to be near the station rather than toward the Duomo Not much down that way within 2 km , Bathroom in particular and overall interior design were fresh comfortable and stylish

477138,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Bar prices were quite expensive about 3 times more for a Sprits compared to lakeside venues on Lago Maggiore but I guess that comes with the fourth star , Perfect location when travelling via train to Milano Centrale easy 5 7 minute stroll rolling bags over smooth pavement Very comfortable beds and large shower Wonderful staff Free electric bike loan

477143,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, There are STAIRS in the front door with no lift and escalator so you need to carry your 50Kg luggage up to the lobby The room door is a bit tricky to open ask your staff , close to the milan station and metro easy transport The gym machine in the gym room is quite funny worth visit Friendly staff P S the rooftop bar is full of business people around 18 00 so dress up and make a reservation in advance 
477144,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, This was a fantastic hotel Clean super modern and very luxurious It is located 5 minutes walk from Central Station and is quiet at night Luigi on the front desk gave us outstanding service from the moment we arrived through to check out 10 10

477146,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, 1 Booking com need to give clear directions to this hotel Following the small map would only make sense with a description of which doors and street to use to exit the station 2 We were allocated a room better suited to disabled guests with a shower and plastic curtain and no shelf space for makeup 3 Water bottles were only provided on the first day and the Wellness center is expensive 4 There are only two main elevators serving twelve floors This is not adequate especially when the hotel allows private functions leaving paying guests resorting to the stairwell When we finally made it up to the roof top terrace for a quiet drink we found it overcrowded and the noisy private group took most of the tables 5 The breakfast staff should have checked with reception before we were accused of not prepaying for it An apology was only offered after we took up the issue with management 6 Based on previous McGallery experiences I fail to see how this hotel qualifies , The bed was comfortable the dinner menu good and reception staff helpful but overall a negative experience 
477147,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, thought the drink prices on the roof top bar were a bit steep plus there was a pre booked birthday party non staying guest on so we were shoved into one corner of the roof with small tables chairs whilst they had all the best seats views, stayed in an exec suite on the 12 floor with a balcony views etc were great
477148,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Absolutely fantastic stay here The staff couldn t have been any friendlier or helpful Cannot find a bad word to say about this hotel or our experience 10 10

477153,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I had to solve parking problem by myself there were no free parking spaces in the hotel so hotel staff asked me to go to some garage nearby the hotel but couldn t find anybody there Parked a car on the street, Room design Room cleaning View from a window Room amenities Metro station in a few minutes walking Wi Fi quality is great

477158,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, We really looked forward to the rooftop bar but it turned out to be very clubby and more for outside parties than for the guests of the hotel , Very modern and clean rooms The staff was very helpful with suggestions 
477159,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, We had an overbooking for two weeks there were two rooms reserved under the same name While this was obviously a mistake the hotel never mentioned this until we checked out and forced us to pay for both rooms The roof terrace restaurant is bad and overpriced I ordered a glass of red wine and received a glass of almost boiling Cabernet The bottle was obviously stored in the sun When I complained the waitress told me that red wine isn t supposed to be cold and offered me to put a bottle on ice She did not take the wine back and charged us 15 Euros for the 0 1 litres of red wine and 10 Euros for a small beer Rip off , The rooms and the hotel are nice the location is very convenient next to the main train station airport express The breakfast is good

477166,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Reception staff unfriendly abrupt initially tried to tell us we weren t booked in despite us showing them our booking confirmation email Spa doesn t open until 5pm not sure why and because we had evening plans the 2 nights we were there we missed out on using spa which we had intended to use morning or afternoon the spa facilities had been the main factor in choosing this hotel We didn t get to use it The waiting staff on the roof top terrace bar were terrible it took 15 mins to be served then our drinks 2 juices didn t arrive after another 15 minutes so we left A conference party had arrived the staff weren t interested in us We weren t impressed at all We would try another hotel if we go back to Milan , The woman serving on the coffee croissant bar in the lobby was lovely very attentive She gave us some great customer service Our room was very clean modern bathroom nice The hotel itself was lovely the lack of customer care let it down

477179,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, SPA is nice though quite small There were too many people at once in there with only 3 beds to relax Think number of guests should be limited and time slots allocated to ensure good experience , Location close to the central train station Also only 30 mins on foot to the Dome Staff is attentive and nice Food in the Restaurant is quite good Breakfast had a good selection although the coffee is filter coffee 
477180,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Only 2 lifts and on one night of our stay there was a function on the roof terrace and hundreds of people were queueing for the lifts making them unaccessible to the guests , Location excellent Overall style of hotel modern and inviting

477182,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Staff too few unfriendly unhelpful We booked bicycles as offered on the booking page Forget it There are no bicycles I made a formal complaint but they didn t respond Pictures of top floor terrace with city views are misleading because the top floor is actually only for functions No views from the public areas , Good bed though hardly big enough to call a king size Food just mediocre quality and value but plentiful 
477183,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Area carpet in bedroom could take a more thorough vacuuming See comments above regarding sauna room One of 2 bathrobes we had didn t seem fresh , Great location within walking distance to Stazione Centrale Spacious luxurious room Huge bathroom and a separate sauna room which was a bonus which we didn t have time to use though This was also the con the ceiling had molds good thing we didn t care to use the sauna and it was not connected to the bathroom All in all I d say LaGare is affordable luxury We had a very relaxing overnight stay Would stay there again

477194,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The location though convenient for the main railway station and business district is charmless , Impeccable modern hotel well run spotless and comfortable Good buffet breakfast 
477195,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Breakfast was not that good mainly because of poor coffee You don t expect this sort of coffee in Italy especially in a 4 star hotel We only had breakfast there once If you do not necessarily need eggs and bacon check out many cafes nearby for wonderful coffee and pastry Much better and cheaper Another issue was decorative pillows on the bed I am pretty sure they caused severe allergy for me On a third night I removed them far away from the bed and it was better If you have allergies be aware I suggest the hotel staff to take this seriously and check those pillows and the rooms in general for allergies Some people might have very strong allergic reactions , Quality of facilities was great Location is great close to the Central station two metro lines and trams 
477196,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Service in the bar was not adequate for a 4 star hotel Waited more than 20 minutes to order Staff at the reception was very friendly Loud air condition , Location is very central Very modern room 
477197,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The attitude of a clerk at checkout My name was misspelled and my address completely wrong Instead of a prompt correction and apologize he preferred to comment on my request of explication, The functionality of the hole property is excellent the only disappointment has been with the training room and annexed steam room absolutely too little to be even considered as an opportunity
477198,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The locations was near to the train station and the metro with access to town center and airport The staff was friendly The hotel was clean The room was spacious and the bathroom was really good

477203,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, the entrance of the room is dark and even with lights it is not enough also you have to insert the card of room in a special place which is hidden and directly clear At check out the have asked for extra city tax which they did not ask before at check in, close to central station assistance from employees look of the room
477204,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, 200 Euro went missing during our stay The hotel did their best and checked the security tapes and room log but no evidence could be found of any wrong doing Given that I had withdrawn the money just a few hours previously and that I then got changed to go to the gym there really is very little chance the money was mislaid elsewhere The hotel were very helpful but ultimately their comment of course we believe you I could only excuse on the basis that perhaps their English wasn t very good Either way if you re staying here just use the safe a bit more than you normally would perhaps The rooms are a little smaller than they appear in the literature but overall it s such good value that there is not reason to complain , The deal we got was amazing Relative to other Milan hotels with spa and this level of facilites LaGare offers incredible value for money There s also a great Japanese restaurant and fantastic Mexican restaurant nearby 
477205,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, The Spa was the highlight of our stay Beautiful sauna and relaxtion area The staff dealt with all our requests immediately and everyone was so nice and friendly Would definitely recommend 
477206,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The Hotel didn t have an elevator or ramp to take the luggage up from the entrance you should climb many stairs with luggage or leave it outside for calling the carrier boy , breakfast
477207,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I frequently travel to big conurbation like Paris New York Tokyo and other but it was my only 2nd time I was visiting Milan As everybody knows the standard of the hotel has nothing common with the number of stars In this case we were seduced by the good opinions probably from the hotel personnel Despite the fact that the hotel was almost empty not very friendly receptionist offered us a room on the 1st floor with a small window overlooking the dustbin and the office building very close to the hotel facade we have to close the curtains during the day But first we were hesitating to take the room almost on the ground afraid of the noise from the street but the receptionist told us that other room will be prepared in 3 ours she did not look convincing as we did not want to waste time we took the keys We had to carry our luggage ourselves to the room not very far but still it supposed to be 4th star hotel Despite passing next to the reception several times during the stay staff was not interested in the guests too much not even once we ve heard good morning Toilet acted reluctantly and water barely flowed from the shower Even though the rooms had to be sound proof everything from the room next door was audible Location of the hotel is rather average and for the money it was offered you can find much better hotels in Milano Not recommended ,No Positive
477208,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Atmosphere environment and limited range of options in hotel restaurant restaurant prices were not extortionate given quality of food cooking but did feel a touch too expensive given negatives Rooftop bar was not open during my stay , Close to the main station in Milan very handy when arriving late into Milano Centrale station Extensive Sky TV package Good quality food in restaurant 
477209,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, I got a room that was not cleaned after previous gust and they needed to change it They orderd a normal taxi for me and the driver asked for 30 additional euro as a fee for the hotel, Location
477210,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Room tempature was governed and stayed at 22 but the room always felt very warm A staff member came into the room without knocking twice while my husband was in the room working , Rooms are nice and the breakfast is very good
477211,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, elevator , 1 fast internet 2 clean new large room 3 good bathroom area 4 second toilet to wash 5 good staff 6 good and useful lighting in every part 7 new hotel a few years old 8 fast and kind service 9 cheap 10 curtains to cut the day light 11 very intelligent room design 12 good breakfast 13 five minutes to central station 14 
477212,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Strange to be in a 4 star hotel with no room service Pathetic attitude from the staff over small issues never helpful Nowhere they mentioned that the bar on terrace will be openly in summers Happy to be out , Strategically located Nice modern building with no soul 
477213,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing comes to mind , The location was great The hotel is just a 10 min walk away from the Milano Centrale railway station the departure point for all our day trips out of Milan Close to cafes and restaurants Staff was friendly helpful and a bunch of fun individuals Patient with our questions and queries 
477214,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The spa area was an additional cost of 15pp which is an unnecessary cost The food was not great and priced very high , The room was very comfortable The location was perfect for using the metro The little italian restaurant right beside the hotel was amazing 
477215,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Only a few guest in the restaurant but it took more than half an hour to get the bill A menu has been ordered two times but nevertheless beef has been served instead of salmon Check the bills in bar and restaurant , Though about ten persons wanted to check in Saturday night the manager on duty was very friendly and full of patience The rooms are good equipped Food in restaurant and at breakfast was very good 
477216,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Full of disappointment staying in this hotel We were shocked to find out that there was feces in the toilet when we entered the room The steamed bathing room was originally a good design but it kept dripping water which made us could not sleep at night The lighting effect on the wall of the building was disturbing which forced us to close the curtain Arrangement for breakfast was messy with limited food Staff were not really helpful with no smile on their faces except when we checked out We did not enjoy our 3 nights stay at all , It is located near Milan Centrale 
477217,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, We booked a suite the tv in the lounge area did not work which meant the lounge area was a waste of money we had to speak to reception on FOUR seperate occasions over 2 days before someone came to the room we were then told the sky didn t work No coffee facilities in the room we were told they were hoping to rectify the situation A four star hotel should not be letting people down on these points would I stop there again they will have to improve , Location was close to 2 of the main rail stations and was picked for that reason The waiters in the resteraunt were excellent and the decor was fantastic
477218,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, For a 4 star hotel I would have expected that the spa area is free of charge for guests The rain shower head room 6 on floor 10 needs some maintenance as water was not coming out easily and strongly enough because of lime , The hotel is very conveniently located near the Central Station The design room was very comfortable with a big and good bed The New Year s dinner was excellent with a good menu of several courses and tasty prosecco and wines Staff at the reception was very friendly 
477219,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, One female reception staff was unfriendly Even with parking reservation we had to park elsewhere Too expensive Bedsheets didn t get changed , Room was a reasonable size bald Barkeeper is an awesome guy 
477220,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Its a major ripp off They have been charging for everything Even though we stayed in Junior suite we still had to pay extra for breakfast spa parking etc, Location
477221,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel,No Negative, Overall the room was clean and a great tasting breakfast was included which was nice to have Especially i liked the facility it is very modern i was travelling by train so it was great that the hotel is located nearly to the station Easy to find about a 5 min walk from the station 
477222,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, As the hotel seems to be located at a business rather than a touristic area it s a bit dark and desert at night if you plan to walk , Great staff Very comfortable and modern Nice wi fi Breakfast with good variety Easy walking distance from the Milano Central train station and metro 
477223,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The sights are a little bit far away we took the metro to reach the duomo or santa maria delle grazie, Very friendly clean rooms very good breakfast
477224,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Music in hallways sometimes audible from room off at night though Colored lights outside window took one night to figure out that we could turn them off , Room clean and comfortable good size and nice simple furniture Eco friendly great location helpful and warm staff

477227,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Unfortunately we didn t manage to eat at the restaurant on 13th floor because it is open only in summer and we didn t know it , Incredibly convenient very friendly personnel delicious wide ranged breakfast buffet very clean and modern equipped definitely a good choice we will come again 5 min from central station on foot 20 min to Duomo on foot tram outside the hotel metro 2 min on foot 
477228,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, The one and only disappointment we had was that the room did not have an iron Upon calling the front desk we were told that the hotel does not have an iron ironing board available and the only option was to have our clothes ironed by the hotel at 5 a garment This facility is nice to have but it would also be useful for a hotel to have an ironing board with iron that is available to use also , Myself and my girlfriend visited Milan for the first time earlier this week and had chosen to stay in the LaGare Hotel based on its reviews online The hotel is very appealing from the outside with the multi coloured windows and the lobby also very grand We were welcomed and checked in early and given lots of information by the friendly front desk staff Our room Double was superb A very modern seclusive and cosy room large comfortable bed large flat screen modern LED TV with SkyTV and clean wooden floors The room was fitted with numerous switches for convenience with multiple lighting modes and automatic window shutters The bathroom was just as good with a large double walk in shower with a very cool overhead water fountain and run away draining on the floor Speaker system fitted into the bathroom allowed us to play music from the TV in the bathroom awesome The room had lots of amenities free bottled water a mini bar free wireless internet and toiletries The hotel is around 15 minute walk from the beating heart of Milan But still has restaurants and bars within 5 minutes of the hotel and is only a 5 10 minute walk from the Milan Central station We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel we had a drink in the chilled bar area but sadly did not get to try the restaurant terrace or spa this time We would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to stay in Milan in style 
477229,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Small private parking always full and not bookable in advance SPA open only few hours per day from 5 30 till 11 30 p m Rooms well isolated from external noise but boring background noise from the bathroom , Nice location in a strategic area between Central and Garibaldi Stations and at walking distance approx 20 mins from the Dome square Modern and trendy interiors friendly staff Comfortable rooms provided of all amenities expected from a 4 star hotel 
477230,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, They charge your for every little step Spa is 15 extra per person breakfast is 14 per person and honestly it s not worth it at all very average food no variety and they didn t have lactose free milk unacceptable for an upscale hotel like that so I couldn t even have my morning coffee And all this with the fact that we had a junior suite nothing was included and the room itself was very average Ah and they have a tiny garage which is of course fully booked and the only place you can leave your car is the parking nearby for 24 a day When checking out they didn t even ask us how was our stay fair enough , It s modern and comfortable 
477231,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, there is no possibility to open the window and the air conditioner didn t really allow to circulate fresh air into the room Felt a bit stuffy but it s a minor thing Slow elevators , Monochrome design close to the central railway station with a direct link to Malpensa airport
477232,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Nothing but the elevators were under maintenance so i utilized the service elevator once for breakfast, Location is definitely superior just 5 min walking from central meyro station and 5 min from Garibaldi station Staff are very cooperative and speaks English well

477238,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Not the nicest neighborhood But we wanted to be near central station for easy access to the train to the EXPO The bed was a little hard and there were a few things that needed repair in the bathroom , Modern up to the minute features close proximity to Central Station Great staff 
477239,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, 1 the lights in the room not enough especially with the dark furniture 2 No ironing instrument in the room and when I request one they said that it is not permitted in all Italy hotels So I have to use their laundry with high prices 3 No Tea or coffee maker in the room 4 Toilet stuffs like hair conditioner and facial tissue are supplied only once in the whole stay 5 The towels are the large ones only The small towells were seen only in the first day 6 Room service after 12 mid night is practically not available I arrived late the first day and when I called many times no pick up so I have to call Reception and they called back but only salds was available at that time , The dinner in the hotel was very good High quality but they close at 10 30 pm

477242,LaGare Hotel Milano Centrale MGallery by Sofitel, Bad lighting and A C management too high tech for most guest And I work in technology There were two young people working at the Terrance roof bar on Tuessay night that spoilt my enjoyment They ignored me and my wife did not take our order for over half an hour even though it was not busy Tried to get their attention and had to get off my chair to walk over to them and tell them I wanted to order a drink I asked for snacks which didn t arrive for another 15 minutes Wasted an hour of my time which I ll never get back There was also a problem with getting change from my bill Bar tab 16 euro no change for 20 euro I think they were trying to keep the tip which they didn t deserve Disgusted with service I fought back and avoided bar again for the 3 nights I stayed there Completely spoilt my enjoyment of the hotel, Very chic and hip hotel close to Milan Centrale station and metro Nice touches with decor and facilities Enjoyed stay with large room and shower facilities Friendly front desk staff
