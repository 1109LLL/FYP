86373,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The male deputy reception manager rafael had an appalling attitude deeply upset me and offended me to the point I was annoyed I would not use Hilton again because of his lack of empathy and disregard for a clients requirements Rooms are tiny also and shower was dirty I was told the hotel doesn t book through booking com and any requests made via the site are not noted or actioned Internet would not work on any device I had either and once again the manager was not interested and said he couldn t help This was the worst hotel experience I have had in six months , Nothing

86419,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Room was small for a double there was max 2ft between the bed and wall tv Heating set to 23 8degrees was quite a blast to be greeted to in March but the air con was quick to kick in Maybe some seasonal awareness with temperature settings When coming home from a night out with friends granted in the wee hours we had to enter via the back entrance which was not ideal in the dark , Cookies on arrival is always a nice touch The facilities in common areas were always spotlessly clean and staff were friendly and helpful Room was comfortable if a bit cosy the bed was great quality comfort level 10 10

86425,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The Disability Access room didn t suit me I m too tall for the tiny low sink and there was nowhere in the bathroom to put anything down apart from the top of the cistern which was already full of unwanted freebies in any case So I shall refuse such a room if offered it in the future , Bed and food were fine as were the staff 
86426,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Just a noisy pipe in the room , It was a lovely hotel easy to get to the venue where we were going to pleasant staff we were upgraded to a lovely room the second night due to a noisy water pipe running in the room on the first night

86436,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Not much maybe a mirror by the desk for ease of drying hair I had to sit on the floor by the full length mirror , The hotel is situated just short distance from both Ealing Common 250m and North Ealing 800m tube stations so extremely easy access to the centre of London 30mins to Leicester Square You can park really cheaply at North Ealing station at the NCP car park Much cheaper than the hotels on site parking The room although fairly small was decorated really nicely was very clean and the most comfortable bed I have ever experienced in a hotel Breakfast was really good and staff were friendly and helpful There was an iPod dock which was very handy and nice coffee machine We were given a warm cookie each on check in which was a lovely and unexpected treat 
86437,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was too cold because the heating system wasn t working We called the reception and they sent us somebody He said he could offer us a portable heater which we agreed to But afterwards he didn t show up and we had to call again to finally get it The breakfast was only ok I honestly was expecting that at least a cappucino would be included in the price of breakfast in a four star hotel But there only was not so great filter coffee and to get something better we had to order from Starbucks which for me personally wasn t an option since it s really not my favourite , welcome cookie

86455,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I have put poor for cleanliness and comfort due to the room smelling of sewage not due to actually visual cleanliness this was perfect and beds were very comfortable It was the smell coming up from the sink so had to have the plug closed and water in to try and disguise the smell and window open not that it helped much I would be extremely surprised if we were not the first people to comment on this Not what I expect from a double tree , Friendly staff welcoming
86456,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I had a value deal of just room for the night and no extras like breakfast included but there should at least have been cups and tea coffee facilities for us none in our room , The hotel is smart clean and comfortable the reception staff was lovely and friendly and of course the yummy cookie I left a new pair of jeans behind but got them back on returning just a couple of hours later to collect them so thank you

86460,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, We had a standard room which would be better described as cabin We have normal BMIs but if people are overweight or obese they would have problems This is the smallest room in a hotel I have ever had Customers need to be warned I did not realise there was deadline for the doors of the breakfast area to be closed Perhaps you should sound a warning I would have been quicker of the mark to obtain some milk if I had known , The reception area was comfortable with easy access to lift and refreshments

86471,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was super warm on arrival and the aircon was so slow the TV remote had no batteries and we waited for 15mins for someone to help us The towels were old and crusty and the bed sheets had stains for 200 per night it was a very over priced hotel should of offered us some form of apologise Ridiculously priced Starbucks and the breakfast in the morning was horrid No food stocked up the tables a mess and not wiped and the waitress took over half an hour to deliver my eggs My partner had already eaten his breakfast by the time my eggs arrived to the table Overall we won t ever recommend or go back to the hotel , The reception area had lovely decor and the gave out cookies 
86472,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Manager lacks business acumen I checked out early due to an emergency and they refused to credit me for the extra day Hilton just lost future nights from a business traveller becauae one greedy manager could not see the forest from the trees Great hire for local franchisee colossal failure for the franchise ,No Positive
86473,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, I booked the hotel through booking com I was initially told the room would cost 105 for the night but when I went to check in I was told the room would cost 135 for no apparent reason 
86474,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Housekeeper trying to get in the room at 8 30am , The room was a little on the small side but adequate for an overnight stay Very comfortable with a comfy bed spotlessly clean and a very modern bathroom Good breakfast with plenty of choice Staff were helpful and friendly Very close to underground 5 min walk to get into the city 
86475,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, had to move rooms the following day as could hear the guests in the room below arguing and was woken in the night due to this seemed to need some sound proofing Staff were great though and dealt with perfectly , greeted with warm cookies room was small but nice breakfast was good parking good comfy bed and nice bathroom nice clean hotel 
86476,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Going home , We have stayed twice at the double tree in Ealing and we have found it very friendly place providing a good service in the bar and at breakfast the toast was toasty the corn flakes very flakey and the jam very jammy 
86477,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Room was quite small for navigating with two bodies as the beautifully large bed takes up majority of the floor space Not a lot of free space to manoeuvre, Loved the friendly staff and the complimentary warm cookie and bottled water 
86478,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was smaller than anticipated But you expect that from London hotels, The restaurant and staff were amazing Wonderful choice at breakfast rooms comfortable and clean and design was amazing Overall ambience was stunning
86479,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, Everything staff were fantastic Couldn t compliment them highly enough Obviously great management in this hotel as all staff seemed happy to be there and were very friendly and helpful 
86480,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room smelt heavily of cigarette smoke which by todays standard we found very disappointing , It was very close to the main arterial road leading into London and the tube station was only 3 minutes away 
86481,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, When you have a room on the main street things can be very noisy due to traffic conference room On our stay there was a party going on with loud music till midnight afterwards yelling and running in the hall till 4 AM Secondly bad interaction staff misunderstandings our luggage temporary lost on arrival no vouchers for breakfast Esp on weekends I think parties might disturb night rest A better isolation could help a lot , Short walk to underground district piccadilly lines Good breakfast Clean room Staff friendly
86482,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Previous customer s feedback card still in room limited availability of capsules for coffee machine , Very nice room excellent shower helpful staff
86483,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The telly was fine but sky sports and movies would be good, Very helpful staff who guided us to an excellent local curry house They even printed the menu off for us The availability of breakfast until 11 am was also much appreciated Nespresso machine made us feel at home 
86484,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Air conditioning units were located outside our hotel window which was quite noisy In the description it said mini fridge however on asking why the fridge did not seem cold I was told it s only a chiller so a little disappointing as we were self catering , Room size was small but with the air conditioning this was not a problem 
86485,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, When we arrived very late after our flight we just wanted to shower but there were no toiletries in our room not even hand soap We had to call the desk and wait for a while before they were brought to us and nobody said sorry about that Then our wash basin sink had a very bad drainage problem so it took so long to drain and was very inconvenient Also a couple of towels had black spots on them , Coffee maker
86486,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, A double room so 2 hooks for bathroom towels instead of one big one would be more sensible Bigger mugs required to equal liquid output from Nespresso coffee machine to avoid overflow Room small but perfectly formed , We had pre requested non smoking room on quiet side of hotel and were given both without having to ask again We liked the boutique feel to the hotel and its proximity to Underground bus routes and Ealing Common Nice touch warmed sweet bun on arrival and bottle of water each on departure Staff so pleasant helpful and interested unusual for London 
86487,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I m a bit put off that the transport the front desk recommended was a full faire taxi Other car hire options presented themselves once I got the lay of the land , Great staff The breakfast was quite good Very convenient to public transportation Internet service was fast and well connected Comfortable rooms and beds 
86488,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, House keeping need improvement in all aspects Same little soap was hardly changed Checked out at 6 am and reception told me there is no one to help me to bring down our nine suit cases I personally took them down and while reception staff were watching me no no bothered to help me at all First time to see these reception staff in my ten days stay , We loved the all the staff and specially reception staff Food was great Bed was perfect We felt home all the time 
86489,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Nothing really All staff were helpful and the room was clean and modern , Great location only 30 mins from central London and with lots of shops and restaurants within a 5 minute walk Breakfast had plenty of options and the warm cookies on arrival are a nice touch 
86490,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, We got charged 20 pounds for checking in a couple of hours earlier and had to give a deposit of 60 pounds which they have back after check out Bathroom is too small you can hardly move Otherwise nice hotel I d go back , Great location 3 minutes away from Ealing Common Station and less than 10 from Ealing Broadway nice shopping area by the station comfortable room although the bathroom is tiny friendly staff 
86491,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Location too far from everything so we moved further into the city Unfortunately that was a bad move but you can t have it all Should have stayed in the clean air conditioned nice room we had here , Nice clean friendly hotel 
86492,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Overall a poor experience at this hotel Was not told about 30 card deposit when booking online Told the receptionist I did not have right card with me and that I planned to come back He called me on the room phone to reiterate which I thought that was out of order Went out and left the free to clean sign on the door handle but the room was not services upon my return Was expecting a higher standard from this hotel , Convenient location for the day

86497,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The alarm had been set for 6 45 by the previous guest so woke me up very early on the first night of our stay and again on the second but couldn t figure out how to stop it this time so snooze went of 3 times before I managed to achieve this so may I suggest that when a guest vacates a room your cleaners could clear the alarms as routine when making up a room for a new guest, The pillows were definately the best we have ever laid are heads on Oh and the brownies were first class 
86498,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Just make sure that you get a room at one of the the floors if you are staying here with the intention of relaxing and sleeping They rent out the ground floor to events that play really loud music untill 1am I had to complain once wait for nothing to happen call a second time and demand that they provided a new room for us as it was impossible to sleep They did find us a new room but getting out of bed to pack and move to a different room at midnight Disapointed , Nice place but what does that count for when your room is above a night club The hotel had renten out a part of its first floor to an event that played loud music all night long 
86499,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was on the small side and so hot the air con was not efficient we did get a floor fan in room which helped a little but as I said it was the hottest days of the year , Perfect location for our needs staff very helpful and the air con down in the foyer lounge was amazing as we chose the hottest days of the year to be in London Breakfast was superb huge choice and set us up for the day

86502,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The duvet seemed to small for the bed also no welcome cookie that you usually get from doubletree Hilton , Location is convenient for public transport plenty of parking 
86503,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, A pet hate of mine is that a hotel of this standard does not offer complimentary nibbles at the bar A bit petty maybe but i always think that adds something , Just off the north circular and close to the M4 Plenty of parking at a reasonable price and less than 2 minutes walk to Ealing Common Tube Friendly helpful staff and food I only had breakfast was excellent 
86504,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The location was awful the building is hideous looks like an old office block the staff did not look very happy we were never asked at any time how our room or stay was going on arrival i tried to engage with the receptionist telling her about our journey and where we had come from she looked at me like i was demented this was at 9pm on a Sunday night no one was rushed off there feet on departure we were not asked any questions at all about our stay room visit no small talk even tho i was the only one at the desk then it does appear to have a lot of eastern europeans on the staff it was not a nice stay the only guarantee is i will never cross the door of this place again fed up being promised the earth by booking web sites and getting poor accommodation our pets have more personal space than we were afforded in this hotel poor customer service , the place was functional it was clean and not much else going in its favour
86505,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Too far away from sights breakfast not up to the mark and not included in the quoted prce , Closeness to the underground good size rooms Good facilities in room
86506,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, Avoid the quaint Victorian places they are not charming just cramped often dirty and lacking any comforts The Doubletree Ealing was easy to get to on the Tube 1 5 minute walk from Ealing Common Station The bus stop was directly across the street The room was great comfortable beds quality bedding and towels fast internet free seemed to have plenty of parking and the complimentary cookies tasty I booked the night before my stay and got a great rate 135 BP
86507,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Bit annoying when unable to check in at 1 50 for 2pm check in and a queue to re join at 2pm to see if there is a room available yet we attended for a local event at wembley and were frustrated we were late as a result This must be a common occurrence due to this hotel s location and we booked due to good check in time and so would be v helpful if check in was quicker and definitely available at 2pm Busy street with traffic , Breakfast was lovely specifically booked on B B basis having had great breakfast at another double tree Hilton pancakes and muffins v tasty Shower in en suite also very good 
86508,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The WiFi wouldn t work as my surname wasn t recognised , We was treated by very friendly staff who offered us complimentary cookies and apples The room was clean and comfortable with a lovely selection of toiletries

86522,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Breakfast was a little chaotic but that was nothing to do with the staff or hotel it was the fact that most customers had been to a concert the previous evening and all had a lay in so ended up eating at the same time , The bedrooms had very good finishing touches and I liked the Nespresso machine Proper hairdryer was a great addition The pillows were really comfortable 
86523,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The location that comes up on Google maps is incorrect I was left stranded in the early hours having to get a cab at my own expense I reported this and nobody came back to me Whilst I understand this isn t the hotel s fault I assume this must be a common occurrence and more could be done to prevent this , Great rooms the staff were great and they welcome you with a treat 
86524,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Waited over 2 hours for room service that never came Apparently a problem with in the kitchen but when questioned were told food was on its was up It never arrived and no call from reception staff to say this was the case bad at 2am when you re starving hungry and wait up for it , Room was clean bed very comfortable Good location for nearby tube station 2 mins walk and access to London City Breakfast was good value for money would recommend booking this in advance as 5 cheaper Friendly helpful staff overall good customer service

86533,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The staff were unhelpful and not very friendly We are not from around the area so asked for help regarding travel to Wembley and were only told about getting a taxi no other options told so we had to seek the information ourselves I was very angry that someone complained about having to pay for parking and so they were given it free of charge when I had to pay surely this is not fair I also was not happy that when we arrived late on in the evening the man who served us at reception said to a colleague something about not having a room which made me worry After a short while we were given a room which was clearly for a disabled customer as there was no bath the sink was very low down so hard to use I felt as though we were just shoved in a room and been forgotten about Also despite putting the sign on our door to not disturb us we were woken up at 10 00am by the cleaner walking straight in Overall we were not impressed and would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone I am very disappointed and would appreciate an email regarding the issues raised please , The breakfast was of a good standard and there was plenty of choice the hotel was clean and I thought the cookie upon arrival was a nice touch

86568,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Fact that when I arrived I discovered cost another 13 50 to park in hotel cark park which was a total rip off as the car park is on hotel land and not a third party one Also on check learnt that my room did not include breakfast and a simple buffet was 31 00 for two 15 50 for an English breakfast and cup of coffee , Rooms were clean and decor was good but you would struggle to swing a cat in there thats for sure 
86569,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Too much traffic noise from main road had a fairly sleepless night from the sirens and noise of cars and buses , The staff were very helpful and were always on hand to answer any questions The breakfast is great room service selection is good Large 42 TV Clean rooms and comfy bed 
86570,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I carefully chose a room away from the roads STG5 for room service delivery is a rip off, Clever room lay outs good gym nice little touches like the chocolate biscuit and the very friendly staff STG10 for all you can eat breakfast was great and everything was cooked really well

86576,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, We stayed at the hotel for the Wembley Cup Final the location was excellent as the bus stop to Wembley was just across the road with a journey of approx 35 minutes to get there Ealing Common tube station was approx 3 minutes walk from the hotel and Ealing Broadway tube was approx 15 minutes walk so plenty of choices to get into London centre All the staff were very friendly accommodating and helpful The room was excellent and the breakfast was superb with plenty of choice I would definitely stay there again 
86577,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, there was nothing that we did not like we just like this hotel and its location, the greeting on arrival the staff at breakfast was very helpfull breakfast was very good as per usual 
86578,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Room size, The hotel is brilliant the only downside point is the size of the room the room is too small in a way that if someone want to walk around the other one should sit on the bed but all the rest is fine clean comfortable bed good staff 
86579,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Ensuite very clean but bijou shower only no bath to relax in after a full day of sightseeing in the capitol , Rooms very clean and bed very comfy Complimentary warm chocolate cookies on check in were LUSH 
86580,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, My Mum paid 25 for the car park I think the car park charge should be included in your stay , Warm chocolate cookie on arrival and very welcoming staff Rooms to a high standard with coffee machine Lovely bathroom and toiletries 
86581,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Everything was great but personally I think a face flannel could be provided, Staff lovely although wasn t offered a cookie rooms spotless and very comfortable

86588,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Air conditioning a little noisy in room, Welcoming staff clean bright foyer and smart rooms albeit the doubles were quite cozy but nothing to complain about A nice touch to have Nespresso machines in the rooms Air conditioning a little noisy but sure I could have it turned it off or down if I was that bothered I ll go back 
86589,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Could be quite noisy due to road nearby and impatient drivers and the parking cost was a little disappointing but this wasn t a deal breaker due to the excellent location of the hotel I had some trouble with the air con but if I had asked sooner this wouldn t have been a problem , Lovely and helpful staff tasty breakfast and decent rooms This is a tidy and recently refurbished hotel The location less than half a mile from Ealing Common tube station and a sainsburys local made this a brilliant place to stay The locals we spoke to were polite and helpful too 
86590,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Terrible stay very unhelpful staff very disappointing for a Hilton Hotel after staying at many Hilton will now be off the cards for this Please be aware they add extras on for everything 15 50 extra per person for breakfast 25 00 to park in the car park over night terrible overpriced food in the restaurant What was meant to be a relaxing overnight stay turned into a very miserable time ,No Positive
86591,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, Lovely really helpful staff informed us there was a wedding taking place and moved us to another floor to reduce noise Free cookies on arrival were an added tasty bonus Great stay

86593,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that the cooked breakfast was cold In fact the rashers would have been warmer straight out of the fridge , The staff are very friendly and attentive 
86594,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, The location was perfect for Central London travelling in from Birmingham too Wembley is easy to get to and not too far into the centre We were greeted by the duty manager who was friendly and helpful and to top it off he gave us two lovely cookies Room was perfect for what we needed had a great sleep and woke up feeling great Will definitely stay again 
86595,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, All the staff seem to be very well trained They are friendly without being familiar courteous competent and helpful They are able to advise guests new to the hotel about transport links to other parts of London The breakfast is excellent 
86596,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Nothing, Professional helpful staff The lady at breakfast even remembered that I liked Earl Grey tea with my breakfast Room was very clean and comfortable and having a coffee machine as well as a kettle was a great touch 
86597,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Nothing everything was good, Lovely friendly helpful staff clean modern rooms convenient location will definitely recommend to all and try to stay again
86598,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, It would have been a help to have the tissues replaced in the bathroom however my wife purchased her own , A clean welcoming hotel with an excellent choice of breakfast 
86599,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, Staff was extremely kind The whole hotel was clean and looked great Definitely would recommend to anyone who would like to visit London since it has a tube station nearby like 2 mins walk It was a pleasure

86604,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Room could have been bigger , Lovely soft beds with cotton sheets Shower gel smelled really nice Nespresso coffee maker and fridge in room Staff exceptionally friendly very unusual in London Made us feel really valued Always love the cookies 
86605,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, At 01 44 I was woken by a massive argument in the room below and then by conversations just outside the hotel by hotel residents Not the hotel s fault but the noises continued even at 4 30am and shortly after the noise from the North Circular kicked off The windows weren t very sound proof at all I was also in a room which had a door to enable the size of the accommodation to be increased Frankly at times it was like having someone else in the room especially the next morning when the resident was clearing his throat for the best part of an hour If I stay again I will insist on a room at the back with no adjoining room capability , Location quick check in private parking breakfast
86606,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, We booked through booking com and on the Hilton hotel website was cheaper and it says best price guarantee on booking com so we emailed them and they never honoured it and it was a bit expensive for the location,No Positive

86610,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was so small that my mother and I were positively cramped Being away from home for a total of three weeks we had a lot of luggage and nowhere to put it If you were overweight you d be pushed to even get into the bathroom , The rooms were tastefully furnished
86611,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Room was one of the smallest i have stayed in the bathroom was tiny more like a cloak room There was a unpleasant smell from the bathroom that was reported all that appeared to happen was that they took the self closer off the door and opened a window while we were out The wife knocked off a decrotive panel under the window which exposed a very dirty radiator hadn t been cleaned for some considerable time , Only about 100m from the local tube station Ealing Common Very nice and courteous staff Coffee maker in the room
86612,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Small room sizes no bath tub Poor view overlooking roofs and carpark Having to call go down to reception daily for WiFi access codes, Proximity to local amenities
86613,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I paid the money as this was a birthday celebration but well worth it , Great helpful staff contemporary layout with lovely bedrooms with nice coffee machine Gym was great and breakfast was fresh with plenty of staff 
86614,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Bathroom was a bit tight for two , The room was good with everything we needed iron hair dryer fridge ipod alarm clock and coffee making facilities Fresh towels every day and contemporary decor Two minute walk to the tube Would definitely stay again

86616,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The only thing I would say that let this hotel down is the exterior The building does not look very appealing but I would still be happy to stay again as the hotel itself is great , Liked the staff which was very friendly pleasant and helpful The hotel was very clean and had a nice decor too 
86617,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, On the Saturday night there was a private function and the music was so loud we were kept awake until past 1 am There was no warning that this would be the case and the staff couldn t do anything to help in this matter , The staff were friendly and informative and the hotel and room were to a great standard 
86618,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, All good , Reception staff were very friendly and helpful Young lad from Scotland was excellent Good place to park and get the tube into London We stayed to see Hammond May and Clarkson at the O2 me and my four sons Its had a facelift since the last time I stayed and it is a good job Breakfast was cheaper if you buy once your there

86621,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, No bath and the shower tray filled up so quickly that you had to keep a keen eye on it Tiny portions of cheap UHT milk for coffee tea in the rooms, Location attentive staff car park bed was nice 
86622,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, A little bit tight in the bathroom Duvet a little thin as it was a cold night , Really clean and modern Parking a bonus Great breakfast Love the warm cookies on arrival 
86623,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room was too small, The staff is polite and professional and the breakfast is complete The hotel is 30 minutes far from the centre but the tube is very close
86624,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Bathroom very small bar staff a little unorganised not sure to order drinks at the bar or waiter service changed every night Breakfast a tad cold one morning but lovely the next so perhaps just had a bad day, Very clean staff friendly great location with good size car park will despite little issues definitely stay here again 
86625,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The main restaurant menu is sometimes over ambitious and at other times not very interesting which is unfortunate because there are not any satisfactory eating places nearby The a la carte seems reasonable but the wine list is limited and rather expensive , The staff in this hotel are excellently trained efficient and courteous without being familiar The breakfast is first rate The car park is useful if you want or need to be in the West London area 
86626,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, When I opened bedroom window whole room smelt of cigarette smoke Large wedding happening downstairs which meant restaurant wasn t really useable , Good location fairly new room and nice coffee in room Friendly staff Good quality chain hotel option Most amazing sushi restaurant around corner open until 9am Absolutely first class sashimi really glad i didnt go for hotel restaurant option 
86627,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Coffee shop understaffed and took long time to be served Couldn t find a bin for rubbish in coffee shop, Friendly welcome and very comfortable room Nice breakfast and helpful dining staff
86628,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Receptionist asked a little too many questions when checking in Calling the room once we had gotten in is not necessary Eve not though the room is clean the cupboard Was not checked as the previous persons dry cleaning was not taken out , The hotel was nice clean and spacious on arrival The room clean and comfortable 
86629,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I stayed for two nights and although I ate breakfast relatively early most of the cooked items were cold on the first morning The second morning I was served cold tea and had to ask for a fresh cup , I liked the anonymity no one bothered me and allowed a peaceful stay
86630,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, the room is a bit too small for a couple, location just seconds from Piccadilly line staff friendly and professional location very clean and excellent breakfast
86631,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, It could be better if inlet plug for hair dryer charger was inside area of bathroom It might have made me possible to use hair dryer in front of the mirror with staying standing I had to bend forward in front of mirror near entrance door outside bathroom , I liked King sized bed enjoyable Nespesso coffee inside room and starbucks coffee inside hotel And friendly staffs 
86632,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Not a bad experience as such but we felt the room and bathroom were a little cramped But for one night it was fine , Friendly staff clean modern building good breakfast and all in a good location with easy access to London 
86633,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, My room faced a street so I heard a lot of street noise cars driving by and people talking on the outside of the hotel Luckily I had packed some ear plugs which helped me sleep better , Comfortable bed and clean updated facilities within my room The hotel is easily accessible to a nearby subway station and you can t beat the free warm cookie upon arrival 
86634,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Small room toilet design to flush the toilet you have to close the cover Room was prepaid but extra amount was reserved upon check in That is OK What is not OK is that it took around two weeks until it was cancelled , Close to the tube good breakfast except coffee 
86635,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, how can they have staff at reception who can t speak proper English My friend was supposed to arrive a bit early they they put him in someone else room because they thought his name was similar to one Chinese guy they had scanned his Indian passport though I had to wait at reception calling everywhere because the receptionist told me no one checked in my booked room They were unfriendly Honestly stayed at more the 200 hotels I travel every month and never going to recommend this hotel because of their staff , Easy to find right close to tube station
86636,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Yes the air con couldn t get it to regulate right Rang through twice Did send someone up who told me it would be another 25 mins for it to cool down Was too tired to ring again when it was just as hot Spent longer at the controls rather than in the room Did explain at checkout but told they would get maintenance to look at it, Excellent customer service in all departments
86637,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Radiator leaking onto the floor wet carpet but not the end of the world, Good room and friendly staff Cant complain about the value and good proximity to N Circular and the Tube
86638,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The room though very well appointed was erm a bit compact but I had no problem with it Ordered a sandwich in bar at 11 15pm after they theoretically closed service at 11 00pm They served me so good service that they did provide the sandwich the bad bit was that the bread wasn t fresh and sandwich had been made for sometime and not covered Not so bad that I couldn t eat it but not really very good for the outrageous price Good that they immediately canceled the charge for the sandwich upon my complaining Service can t be faulted there , Great room modern and well appointed No bath in bathroom but very very good shower area modern and it worked well as well There was a Birthday party in the hotel but the reception gave me a room away from the ball room There was no disturbance at all brilliant I was amazed how quiet it was though the lobby bar restaurant area was naturally busy and noisy This was Saturday night after all Close to tube station and facing Ealing Common for walks if that takes your fancy and you survive the inner orbital road A very pleasant stay 
86639,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, This let down the rest of the very good stay The two room services meals on both evenings of our stay were only luke warm and the toast of the panini which was actually only sliced bread was not properly toasted It was disappointing We did not take this up at the time because it was late and we needed to eat and sleep Rugby World Cup was tiring We did mention at check out and were offered a free coffee , Great hotel with welcoming atmosphere and helpful staff Good location for visiting London 
86640,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Rooms were small but I think that s a common theme in London, Very clean and the staff were very helpful Despite being a good distance from the downtown core it was very easy to get in and out of the city Right along the Piccadilly line so it was very convenient Restaurants groceries pharmacy etc all close by Great alternative to staying in the city core which would be much more expensive Great experience Would go back 
86641,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Staff went through the motions of politeness but it clearly wasn t real and would ve been better if they d just done the checking in checking out without a load of personal questions, Very clean well appointed and perfectly located
86642,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, A water point would be nice on a floor as the tap water is warm and almost undrinkable , Great staff attentive and went above and beyond to surprise me for my birthday weekend Breakfast is one of the best we ve had at a hotel rooms were lovely and it was very clean Few minutes away from a tube station takes around 30 minutes to get to central London Location wasn t a problem at all 
86643,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, All members of the staff encounters were fantastic welcoming extremely helpful I stay in hotels for 70 nights a year that staff here compare extremely favourably with any hotel I ve stayed in 
86644,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, we requested a room with a bath However we discovered that it was showers only in every room Had we known this at the outset we would have found alternative accommodation to meet our needs Also the breakfast was rather cold , the bar area was very comfortable to sit in The chocolate cookie when we arrived was very welcoming 
86645,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, The rooms are small but if you re doing touristy stuff in London like we were it s all you need for a good night s sleep It was a little bit longer on the tube although for the price we paid it was cheaper to get a longer tube ride than to stay in central London Each to their own , Clean and cosy signed up for Hilton Honours and would definitely stay in one of their hotels again 
86646,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, i work in hospitality industry and of course my eyes are looking different when comes to hotels First as I stepped in I was welcomed by warm reception staff offering tasty warm cookies very friendly and helpful The rooms was very clean good size bathroom as well clean and well equipped with clean towels and toiletries Overall really impressed about price location and cleanliness

86648,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Smoking near entrance of hotel and it was very warm but could not enjoy the outside facilities because there were too many people smoking, Location parking facilities cleanliness and helpful staff
86649,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Paid parking Rooms are tiny We could not move around after the luggages were arranged Hated it Bad Hilton experience Comfort was next to zero, Breakfast variety Helpful front desk staffs Proximity to underground and Ealing Broadway shopping
86650,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing,No Negative, Hotel was fresh clean very well laid out and the staff were fantastic Quite far out of town but very close to the tube so it was no bother at all and for the price we paid the travelling was more than worth it The local amenities had everything you could want too My only disappointment was the pillows they were practically non and didn t make for a good night s sleep at all but I kept forgetting to ask for firm replacements so it can t have bothered me that much I m sure the staff would have been more than happy to help had I raised it at the time All in all a fantastic wee place to stay I ll be back for sure Thank you 
86651,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, I had a laptop iPad and iPhone but I could only connect to wifi on one device so had to keep switching two off when using one why I don t see the point as the wifi was free ,No Positive
86652,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, Perhaps the cost of guests parking charges could be reviewed 12 00 per day does seem excessive when I m already a paying guest, I liked the close proximity to the M1 motorway after a long drive from the north of England and I also like the convenience of the Ealing Common tube station almost on the doorstep of the hotel
86653,DoubleTree by Hilton London Ealing, everything was quality , location for our needs was spot on the staff could not have been more helpful the room was one of the cleanest ive ever stayed in 10 10 across the board
