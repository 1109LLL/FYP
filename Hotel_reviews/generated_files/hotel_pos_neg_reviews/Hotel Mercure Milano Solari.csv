485752,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Poor air conditioning and the replacement during breakfast terrible , The front desk staff very kind and friendly specially Silvia Good amenities in the room bathroom
485753,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, The room was air conditioned a bit too much The shower was rather weak Since the room was right above the entrance the view was not that nice and there was some noise from the entrance and the street Wi fi worked well but only one device could connect to it at a time So when I wanted to use it my husband couldn t and vice versa It was our second time staying in the hotel we were given a different room before and we liked it very much which is why we chose to come back and this time it was a bit disappointing , Great location Close to public transport Health food store nearby Comfortable bed 
485754,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, The food from the breakfast was less than satisfactory and we had to pay for it too, Location was brilliant only a mile walk down the road to great restaurants and bars
485755,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, The card reader to get into the room was not working I spent 30 min waiting for the staff to come up and go down and come up again to try to solve this problem in the end he gave me a physical key, Furniture was smartly organised nice location quiet
485756,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari,No Negative, We got upgraded to the executive suite for free The staff were very friendly and helpful going out of their way to try and help with some problems we had Room was lovely we even had our own coffee machine 
485757,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Paid for a small overpriced room got wrong info from front desk with public transportation the alleged 30 mins to a airport actually took an hour PS There was little to no traffic or diversions , Clean room
485758,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Waited a few minutes for check in as just one person at reception but he apologised and was pleasant Breakfast was 12 euros extra but was good for me it included tomatoes and rocket, It s all good Not too far from Navigli and rooms decent size and new 
485759,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Breakfast a bit pricey with tepid eggs and bacon Pity there is no on site parking at a decent price reckon 25 Euros a night , For the most part quiet Once there you can visit everything by foot or public transport 
485760,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Room was quite warm Set air con on low but didn t seem to cool down , We were upgraded free of charge with a complimentary mini bar and king size bed Forgot to bring toothpaste but we re delighted with the complimentary toiletries toothpaste lotion shampoo conditioner nail files combs etc Felt very safe in hotel good security and well lit at night as two young women visiting Milan
485761,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, I had a problem with my bill where they overcharged my credit card After many many emails back and forth they finally admitted they were wrong and would refund me When I did not see the refund they kept telling me to wait and wait To date there has been no refund only lie after lie Also the key cards don t work you always have to ask the desk to get in your room Mostly it is the lying and the overcharging that was the worst Just avoid this place for the sake of your wallet and to ensure a good trip , The rooms are decent and its an exact corporate style hotel 
485762,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Had a few technical issues safe didn t work properly key wasn t working well and Internet was not functioning properly all the time , Staff were amazing very helpful and friendly Hotel is very clean 
485763,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, No airco in the room it was 34 degrees I went to party on Friday so I slept late on Saturday The reception called me at 2pm to ask if they could clean the room I said it was ok in 30 minutes This was a problem so they didn t clean it When I asked for some fresh towels that night to quickly take a shower it took half an hour to bring them I only had half an hour to shower because I met with friends , Nice hotel Relax not noisy Good beds Modern rooms
485764,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Nothing at all , Friendly check in staff manager wonderful breakfast our room had free coffee and tea comfy bed speedy check in and out We felt very welcomed in the hotel 
485765,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, They close the gate at midnight Night time staff not friendly Wifi not working very well in some rooms Elevator is very slow, Day time staff is very friendly 
485766,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari,No Negative, Everything was great we were not expecting to have such high quality and service for that price The rooms are just as they are shown maybe even better Great location very close to the metro and also it is possible to walk around The staff is very helpful we needed our shuttle tickets to be printed and they did it in the middle of the night really fast Room was cleaned every day We are very very happy about our stay here absolutely recommend it 
485767,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari,No Negative, Staff answered all questions well I realized after leaving that I had left some items behind Mr Diego located my items in a timely fashion This was above and beyond normal good service 
485768,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, We were fairly unimpressed by the breakfast and the coffee was surprisingly bad in Italy of all places , Nice hotel easily accessible by the underground from Centrale walking distance to the city centre clean room comfortable bed 
485769,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, The room was strangely a bit cold despite of A C beeing off and 28 C outside , Staff very nice and efficient especially at the reception desk Very good mattress Very clean room Good position in the Navigli area Very good wifi free of charge 
485770,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Staff at front desk wasn t particularly helpful in responding to basic questions including about tourism in Milan , Very clean room and facilities But room itself a bit small 
485771,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, The staff at the reception desk are arguing with you or even shouting at you when you have a remark about something instead of correcting it Especially 1 guy that is working there They never greet you when you pass by the reception and overall their attitude is not hospitable at all ,No Positive
485772,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, relatively noisy You can hear the people in the corridor So if guest arrive late not ideal, easy access good location clean good size room coffee tea facilities in the room 24hour access good value for money with Booking deal
485773,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, No parking available but close to the hotel you can find underground parking be adviced that prices for parking are not cheap at all , Excellent position of the hotel just 10 minutes walk from Navighli Cleanless of the room Comfort Friendly staff 
485774,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, No complaints , In what I consider to be a safe area Close to tram stop and not far from metro stop Easy check in and check out Saved our cases while we did a last minute shop Lots of places to eat close by 10 minute walk to canal area Spacious up to date extremely clean room Only stayed 2 nights but room tidied each day 1 soft pillow and one firm Nice and warm Plenty of tea and coffee Plenty of guest soap shampoo body wash etc

485777,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, I stayed in this hotel in November and got a very very hot room as it was sunny and warm outside and the room was facing the sun It was really impossible to stay inside as i could not change the temperature of the room In this hotel temperature is centrally controlled So when I asked to change room in order to get at least one not facing the sun the hotel receptionist started talking very loud almost screaming and saying it was not true that my room was that hot According to him my room temperature was ok and so he could not give me another room We had this super loud discussion and in the end I had to sleep with the window open in November Of course the day after i got sick I understand that November is considered winter in MIlan and so hotels turn the heating on also during the day even if it is super warm outside but you do not expect staff talking to a customer like this in a 4 star hotel The day after i changed hotel stayed in a una one and staff people were super nice and friendly plus i could change my room temperature ,No Positive
485778,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, It is a 4 stars hotel and the room was not in that level small and tiny TV for payment The shower did not work well Breakfast too expensive , Location
485779,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Wi fi was not working in our room Staff suggested that maybe it was because our room was far from the router but had little interest in resolving the issue Tried a different staff member on the following day same lack of interest , Out of the city but an easy and quick metro ride into the city centre Clean Great breakfast Close to restaurants in the canal area

485781,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, Some not all of the front desk staff seemed a bit moody This doesn t include the cleaners who were lovely , Location room park opposite was nice to sit and have a drink There was a lovely little coffee shop over the road Mood which did a coffee ask for Americano else they ll bring you an espresso and a croissant for 2Euro This hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from the Metro so the location is fine 
485782,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, We paid 5 eu for using inthernet on tv or something like that suprisingly because i didnt noticed any info about it and the room is a little bit small , Good wifi connection nice bathroom and very close to metro 
485783,Hotel Mercure Milano Solari, My husband and I were beginning our honeymoon here and requested an early check in to relax as we had just gotten off the plane The receptionist told us that it was not possible but we had been able to request the option so that was confusing and we would have to wait until at least 1pm We returned at 1pm and she then changed her answer and said not until 2pm And it was not until the strike of 2pm that we were allowed in our room In the future do not offer an early check in option if you are not able to provide one , The hotel is very close 3 blocks to a subway stations which train line is very convenient to get to all of the major sites of Venice But it is far enough out of the center to be tranquil Great location
