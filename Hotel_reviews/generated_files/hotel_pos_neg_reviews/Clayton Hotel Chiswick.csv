225795,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, This hotel could be excellent but is let down by the finer details Stains on bedding not changed for 4 days No more toiletries provided after we used them first day No more refreshments after first day TV didn t work properly Grout chipped away from the shower flooring Water doesn t drain in shower so you stand in 3 inches of dirty water All petty in the scheme of things this is a really good hotel but for the price should be better, Really big corner room provided due to the amount of luggage we had Bed was extremely comfortable and large Nice clean bathroom with separate shower and bath Lovely bar area downstairs Good coffee machine in room Really quiet we had a great sleep
225796,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Price and working space in the room The TV takes the majority of the space on the working station , Very close to the Chiswick Business Center were I worked during my stay Restaurant to improve in the choice of dishes Excellent location close to Heatrow airport Good the price of the taxi provided by the hotel
225797,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The bathroom was not exceptionally clean The location was a bit awkward so we had to switch a couple of trains in order to go to and back from central , The room was good for the price we paid given that we were in London and far from central The tube station was a few minutes away so we always walked to it We had a lot of time between our flight and checking out The staff was friendly enough to let us leave our luggage for a while until we had to leave 
225798,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Not a thing, The burger meal we had was excellent as was the breakfast too I was pleasantly surprised how clean and roomy and the service and staff are a credit to rhe hotel would definitely return
225799,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing , We had a perfect stay at the Clayton Even we d some tiny Problem with our booked room we got a double instead of twin room but Housekeeping and reception Team solved the Problem quickly All staff very friendly helpful and professional Facilities were in good order and interior nice and modern Room was clean and spacey with comfy beds bath even with good space and tidy and clean Breakfast was top tasty and enough from everything for everyone Public Transport even to reach in within very short distance walk to Gunnersbury Stn and bus directly infront of the Hotel We ll definately come again

225801,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The room lighting was a little too dim , The staff had a chilled bottle of Prosecu waiting for us to toast my daughters birthday along with a greeting card Staff very accomadating excellent choice of menu items to satisfy all tastes 
225802,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, This should not put anyone off staying here as we will definitely book again These points are mainly for feedback for the hotel however there were a few niggly things like reception very busy staff were struggling a little and it took a long time to check in Room 122 door key card very temperamental only after sticking the card in 10 times did it work some of the cups and mugs weren t washed on any of the nights that we stayed there the lock on the bathroom door handle kept coming off room service did not collect the tray when we phoned them so the dirty plates remained outside the door there was no hot water on the 1st floor for the morning of my meeting so had a cold shower still trying to sort out the payment as it was taken off incorrectly however they are helping me Room was a little small and had a balcony which we couldn t go out onto parking ticket didn t work once validated to stay current us to come and go as we needed to so got stuck at the barrier, Really lovely hotel really clean and staff were really helpful and friendly Wouldn t park outside as there was a lot of glass on the road however the undercover parking was very convenient Very comfortable bedding and good food 
225803,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, 1 Interestingly I was able to use my Diners Club credit card to pay for drinks breakfast etc but it was not accepted as a guarantee at the reception so I was not able to charge anything to my room 2 Whilst most of the staff were fantastic there was one day where the guy responsible insisted on personally seating everybody at breakfast Since he was alone this led to a 15 minute queue to get into breakfast Most Europeans are quite capable of finding a table and seating themselves ,No Positive
225804,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bedroom air conditioning wasn t working first day and night weather was hot making it very difficult to sleep general fault in all bedrooms apparently No concessions offered by hotel e g water iced drinks Breakfast expensive at 15 each on the day luckily much cheaper alternatives within easy reach Vegetarian meal ordered in bar turned up with chicken in it replaced easily enough but ate it on my own as my wife had finished her meal , Clean well presented hotel helpful staff Very comfortable bed Location good as we were going to an event in Kew Gardens Gunnersbury station only two minutes walk 
225805,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bar closed early If getting back from a concert event at Twickenham take the shuttle to Richmond and then tube We didn t and regretted it , We didn t have the breakfast as it was dear and there was a very good caf across the road selling breakfast for a quarter of the price Bus to Twickenham was good 
225806,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Lovely hotel and nice location would stay there again Good service and a nice ambience in the hotel The location of underground just across the road so good base for getting around London 
225807,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, No bathrobes limited selection of refreshment in the room , Comfy bed quiet air conditioned room amazing towels Very helpful and friendly staff Fab location 
225808,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The bathroom was very dark not great for getting makeup hair done etc , Bed was amazing room was lovely bathroom was dark and would have preferred a separate shower cubical 
225809,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Only things that could be improved as luxurious and comfortable was the bedroom it could do with less furniture so you can move about without hitting into things and a bigger shower head lovely big walk in shower tiny shower head , We were attending an event in Twickenham stadium Easy drive to hotel straight off M4 Secure underground parking 16 overnight Prime location 2 minute walk to tube 10 minutes max on tube to Richmond then free shuttle bus to event Bed was very comfortable good quality linen and towels Breakfast was buffet good quality 
225810,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We happened to be given a disabled room which would be good for its proper purpose but the bathroom had no shelves at all no washbasin plug very low fittings and curious lighting etc , Good business style hotel in great location for west London Heathrow etc Adjacent parking 16 
225811,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The breakfast service appeared to be short staffed tables were not cleared promptly guests were moving dirty dishes adding to the uncleared tables I would expect tables to be cleared at breakfast not nice to eat your breakfast with a view of someone else s dirty crockery We could not adjust the air conditioning in our room 226 it was preset to 24C The lighting in the bathroom could have been brighter , Bed very comfortable room well appointed Our room was quiet and of a generous size with only some traffic noise Bathroom spacious with a separate shower and bath Plenty of secure parking beneath the hotel I recommend the cook to order omelette for breakfast and the home made muesli was delicious There was a good range of healthy options for breakfast 
225812,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, nothing bad to say but rooms could come with a mini fridge and dressing gowns for guests , The room was very clean as if no one had ever been in there The bed was co comfy and I was very happy overall with my stay 
225813,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The bar was very noisy and a lot of rubbish had been allowed to collect on and around the tables on the terrace outside , The rooms were clean very comfortable and well equipped Great showers Location is good for Kew Gardens and the M4 
225814,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The rooms were serviced very late in the day i e after 6pm even 7pm so no dry towels if you want to shower before heading out in the evening , Good sized room for London hotel Close to tube Great for access to Chiswick Kew Richmond and Wimbledon 
225815,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I did not like the policy of taking both my British debit card and my Euro Master bank card and removing the money from my euro account for 7 days when I had specifically asked them not to do so Upon leaving I was informed the money would be refunded I paid on checking out with my UK debit card I object to the intervention in my euro account This is bad practice and I shall not return there because of it ,No Positive
225816,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We had an initial problem at check in but it all got resolved eventually A good 10 mins walk before you really start to reach Chiswick High St shops cafes , Great location when driving in from M4 so close to tube and bus stops Large rooms tasty breakfast Great for street parking at the weekends a car park on site makes a stay of a couple of nights affordable We sampled the local theatre at Turnham Green The Tabard Theatre pub enjoyed it 
225817,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room service breakfast wasn t that good Slightly cold and not all the preserves were given jam sauce Cold toast TV was very sow to change channels , Very clean and friendly Good price Dinner was very good Parking was a good price 
225818,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The prices for food and drink within the hotel No mini fridge so you can t have a cold drink or store any food , The girls at reception were great and very helpful The room was very good size quiet and clean The bed was incredibly comfortable The surrounding area of the hotel is clearly a more posh place in town so it s a nice place to stay The aircon was perfect The shower was large 
225819,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Very good breakfast plenty of choice Friendly and approachable staff Hotel was very clean and comfortable and very tastefully decorated and furnished Would stay there again 
225820,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing was to dislike only I wish I had planned to stay longer, The hotel was perfect welcoming staff helpful and knowledgeable helping us to make plans for during the stay rooms excellent clean spacious and everything required for a comfortable and enjoyable stay the food was excellent and the breakfast was one of the best I have ever experienced when staying in a hotel I will definitely be recommending and using this hotel whenever I go to London travelling to all areas was simple and quick the tube stations being so close 
225821,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Some lighting need replacements dialing for room service can be a challenging to get through to the other end , Clean friendly staff and comfortable bed
225822,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The hotel was fullbooked so the breakfast service was not so good , Good location near BSI and underground station Local pub s just round the corner Bus stops outside the hotel 
225823,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The shower head was faulty and water pressure not very powerful was very disappointing considering its only recently been refurbished, Very convenient location
225824,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There were no biscuits with the tea and coffee making facility , We stayed here as we were going to an evening concert at Wembley It didn t take long to get back and the hotel was quiet and very comfortable after a day in London Breakfast was good 
225825,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Noisy room next to Honda Dealer motorcycles chop , Location for us The Village of Cheswick has great restaurants and good shopping Convenient to the District Line to London and Kingsford Hampton Court 
225826,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Room was lovely bed was large and very comfortable Staff were lovely couldn t do enough to help even when being treated horribly by other guests Modern very clean and breakfast included large selection worth the money Gutted we booked the one night rather than two 
225827,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The bathroom facilities were not what you would expect for 4 accommodation The shower was like a public swimming pool shower complete with other people s hair and a funky smell There was also hair in the bed when I pulled back the duvet , The staff were friendly and breakfast was good 
225828,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Didn t get wake up call booked on arrival for day of departure Could have been a problem as was catching very early flight but had set own personal alarms as a backup thankfully , Outstanding quality of room Comfy beds fab bathroom Love Chiswick and handy location by 3 train stations nearest Gunnersbury 
225829,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I booked through booking com and had issues amending a booking with the hotel The hotel and booking com need to sort this poor communication out , Very nice newly refurbished hotel lovely big rooms convenient parking which was 16 a day Great breakfast Very convenient for Heathrow only 20 minute drive 
225830,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I only stayed in a regular room once and I will never do it again Although the main bedroom was clean the bathroom was a disgrace room 407 if I remember correctly It was a straight tile floor It felt looked like a public shower It also smelt bad due to having no ventilation i e leaving all the dampness after a shower The hotel can be slow to answer the phone or not answer it at all It takes a few attempts I even sent them a comment on twitter to complain about this because I had to call the hotel after I checked out but nobody answered the phone after keeping me on hold for 6 minutes it just hung up They need to fix that otherwise the staff are great , The king executive suites are a good size for a fair price The facilities are good and the staff are polite and very helpful They only have a problem answering the phones efficiently 
225831,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, One thing to note is that the parking on site is 16 a day and not validated however at the weekends at least there is street parking on the side streets , The hotel was clean and pretty comfortable The staff were really nice They upgraded us to a room with a cup coffee maker which was great to have in the morning We didn t spend a load of time in the hotel as we were using it just as a base after a night out but the bed was comfortable the room quiet and the shower was lovely It is much more of business focused hotel in my opinion but serviced us well for the night 
225832,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Convenient location when coming from the west and for ease of travel into the centre of London after check in Good bar food and rooms better than others we have stayed in around London Great breakfast cafe opposite Short walk to shops bars and restaurants on Chiswick High Street No hesitation in recommending this hotel 
225833,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Lack of information about the room How to find the lifts work the air con insert card to work lights etc Overworked staff in the bar late evening stressful for them Needs more information signs in the breakfast area , Cleanliness of the rooms large bathroom comfortable bed lovely Ease of booking cabs Smiley receptionists 
225834,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, On check in whilst we booked a Deluxe double we were provided with a disabled room very minimal I advised Reception and we were moved to a deluxe room Whilst I appreciate mistakes do happen this is a simple allocation of room and should not happen Apparently the Receptionist was new , Excellent pillows Bar staff very friendly Food was hot tasty and good value
225835,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room was too hot and A C was set and locked at 24oC which is too hot for me Twice staff were asked to take a look but nothing changed Check out at 6 30am on Saturday was very slow only one operative and one customer but took 15 minutes Offer to email bill to speed things up failed to provide the bill , Room was well appointed Breakfast was good and choice for evening meal was also good 
225836,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Wedding party music on until at least 1am on Saturday night Made four calls to front desk between 23 45 00 15 not one call was picked up We book Clayton because it is peaceful and quiet out in Chiswick We re unsure if we ll book in again , Comfy bed Exceptional housekeeping Great communal space to relax around the hotel Lovely extra features now that renovations are complete 
225837,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The reception staff were not very attentive and not driven my the customer , The hotel was very beautiful and decorated very well The food in the Grill was wonderful 
225838,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The only negative thing I can say was I didn t have a long enough stay to enjoy the hotel as I arrived late evening and had to leave at 6am Next time I d like to spend more time here , The bathroom had both a shower and a separate bath very handy great quality blackout curtains which made the room pitch black while it was still sunny outside Everything was clean modern and stylish it was a very luxurious hotel Train station within a couple of minutes walk from the hotel 
225839,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing, Great location with easy access into central London Hotel is modern and has everything you need plus good food and ice bar lounges Recommend
225840,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Quiet a few of the lights were not working in the room , Lovely hotel we always stay here when we visit London Comfy beds quiet room and well priced Good location only 2 mins walk to tube station 
225841,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The lights in the bathroom were dimmed very low and there was no way to turn them up which was kind of a pain The room also wasn t as big and modern as the photos portrayed and considering the cost was s bit of a let down No robes either , The food in the restaurant and room service was super yummy The location was great and close to the metro station The bed was really comfortable and the room was nice 
225842,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Breakfast could have been better For the standard of the hotel I would have expected a higher quality of the cooked options Maybe more to order , Coming from the west the location was great and the ease of being able to pull straight in and park under the hotel Not too expensive either 16 for 24 hours A very short walk to Gunnersbury tube taking me directly to the Embankment in the morning really easy When I booked it was 145 for a Superior Double which made it EXCELLENT value However when I tried to book again for the following week it had doubled in price which made it not at all good value so I went elsewhere 
225843,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Of course there are times when a lot of people have to be checked in all at once and things get a little hectic Nothing too bad Everyone maintained their professionality and worked to solve problems , The beds are wonderfully comfortable and the whole hotel is clean and crisp the rooms are large and the hotel is very quiet The breakfast is astounding and the staff are cheerful and friendly and there is a good selection of newspapers 
225844,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, 1 staff member was quite rude and totally ignored me when i asked politely for some more tea , Roomss were a great size and beds very comfy Can highly recommend
225845,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There simply are not enough staff They could barely cope with bust Sunday breakfast time and struggled to clear tables for guests arriving A cue did start to form I felt sorry for them as they were doing their best but could not possibly deliver the required service with so few of them Likewise there were only ever 2 receptionists on duty at any given time which for a hotel that size seemed inadequate I had tried to phone twice to let them know that we would be arriving late no one picked up and that was at 9pm not a notoriously busy time I noticed people waiting to check out as well on Sunday morning that was well ahead of the busier check out time between 11 12noon , Room was really comfortable with a huge bed gorgeous bathroom it was conveniently situated for our needs on this particular trip but rooms overlook either a busy road or in our case a large Honda dealership You don t go there for views The soundproofing is excellent though both against the outside world between rooms The buffet breakfast is better than many being both well presented offering a good variety of what was tasty food Particularly good sausages the fresh fruit was really good too 
225846,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, When we arrived we were given a room which was very noisey it had 3 large ventilation vents just outside the window We asked several times to change rooms it was only after we asked to speak to the duty manager that we got a response Then we were given a quiet room We wanted dinner in the hotel restaurant but were told it was fully booked that evening It was not fully booked they had closed it laid up for breakfast We were told to eat in the bar but there was a football match on so it was very noisey We went out to eat When we got back the card for the door did not work so we had to go downstairs to get that sorted The staff hardly spoke English repeatedly misunderstood what we were saying The location of this hotel is good for Kew Gardens but I would not go back to this hotel as the service was poor the price for the room was high , The room was large comfortable The bed was of excellent quality The room was quiet I had requested a quiet room 
225847,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bathroom dark poor plumbing basin to ages to clear water to bath very poor took ages to fill drain smell from shower outlet overall not acceptable for 4star hotel, Location and surrounding area comfy bed bar area good public transport links
225848,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, No complaints , Altogether excellent hotel comfortable and most accommodating Due to the nature of our trip to London we were only looking for a base for a night This meant that we did not get the opportunity to fully use the hotel which was a shame as it was most inviting 
225849,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Breakfast not included and car parking 16 for under 24 hrs , Convenient driving from the West Country parking not included but available Comfortable accommodation and plenty of space Very polite helpful staff 
225850,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There was nothing about the hotel that I didn t like The staff were all very friendly , The hotel was convenient for a family occasion and close to our relatives in Chiswick Transport and underground made it easy to get around 
225851,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The showers looked modern however the pressure of water coming out of the shower head was average at best , The interior was sleek and relatively modern which was surprising giving that the exterior of the hotel wasn t on par 
225852,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room was dark a bit worn down shower was damp and had an ingress of water from the roof Breakfast was good and wholesome but very dry There were enough healthy foods on the menu to justify a greasy breakfast option My complaints are just petty the stay was lovely overall Brighten up the rooms for god s sake , The general look of the hotel and the staff 
225853,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Not much of a view but it was a big window with lots of light so wasn t a problem at all , It was an impressive big room with a huge comfy bed Large spacious bathroom with a good size bathtub too Conveniently close to the tube station so very easy to get into inner London 
225854,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The weather was cool and breezy no fault of the Hotel s, The bedroom was very spacious and the Aircon was very good when we needed it Lifts were speedy and never full 
225855,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The pillows was like sleeping on rocks the shower was so noisy and we told reception Saturday mornings and we thought would ve fixed got in the shower Sunday morning but oh no it hadn t been fixed ,No Positive
225856,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, the bed was a bit soft and not very comfortable the pillows were to big for my neck , Maria from reception was super friendly she showed me 3 different rooms and asked me to choose between them The breakfast was amazing with alot of choices The rooms are very clean with complementary water Photos are 100 accurate The hotel is located in west London 10 minutes from chiswick highstreet 
225857,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We didn t bother with the hotel breakfast as 12 per head is a lot If you want breakfast there are a couple of cafes near the underground station , We used this hotel as a base to travel into central London for the weekend by underground and it worked out very well Gunnersbury district line station is only a few minutes walk away and with a visitor oyster card the tube worked out quite inexpensive We parked in the hotel car park for 16 per 24 hours which is not bad for London prices Our room was large comfortable clean and quiet with a very nice bathroom We would definitely do this again 
225858,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, That I couldn t stay a good few extra days and enjoy the solitude and relaxation , It was a very special milestone birthday When I eventually got to my room early hours of the morning after celebrating at my birthday party there were birthday banners put up for me A birthday cake champagne chilled I was so touched and appreciative for the attention and acknowledgment And it was nice to be able to sit down and take in the night celebrations I was so busy being the hostess I didn t get the chance to really party the way I would have hoped I didn t even have a drink so it was really really lovely to exhale have a nice drink and enjoy the moment Staff everyone at the hotel are extremely lovely Breakfast complimentary also for my birthday treat Late checkout I cannot fault anything They aimed to accommodate everything They enabled to make my big celebration even more special 
225859,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There was no free parking for guests payment was at a hourly rate The layout of where rooms are was like a maze can be slightly confusing when lost , The property had an underground car parking which I knew my car would be secure Excellent surrounding Brilliant decor It s a very modern stylish grand building Bed was extremely cozy 
225860,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing that I can think of , I didn t eat at the hotel Only one negative I was directed from the underground however I took the tube to Chiswick Park not realising that the hotel is only a few yards away from Gunnersberry Tube Staff should be instructed to state WHICH tube station to arrive at 
225861,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Slight noise from works being carried out in nearby car dealership, The huge bed was fantastic it was the longest lay in I ve had for a very long time I didn t want to get up
225862,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Every thing was likeable, We liked everything the parking facilities friendly and efficient staff the hotel restaurant very comfy rooms so near to places of interest So thank you
225863,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Okay so first of all it costs 16 00 to park in the hotel car park which is an absolute liberty considering i got charged the rate of being there a day when i wasn t I think that is disgusting Me and my boyfriend went down to Chiswick High Road for dinner and drinks On arrival back to the hotel the gentleman doing the night shift spoke to me like a disgrace I couldnt remember the room number we was staying in and ask for him to look it up He looked and spoke to me like I was a Peasant I couldn t understand why he was so angry he even put his hand up and told me to wait a second The most horrendous customer service for a 4 star hotel in West London, The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was spacious 
225864,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Second time I ve stayed here unfortunately room wasn t as great as last time Compared to previous room smaller n bathroom was old Also need more staff on a night especially when holding an event Had to wait for a while before being seen to at desk , Excellent location for visiting West London Bed is lovely had a beautiful nights sleep 
225865,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The hotel looked worrisome from the outside Exterior needs updating There is an arresting smell of oud in the lobby A milder fresh scent is more desirable in my opinion There is a general lack of warmth in the hotel It would not hurt if reception staff were more friendly The rest we encountered apart from the 2 staff mentioned were sullen and did not seem like they enjoyed their job The shower temp was a bit iffy but resolved after repeated tweeking , The rooms are all updated to a modern standard Good sized shower too Hotel is 2 minutes away from Gunnersberry tube rail station and is one stop away from Kew Gardens There were 2 friendly chaps on the staff one at the bar Ricardo and the other was serving food an actor I forgot his name Breakfast was a good spread Only had it once though so I am not sure on variety on a daily basis if one is staying longer 
225866,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Strange cleaning policy no daily vacuum cleaning sometimes do not empty litter bins Laundry is quite expensive but we found a lovely self laundry place a few steps further along High Rd and did our laundry in 20 mins for just 5 50 GBP tumble dry for 2 GBP , Good location 3 min walk to the tube station Very nice neighborhood lots of restaurants cafes shops Quiet area Very helpful staff Tea coffee in the rooms 
225867,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The only thing I couldn t work out was the room temperature controls It might help to provide instructions of how to operate them , I booked 5 double delux rooms and each and every room was excellent spacious rooms with huge bathrooms Check in and check out was very simple and we were able to leave our bags with the hotel after checking out which enabled us to partake in some retail therapy before heading home I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends 
225868,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The doors to the bedrooms were not on slow closing and each morning we were woken by neighbouring room doors slamming on the way the breakfast I asked for a room on a high floor and was given a room on the first floor the lowest possible , The hotel has recently been refurbished and was very clean and modern The room was comfortable and had everything we required 
225869,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The staff wasn t very friendly I forgot Cards in the room and I wrote an E Mail asking that they send me my Cards home To date I have not received a response whether my cards were found and whether it is possible to send them to me This is not acceptable for a Hotel The room was very loud and the bed was too small for 2 People and not very comfortable , the position was further good the breakfast was good The room was big and clean 
225870,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, a little too corporate Not quite sure what they were thinking with the bathroom colour yellow its overpowering we booked a twin checked on checkout it was a twin but it was a double we then had to wait for them to change it all around which was a pain Better attention needs to be paid , ok value for money 
225871,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Breakfast was not included I did not have a chance to grade it , Big clean room silence outside the window professinal staff Bus stop on the main Chiswick road near the hotel with many routes Gunnersbury tube station at 200 300 metres to the left 
225872,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The room did not have a fridge just an empty fridge sized cupboard It took upward of 30mins to get into the heart of the city so is not ideal for people looking to go in regularly The hotel obviously caters to the businesses in the close vicinity as much cheaper rooms with similar services can be found elsewhere including closer to the city , If you are there for business in that region then the location is perfect and the Gunnersbury station is very close by The hotel was quite well kept and clean with excellent finishings 
225873,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We ordered two coffees in the bar area at about 11 20 am We were asked to sit down and someone would bring them over very good idea It took nearly half an hour before they arrived and then only after a reminder The reason was obvious there was only one person on the bar the till was at the opposite end of the bar to where she was serving drinks and making coffee and the bar area was busy with people wanting drinks The queue should have been obvious to the three people manning the near empty reception desk ,No Positive
225874,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I had to wait 20 minutes to could pay for an additional breakfast This time i had to stand front of the breakfast room A new wave looking young guy with a german name had no remorces to keep me waiting He was the only negative i faced during my three days stay The only one who has nothing to do with that great hotel No smile no good morning But let s be honest his behaviour can not describe that great hotel and the rest of the very kind staff working there , Great location and very clean room Helpful staff at the reception Ladies at the front desk gave us a five star feeling Very confortable huge bed and a nice view over the city 
225875,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Night staff at reception on one of the night s of our stay was rude and very unprofessional , Modern decor closeness to London Tube and bus services 
225876,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The location is in the suburb of London around 30mins from city center by underground train So for those of you who like to go back and forth several times a day to the hotel this place might not be a wise option for you But its easy access by public transportation just a few minutes walk fr gunnersbury tube station So for us its not really a big problem , The room including bathroom is clean and spacious we slept comfortably and felt refreshed in the morning Good choice of food for breakfast more than enough to get us through the day 
225877,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I booked 2 double rooms but got 2 twin rooms so had a single bed Parked on nearby street and brand new car got deliberately scratched all over Not hotels fault of course , Lovely hotel fantastic breakfast lots of choice 
225878,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There have been some minor timing problem with the cleaning ladies Tried to enter the room at 9 while we were just waking up , Very good breakfast the staff is very helpful and always available
225879,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, nothing as far as it went top service , the good standard were at every detail personnel in the front desk cleaners restaurant Then the room as a space arrangement and facility pristine clean really good bed and toilette facilities however the light on the toilette a bit low a crit the room sound proof and well set 
225880,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Hot breakfast could have been hotter Water in shower hot but hot water in wash basin only ever luke warm, Extremely comfortable bed spotlessly clean with white fluffy towels and crisp bed linen Good selection and quality of food at breakfast but the hot food could have been hotter Reception staff excellent as always restaurant staff a little slow to clear away dirty dishes etc Located 2 mins walk from tube great stay 
225881,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, None , location cleanliness and comfort great staffs who are willing to check you at earlier time depending on availability and offer good choices for their guests 
225882,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I wish they offer free parking or a reduced parking charge when u book to stay in the hotel Parking was a bit expensive, Everything was terrific More than I expected
225883,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The restaurant was closed all weekend and we not told prior to booking and on arrival our room was not ready although we checked in after the check in time, The room was comfortable
225884,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, This is a comment for Booking com we booked when flagged up breakfast included Actual booking no breakfast Also annoyed that same hotel bedrooms prices reduced later Your comments please, Everything highly recommended
225885,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There wasn t a clear sign to point to the reception desk as it s in the corner of the entrance , The room was so immaculate I felt like a celebrity The price was also awesome Oh especially the view and style of Windows Basically it s a place I would like to visit again just to make sure it was real not a dream 
225886,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, At times outside tables were not cleared of glasses or cleaned I think this was due to staff shortage , Sean the barman was faultless did everything and more but could do with more Help at times 10 10
225887,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Very good muffins I liked especially the design of the room and of the hotel the bed was very confortable The area where the hotel is located is also close to undergroud station bus station Good breakfast 
225888,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There was no fridge and No sleeper in the room We were not offered Breakfast as standard as per Booking observation , Comfortable Room size and Beddings 
225889,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The room was a bit small The water to shower with was not hot on the Saturday morning I did not get the wake up call I asked for, Free parking on nearby streets after 5 on the Friday No parking restrictions on the weekend Hotel was clean Staff friendly and professional Very good breakfast with a lot of choice 
225890,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, When we first entered our room we found out that mirrors weren t cleaned properly as well as the sink and the kettle The sink was too small and the tap was too far away and I cannot wash my clothes properly The design of the washroom was weird because everything was squeezed and next to the wall while the washroom itself was quite big The hotel was closed to the train station however it takes time to travel to the city center around half an hour , Breakfast here might be a little expensive however the croissant was incredibly delicious The bed was very comfortable and the lady who served us in Friday evenings remembered our seatings and she was very kind The location wasn t too bad it s very closed to the train station The wifi here was very smooth 
225891,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Expensive car park but then it is London , Excellent hotel Staff very friendly Best hotel bed I ve ever slept in Great location just a couple of minutes from the tube station 
225892,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Coffees and teas could be more freely available with everything else at breakfast instead of having to ask and wait , Some excellent staff comfy beds and very nice food and drink 
225893,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Breakfast wasn t included on our fare which was quite expensive , Installations are great Comfy beds Great bathroom TV 42 Free WiFi very fast 
225894,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Staff were a little abrupt at times but generally ok there was a slight problem with language barrier at times, The feel of the hotel it is very modern and spotlessly clean
225895,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, As often is the case there were not enough tea bags sugar or milk although these were provided after a call to housekeeping Also the Tuna and sweet corn sandwich ordered through room service turned out to be chicken and stuffing which was pleasant though not what was ordered CH was not very easy to operate although a member of staff did come up and explain how it worked , The room was quite large and well appointed Bed linen was good quality and towels also Walk in shower was as requested and had good control of temperature Hanging rail in wardrobe travelled out and down which made hanging clothes very easy Meal in restaurant was good value for money though the dessert was overpriced The location about 400 500 yards from Gunnersbury tube and overland trains was a major bonus Breakfast was expensive but a local caf across the road did jam on toast and tea for 3 00 
225896,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The shower in room 430 makes a sound when you turn on the hot water Bathroom is a bit dated and the shower looks stained , The room was great in general Large bed and very quiet Bar staff and night reception staff were very friendly 
225897,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Poor selection of soft drinks Poor room service ordered food didn t arrive rang back an hour later and told what we ordered wasn t available wasn t informed has to attend reception and complain 4 in the morning ordered at 2 15am , Bed was comfy Nice shower Friendly staff 
225898,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Heating only on when in the room it was cold Cold floor in the bathroom Very noisy doors closing and opening all the time , Big room and bathroom stadard doubleroom Coffee and tea in the room 
225899,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing , We were able to check in early Booked through Booking com and got a great price All members of staff were charming and very helpful Excellent service all round Will be back 
225900,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing , This Hotel was great when it was The Moran It s now even better as The Clayton Very comfortable with excellent welcoming nothing too much trouble staff Excellent food in The Grill at The Bar Ideally situated too 
225901,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, It s a little pricey for food and drink , The room was perfect The bed was really comfortable and the staff were great The location was perfect for us 
225902,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, No adjustable shower head so no way to wash hair without taking a shower No shaver socket in the bathroom Air extraction in a bathroom stopped working mid week which wasn t pleasant , Nice and big beds Large room and comfy room 
225903,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room 131 was horrible Wifi was terrible in room connection was too weak to work from laptop room was so far from everyone else and staying alone did not feel very secure water was luke warm couldn t have a hot shower couldn t have a bath as the water was cold after only an inch in the tub and then it wouldn t drain, Very clean private hotel staff very helpful Food was great Location was close to office
225904,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Food is very bad Not tasty and not fresh A very poor breakfast costs 14 95 pounds Cappuccino costs 3 pounds more Car parking 16 pounds a day , New hotel
225905,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Only one towel left in the room each day despite advising reception house keeping Arrived home one day 5 PM room still hadn t been closed , Nice rooms
225906,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing I didn t like, What s not to like about this hotel Rooms are large with lovely showers rooms Although some have baths with shower the newer standard rooms are smaller but beautifully decorated Such a relaxing place to stay Breakfast is lovely too with an amazingly large choice Recommend the Vitality Breakfast Food in the restaurant and bar great and good value The staff are so attentive and friendly It is my favourite place to stay in London now I have found it And I have stayed in very many Now I am sorry I have given this revue because I am finding it increasingly hard to book a room it very quickly gets booked out Will probably be harder now 
225907,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The lady directing seating for breakfast in the restaurant Sunday morning was extremely abrupt Hoping it was just an off day for her Was surprised the restaurant was closed Saturday evening although food was available in the bar, Reception and bar staff extremely polite and courteous
225908,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The quilt on the bed was awful Slightest movement it made a noise The thermostat in the bedroom automatically clicked to heat after 10 mins of air con so bedroom was very hot and stuffy No windows opened Asked for new batteries and toilet roll which took forever and a few reminders to get them to bring it to our bedroom Booked a deluxe double but looked more like a standard room, The bed was very comfy but the quilt was awful The free wifi was fab hotel was very clean 
225909,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, The best feature about this hotel is the amazing hospitality of the staff everyone was absolutely lovely thank you for such an amazing experience Very courteous polite and professional 
225910,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, It was all good for us If there was a slight gripe it was only that our room was not ready on arrival but we only had a 10minute which was fine, First time at this hotel and we think it would be a great choice if flying out from Heathrow as the tube station is just over the road and only a few stops from the airport There is a bus stop right outside the door for public transport links We found the hotel to be modern clean and contemporary Our bedroom was very spacious and the bathroom was enormous with a walk in shower and huge stand alone bathtub The breakfast was excellent with such a huge variety to choose from and all was of excellent quality fresh fruits smoothies porridge cereals yogurts pastries continental selection and a gluten free selection It was a self service buffet but waiter service for tea coffee and any special requests e g omelettes poached eggs ect We stayed at The Clayton in Dublin last year and this too was an excellent choice and of a very good standard It seemed popular with couples families and solo travellers 
225911,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The parking pricing structure is confusing and suggests guests get a concession which of course they should be given It is actually 2 an hour flat rate but that is wrapped up in confusing notices about charging rates that confuse guests into thinking it is 14 for hours or 16 for 24 hours parking Hotel guests should have clear information about charges from the start , This is an excellent beautifully clean hotel with very high aesthetic and quality standards Friendly efficient staff made everything very easy and welcoming It is a good place to be 
225912,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Can t think of anything , Lovely huge bed and bath big enough for two as well as a large shower Just a bargain for what was paid A city view too One of the best hotels I ve stayed in in London 
225913,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Perhaps not ideal for tourists a bit far from Central London but still worth it and close to LHR, There s not much not to like about this hotel Room had great decor was large with comfortable bed Bathroom had both shower and bath which was a bonus 
225914,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Parking was far to expensive considering it was not central , Fab hotel Easy access to central London The room was huge and the bathroom was great Would stay again 
225915,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The only thing so say was the tv and coffee making as far as I could see came wth no instructions so there was a little trial and error but that is the ONLY thing, The whole room was fantastic and the service was excellent The staff were lovely 
225916,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The air conditioning in the room would not turn off so the room was very very hot noisy because of the fan I even rang reception 3 times they could not turn it off So a very bad night sleep for the family,No Positive
225917,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We expected a fridge in the bedroom as it was a Deluxe room The main door and the bathroom door were slightly stiff making it difficult to keep it quiet to other customers when trying to open close them The bathroom lighting was very poor specially near the mirror very poor visibility i e if you need to do a wet shave and you can t see if it is a good shave The competition is aware of the issue and they have made found solutions for it http ibuwe com wonderful led mirrors for bathrooms fancy design led mirrors for bathrooms backlit wall mount mirror bathroom vanity lighted commercial illuminated in san diego, The location is very good walking distance from public transport is very good The staff was very friendly including the cleaning assistants that helped with a mix up with the beds in one of the rooms Breakfast was very good with a different range of options that was for everyone choices and staff was quick and available The bedroom was good too size temperature and the floor too we where on the 5th was quiet at times doors slammed too hard 
225918,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I was told there were bathrobes in room none in room asked from desk they said they d some a one up never got it asked why on checkout they said that they were very short of them My TV had no sound 2 different engineers came to room and could not fix I was offered a different room at 1 am On checkout was told that the TV Sky was very temperamental This hotel is potentially amazing but is let down by the finishing touches that makes a place memorable and relaxing, Upgraded to exec room very good Clean and slick
225919,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Service provided by the staff We arrived at 14 30 half and hour after check in our room still wasn t ready We were then told we could have a coffee and then that was changed and we were put in a family room In arrival at the room we went to make a drink and the milk has curdled split After attempting to call the reception and all the other number on the phone we eventually got through to Someone and asked for fresh milk and teabags We waited an hour whilst getting ready and still nothing has arrived again started the battle to get someone on reception Someone came to the door we asked for milk they said that s housekeeping and walked off We had also request a room service menu which arrived 1 5 hours after our call so too late to order The milk never arrived so my mum who I had bought to celebrate her 60th birthday had to go downstairs to make a complaint Upon return to the hotel at 23 45 milk had been left but it was uht and still split Again we had to request fresh milk We had been checked in 10hours now and not even managed to get a drink See phone below who would want to drink that Went for breakfast to be told only one person was booked even though I had booked for 2 via booking com disgusted with this and that they have now charged me additional , Good breakfast selection
225920,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Check in a little awkward I was early and had to wait in the bar no problem however guests arriving after me were given room keys Had to ask manager who explained some rooms weren t ready but I could look at one that was which we ended up staying in as it was perfect maybe the receptionist moody harried by ringing phone could have offered this level of service Other than that MINOR detail this hotel is exceptional and the location perfect , Such a nice hotel staff very helpful receptionist a little moody but manager super helpful
225921,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Cold plates to eat hot cooked breakfast from and the Grill dining room being closed on two evenings out of the three I stayed , Excellent breakfast 
225922,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Heating did not work in bedroom Watch you do not get a room with window facing a wall , Brilliant breakfast served till 11am very spacious comfortable spotless room and bathroom Convenient for Gunnersbury tube and overland rail Staff very helpful and efficient 
225923,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We had very limited hot water in our room We could not fill the bath which was very disappointing , The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were comfortable and just what we needed 
225924,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing, Breakfast was delicious Sometimes serve yourself breakfast can taste like it s been sitting there all night but the Clayton breakfast was excellent Very helpful older gentleman in the breakfast staff 
225925,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Shockingly poor quality of the renovation work Towel rails falling off walls and no sound proofing also paid extra to upgrade room to with bath but the hot tap had been disabled and the shower water was only luke warm Key machine on door didn t work properly and room service food was left in corridor all night and still there after 9 when we went to breakfast , Everything was new recently renovated
225926,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Is just a little bit out from central London if you want to do touristy things but close enough if you just want to use as a base Transport into London not bad , Have stayed here often Staff very helpful and friendly Hotel rooms are very clean and nicely decorated with lovely showers or bathrooms In some cases very large bathrooms And very good value for money Love staying here 
225927,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room wasn t ready for check in when we arrived and was given a totally different room to the one booked as I have checked and so paid more for a certain room but ended up in the cheaper room not good at all,No Positive
225928,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, There is nothing bad i could possibly say about this hotel I didn t want to leave the room and bathroom were beautiful the staff were lovely and the hotel overall was amazing I would definitely go back and would recommend this hotel to anyone Thank you for such an amazing time 
225929,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The views especially I like leaving the curtains open whilst I sleep but the lights from the Honda garage were too bright Also the walls are thin and I can hear a lot people in the corridor whilst I tried to sleep , The showers were really good and the bed was very comfortable
225930,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We booked to stay in a deluxe room but was persuaded to upgrade to an executive room and charged 60 more which had not been explained fully We thought the total additional amount was 30 and not 30 per night The piece of paper we were given stated best possible available room and did not confirm it was an executive I am not sure I would have paid the extra 60 as the room was not as good as the Deluxe room that had been pictured when I booked with Bookings com and it had no Hotel literature or information in the room The carpet was also not too clean , The breakfast was exceptional even though we also had to pay 12 each extra for it I had seen it advertised within the Hotel Website as breakfast free after we had agreed to pay The location was extremely good for getting out and about on the Tube The Hotel itself was nice and had plenty of public seating areas to relax in a pleasant bar with good parking space underneath it Although it was quite expensive at 16 a night 
225931,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Don t think the picture represented the actual room very well I was shown black gloss tiled bathroom and got to our room and it was like a lime green bathroom which wasn t to taste, Loved the size of the bed
225932,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I had a room service order for dinner which was that was hot on the outside but Ice cold in the middle But I rang room service to tell them and they fixed it straight away , The bath was amazing Definitely stopping here again

225935,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, The bed was enormous so partners snoring was a distant murmur Bath was a good size too suitable for soaking under the water rather than 1 2 in 1 2 out 
225936,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bathroom sink and shower did not drain properly Milk provided was off Air con unit clicked on off very noisily all night Unable to turn it off ,No Positive
225937,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing, The bed wasso comfortable we had to lift the bedsheets and check the brand of the mattress so we could buy one Also check out at 12 the breakfast bar closing at 11 Loved it
225938,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Unfortunately we found out that the grill restaurant was not open for dinner in the evening at weekends as they said not many people used it Instead we had to eat in the bar area which was quite loud with drinkers , When checking in we were given the choice of which floor we would like our room Our room was very clean comfortable Staff were friendly helpful breakfast was lovely 
225939,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bacon was quite fatty staff was not friendly bathroom light didn t work towels were smelly and food and drink was quite expensive bar staff didn t know how to poor a pint and no cocktails , Bed was comfy hotel was very clean and pristine lovely views good free wifi handy having a hair dryer iron board and iron nice and warm room and big lovely bath 
225940,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Some of the fixtures in the newly decorated Im guessing bathroom were loose such as towel hooks soap holder shower holder The shower also leaked water over the floor but Im not sure if this was the powerful shower head or a leak Probably the power shower This was room 116 Nothing else negative I can think of , What a lovely hotel The rooms were fresh clean large comfortable with excellent shower The bed was a good size and comfortable The TV was large There was no noise from neighbouring room Its a short walk to Gunnersby tube station so no bother at all We parked in undergound hotel car park with ease Good size although annoying alot of the spaces were reserved Plugs next to the bed which was a HUGE positive love to put phone on charge next to me 
225941,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, The room was very nice and the bath was a nice bonus Cleanliness was spot on and the hotel itself was extremely smart and clean Would definitely come back to stay again and would recommend

225943,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Little bit of mould in the shower Pillows need improvement , Breakfast was very good and the room and hotel overall was quite funky Staff were helpful and pleasant 
225944,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Gym next door to room early morning treadmill thumping for 40 woke us up early on a Saturday morning after a night out , Staff response to a problem Bathroom was great
225945,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There is only one minor criticism as we tried to have some relaxation with a movie and no services exist and very limited service with the TV and radio channels , Our room was impeccable for our last day apart before I move to the USA with my fianc e permanently The hotel itself is more stunning than I remember the last time I visited 10 years prior 
225946,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Freezing in room in room heater didn t seem to work houskeeping were called twice They eventually brought a heater to the room Booking com hadn t passed my details to the hotel so my booking wasn t in the system Had to wait half an hour for it to be sorted out Very inconvenient , Rooms spotless and staff amazing
225947,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Minimal supplies of coffee tea making items No hot chocolate and only 6 tiny containers of milk Not very hospitable No instructions for tv or the room temperature control Breakfast price too high and therefore declined Not really geared for leisure guests although the staff were very friendly , Very comfy beds Quiet room Reception staff very good 
225948,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I requested a late check out but didn t hear anything back just said pending approval , The Bathroom was exquisite as a large fellow i hate Hotel baths always so small this was HUGE highly recommend if you like a nice bath and are a larger person the room service food was among the best food ive had from any hotel 
225949,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The overnight charge for parking in 16 This was not clear at booking , The Clayton is clean and functional with good sized rooms effective workspace and decent quality TV It has a car park underneath it which was important as I needed to be able to park securely Mainly chosen for location Staff were all very nice and helpful 
225950,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The rooms were really cold when we srrived but warmed up quickly There was some noisy maintenance work in the bar The car park is narrow in every sense , Staff were attentive and professional The rooms were very nice 
225951,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Wonderful family room and second Double room Separate shower and bath great Modern decor and spacious Great location for what we travelled to London to enjoy and good transport to city

225955,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Nothing, The Rooms are just epic One of The most comfortable beds in the world Tied with Clarion Hotel Stavanger Norway Your Loyalty is recognised Big League 
225956,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Distance from centre of London , Upgrade on request as it was a birthday Also they sent up a bottle of Prosecco Liked that there were restaurants and bars nearby and close to transport into centre of London 
225957,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The fire alarm went off at 5 in the because someone was smoking in there room it was really hard for me to get back to sleep as I had a early start to the day Not very happy , The bathroom was really nice
225958,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Fire alarm went off for no more than 7 seconds before switching itself off I assumed a mistake or a test at no time did any hotel staff try to inform guests on my floor that it was actually a real emergency as is common practice in all other hotels i have stayed in Only when i looked out of the window some 5 mins later that i realised that guests from other floors were outside with a fire engine Once i left the room there was still no fire alarm but when making my way downstairs using the fire escape i could hear the fire alarm on all other floors Total shambles from poorly trained staff fatalities could have occurred due to lack of basic training Will never consider using Clayton Hotels ever again ,No Positive
225959,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Our room was freezing When I reported this it was ignored Eventually after several attempts to get something done a Manager called Mohamed came to the room and was unhelpful and offensive Ultimately i had to go down to reception and threaten to cause a scene if we were not moved Appalling attitude to a guest problem,No Positive
225960,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Staff could have been more attentive at breakfast we had to ask for tea coffee each day and it wasn t explained that we could order specials as an option , A truly lovely hotel on the outskirts of London Spacious rooms that are fitted with high qualities amenities Breakfast was delicious with a wide range of choices on offer Staff were friendly 
225961,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Insufficient heating in the room Found cigarrette stains on the floor But all the rest faultless , Last minute discount four star hotel excellent staff and installations Silent and confortable rooms 
225962,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We didn t realise there were maintenance works schedule at Gunnersby tube station Travel wasn t as eady as it could have been , The bed was extremely comfortable One occasion the most comfortable I ve experienced in a hotel 
225963,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, 14 95 for a breakfast that was very poor Scrambled eggs were runny and not cooked properly bacon and sausages both cold finished food before waiter brough coffee and I had to find him to get that disappointing as hotel was good , Nice clean room and good bathroom
225964,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The only issue I had was the heating which was virtually non existent the room had some sort of air condition in it but despite the fact that I was constantly increasing the temperature cold air was kept coming out I tried switching it off but it kept turning on on its own for some reason which was rather annoying I mentioned this at the reception they said they were going to look into that but I think they never did it s slightly ironic but it was much warmer in the corridors outside the room than it was inside the room the management at the hotel really needs to have a look into the heating issue as many times I overheard other guests complaining about that too , Location was very convenient on Chiswick High road but away from the busy part and moments away from Gunnersbury tube station The room was kept clean and was very quite mainly due to the fact that it was located at the back of Chiswick High road 
225965,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Toilet wasn t working, We were told by reception that breakfast was til 11am so went down at 10 15 to be told it had closed at 10am and could not have anything So I said I was going to complain to reception was told very grudgingly that they would cook us 3 full English breakfasts I asked for scrambled eggs but she said it was not possible then she said we would have to eat in the bar as they were cleaning the restaurant The breakfast was cold we had to ask for toast juice coffee and service was so slow The television in our room did not work the toilet was blocked not acceptable when paying 152 for ONE night I have had better breakfasts rooms in as Travelodge for a lot less money 
225966,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The reception area is on extreme left side I was waiting in the lobby for 20 mins later I found out the reception desk , I would like to appreciate the professionalism attitude of Ms Ashley polish if I m not mistaking with the name She changed and gave me a better room Appreciate her hospitality 
225967,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Stayed three nights with three rooms and still had to pay for parking in car park located under hotel Paid 65 00 and to add insult to injury got to the exit barrier was open Not happy , Good location for central London Twickenham Tube station just 500m away Excellent room service 
225968,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Laughably expensive car parking especially as there were RingGo street car parking bays just around the corner of the hotel at a fraction of the price , We stayed for 1 night after driving down from the north of England A perfect and comfortable stop over for a relaxing night s sleep Excellent beds 
225969,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I booked the hotel 3 months in advance being aware that it was free parking One of the main reasons I booked it with them Then when I got there I was left with a nasty surprise Had to pay parking for two nights which accumulated 40 Which is scandalous considering you pay to stay at the hotel as well I was never informed that parking had changed and you now had to pay for it I asked reception and they told me it changed a week ago Fair enough but considering I booked it before it changed I should ve been informed or been given free parking , The bed was so comfortable 
225970,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Usually we stay in London centre but for our pre Christmas family gettogether we stayed in Chiswick where our son lives The hotel was a really nice surprise We will definitely come again 
225971,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The restaurant was full booked out due to an event We only found out when we arrived for dinner this should have been mentioned when we checked in Otherwise great experience ,No Positive
225972,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Hotel is a bit far out uf you are travelling into the centre of London daily but tubr station is very close by Restaurant service slow food average , Really comfortable Room spacious bathroom Convenient close to tube station 
225973,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There was two of us staying and in the room there was only one bathrobe and slippers if asked for another pair we didn t receive them until next day when we kindly reminded it to the staff and then too we didn t get second pair or slippers and the bathrobe was missing a belt , Overall hotel was nice but the quality of the food was very poor
225974,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The first night our room was very loud as we were right above a party in the restaurant I was very happy that we were moved to a quieter room for our final night thanks , Loved the staff extremely friendly and seemed really caring about every individual from front staff to bar employees Thanks for your great service 
225975,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The half door on the bathroom toilet doesn t provide much privacy for those people who prefer to keep such things private from their other half The bar is a little too large and quiet , Superb breakfast although not too sure about the weird dolphin birthing music being played as background Comfortable beds and lovely quality linens Great food Good location opposite Gunnersbury station but of course Chiswick itself is not exactly the most interesting area of London it s a perfect hotel for visiting friends in that area 
225976,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, That the moment we arrived they wanted to charge us for parking that they decided they would implement due to Christmas parties being held not good when you are on a treat for your birthday with the family and don t get to sleep due to very noisy part goers Hairdryer didn t work dark bathroom someone s dirty socks left behind makes you wonder are they actually cleaning The duty manager was brought to us and I explained I wasn t paying the parking as I d booked ages before so the parking was wavieried on this occasion, The location of the hotel the decor and the comfortable bed if we had of slept due to the noise 
225977,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bar understaffed for in house corporate party external noise at 5 30am for 15 minutes but don t know if it was a one off, Bathroom with bath AND shower good buffet breakfast nice staff close to tube parking facilities uwe were upgraded to stay in the same executive room as we had already booked an executive room for the previous night good wifi
225978,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Miserable heating system was not possible to adjust it The room was cold the bathroom area floor icy cold and unpleasant to walk on The bath took forever to fill up and the shower needs to be modernized My colleagues in other rooms also complained of the cold and similar experiences regarding their bathrooms ,No Positive
225979,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, disappointed in the food I m vegan was at a conference and had ordered vegan food in advance organisers told the hotel but lunch on first day was a buffet when I asked what the food was for the vegans I was told don t eat the chicken the fish or the potatoes butter but you can have everything else I complained it was slightly better the next day but not a lot At breakfast I asked for soya milk and it came out in its carton not in a jug ,No Positive
225980,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Car park was ok when we stayed but looks like it could run out of spaces when busy , Fresh modern rooms and comfortable bed Unusually good buffet breakfast Handy for the end of the M4 and tube station

225984,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, 15 for breakfast Ridiculous Especially if you only eat continental one Lunch buffet was a lot larger meal and cost 10 Staff at the bar there weren t enough of them for lunch and evening period so they were under a lot of pressure having to serve at the bar clear tables and serve food which made them a bit grumpy and overwhelmed, My room was spotless very clean bathroom really comfy bed

226021,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The receptionists are not professional their English is not very good and are not welcoming One thing that I didn t liked in the room is that I don t understand at this price and with a coffee machine in the room why they don t give every day some capsules for coffee I ve had two nights accommodation and one coffee for each 2 adults It s a shame you need to look at that machine and not to have coffee to make one Or maybe you need to ask for some and pay extra , I like The location Is brilliant I ve had an executive twin room which was very nice and enough room for two adults and 1 child very good equipped and the bed was very comfy Everything was very clean I also liked the personal from breakfast

226050,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I have used this hotel since 2010 staying with them through their refurbishment process The rate charged reflected a refurbished 4 hotel The room provided was old not refurbished and realistically 2 quality Hotel was unmoved to my concern offered no adjustment to the misrepresented facility I accepted the rate for 6 years of customer service is blown I will look elsewhere from now on , The location is great and normally so is the hotel

226052,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There is an echo while talking in the bathroom I guess it s happening as everything is new , The room where they put us was in the new building everything new and looking stunning The bed extra comfy and I requested some roses for a romantic decoration and they have done it for me The breakfast wasn t included in the room price but was not a problem to have breakfast there and we paid as an extra expenses The breakfast is a buffet and honestly they had everything what the mind will desire for a morning breakfast

226060,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The staff at the reception were like day and night We first encountered a girl who gave us a sub standard room which was definitely not a 4 star quality room This was corrected by a lovely young Lativian lady who gave us excellent service she changed our room from the antiquated old part of the building to a room in the newer part of the hotel which lived up to being rated as 4 star , The proximity to the Tube station and the pleasant surroundings of the hotel
226061,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room very small in corner location Sink holding water Fixtures and fittings very worn Room cleanliness poor During the night the fire alarm activated and we had to exit to the muster point We were met by a large group of drunk Barnsley footballers and supporters but no Hotel Fire Marshall After some time we returned to reception and had to find a member of staff who told us a call point had been smashed but that this was malicious The fire brigade did not attend and no apparent check was made of the hotel to ensure there was no fire a presumption was made that it was a false alarm , God facilities and location
226062,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Staff very slow and not very friendly booked a taxi through reception but they didn t book it had to ask 3 times rang taxi company myself in end this all resulted in us getting to wembley late and missing all the meal in the VIP as my son plays for barnsley so was very upset about this Have stayed previously in the crinklewood clayton crown and couldn t fault anything really enjoyed my stay their Very dissapointed with the chiswick clayton hotel , Apart from room not much else

226070,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The shower in 912 too small head not very powerful The girls on reception they gave the impression of being bored were not what I would consider efficient professional , The bathroom overall in 912

226073,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The mirror in the bathroom is too high and a bit too far away behind the stone ledge There is no clock in the room The bathroom is huge but there is no tub The towel rack is far from the shower It should be located within reach from the shower When I check in they placed a hold on my credit card for more than the room rate and charge to the card local currency and not without checking with me or telling me how much they have hold I only realized after receiving a notification from my bank I checked with them the next day and was told they will cancel the hold and charge me the correct amount upon checking out I left and was back a week later Same thing overcharge me without even bother telling me When I check out I expect them to cancel that and charge me for the rate that I have booked but instead I was told that I have already paid I can just leave If I didn t insist that they cancel the hold and charge again I believe I will be charged the initial amount held Again they charge me in local currency instead of without bothering to check with me When I request for an invoice I was told that I have booked through agent and no invoice will be given which is not true The room is nice and location good but the service leave a lot to be desired In the middle of the night it can be very noisy I can hear people talking very loudly and also heard the roaring engine of racing cars bikes speeding through the streets , It is just a few mins from Gunnersbury station and walking distance to shops restaurants and supermarket The neighbourhood is neat and safe The room is big but I don t think it is as big as 30m2 The rooms are probably newly renovated because everything look new and clean There is a mini fridge iron and a powerful hairdryer The lobby also look nice and modern 
226074,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The only breakfast option was a big buffet and it would have been nice to have an option to grab a quick coffee and muffin It was also very difficult to have any attention from the staff to order an espresso or latte rather than american coffee or to have a second coffee If you are interested in a full breakfast the options are quite diverse and it is possible to order something from the kitchen if you can get the attention of the staff , The hotel room was spacious quiet and nicely decorated The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very well located near restaurants and transport 
226075,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, First room offered wasn t what I d booked and that room was frankly tatty Second room fine but bed and pillows very uncomfortable and fan noisy That could not be switched off , Well located for the purpose of our visit Girl at reception who greeted us was very nice and helpful

226081,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Booked a triple room which turned out to be a double room and an extra mattress was bought in which left no floor space Should not of been advertised as a triple room Even though a triple room was booked it wasn t set up for us and the whole booking in process took ages and ages and then we had to leave the room while the extra bed was put it Not great when you are tired after a long journey We were show a twin room which had even less space to put the extra mattress so the double room with single was the best option If three friends were travelling together they don t want to share a double bed ,No Positive
226082,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room was stuffed to the gills and there were so many pillows we were drowning in them Fancy modern finish was not suitable for young kids really as edges were hard and metal Money reserved up front just in case we used anything in the room which made us not want to even boil the kettle , Loved the staff They were great They went out of their way to get our passports to us at the airport after I left them in our room 
226083,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We had to be moved as our room was shabby with a dirty bed throw, Moved to a new room see below which was lovely but we should not have been put in a shabby room in the first instance

226090,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Stayed in one of the new executive double rooms in the hotel s rear extension The room was very comfortable and equipped with a coffee machine and other nice little touches Generally felt like a very good spec and value for money The staff were very friendly and helpful 
226091,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I booked a suite and it wasn t a suite is was a luxury large room with king size bed so very very misleading I also don t like this ludicrous habit of having ONE set of towels in the bathroom and having to look for another set which is hidden in the wardrobe WHY when it s a double room it s not trendy or stylish it s stupid and unnecessary , The bed the linen and pillows were very good and the bathroom magnificent Room service breakfast was also good 
226092,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Small building points such as the sink pretty design but No real space for putting toiletries Shower great but water dropped out when door opened Rug had to be turned back to open wardrobe and finally bedroom mirror fixed and hard to use even when sitting unless you were a tall lady Small points We were very comfortable and will recommend it , Spacious room quiet lovely huge comfy bed loads of mirrors red hot water 
226093,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, took too long for Latte in the morning and think I got charged on card but couldn t spare the time waiting over 20 minutes so we left also check out was painfully slow so again left keys and didn t mention that our lattes had not arrived So we probably paid for it indirectly as card swipe taken when arrived, Comfy beds temperature perfect bathroom clean and had all creature comforts
226094,Clayton Hotel Chiswick,No Negative, Pleasant and friendly staff Lovely large room Comfy bed Loved the huge bathroom Could ve stayed in the shower for hours Great location close to underground Late checkout brilliant at mid day so no rushing to get up in the morning Bar food was good value and well presented 
226095,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, No parking and reception not well manned at check out time had to wait a long time The rooms in the new extension are much smaller especially the bathroom and have lost the character of the original building , I liked Chiswick and easy to tube into the centre 
226096,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Lighting arrangement in room doesn t allow for a single light by bedside No good if one of two wishes to read and other wants to sleep , Location good for links in West London
226097,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Renovations were going on while we stayed there The room was comfortable but had no fridge and due to the decor it looked like it was taken from the set of Goodfellas Breakfast was quite expensive though nice , Location was excellent and the staff were extremely helpful Food was of a good quality 
226098,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The temperature control in the rooms was unresponsive The first room was far too hot and the aircon wasn t shifting it We were moved to another room which was set to be cooler It ended up too cool , Room large and very clean Bed very comfortable Surprisingly quiet we were on the fiflth floor 
226099,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Breakfast food was of poor quality , Breakfast very poor room excellent staff helpful location good Unfortunately hotel is under refurbishment so only a small bar area and no onsite parking available 
226100,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Wasn t there long enough to dislike anything , Arrived early and told the staff on the check in desk that we would be very late as we were going to the rugby Staff helpful right from the off Thought this looked alright when first walked in Arrived late and bar was still open even though went straight to bed Hotel room and bathroom was great Would have no trouble staying there again Photo me and Jason Robinson Rugby World Cup winner and T V pundit 
226101,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Staff need to be more proactive and friendly I would have rated the hotel Five Stars if the staff performance was better , The cleanliness and the overall quality of the physical facilities
226102,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The hotel is still having works carried out on it There was issues adjusting the temperature in the room The room was very cold on arrival due to the air con being on I set the temperature to warm up the room however it took several hours before the room warmed up , I like the location of the hotel and the revamp of the rooms 
226103,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Regulating the room s temperature was a challenge When setting was at 22 temperature would go up to 24 When setting at off heating would start again by itself , Excelllent location in West London Comfortable bed 
226104,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, More information regarding how to set heating on the rooms More information re how the rooms are serviced ie that you need to put your hanger on the door to have your room cleaned no explanation given so we did not have our room cleaned or bed made or bins emptied etc, The Staff were extremely helpful particularly the Bar Staff members 
226105,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I thought that the toilet roll holder was in an awkward place , The room was very clean and modern The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were deep filled and bouncy The bathroom was very modern and luxurious 
226106,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, We ordered the continental breakfast in bed for the first morning of our stay it wasnt particularly cheap Initially we were only brought cereal and pots of tea Had to ring down to get the rest fruit juice croissants We had no yoghurt sent the fruit bowl had a very poor choice only apple and melon Was really disappointed , excellent location just a short walk from the nearest tube station Free upgrade to an executive room Hotel was spotlessly clean room was cleaned and towels toiletries tea and coffee restocked each day Staff were very friendly 
226107,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Wasn t told that refurbishment work was going on so the main restaurant was closed as well as other work going on so everything was covered in dust sheets We had dinner in the bar area but didn t have a lot of choice it wasn t very cheap , Our room was lovely very clean we was on the 6th floor so had a nice view of the planes coming in to land We liked the fact that you didn t have to check out until 12pm By booking breakfast at reception for the next morning we got a discount 
226108,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I would have liked BBC Radio 3 to be available on the TV It seemed they only had Radio 2 and Radio 4 I was also a bit baffled by the air conditioning I m not certain it was working properly , It is in an excellent location Chiswick High Road is a very dynamic street and you can park nearby from 6pm on Friday for the weekend 
226109,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Restaurant was closed only bar meals decorators working above your head while eating in bar area music very loud and not very warm No face cloths providen no body lotion provided , Comfortable room
226110,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Despite a luxurious bathroom the hotwater system wasn t brilliant and our shower and bath water was never hot only warm to slightly warmer , Despite the hotel being given a big makeover including extensive building work we did not feel really inconvenienced by this and the staff did everything they could to make our stay a good one This included an upgrade to our room on arrival The room we were given was in the new wing of the hotel and had a sumptuous bed and furnishings and a luxury ensuite Can t comment on food or bar as we didn t use these Really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again 
226111,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Bar and restaurant arrangement are a let down at this stage in the hotel s refurbishment , Excellent staff and the refurbished new part of the hotel is outstanding

226114,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Not told Hotel was under refurb Air con not working properly phoned front desk in middle of the night to turn off which didn t happen When told front desk on check out they were nonplussed We have stayed at this Hotel many times , We book for location more than anything else 
226115,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Lady in Reception very helpfull but when we requested our boarding cards to be printed by a gentleman we had no success following being told a few days earlier that it would be no problem Had to leave without them , Location
226116,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I booked this hotel because it was close to a wedding reception that I was attending The added attraction was the website told me that the bar would show all major sporting events on its TV England vs Ireland six nations fairly major Not only was it not on but the bar was undergoing major refurbishment and was closed The hotel did seem to look like a building site and at 149 for one night room only I certainly didn t feel I was getting value for money I did mention this when I was checking out and was told that if I come again and tell them of my disappointment I would be upgraded Not sure I ll be going again ,No Positive
226117,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Hotel is under renovation limited services Extremely cold rooms with failures in air conditioning Poor food quality and long time waiting Staff looks demotivated When it was Moran Hotel it was my favourite , Rooms in the renovated area are great 
226118,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The carpet in my room in the old wing was very dirty If you like the continental breakfast with eggs sausages etc thank there is a good choice If you just like bread pastries than breakfast is quite poor , The hotel is currently refurnishing the rooms Unfortunately I was not in a room in the new wing which was already refurnished

226120,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Room was cold even with stat set at 23 and the lighting was poor Our curtains didn t quite close together so the outside light crept in , Breakfast staff were very helpful Bed was comfortable Bar was cosy but possibly a little too hot 
226121,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, The bar staff were not as welcoming as they could have been and we only stuck around for one drink because of this , Receptionist was very friendly helpful and gave us a free upgrade The room was lovely and the shower was so good I could have stayed in it for hours The breakfast was fresh well presented and with lots of options It s in a great location just off the M4 and a minute away from a district line station 
226122,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, There were 2 of us staying but only one set of towels which they did rectify No restaurant as being refurbished and bar menu incredibly limited no where to eat without walking 15 minutes Bed uncomfortable room was freezing no one asked us if we wanted a hot drink at breakfast which I thought was incredible , The staff were helpful

226126,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, About the only downside that I could mention was the tv in the bedroom had a very poor picture , Staff were very friendly upon arrival and throughout our stay The room was a good size and very clean Although I was worried about the renovation work that was going on and visible from the outside from the inside we did not see any sign of work going on and didn t hear any noise from it at all Less than 5 minutes walk to Gunnersbury station and 20 minute walk to Chiswick house so ideal for what we wanted

226196,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, Just the location wasnt very central but obviously should have researched more where it was just on the edge of zone 3 however it was very convenient for the tube , The lovely big clean fresh bathroom and bedroom I also can not fault the staff looking after the room

226201,Clayton Hotel Chiswick, I found it odd that i d booked a double room had updated my booking that there would be a second person in the room as you d expect this to be the norm for a double room A 10 per day charge was put on for the extra person When checking out the value was quoted in STG i paid and the system defaulted to Euro the hotel had its own Rate exchange system which appears to be 3 5 greater than the market rate there was no option to pay in STG only Euro this is normally an option at the terminal or communicated via a staff member I see this as a way to get an extra 25 out of me This was not obvious until the transaction had gone through This is an area that needs to be rectified and the extra person room charge does not appear clear and not described on Booking com , Location worked very well from a wedding at Kew Gardens plus close to the Tube and Chiswick high street is a 5 7 min walk away
