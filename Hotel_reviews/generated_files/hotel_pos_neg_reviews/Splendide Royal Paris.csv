78350,Splendide Royal Paris, almost no facilities so I couldn t understand how it is a five stars hotel they don t have a concierge , New and clean with extremely helpful staff
78351,Splendide Royal Paris, I wouldn t say didn t like but do be aware that given the proximity to the president s residence some traffic may be diverted now and then This is no big deal you may need to walk one block now and then It s worth it for the quiet privacy of the neighborhood , The hotel is quite wonderful Only twelve rooms so the experience with the staff was quite special This is a luxury hotel and feels like it every step of the way Perfect for special occasions The staff went way out of their way in every instance I cannot say enough about them Also it is in arguably the safest neighborhood in Paris given that the president s residence is right around the corner It is a short walk to the Champs Elysee Place de la Concorde and the sights of Paris

78353,Splendide Royal Paris, Each suite had tea coffee making facilities but we had to ask for milk and sugar When the dirty crockery and cutlery were taken away they were not replaced we had to ask for replacements likewise the tea and coffee sachets were not replaced When breakfast arrived it was not always what we ordered , The hotel was in a quiet select area yet still near to all amenities We were given a warm welcome and the staff were very attentive The suites were immaculate and tastefully furnished huge beds This is a new hotel and the negative comments are just teething problems and did nothing to spoil our stay
