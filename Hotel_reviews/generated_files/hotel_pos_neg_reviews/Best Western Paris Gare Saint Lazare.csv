78272,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, It s advertised as having parking it is not on site Slightly deceiving Only one pillow each Fairy clean but could do with a new coat of paint in some areas , Convenient and quiet Good location for the price 
78273,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Nothing bad to say about the property really , Nice clean room big cumfy bed bathroom was compact but had everything you needed Having a balcony was great too as made the room feel open and airy plus great to watch the Parisian life go about its day below 
78274,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Breakfast was mediocre , Bed was super comfortable small but good room balcony helped Perfect for a weekend getaway clean great location Residential area but not too far from all the big highlights I would recommend for a short visit 
78275,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The area didn t really have that many food and drink places , Bed was comfortable and rooms really clean balcony was nice bonus there s not that many restaurants and bars near by but we found a food places around 15 20min walk away from the hotel at the end Breakfast was ok 
78276,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, This could go on for some time This place it appears to be an old converted block of flats from around the 1800 s It has a seriously very narrow central spiral staircase with a lift that was installed at a very much later date and as so does not come to ground floor but appears halfway up a flight of stairs this is the same for all 5 floors Elderly people or those with walking problems will find this either considerably difficult to deal with or even dangerous I am not Joking To reach this lift I a 72 year old man had to carry my heavy luggage up to this lift on my own as no help was offered or given Upon studying this further and reading the emergency escape instructions If the central stairway becomes blocked you are then instructed to remain in your rooms PLEASE NOTE THIS INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THERE ARE NO EXTERNAL FIRE ESCAPES I suppose it s easier to remove bodies this way rather than cleaning up the outside pavements of those who attempted to jump to safety The rooms themselves are just about big enough to take a full size double bed which then leaves about 18 inches either way for you to get round The shower works quite well though and breakfast is just about passable for a cheap hotel OF WHICH THIS ONE IS NOT I do not consider this place value for money NOR DO I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE I am also writing to BOOKING COM to make a formal complaint with regard to their promoting this hotel as it is quite obvious no one appears to have checked this place before advertising it , The shower worked quite well
78277,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The tea facilties were not good only one tea bag and milk in room even those there was two people staying Had to go and ask for tea bags and milk , Room OK facilties ok
78278,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Very Small rooms, Living like a local but not too far from tourists areas Balacny room over looking quiet Paris neighborhood Short walk to metro train station lots of cafes and just a 15 minute walk to Opera House 
78279,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, This hotel should be 2 stars NOT 4 stars Be aware The Rooms are nothing like on the photos This is small tiny rooms and really old and ugly The rug on the floor had many old stains in it and this is like a total disappointment I came to Paris to meet my girlfriend for only 2 days and this ruin my trip First i arrived at 4 pm The room was not ready I needed to wait for 20 minutes Then i had a key to a room and inside that room was a worker painting the room I went downstairs and the guy made a mistake So he gave me another room That room was really dirty and small and nothing like on the photos I went down again and they told me they were full I then told them i was not happy and wanted to do something about this THEN they told me they had another room That room was a little better but still the same and not cozy at all I usually not write bad reviews but this was a total disappointment Also the price i paid was for 4 star hotel This is NOT a 4 star Hotel REALLY DISAPPOINTED OF THIS AND THE STAFF THIS HOTEL SHOULD NOT BE 4 STARS FAR FROM BEING A 4 STARS HOTEL , Location is ok 
78280,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, It is an old building but there are some areas that need maintenance My hand shower was leaking all my stay I had to put it on the floor to avoid the noise , The location is good and the rate I had was fair The staff is helpful and friendly 
78281,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Very small room on 1st night Lady on reception changed us for 2nd night without us asking Good room 2nd night , Lady on reception very friendly Clean breakfast room Good coffee 
78282,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The laundry service was horrifically expensive , One staff person in particular was very friendly and helpful Ana close to the metro room was a good size and comfortable
78283,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The rooms are functional yet small , The Hotel is in a wonderful location with easy access to the metro many restaurants and unique shops You will be surronded by many locals going about their daily lives Lastly parc Monceau is vry close one of the gems of Paris 
78284,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The supposed queen size bed was 2 singles joined tgt lol, The toilets were amazing for the limited space in Paris and the budget we had The bathtub WOOO HOO lol
78285,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The toilette at the breakfast room was not working It was very disgusting and smelly when I entered it at 8am , The availability of AC during 35 degrees in Paris is awesome The breakfast is also worth its price The staff was very kind and always helpful 
78286,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The room was small which was the least of our worries The shower kept going hot and cold which was annoying The stairwell lights were out which considering it was a narrow spiral staircase was not good The first time in over 50 years of travel paper cups were provided in our room and we got one tea bag in our room on the first day of our stay no more were provided When we arrived for breakfast on the 3rd and 4th days at 8 30am there was no muesli no croissants all the white cheese had gone so had most of the meat When we spoke to the person looking after the breakfast the approach was so what the girl on the desk however arranged for someone to go out and get some croissants The piece de resistance however occurred on our last night We watched the Rio olympics until after 11 and then couldn t turn off the tv The batteries in the control had corroded I replaced them but the terminals had gone There was no switch on the tv so I had to remove the tv from the wall to get at the wall switch The real issue was that all the problems were avoidable with a little care and planning , This bed was comfortable and the air conditioning went well 
78287,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, They had to move us because the air conditioning wasn t working and up charged us for the room because it was a different bed Then they had to move us again when the electricity in our floor wasn t working They blamed us for the electricity in the building going out but our adaptor for our iPhone was fried and they refused to replace it unless I provided a receipt The door didn t lock in our third room properly and we had to make sure that we pulled it shut numerous times so it would close Lastly after fighting with them about our bill and the charges we checked out of the hotel and left our luggage as were weren t leaving until the evening When we returned many hours later to collect our luggage they presented us with another bill which they said they had forgotten , The girl who served breakfast was very nice and polite She was the only staff who seemed to understand that customers matter 
78288,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, bedroom and staircase an accident waiting to happen the lighting was poor and we assumed there would be mini fridge in the room it was our anniversary we bought a bottle of wine to have in our room the next night we where told it could go in the fridge in reception when we went to collect our wine it was frozen solid most dissapoimting, breakfast
78289,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The internet was awfull , Location was great if you like walking Everything within 30minites of walking onvluding sacre c ur louvre etc Metro about 10minute walk away The bed was so confortable Supermarket over the road aswell 
78290,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Wifi horrendous in the room No facility of Whatsapp calls Skype I Organised that the room was ready before arriving at 12 as I had travelled for many hours to get there It was not In the morning I go for breakfast I have to climb over 4 big laundry bags to get out of lift Staff chatting on stairs about their private affairs all the time so I can hear them all the time Room size of 501 Ridiculously small , Bed comfy 
78291,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Breakfast was very expensive considering was just some croissants ham cheese and cereals I believe for 13 this was far over priced, Good location close to 3 stations
78292,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Being an older building there wasn t good soundproofing You can hear the comings goings of people into the small hours footsteps doors talking etc , Fantastic location 5 minutes walk to the local metro 10 15 minutes to Opera Galleries LaFayette Great place for strolling around too with local French restaurants patisseries etc Rooms were clean tidy I had a room with a little balcony which I highly recommend asking for 
78293,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Unequal cleanness but strong cleaning products smell all over the place The sink was plugged and it took 3 days and multiple requests to get it unplugged And then it was completely leaking which took another 24 hours to solve 1 hour before I leave Besides very noisy no soundproofing at all and a cleaning team which seems to come always at the wrong time but never when you meed ,No Positive
78294,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The rooms we re supposedly soundproof I can assure you they are not We heard the cleaners hovering at 7 8am in the morning The stairs is windy and very steep so we heard a lot of banging as the cleaners dragged the hoovers up the stairs , It is very central to the Arc De Triomphe Lovely little Irish style pub restaurant about 50 meters on the left away called The Publisher Cheap for Paris And the staff were friendly and helpful 
78295,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Sink was licking House keeping did not replace tissues toilette paper teas and coffees I had to ask for it every day , The bed was comfortable The girl at the reception was very friendly 
78296,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Well the rooms are very small but are very ok , The hotel has a very good location I mean you can walk to get to Opera easily and take metro for other sites Very good bathroom comfortable bed 
78297,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, There was no shoes for the room I always had to stay with my running shoes in the room , The position of the hotel was very central and beautiful building

78299,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The room was a little too hot because the street was too noisy if you opened the window and air wouldn t turn on , The room was small but very comfortable and had everything we needed The location is on a great metro line and close to it 
78300,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Little Bit dark rooms lights are very dim , Very friendly staff very clean and comfortable bedsheets nice bathroom and very good location near train station and very accessible area 
78301,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The breakfast was a bit poor of food Early Sunday morning there was a small baby crying continuously near our room and woke up us The lift was between the floors , I really liked the location because it was in the city centre and we could go around without using transport for the main monuments I liked the room tiny but it was clean and nice The staff was really nice and helpful 
78302,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, View from the room is not breathtaking courtyard building site , The hotel is well located 15 20 by walk to Grand Palace Close to the underground Clean quiet nice with very nice service Close to the hotel is street with local market ect I would come back again 
78303,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The service from the staff wasn t very accommodating as we arrived as the terrorist attack began They were not comforting quite sharp not compassionate and acted as normal rather than ensuring you were okay during the crisis Also staff at breakfast stared out of the window until we were finished looking not comforting either Subtitles didn t work on the TV and staff were unaware how to change this this was distressing as we were trying to find out what was going on in Paris during the terrorist attack and couldn t understand again staff did not try to accommodate Use of the word bar within the hotel is a huge over statement there are a few bottles at the side of reception to choose from definitely wouldn t call it a bar , Room was clean tidy and comfortable However subtitles didn t work on the TV and staff were unaware of how to change this 
78304,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The hotel has no direkt access from the elevator to the room There is only access with stairs The free wifi is very very poor you can NOT use Skype or any other free Voice apps and you can forget about watching movies online The hotel room was very dirty and old ,No Positive

78306,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, The stais are a bit a challenge but it gives the hotel its special Parisian charm , The hotel is in great location in a quiet street close to many attractions very clean upgraded We could sleep with our windows open and didn t hear the street traffic Manager and staff are really friendly helpful and personable They take a good care of their gasts We felt very welcome and like home at this hotel Very good choice I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family members 
78307,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare,No Negative, I fell ill while staying at this hotel and the staff were amazing We asked the reception staff if there were any doctors near by and within half an hour they had made an appointment with a doctor for me that was only 5 mins walk away 
78308,Best Western Paris Gare Saint Lazare, Our room had a broken TV and it seemed as on going problem for a while the room should be sold for a way cheaper price then and the fact mentioned when booking at the description The room could be lighten more but it was rather dark , Bathroom was very nice small but with bath and design gives extra credit The bed very comfortable
