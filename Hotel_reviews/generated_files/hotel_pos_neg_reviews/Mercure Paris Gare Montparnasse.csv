99489,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Noise Not being told about this when we checked in , The location was great However renovations were taking place that created a lot of noise throughout the day There was also no water on the morning we were due to depart We complained and the staf were very sympathetic and offered a discount 
99490,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Room was worn down One of the curtains did not close and the toilet ran every 5 minutes or so The shower was either dirty or just scratched up the side table was rickety to the point of being un useable , Location was good 
99491,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Access to shower was by the tub which is very high and difficult to get in and out of Needs hand rails on wall to assist Positioning of glass screen means you are unable to run a bath or adjust temperature or turn on the taps without actually being in the bath ,No Positive
99492,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, The breakfast was way over priced and the staff in the restaurant were very unfriendly The front desk employees were helpful and polite but did not follow through But the worst I KNOW I left some things in the room on Saturday morning when I checked out and when I returned Sunday housekeeping denied anything was found in the room They are doing upgrades to some ground floor areas and some of the rooms The place was a MESS and noisy , The property was conveniently located near the train station 
99493,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Work in progress noise no bar keys had to be programmed every day 1 bottle of water in minibar that s all even if I booked for 2 staff could not answer on basic questions for restaurants , Comfort
99494,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Max price for the bare minimum Acor Hotels can get away with Typical of today s accountant controlled hotels But an ok place if you are used to these max for min establishments It d been a welcome bonus if the key cards had actually worked the room doors room lights and also the lifts would have saved long walks up and down the stairs , Few minutes walk to Ga t Metro Montparnasse Metro and mainline station and Edgar Quinet Metro Street outside hotel lots of bars and restaurants and not expensive Good place to locate in Paris to then get around if you are on a medium budget

99498,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, We would be hard pressed to find anything not to like during our stay at the hotel However shortly after booking and paying in advance for the room I noticed a fraudulent charge on my credit card for a gambling or gaming establishment in Paris This was a single occurrence that was quickly rectified , We stayed four nights with three adults in one room and were very comfortable The room was by no means luxurious but was large enough that we didn t feel cramped The Montparnasse area is very walkable with a large variety of restaurants cafes and shops nearby The hotel itself is situated between two Metro stations each serving different lines making it very easy to get around the city It is also a short walk or one Metro stop away from the terminus for the Orly Airport Shuttle Bus the Metro to CDG Airport or the Gare du Nord rail station 
99499,Mercure Paris Gare Montparnasse, Room was far too hot and thermostat didn t seem to work so I needed to keep opening the windows As it was quiet that wasn t such an issue , Bed was comfortable and the room was a quiet one as requested Receptionist was able to recommend a good restaurant
