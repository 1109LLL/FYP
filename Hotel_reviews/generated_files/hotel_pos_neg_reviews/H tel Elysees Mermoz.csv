143781,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Some housekeeping issues Took a few requests to get amenities refilled and was accidently checked into a room that wasn t ready But the situation was remedied quickly , Friendly staff excellent location 
143782,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The toilet was separated from the bathroom with no hand washing facilities in it , Staff were very friendly and helpful location was great and the cleanliness could not have been better When we return to Paris I would stay here again
143783,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The breakfast Not good enough variety of dairy products and eggs even though we upgraded to the higher menu Staff at the restaurant have very little english knowledge , The location is just the best you can get And we felt completely safe going out We actually felt at home Staff were very friendly and helpful when we needed them I found the bed quite comfortable And the Wifi speed was great Will definitely stay again 
143784,H tel Elysees Mermoz, No muesli for breakfast only cornflakes etc, The hotel was close to the Metro and to the Champs de l Elysee also restaurants museums and the Seine
143785,H tel Elysees Mermoz, This is a very pricey neighborhood and all the restaurants were pretty expensive even by Paris standards I went to Montmartre and had a equally great meal for a better price , The Paris breakfast which was included with the room rate was perfect for me The hotel is near the Israeli embassy so there are soldiers guarding the corner near the hotel making the area safer 
143786,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The only thing was the wifi was spotty , Loved that they used L occitane products in the bathroom The room and bathroom size is also slightly bigger than average for Paris There s also a cute little balcony and the breakfast is standard good French pastries juices and coffee You can upgrade to a hot breakfast for a fee The location is excellent A 2 min walk to Champs lys es and 3 4 min walk to any subway station A 30 min walk to the Eiffel Tower A 5 min walk to the Seine and a 3 min walk to the avenue with all the brand shops There s also a small vintage store next to the hotel but it was never open when we were there so not sure what the hours are It was my moms bday and they made sure to make it special for her The service was really good They sent recommendations before our trip which was great 
143787,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Basic breakfast was basic and perhaps the additional breakfast should have been included in the price, Excellent customer service and perfect location for the Paris marathon
143788,H tel Elysees Mermoz, I wish they somehow had room for a small fitness room with free weights and a bench It would have been great if the Parisian breakfast included whole fruit , The location was just off the Champ Elysees walking distance to everywhere The bed was excellent as was the climate control in the room The guest bathroom on the ground floor was convenient 
143789,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Wifi is very weak and unstable especially in the 5th floor cracked paint on rooms roof All Room walls is dark and not painted But covered by cloth Breakfast is very poor comparing to the money I paid Furniture is very old Elevator is scary , Staff was good Location is quite good 
143790,H tel Elysees Mermoz,No Negative, The breakfast was good the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I have slept in and staff more than happy to be of service Close to tourist attractions restuarants and the Champe Elysees for shopping 
143791,H tel Elysees Mermoz, There is nothing that I could say negative about H tel Elysees Mermoz absolutely exceeded expectations in every regard , While the facilities were top notch the location was fantastic and the price was very reasonable it was the staff that were the real stand out at H tel Elysees Mermoz They were exceptionally friendly and helpful could not praise them more highly 
143792,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Couldn t turn the heating down from the thermostat in the room so ended up turning off the radiator and opening the window but nothing that was insurmountable , Great location very friendly and helpful staff Plenty of toiletries and refreshments in the room nice and clean Would not stay in any other hotel if we were to visit Paris again 
143793,H tel Elysees Mermoz,No Negative, The accommodations were excellent The room was spacious and the staff was friendly and helpful Close to many wonderful sites and restaurants We were even given an upgraded junior suite which was a pleasant surprise 
143794,H tel Elysees Mermoz, No complemntry water in the room No room service at night we couldn t find a small shop to buy some food near by at 10 pm , tthe clean rooms the design toiletries 
143795,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Nothing to be said , The staff were very very friendly and supportive more than expected Quick action and smiley faces all the time I my wife and daughter enjoyed our time a lot 
143796,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Very Small rooms The way of splitting the breakfast to two types french and intercontinental and you have to pay more to get more than the french BF 1st time for me to see like this Expensive compare to the facilities The bath room is separate from the shower room Old building and need renovation, The staff are very friendly and cooperative Clean place Location Fast free WiFi
143797,H tel Elysees Mermoz, I liked everything , Free wifi everywhere free phone call in EU Location is great and very close from metro station and champ elysees street Many cafes and restaurants around hotel Hotel amenities are L Occitane 
143798,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The fact that it clearly stated that room service finished at 11 but that we were not able to order it when we tried about 10 30 as they said it was over for the day, The staff were very pleasant and helpful Particularly the gentleman who did the night shift Very good location 
143799,H tel Elysees Mermoz,No Negative, The hotel was in a very good location with many small restaurants nearby It is a modern boutique hotel It was ideal for a family with 2 small children 
143800,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The rooms were quite small Upon arrival we upgraded from deluxe to a junior suite , The location of the hotel was centrally located next to the Champs lys es It was ideal for shopping 
143801,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Poor variety breakfast Very very narrow corridors The size of the rooms is so small actually tiny Staff were ok Not so helpful There was hair on the new sheets when we just enter the room after check in Nevertheless the price is sooo expensive, The good thing about this hotel is the location only near by a lot of things
143802,H tel Elysees Mermoz, There were no pictures on the walls in the room , This hotel was a great value The rooms were small but adequate The location and breakfast was great We had a street view that was pretty neat The wifi was fast 
143803,H tel Elysees Mermoz, The shower bath design is not too well thought out due to the potential for spillage on the floor because the shower head must be positioned rather forward looking as it is prone to droop due to the weight of the shower head but all in all this is a minor inconvenience , The staff of this hotel are very attentive and friendly The rooms are standard size They are both comfortable and quiet The breakfast is a standard French breakfast of excellent quality food and beverages The hotel is in an excellent location a very short walk from the Champs Elysee and metro services 
143804,H tel Elysees Mermoz, Our breakfast appetite is small so we did not eat in the hotel but preferred to take a coffee and croissant in a nearby coffee shop where there is plenty of choice Overall we were more than happy with the hotel , The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful We had dealings mostly with Ana who always greeted us with a smile and was more than helpful in dealing with our queries and requests While our room was kept spotlessly clean a temporary maid caused us a problem because of carelessness Fortunately this was solved

143807,H tel Elysees Mermoz, If I was to be very picky the toilet is not in the same room as the bathroom not a big deal tho, We were made welcome from the very start staff spoke good English and helped us as much as they could room facility s location and cleanliness were excellent I would recommend this hotel to anyone
