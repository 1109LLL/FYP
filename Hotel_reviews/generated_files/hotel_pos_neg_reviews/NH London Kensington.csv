102316,NH London Kensington, Tiny room for two people by North American standards Double bed No ice machine and frequently absent bar tender Excellent air conditioning as London was hot Twin bed rooms in subground level large but institutional and outfitted for wheelchair access Shower only Helpful staff Good full English breakfast Hotel feels a bit worn Pillows need replacing Noise from other rooms and hallway could be heard ,No Positive
102317,NH London Kensington, everything rooms should ready as advertised rate should be more in line with what is on offer rather than lower than average 3 star in noisy main road location long walk to from underground station s no bath shower only does not suit everyone would never book here again ever did question the high rate having seen the small room on offer met with shrug of shoulders , not much to like really extortionate rate charged room not ready on arrival at 6pm ruined planned evening arrangements small room no bath 
102318,NH London Kensington, Basic maintenance and repair to the bathroom was needed , The staff was very friendly and helpful I read previous reviews and had no problems with the WIFi 
102319,NH London Kensington, Preventive maintenance needs to be improved During two stays in June on two different trips the shower drain in the bathroom was completely clogged In the first case maintenance solved the problem very quickly and efficiently In the second case it proved impossible to continue showering and my husband unblocked the drain with the aid of a pair of nail clippers removing a huge amount of hair that had obviously been there for some time , The location is excellent and the hotel is very good value for money The staff is very friendly and helpful There is a tube station nearby and lots of amenities We will definitely go back to this hotel 
102320,NH London Kensington, We felt they were understaffed as the lobby bar person seemed to be away performing other duties when most needed Didn t seem fair to her and of course her clients , The staff were pleasant and cooperative 
102321,NH London Kensington, Staff not very friendly and often busy so not available to help with enquiries Some ESL so hard to understand No facecloths in room , Close to Earl s Court tube great shops 
102322,NH London Kensington, Unfortunately the room was laid out by an architect designer that most likely never stayed in a hotel The placement of the desk was awkward as it left no room between the bed and the desk chair when the chair was pulled out or being used Electrical outlets are poorly placed Bathroom lighting was very poorly placed and the location magnifying mirror was a placed well for a giraffe but not a normal sized person ,No Positive
102323,NH London Kensington, The toilet in the bathroom did not flush very effectively and the wash basin had a central immovable tap that prevented me washing my hair easily, I liked the small garden at the back of the hotel The staff were excellent
102324,NH London Kensington, Unfortunately the staff at the reception makes you feel terrible After a 6 hour flight at 14 52 they didn t let me in my room saying I had to wait until 15 00 The worst thing was a group of pilots came and let them in their rooms at the same moment NH hotels NEVER AGAIN No lunch in the rstaurant You can only eat sth in your rooms S S, The location only 
102325,NH London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel was comfortable clean and tidy Very good location The staff was friendly helpful and very professional Everything was perfect I would like to thank particularly Luisa a lovely girl of the staff that made us feel like at home 
102326,NH London Kensington, The suite is interesting but honestly not really worth the extra money It is split on two levels which requires a card for the electricity They only provided 1 Once asked the staff was very friendly and helpful to supply a second but would be easier to do it with the suite considering the setup Also it has an upstairs and downstairs The small TV by the bed downstairs is much more limited in channel selection lucky if you have 4 channels So not a big deal but you need to be upstairs to watch television All in all it s probably easier to stay in the standard room , Breakfast was very nice Staff is very friendly and helpful if you are a Spanish guest you will be very comfortable most of the staff is from Spain Neighbourhood and location are really nice Public transport is easy with Earl s Court station 
102327,NH London Kensington,No Negative, Beds were very comfy Room was very quiet as requested even though it overlooked the main road outside which was not a problem at all TV s on both floors of the room 
102328,NH London Kensington, 1 i book standard simple large room facing garden but was upgraded without asking and got room facing the street and room which was divided in two floors facing ugly stairs to the second floor of the room bed the stairs took most of the space of the room and was leading towars sitting area living room with extra WC above our head very strange and useless design i went to reception and ask to change it back for the room i book simple looking facing garden or wall from the bed butt it was not available 2 at the bar i ordered champagne they did not have it believe or not in th emiddle of London they can easily went ot the store and purchased one another couple ordered champagne too same disapointment so ordered dry white wine it was out of stock ordered beer on the menu out of stock so 3 items i ordered were out of stock , location easy to take cab to the airport but another hotel i stayed had much better service and more pleasant staff
102329,NH London Kensington, I feel complimentary water in the rooms would be an added extra touch as a lot of hotels offer this , complimentary upgrade to a suite very comfortable room peaceful clean and felt spacious Breakfast was outstanding plenty of choice to cater for all tastes fresh food of a high standard Peaceful sleep very warm welcoming staff 
102330,NH London Kensington, The air conditioner of my room kept switching off i was always calling the reception to keep it on and cool And the Wi fi you guys seriously urgently really need to get a better wi fi service It took me like 15 min just to sent an email , The bed was super comfortable the room was super clean and well decorated very cozy perfect location lots of restaurants near the hotel the service of the hotel restaurant was great too the staff is super nice and very helpful it s also close to the earls court underground station that goes straight to Heathrow totally recommend 
102331,NH London Kensington,No Negative, We did travel with a baby we request king size bed and a crib and was perfect and in place at the moment of our arrive great location good restaurants around and awesome breakfast nice personal at the lobby and the restaurant
102332,NH London Kensington, the advertised price for the room included breakfast when I got there one receiptionist said there was no additional price and it was included the next day when we went to get breakfast the new receiptionist said it would be an additional 15 lbs per person so we declined Your advertisement was incorrect and we want compensation for this We wanted a room that included breakfast and this was not the case with this hotel major confusion ensued , locatoin

102334,NH London Kensington, I asked for an early check in and I didn t receive it I came at 11 30 and they told me to come between 14 15 o clock I didn t find hand cream and hair conditioner in the bath like in other NH ex Brussel but when I asked at reception they gave me There are no computers station for clients like in other 4 or even 3 stars hotels , The location was great few minutes from Earl s Court Station and Kensington museums The breakfast was wonderful The muffins are great Very clean hotel Very good restaurants very close 
102335,NH London Kensington, H rd s ng var enda minus under vistelsen , Utm rkt l ge p hotellet Kort g avst nd fr n tinnelbanan och bussen alldeles utanf r d rren Ett extra plus var att en buss gick direkt till westfield gallerian med shopping i m ngder 
102336,NH London Kensington, There was no milk in the room for tea and coffee , I liked that you had to have a room key to access the lift from the lobby The room was comfortable and even though the hotel is on a busy main road you couldn t really hear the traffic in the room 
102337,NH London Kensington, I was put in a disable room and was not made aware of it THe next day was told that the reason was a full hotel but having checked in at 3 30pm I doubt the hotel was full at that time When enter the room it smells of cigarette too luckily by the time I came back tot he room after dinner the smell was gone, Breakfast was great staff was friendly
102338,NH London Kensington, We got a room in the garden level which was essentially a basement level with a small window and quite dark room Plus the plugs weren t working due to some electrical system error which got fixed We ended up staying only our first night then moved to another hotel, Great service staff was attentive and helpful
102339,NH London Kensington, The furniture in the room and the bathroom was more worn than I expected for a 4 star it looked a little unkempt, Lovely helpful staff everything was clean and tidy
102340,NH London Kensington, Steps at front had to carry suitcases up As usual only a stand for one suitcase So that meant the other was on the floor , This was ideally located for exploring London and not too far from train station The room was a good size with safe Property security swipe card to access lift etc Cosmopolitan feel 
102341,NH London Kensington, The hotel s external Internet service provider failed to acknowledge and fix the slow below usable Internet in my room s Two out of my three nights I had to spend time on the hotel phone with their technical support without resolution Not really something I wanted to spend my time on The third night I abandoned it altogether and worked down in the lobby The premium upgrade which I was willing to pay for made no difference To give you a benchmark both free and premium were only able to deliver YouTube videos at 144p with lots of buffering interruptions Unwatchable The Internet issue was frustrating for me and frustrating for the hotel staff who did everything they could by giving me a new room in case it would resolve the issue It didn t It is my opinion that the Internet service provider is failing this hotel or at least the 4th and 5th floor rooms I was in I suspect we all agree we need at least basic Internet in our rooms when we travel and basic means YouTube should work at 720p or at least at 480p I am not particularly loyal to any one hotel so when I have experienced not having Internet I simply choose to book elsewhere next time My advice to the management is to challenge the company that provides them with Internet I would , Very friendly staff Super helpful with any issues I had and they always did their best to be of assistance They were even proactive which was great 
102342,NH London Kensington, Room was a bit bland but it did the job Breakfast was very expensive, Great location in brilliant area Had a lovely walk by the embassies and up to Noting Hill Grand comfortable quiet room 
102343,NH London Kensington, Unclean toilet and bathroom cracked floors and the wood on the floor was breaking off bed was awful broke my back channel selection was poor , Nothing
102344,NH London Kensington, The wifi speed is certainly not the highest you will need to upload your instagram pictures later Unless you pay an extra fee for higher speed , The hotel is in a really good location You can walk through the street to arrive at The Natural History Museum Very pretty and nice neighbourhood You will definitely feel like a part of fine English Society The lobby is quite cosy Rooms are very good for the price The picture attached was the reason I woke up excited every morning To have a cup of tea and plan my day Earls Court station is quite nearby as well as many restaurants some of which will be fast food and some will be Italian like Zizzi Nice places to have wine and Pizza Well done NH 
102345,NH London Kensington, No milk available with in room tea last evening only one breakfast tea bag in box had to seek out tea bags the next morning , The bed was lovely very comfortable We requested a quiet room at the back and got one Thank you I was impressed by the offer of 2 complimentry drinks at the bar to celebrate my wife s 60th birthday The young Italian female bar staff was very polite friendly which made it even nicer The wine was very good indeed Thank you this late evening drink finished off a perfect day 
102346,NH London Kensington, The breakfast cost is extortionate the most expensive hotel breakfast any where i have stayed and due to the cost I did not eat there Not many other guests did by the look of things too much competition around , Nice decor comfy hote 
102347,NH London Kensington, The staff is a bit grumpy My mother is older and was lugging her suitcase up the hill The front desk lady saw us perfectly and didn t budge an inch to even help open the door , The location is great
102348,NH London Kensington, The complimentary WiFi is extremely low and it s not according to today s standards to charge separately of adequate speed WiFi , The location is spot on despite the busy Cromwell road the room was peaceful and quiet The staff is very friendly and professional made me feel truly welcome 
102349,NH London Kensington, The bed lacked softness but a top mattress would have done the trick , We stayed four nights and had a wonderful stay We celebrated our anniversary and were welcomed with sparkling wine a lovely note and an upgraded room Thank you so much We will definitely stay with you again Lovely neighborhood with walking distance to shopping caf s and restaurants Bus right outside that goes to Harrods Hyde park etc 
102350,NH London Kensington, We booked for 3 people but you only allocated a standard room with a double bed therefore we had to wait for a put u up bed to arrive and the room was then very small we could not get into the wardrobe, Staff very helpful
102351,NH London Kensington,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff great breakfast choice comfy bed Busy area perfect for me as I was travelling alone five mins walk from earls court tube station and plenty of places to beat within walking distance
102352,NH London Kensington, Bathroom was very clean well stocked with shower gels etc but some trim was in need of updating , the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent 
102353,NH London Kensington, We had stayed a few years ago at the previous NH South Kensington which was about a half mile away That one had better restaurants close by on Gloucester Rd and Old Brompton Rd The restaurants nearby to this one on Earls Court are on a much lower level so we had to walk a fair distance most nights to Kensington High St to get to a better class of restaurant They have a make your own espresso machine at breakfast which might seem like a nice idea but sometimes you had to wait I d really rather have the staff bring me coffee which is the way it was at the other hotels we stayed at this trip Using the elevator involved inserting your key card which sometimes didn t work Same for operating the lights within the room Hadn t seen that before in England , The hotel is on Cromwell Rd with convenient access to the Earls Court tube station We had a deluxe room which included a small sofa There was a hairdryer in the closet which we did not get in the other hotels we stayed at in England The breakfast was fine and you can get eggs cooked to order in addition to the prepared ones at the buffet The minibar in the closet allowed us to keep our own beverages The hotel is air conditioned which really is needed in London in the summer Some others that are in the same price category are not They offer a nice assortment of complimentary newspapers 
102354,NH London Kensington, A little more attention to technical maintenance please the handbasin drain needs to be cleared very slow to empty Wardrobe sliding doors kept closing annoying when using safe etc A noisy air con recirculating pump was reported needs replacing now as noise makes sleeping difficult , Staff were genuinely friendly and eager to help Where else in the centre of London would you have the use of a private garden with squirrels aplenty 
102355,NH London Kensington, Nothing, Everything was perfect Lovely room with outlook to garden Lovely breakfast Attentive staff Enjoyed dinner and drink in garden Bus outside 
102356,NH London Kensington, We booked 2 rooms for our business trip but we got rooms in basement floor for disabled people low sink bed with a hard mattress etc , Breakfast was very good rooms were spaceous and clean
102357,NH London Kensington, The only thing I d point out on the downside is that the bathroom looks a bit weary especially around the bathtub Our sink was slightly leaking I would have reported it to the maintenance team had we stayed longer but since we were only there for 1 night I didn t want to lose any time , Stayed here for only 1 night Check in was super easy Our room had plenty of space very comfortable bed Good level of cleanliness The location is absolutely brilliant About 20 mins walk to the Natural History Museum about 10 15 mins walk to the end of Kensington High Street Only 5 mins away from Earl s Court tube station from where you can directly go to Heathrow Airport about 35 mins on the tube Didn t try the breakfast because we had to check out quite early but the breakfast room did look quite inviting 
102358,NH London Kensington, Air conditioning would have been a welcome addition Only 2 plugs in the room not nearly enough with a selection of phones iPads and cameras to charge , Very friendly staff very efficient Fridge in the room was great for cold drinks as the weather was very hot and sticky Nice garden Quiet but very central location Plenty of shops and restaurants close by Shampoos etc provided were very good quality Excellent breakfast selection Luggage storage facility after check out was very useful

102365,NH London Kensington, Shame we were all on the Garden Level with a view of pipes and basement paths The beds were a little hard and the pillows like small balloons WiFi was the worst we ve experienced in a London hotel , Breakfast was excellent The twin room was a disabled room but that gave our daughters more room When a third daughter decided to stay there was no problem with the single sofa bed being made up and the extra charge for B B was minimal Great restaurants nearby Stored cases until our evening train

102370,NH London Kensington, No milk for the tea coffee There was parking available which is a God Send in this part of London but access was difficult needing the sole key for the hotel to be used to open and close the gate a logistical challenge The staff were friendly but not overly Breakfast was of poor quality though plenty of it and oh also the Hotel was not good value for money , Good sized room on the 6th Floor Good tea Coffee making facilities but no milk to enjoy it fully and a comfy bed Could control the temperature of the room well too 
102371,NH London Kensington, Rooms not adequately cleaned sheets too small for the mattresses room very small do not allow suitcases to be opened if not onto the bed rotten wood into the bathroom door frame shower spilling water from hose, Gentle Italian girl helping our kids out
102372,NH London Kensington, Our room 029 was in serious need of redecoration The walls were dreadful bits of plaster chipped and desperate to be painted The bed was too firm for my taste so after a night I felt like I had been hit by a train The air con did not work properly which made the temperature uncontrollable Reported to reception but no feedback or resolution The main window did not stay open without a bag propping it up The temperature of the room spoiled our stay , The location was good and staff were friendly and professional The breakfast was nice although I didn t like making my own coffee and toast 
102373,NH London Kensington, When I wanted to check out and pay I had to wait a long time at reception before the person eventually helped me They have to make sure that they have enough staff available to deal with people checking out in the morning , The bed was big I like that Staff was friendly and professional breakfast was good 
102374,NH London Kensington, The air conditioning had been turned on so the rooms got very stuffy and warm during the night and this could not be fixed , Bar and room service staff were very accommodating and friendly Hotel location and facilities suited our needs We liked that there was a fridge in the room and milk was bought up fresh for coffee in the morning
