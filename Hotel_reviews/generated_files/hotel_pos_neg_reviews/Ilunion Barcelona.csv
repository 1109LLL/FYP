425482,Ilunion Barcelona, There was a taxistrike when we were there As the plane of my girlfried had a delay she couldn t get to the hotel by metro I was already in the hotel and asked the guy in the lobby for help a driver or somtehing He wasnt very helpful , Very nice breakfast Perfect hotel to visit the beach and the marina as well as the poble nou with a lot of nice litte restaurants and bars 
425483,Ilunion Barcelona, The worst thing was the delay in check in They made us wait 2 hours after the regular check in time in order to have rooms tidy and ready Even after that the bathroom was dirty so we had to call the housekeeping team to help We thought the cleaning team is not enough per floor We used to return to the hotel late in the afternoon and the rooms were still not cleaned This is also the reason for late check in , We booked last minute and we were glad to find a good price and quiet good location We used taxi to get from a place to another Although metro station LLacuna was not very far just two blocks away Staff was friendly Breakfast is fine 
425484,Ilunion Barcelona, gym was average , Close to the beach and yhe staff we welcoming and spoke fluent english Rooms were nice and the local neighbourhood provided everything you needed 
425485,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Good place close to the beach less people than on the Barcelonetta many good restaurants and fruit shops on Rambla de Poblenou quite close to underground few mins walk soft and clean white towels and bedsheets good wifi and enough sockets in rooms
425486,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Very good location 6 minutes to the sea close to Rambla de Poblenou perfect for evening strolls or dinners Close to metro station llacuna and poblenou Rooms are big and comfortable Delicious breakfast all staff is extremely friendly prompt and hospitable Especially the receptioniat Noe she is extremely professional and gave us a very warm welcome 
425487,Ilunion Barcelona, The bathroom had serious mold between the tiles in the shower I asked to change rooms and had a look at another one witch was better but finally got a third one wit little visible mold However the rooms have a bad air conditioning from the bathroom so it is more than likely to get a room with mold in it , The hotel is in a great area close to the beach We loved the outside pool on the top floor 
425488,Ilunion Barcelona, The location was ok it s a bit far away from the city but still close to the metro Overall we liked it to get away and relax from the busy city, Rooftop pool was awesome the room was spacious comfortable and clean and for a really good price 
425489,Ilunion Barcelona, After midnight they wanted to charge more than booking com price for our friends and the guy at reception was very rude They do not change sheets even it was dirty They ask the whole amount at the check in , New building with clean rooms Seimming pool and gym Complimantary water 
425490,Ilunion Barcelona, There seemed to be some confusion on what we had booked Hotel blamed booking com and vice versa The hotel is very plain and doesn t have any character think British travelodge The breakfast was ok but certainly wasn t worth 14 euros each Food was greasy and pastries not fresh and took a while for anything to be replenished , Location of the hotel was good for what we wanted 
425491,Ilunion Barcelona, We booked a taxi the night before departing to take us to the hotel and it wasn t booked until we checked out Which meant the airport was a bit hectic , Room service was excellent and the reception staff we re outstanding 
425492,Ilunion Barcelona, The hotel was a little soulless but for a business hotel its fine The bedroom was a little tired and a little bit dusty , The bedroom was large and the bed was incredibly comfortable The bathroom was large and had plenty of room for all your things with a good shower The hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood close to a metro station and a short walk from the beach 
425493,Ilunion Barcelona, The AC is so strong when you get into the lobby is too much the difference from outside that really bother me , I went to this hotel many times and I really liked this time I went with my kids it was perfect the distance to the beach and I had many options to have lunch and dinner with them just few blocks from the hotel 
425494,Ilunion Barcelona, We had a broken chair the desk chair this happened on our 2nd night BUT I was able to complain in fluent Spanish to your Reception Staff that it was unacceptable etc a replacement chair was delivered to our room within 10 minutes definitely very impressive service , Overall all were ok very pleasant Keep up the good work 
425495,Ilunion Barcelona, Dinner again ordered via room service felt lazy but gave them another chance to shine Unfortunately they didn t Very basic club sandwich and chips Did not enjoy and left a bad taste to the service to an otherwise pleasant stay Room service struggled both times with basic English language very troublesome Air con was slightly faulty with the switch and it was a shame there were no vending machines offering simple snacks at night for such a large hotel Check in took a long time due to a fault with the system A cleaner entered my room without knocking in the morning long before checkout Mini bar in room only had two bottles of water , The size of the room was great Lots of breathing space The bathroom was also large Cleanliness was spot on Lunch ordered via room service potato flaked chicken was scrummy Staff were very friendly Modern room with mod cons including mini bar and large HD TV 
425496,Ilunion Barcelona, Everything, Nothing Over priced very uncomfortable beds extremely expensive more than double the price of everywhere we have stayed on our trip laundry service was 75 for just a few items I paid 360 a night and they would not include breakfast in that price And the breakfast was well below par Would never stay here again 
425497,Ilunion Barcelona, The pool and fitness center were too small The breakfast was 14 person the staff from the reception very unprofessional and rude Didn t worth the money ,No Positive
425498,Ilunion Barcelona, Outside of the short walk to the beach not much in the neighborhood Yet close bus and tram stations to get in other parts of the city Pool is small and not very nice , This is a nice hotel with good facilities on an outer layer in Barcelona Very close to the beach and in a nice and safe area but to access most of Barcelona s attractions you need to take a 20 30 min bus ride just outside the building This is more of a business hotel rather than one for holidays About 15 min walk to a nice new mall with a large Carrefour market 
425499,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, I like this hotel so much The room we had was on the 8 floor so we can saw all barcelona Especially we liked pool on the roof and personal which is very kind 
425500,Ilunion Barcelona, Room service and cleaning were below basic service When the cleaning service forgot to put towels we called the front desk to have them brought up The answer Please come to the front desk to fetch them Bread crumbs on the table remained there for 3 days , The room had been very large Breakfast buffet had been extremely well supplied for all tastes The road one block away is full of restaurants where we found a healthy mix of indigenous people and tourists 
425501,Ilunion Barcelona, Check in took forever They gave us the wrong room at first not the one we booked online Finally got the room we booked and was disappointed when we walked in They confirmed that they had moved our wake up call to our new room We never received a wake up call and we had to leave for the airport first thing in the am Luckily my husband woke up early Upon checkout we found out they made a wake up call to our old room and made the occupant of that room very angry for waking them up so early The pool closed way too early so we weren t able to enjoy it part of the reason we booked the hotel was for the rooftop pool , Restaurant in the hotel had good food Nice pool on the top floor 
425502,Ilunion Barcelona, The hotel could ve been cleaner the location wasn t the best as it feels like it s a bit out of the way There are a few cafes and bars around but it still a good walk from the marina and the beach The surrounding area is quite shabby and there are a lot of rundown buildings lots of graffiti and squats I think the price was expensive for what it was there was no iron in the room and the breakfast was incredibly overpriced The weekend was also really noisy one morning we couldn t sleep until 3 AM I wouldn t stay here again, I paid for an upgrade and the room was very nice we had a balcony and a spacious lounge seating area 
425503,Ilunion Barcelona, We didn t eat breakfast at hotel as very expensive there are a few bakeries within 5 minutes we had nice breakfasts at We asked for a double but it was two twin beds pushed together which was a bit disappointing , The location is great ten minutes walk to the beach and loads of lovely places down la rambla poblenou Rooftop swimming pool was refreshing and great for a morning swim although not huge Room was comfortable tea and coffee facilities and water provided daily in mini fridge room cleaned daily to high standard 
425504,Ilunion Barcelona, Our room was dirty there was a layer of dust on my iPad after one night laying on the beside table The interior has seen better times everything seemed sticky dirty and burned curtains damaged bathtub and a mattress that should have been changed long time ago We ve specifically asked for a higher floor with a view and got actually the first possible hotel floor with a view on the office building next to the hotel you almost could attend the meetings there , The only good thing about this hotel was the Italian restaurant on the opposite site of the street 
425505,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, So for us the location was perfect A little quiet plenty of dining options and close enough to down town We Enjoyed the Rambla del Poblenou The Rambla is one block away and offers lots of interesting walking restaurants and Cafes We enjoyed being 10 minutes away by bicycle from the downtown which can be really hectic at high season 
425506,Ilunion Barcelona, Hotel is nice enough and in a nice enough area but I m so extremely disappointed with the staff in this hotel I ve never been spoken to so rudely before that the staff ruined mine and my friends holiday I wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone The cleaner would bin eat drink our snacks and water would not recommend ,No Positive
425507,Ilunion Barcelona, No room service after 10 pm Restourant near by close by 12 am Room cleaning is not sufficient Price in my period was high , Location 10 mins walking to beach Closer to market and local restaurants Taxi point front of hotel 24 hrs Fast check in out 6 euro to reach beach 10 euro to reach la rambla st 
425508,Ilunion Barcelona, Minor issues Lobby stafffs were little bit strange may be a cultural difference for example they made a mistake regarding my payment which after my persistent requests they verified and corrected but they never apologized internet speed is on slower side, Big room Good connectivity AC was quiet against some reviews here the AC did not make any surplus noise Supermarket nearby
425509,Ilunion Barcelona, The reception is on the forth floor of a shopping center so finding the car park well below ground and then getting your luggage up to the hotel takes some work The cost of parking is high but you do get a discount through the hotel but when you add this to you overall cost works out a little on the high side Breakfast OK but powered eggs and machine coffee are my particular pet hates but overall not so bad Plesent staff though , A very plesent welcome and helpful staff The hotel is well located for the science park 10 minute walk and the old town is easily reach by bus metro or taxi Wifi worked well in the room good fast reliable connection 
425510,Ilunion Barcelona, Bathrooms was very old Showerhead didnt work good and it spreaded water everywhere , Location and rooftop with pool was the best Also good breakfest 
425511,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, The location of the property was excellent It was only one block from many restaurants and only a few blocks from the beach The hotel staff were very friendly and informative Metro stations are very handy and accessible 
425512,Ilunion Barcelona, I cant really fault anything , Very friendly warm welcome We were lucky enough to get a room on the top floor close to the gym and rooftop pool From the room we had amazing views of Montjuic La Sagrada and Tibidabo 
425513,Ilunion Barcelona, We didn t eat breakfast at the hotel because it was way too expensive So overpriced 14 euros for a buffet , Beautiful rooftop pool the hotel was really clean and the staff were so friendly
425514,Ilunion Barcelona, Reception staff are very rude very unhelpful Stayed in Barcelona many times now and never ever encountered staff like the staff here For this reason I will not be back to the hotel which is a shame as its a gorgeous hotel but definitely ruined out stay as they were all so rude , Beautiful hotel large modern rooms cleaning staff very pleasant Lovely roof top pool gym pool and out door area kept very clean by staff 
425515,Ilunion Barcelona, there wasnt enough sugar and coffee it was only one pack of sugar and one pack of coffee they should actually put atleast 2 I had to share with my partner the cup of coffee because of the lack of sugar,No Positive
425516,Ilunion Barcelona, value for money cannot even talk about it The room is clean but the basically nonsexist windows bother me so much View is not good either Would not stay here again , it is close to the beach there are some good restaurants around Subway access 
425517,Ilunion Barcelona, Some construction nearby were noticeable but nothing serious Overall it s a great place to stay , We had a special request for our Wedding Anniversary as an extra and the staff was very helpful to fulfill this Breakfast has very wide variety of meals including 4 5 kind of milk full skimmed soy almond etc Great view from the room 8th floor to the sea and the city 
425518,Ilunion Barcelona, Everything was perfect, Everything was exceptional we arrived from an overnight flight early in the morning they allowed us to check in early so we could sleep hotel room was lovely pool a little cold but lovely sun deck and staff were amazing very helpful and even gave me a rose as it was the Spanish Valentine s Day so made feel very special great hotel great wifi excellent staff and decor
425519,Ilunion Barcelona, No breakfast included when we paid 1000 for 5 nights , Very expensive for what we got no breakfast included in the high price paid No airport shuttle taxi cost 30 euro We ordered room service and the food was average 
425520,Ilunion Barcelona, The cleanliness could be improved Other details such as for example re stocking of the instant coffee powder in the room weren t always done , I liked the location a lot Away from the busy city center yet easy to reach by public transport or even walk along the beach 5 min walk from the beach One block from Rambla de Poblenou with lots of cafes and restaurants Room was spacious and beds comfortable 
425521,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Nice room on the th floor with a great view on the city and see Located some 500 m from beach and 5 minutes from metro station with direct connection to the gotic area 
425522,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfat is expensive some furniture is getting old some of the staff are not so proactive , The location room size and cleanliness panorama from room friendly staff 
425523,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and kind clean and spacious rooms Parking available with reasonable daily fee Bathroom is very clean Very good buffet breakfast with a lot of choice 
425524,Ilunion Barcelona, Cleanness was a joke Staff were very unfriendly and rude I thought receptionist at least should be able to speak a little bit of English with their guests Bed and mattress were too old and we got backpain after one night sleeping on the bed Very slow wifi Swimming pool not usable Our room was very dark with small windows to give you view of nothing stay away from this motel even if you receive a Free vachure to stay there Do not recommend that Oh one more thing if you book a pay now room they would not take the money right way They wait and charge you upon arrival with current currency affected by the fluctuation so you will pay so much more than you see on their website , There was absolutely nothing to like about this motel 
425525,Ilunion Barcelona, The wash basin was not functioning properly Can send image if required We notified the staff however it was either not fixed or wasn t fixed properly as it continued to have blockage , Hotel was not far from the metro however we used taxi most of the time It was closed to the beach 
425526,Ilunion Barcelona, the staff on desk in lobby were rude we were staying in this hotel for 6days but we really disappointed cause the room clearing staff were very lazy and didn t do their job completely , breakfast were nice and u could choose whatever u want the room was nice and comfortable also very quite with access to subway bus beach taxi and all kind of Restaurant and caf 
425527,Ilunion Barcelona, Can t find anything , Really everything The room itself was big clean and quiet The area is really nice too close to the beach and restaurants The city center is minutes away in metro Home run 
425528,Ilunion Barcelona, The day we checked out the taxis in Barcelona were on a strike and we needed to catch our train to Madrid We re not locals to know that the taxis will be on a strike the least the hotel staff could do is to arrange a private transport for us since we had alot of luggages and bags We asked the hotel staff for help and they sarcastically told us to take the metro local train to the station One of our worst experiences ever Will nvr recommend this hotel ,No Positive
425529,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, nice clean hotel short walk to the beach bus stops and the metro is very Close making it easy to travel around the city would definitely book again 
425530,Ilunion Barcelona, Everything was good , The location is next to Poble Nou with a lot of restaurants close to the beach and metro Room spacious clean towels sheets water complimentary in the refrigerator good internet speed with easy access 
425531,Ilunion Barcelona, The Housekeeping cleaning could be better i found hair in my towels a few times and on the floor of the room and bathroom Some parts of the room are chipping due to it being old but overall the hotel is decent for a business trip , I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip and the hotel is overall average The wifi is good and the rooms are decent but it is definitely not a leisure hotel I stayed here while the mobile congress was going on so the price per night was too much definitely not value for money I didnt eat the hotel much but tried room service once which was good 
425532,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast a little steep at 12 per person per day but that price was pretty good considering the quality and amount of food on offer , Comfortable beds bright rooms and even got tea and coffee making facilities which we shouldn t have got with our room Fantastic service from all staff and glad they did that little bit extra and gave us the kettle in the room The hotel is a little further out but 2 minutes away from the metro and same from the beach along with some great bars tapas just around the corner Would definitely stay again 
425533,Ilunion Barcelona, the beds are way too hard for me I understand it s a personal preference but my back neck and head were hurting from it This is reason I wouldn t come back here , it s a nice big hotel with a big room bath tub is very nice location is good it s near a subway and close to the beach There s also a shopping restaurant street right behind the hotel roof top pool is not big but I m sure nice when it s warm
425534,Ilunion Barcelona, Stuff are careless there forcing us to solve their problems with lack of cash in 6 a m while we we in a hurry to the airport Room was very dusty and furniture seemed to be quite old and rugged Wi Fi speed was also low , Only thing we liked is the appartment view on the city 
425535,Ilunion Barcelona, That there is no tea and coffee facility in room and no iron I d expect these from a 4 star hotel , Modern clean v good value for money and in a fab loacation We loved Poblenou 
425536,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, The staff were very nice and most helpful We had a problem with some important items we had left behind A young lady Reyes Gomez very efficiently helped us to recover the items All staff at this hotel very very nice and helpful 
425537,Ilunion Barcelona, Went by mistake at other Ilunion hotel closer to the city center the receptionist was extremely rude unprofessional and unhelpful Also the staff at any hotel should speak English , Good price
425538,Ilunion Barcelona, Not a dislike but I felt sorry for the staff at reception in their cheap looking uniforms Breakfast too expensive for us at 14 each but happy to eat elsewhere Took own travel kettle , Much more spacious than I thought it would be A little bit corporate which is exactly what we wanted The staff were smiley and friendly we wanted to come and go relatively anonymously as felt a bit conscious of being in someone s home when we did Air bnb I really liked the area as it was a little bit residential but with some bars restaurants and cafes used by locals not just tourists Near the beach so saw lots of people in sports wear cycling running etc I love to visit laces and get a sense of everyday life going on We walked along beach into town May have taken half an hour but nice stroll Perfect for us 
425539,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Incredible hotel It s clearly 4 stars hotel Is by far the best I ever been and I travelled more than 30 countries The reception and lobby area are huge and well designed It has big restaurant there too big area with sofas and a big internet area with several computers Elevators are secured and activated with the room card The room was biger than my appartment All de details are clearly of design with matching colours and good quality furniture Enormous bed with two sofa chairs a long desk and big TV The reception of the room is spacious with a bench and big mirror the closet is big with a quality safe box The bathroom is huge and divided in two areas one with a longer and wider than the usual bath tube wall to wall mirror with designed furniture and matching colours The other area is for the WC and a bench All details are a great quality There s a gym in the last floor a small one but classy and with the basic mchines to stay fit and a great view of the whole city The terrasse has a small swimming pool to relax and chairs to take the sun with nice view of the sea The staff is very welcoming efficient and quick to answer The cleaning staff is alwys available 2 underground floors parking with lot of places available 
425540,Ilunion Barcelona, The double bed was made of 2 single beds poorly tied together with an ever expanding gap between them , The breakfast was delicious and had plenty of options including lactose free milk The Wi Fi required login only on the first day sand this lasted for the rest of the stay 
425541,Ilunion Barcelona, The peripheral area is not charming For example the view from the room has a construction area , It is very close to both metro and beautiful sea of Barcelona The hotel has big and comfortable rooms with modern furnitures 
425542,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Fantastic One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at Staff were amazing Got on upgrade as it was my birthday Hotel is of top quality all round 
425543,Ilunion Barcelona, Booked smoking room although hotel apparently doesn t have smoking rooms although the sign in the room says no smoking but if you would like a smoking room please contact reception to be told they don t have them why the sign and why allow to book Also my wife left a 700 ring next to the sink when we checked out realised when we were on the plane home rang when we got home what a surprise no one seen it so obviously it couldn t had been there because I m sure there staff would have handed it in of course , Bed was comfortable
425544,Ilunion Barcelona, The breakfast was quite expensive but it did have good variety including bacon , It was a nice location but a bit far from the city good if you prefer the beach though Large rooms and bathrooms mine had a beach and city view The rooftop pool was a great idea but isn t heated 
425545,Ilunion Barcelona, The views from one side of the hotel are poor with no natural sunlight at all We had to move to the other side of the hotel to get sunlight and a better view , Great interior design nice view friendly staff good location at a reasonable price Most importantly it is a good location for the beach 
425546,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Room was excellent It was very specious and was not expecting that at all The bed was big and very comfy and I liked the fact that it had a nice bathtub Overall had a wonderful stay I was a bit worried as I thought we would be far from the city center and didn t want to go there to avoid the expensive prices but its was less than 15min total both walking to the tram and getting there And what makes it even better the price AND the quality of the hotel was waaaay better from hotels located directly in the center 
425547,Ilunion Barcelona, N A, The service provided by Ilunion Barcelona was excellent From the minute I walked in to the hotel I felt welcomed The staff were always there to help with any queries I had I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in Barcelona 
425548,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast is very expensive compared to the standards of Barcelona Just across the door you can get an excellent fresh and varied breakfast for less money than in the hotel I must admit that I did not take the one in the hotel but for that money It would have to be supreme quality which it did not really look like it was just average WIFI in the evening was sub par , Very spacious room clean everything is very well maintained Price was excellent for the quality 
425549,Ilunion Barcelona, I thought that I had already paid for the room but on arrival I was told that was only a reservation Person on the desk was quite abrupt in trying to sort it out Room was great but pair of ladies show and tight has been lest and also an ashtray full of fag ends, 5 minutes walk from the beach 5 minutes walk to the metro Room was so comfortable and having the balcony was a bonus Great place to eat and drink
425550,Ilunion Barcelona, The price of room service was steep X2 the prices you get in restaurants in the neighborhood The staff at the reception were borderline rude i e more a aren t we done yet kind of look when I asked to invoice my nights for my company If you want to rent a bike it is 15 euros a day once again this service price is too high and the metro is a good 10 minutes walk , I had a great room with a queen sized bed and designers chairs The TV was a 55 inch that let me hook up my Mac Book pro in order to rehearse presentation without any problems The internet was very fast Apart some sound from the corridor the room is well sound proofed and can help you get a good night sleep Taxi s are accessible from the entry of the hotel The sea is a 10 minutes walk you have a lot of nice coffee shops and restaurant 2 blocs away 
425551,Ilunion Barcelona, we had booked a superior room and when we arrived we were told there was problems with the swimming pool meaning we could only have a standard room but they would give us free breakfast although we didn t want the breakfast we told the staff we were not happy paying the price of a superior room when we were only getting a standard one,No Positive
425552,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast is 14 euros and not even close to what you would get elsewhere In my opinion not worth it Very limitted options in the restaurant menu If you are thinking of staying in for dinner or supper don t Portions are kids size and it s overpriced , Everything but the food in the restorant
425553,Ilunion Barcelona, Location was the only thing I didn t like I knew where I was staying and where it was before booking Not an issue by any means or I wouldn t have stayed there , Decent FREE wifi My room was facing for sunsets all 3 nights were spectacular Balcony Friendly and Helpful staff
425554,Ilunion Barcelona, There were no slippers in the room and they kept saying they will find etc It does not look like a 4 star hotel , Beds are alright and the room is big enough There was a deal on the price otherwise it is not worthy 
425555,Ilunion Barcelona, We didn t get the room we had booked but were more than adequately compensated by the hotel The breakfast buffet needs looking at the cooked eggs were cold every morning with no means of heating them up ie a microwave , Beds nice and comfy staff were very helpful on many occasions 
425556,Ilunion Barcelona, Our cards were blocked net day my boyfriend was concerned , Excellent Service and Design huge hotel hall and very clean very comfortable and perfect location Enjoyed and rested very well 
425557,Ilunion Barcelona, The AC didn t work it only gave warm air This was confirmed by the staff cold air or temperature regulation is not possible during winter time , Spatious room good bed and nice bathroom The swimming pool and view on the rooftop are amazing 
425558,Ilunion Barcelona, Slow internet speed , The location is special it s not at the vicinity of any major tourist spots however there s a quite beech near by and there are some really nice reastaurants A big shopping mall is in ten minutes walking distance 
425559,Ilunion Barcelona, wall too thin i can hear the high heels walking noise from next room AC also noisy, morden design very clean i stayed for some days and saw cleaning lady changing the bed sheet staff friendly for less than 50 Euro per night good value
425560,Ilunion Barcelona, The location is a little bit away from the city but it is ok Not a big problem , The room is tremendously bright and clean The bed washroom is comfortable and big Very good 
425561,Ilunion Barcelona, Rooms are very comfortable nice and clean but they lack vacation spirit You know what I mean The rooms are designed more for business professional , Location is amazing close to beach main attractions
425562,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Ilunion Barcelona is a fine four star hotel with large up to date rooms and a nice rooftop pool The breakfast offered a wide array of hot and cold foods that was well worth the charge The staff were also very friendly 
425563,Ilunion Barcelona, At first we didn t get the room ordered at booking com but receptionist has managed to propose a solution very quickly , Very nice clean hotel with a pool and a gym 
425564,Ilunion Barcelona, Facilities were not good no slippers not even a small plate or fork in the room Although in the third day we asked them for one and they gave us but the service guy took it away again the day after that , Clean room with very good breakfast
425565,Ilunion Barcelona, Facilities not prepared well no slippers no water heater no toothpaste brust wifi connection is extremely unstable and connection is very sloooow , spacious room
425566,Ilunion Barcelona, It wasn t close to main attractions but not a negative as there is metro access 3 blocks away Very safe to walk even late in the evening Can t comment on the breakfast as we chose to eat out , Rooms are big and spacious We stayed here for 4 nights and could not complain Staff was helpful I requested a kettle before arriving and it was at reception with no problems There is a fridge in the room and very nice cleaning staff Make a stop on the rooftop if you have time Short walk to the ocean side 
425567,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Great for business travellers Very competent staff Spacious rooms Easy to find a bite to eat late at night I highly recommend Aguaribay for vegetarians and health food lovers across the road 
425568,Ilunion Barcelona, It s been quite normal not not so good as alternatives for same money in area Hotel itself and room particularly has looked well used , Room size nice view to the city clean enough comfortable bed 5 7 minutes walk to the beach same 5 min to metro stations there are 2 nearby on same line 
425569,Ilunion Barcelona, Poor wifi the swimming pool is as it was not Very small With the installation for disabled person, Good localisation but in the business area however metro is ca 700 800 m from the hotel Quite close to the beach within a walk distance 
425570,Ilunion Barcelona, Swimming pool timings were unfriendly 10 8 30 when most tourists will be in the city quantity of water very low Lack of basic cosmetics like lotions ,No Positive
425571,Ilunion Barcelona, Aircon was so noisy bed mattress springs poked while lying no electric kettle was available they say they dont provide one reception was always busy no conceirge to assist guest queries , gym the view from the room could see the ocean and the city spacious room 
425572,Ilunion Barcelona, The restaurant which is open during the day until late night was not very nice The service was good and room service free but the food was nothing more than OK , The breakfast was sufficient good quality and selection was fine Cleanliness was superb and the staff helpful though sometimes it was difficult to communicate in English Free WiFi every where in the hotel good signal Short walking distance to Metro bus and the beach 
425573,Ilunion Barcelona, There was dried urine on the toilet seat of my clean room , Spacious room and bathroom The airline had lost my luggage cleaning staff was happy to provide me with dental kit toiletries 
425574,Ilunion Barcelona, Not in the best of locations slightly out of the centre Felt a little extra cautious at night Good for the beach and well connected by metro in fairness , Hotel gave us complimentary cava and chocolate on our anniversary Nice and quiet large room great view bed comfy
425575,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, we were at our honeymoon and everything was beyond our expectations The girl at the reception offered us FREE BREAKFAST all our stay alongside FREE bottle of champagne and plate of chocolates just because we were honeymooners NOT JUST THAT the house keeper stuff were extra friendly by helping my wife to transfer me from wheelchair to bed shower chair and vise versa 
425576,Ilunion Barcelona, Cold water in the swimming pool because end of the warm season not the hotel issues I think it would cost too much to warm it all the time hah, Our room was spacious with the wardrobe desk tv spacious bathroom with large mirror good size bath where me and my partner ft together to relax in hot bubbly water after the longer day 
425577,Ilunion Barcelona, the reception staff was very rude indeed asked me do you understand what invoice is when I asked her to repeat herself, The room is spacious and modern
425578,Ilunion Barcelona, Beds are excellent but the ventilation system leaves something to be desired The spacious and nicely furnished bathroom gets damp and this leads to mouldiness Unless the AC is on but since the AC is only onn when you re inn the room and in my room at least does not heat just cool you re basically stuck They should really fix the AC I mentioned this to the staff but nothing happened They serve an excellent breakfast but with just a bit more effort it would be world class Fried eggs should not have hard boiled yoke If you want to serve an English breakfast be aware that it requires Eggs toast bacon sausage and beans The sausage and beans are missing If you want a healthy m sli yoghurt fruit breakfast you need m sli FINELY CUT fruit and yoghurt Big slices of melon with outer skin intact is a no no If you want French breakfast you need croissants and espresso Both are missing The Nestl coffe machine produces the worst coffe in Barcelona The Cafe amb llet is frankly undrinkable , Very friendly and service minded staff 
425579,Ilunion Barcelona, most of staff not helpful anything it should be available in 4 star hotel it is not available and you have to ask about it so they will provide breakfast is normal and simple, It s clean comfort room size is big and good
425580,Ilunion Barcelona, Location was a bit far from the metro station , No breakfast If I remember well it was much better value at a nearby cafe The neighbourhood was fine Quiet wide streets and a nearby pedestrian precinct with excellent cafes and restaurants 
425581,Ilunion Barcelona, The room was unfortunatelly very smelly after smoke Didn t get how they could sell it out to the costumer The kitchen in the evening was very bad can not to recommend taking dinner there , Breakfast was good
425582,Ilunion Barcelona, Unbearable noise from construction site next door Impersonal hotel ok for business but a big no no for warmth and athmosphere , roof top pool very friendly chambermaids 
425583,Ilunion Barcelona, Beds were uncofmy at 225 euros a night the staff were less than helpful and not very accommodating claimed to be rated best hotel of 2015 but not a chance would not reccomend nor would I visits again,No Positive
425584,Ilunion Barcelona, Location was a very quiet area Hotel double charged us once on my credit card which was used for guarantee and was told at check out that we have not paid and proceeded to pay cash Luckily we ve got a receipt of payment and has contacted Booking com to look into it currently Hopefully we ll be able to get our money back, Rooms was comfortable and was quite a good size
425585,Ilunion Barcelona, The only reason we haven t left after the first night was parking It s totally not a 4 stars hotel Our room was not in good condition Scratched floor a trace of shoe on the armchair stale air Air conditioner worked strange When I tried to switch it off it started making loud sounds After few tries it finally switched off Ventilation seemed to be broken Windows were steamed up in the morning No toilet brush Bedclothes was changed only at first day in other hotels of this group it was changed every day as well as towels Parking costs 17 5 Euro per night Looks more like 2 stars hotel Too expensive for poor quality And not comfortable , People on reception were polite There is a parking 
425586,Ilunion Barcelona, Location Not close to centre of Barcelona A limited choice of food for breakfast Was quite expensive , Rooms were a good size Staff were helpful at check in 
425587,Ilunion Barcelona, Toilet was running continously The sliding glass door to the bathroom was off the rails The glass door to the toilet was hanging crooked and was jamming The glass door to the balcony did not work properly It was hard to open and close because the mechanism was loose , Location very good Staff very helpful and prompt to rectify problems Excellent Wifi Nice view of Sagrada Familia 
425588,Ilunion Barcelona, I stayed in this hotel for 8 nights but my experience was not up to my expectation All the receptionists do not pay attention when you speak to them and they deal with you like you are buying from grocery they spoke to me and spoke to other guest at the same time It was bad impression from the beginning I requested cup from restaurant at 11 00 pm and they told me to come to take them because they do not have room service The staff in the restaurant are 2 or 3 only and trying to manage to serve all the guests but was not manageable The cleanness in the hotel is a big issue and does not worth to stay and pay 250 Euros night I will never ever book in this hotel again if I plan to visit Barcelona This hotel deserve 6 from 10 mark only , I like the location 
425589,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, The management has quickly reacted in a problem that came up I will visit again the same hotel in a future trip in Barcelona Tanks for the hospitality Room 719 
425590,Ilunion Barcelona, Room and especially bathroom were not clean no coffee or tea no tissues no equipment to cook water windows were not clean even not on the groundfloor Staff at the reception talking with their colleagues check in took a lot of time Furniture and shower damaged This is absolutely not a 4 star hotel , The pool and the beach which can be reached in 10 minutes by foot 
425591,Ilunion Barcelona, I wish it was even a little bit more central or easy acces but it s great if your purpose is more relaxing or going to the beach, The staff was wonderful I work in a hotel myself so I m quite picky And I m pleased to say I was surprised by their professionalism and yet they were personal Especially Nuria in reception was great Super helpful and so kind 
425592,Ilunion Barcelona, The agreed non refundable price provided by yourselves did not reflect the actual price that we were charged 609 83 euros quoted became 626 77 euros actually charged Bedding was inferior with holes in sheets and was unchanged for three days Only one blanket provided A mere two small bottles of water in fridge in our room no Tea or Coffee is provided in rooms The price of 15 euros for breakfast each was excessive and we opted as many guests did choose to buy or have alternative breakfast locally We will not use or recommend this hotel again , Location was good as friends live locally in an easily accessible area Staff were largely helpful and friendly A great City to visit with excellent transport systems 
425593,Ilunion Barcelona, I can t prove it but I am sure that on the Booking com website it said that breakfast was included in a different colour writing though we were told it wasn t upon arrival nothing major but it just set us in a less relaxed mood waiting for something else unpleasant unexpectedly to come up It was rainy and cold day we got wet but the heating didn t work in the room There was a sound of something happening but after 2 hours we switched it off because nothing was happening The sink and the bath were not draining well at all Overall I would say we had a good stay but there is a room for improvement, Good enough location cosy apartment and the pool on the rooftop was a nice touch 
425594,Ilunion Barcelona, WiFi was very poor, Great location restaurants cafes everywhere within 100m of hotel all with great food no need to go into city to dine Metro short walk away easy access to city Very interesting city Most enjoyable stay Definitely take the hop on hop off bus most informative 
425595,Ilunion Barcelona, Staff was helpful but never told you more than the answer to your question Housekeeping was a little inconsistent Sometimes they replaced the coffee sometimes they didn t Sometimes we had soap and shampoo other times not The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom was broken when we checked in but quickly repaired on request , We opted to upgrade for the jacuzzi tub room That was worth it The room and the bathroom were both large The views from the high floors were great The AC worked well Wifi was free The king bed was huge Given that we were running around being tourists most of the time this was a nice room to come back to and relax Some nearby restaurants and stores and a metro station and close to the beach 
425596,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, this is a lovely hotel very clean and food and staff lovely location is a little bit out and it is not luxury but very nice and would recommend prices in the city way too high
425597,Ilunion Barcelona, There was a couple times when electricity was off but they fixed it fast , Really king size bed Everything is new I guess this hotel is a brand new The location is cool as it s close to the street with restaurants and also is not far from the beach and metro And the swimming pool in the roof is a very good idea when you are lazy to go to the beach 
425598,Ilunion Barcelona, The room is spacious and clean but it is just too basic for a 4 star hotel with not even cotton buds or sleepers available , The location is perfect so close to the sea Fairly convenient to travel to anywhere in the city as well 
425599,Ilunion Barcelona, Bathrooms in bedrooms are clean but need touching up Grouting on tiles is in great need of redoing Staff are Efficient but not super friendly Not an issue for me as I m not American , Very comfortable beds Big clean rooms Great area Less touristy Very near the beach A short walk to Port Olympico Lots of bars and restaurants nearby In short a great pick for me

425603,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, The location is 10 minutes walk from a beautiful white sand beach The best part is you stroll past a range of cafes and restaurants that you can select on your journey back The hotel is modern and room 502 catches the afternoon sun as well as having a view out to the Sagra de Familia 
425604,Ilunion Barcelona, I always enjoy an electric hot water pot in the room so I have the option of making an early cup of coffee or tea That would ve been a nice addition to the room , The location of this hotel was excellent just off the rambla with plenty of cafes bars and bakeries which was both convenient and fun He hotel is a 5 minute walk to he beach which was a big plus The metro station was also near by But perhaps one of the best features was he friendly and helpful staff When we realized we left an important item in our room they mailed it on to our next hotel I would highly recommend this clean and comfortable hotel 
425605,Ilunion Barcelona, I had higher expectation for a 4 stars hotel No bath robe no slippers even if the hotel has a pool Few cosmetic products in the bathroom The room floor looks out of date is scratched and looks neglected No balcony the carpet from the hall was dirty , Nice breakfast but quite expensive

425611,Ilunion Barcelona, Information to car drivers if you set up postal address on GPS you reach a dead end street You have to set up name of the neighbouring street with parking access Carrer Llaguna Doing so you will save 30 minutes of trouble within a network of one way streets Hotel should tell , Good level of comfort and easy access to BCN Centre
425612,Ilunion Barcelona, Location is not central You are near Poblenou and that s about it Most city attractions are far away from it , Staff was excellent at all times shower was strong wifi was stable rooms were clean and very spacious 
425613,Ilunion Barcelona, I was very put out at the rudeness of one sole member of staff who was serving another customer on my arrival After waiting for 10 minutes I asked how long it would take to which she abruptly replied I m serving this customer I again asked the same question with the words I ve had a long journey and wish to know if I can visit the bathroom if the wait would be longer Same rude reply again from her I don t understand why the man gent consider her right for that role In 2nd day we requested an iron to the room After 4 hours waiting and heading out I asked why the delay to be told it wasn t available But no one informed us but we managed to get one next day The hairdryer in the bathroom was making a loud noise and smoke was coming out I reported this dangerous situation which took a further 2 days to be replaced after further insistence from me Oh and when asking for an ironing board at reception it was handed over to me to carry up to my room by myself a guest this isn t a 4 star hotel nor service nor staff Breakfast was always cold and bland Not at all happy with this place and won t be coming back ,No Positive

425615,Ilunion Barcelona, We did not like the area very smelly and dog mess on the pavements very off putting The room did not have any tea coffee making facilities the furniture needed attention The tiles in the bathroom needed regrouting and a good clean House keeping not on the ball we had to ask for fresh towels at 4pm in the afternoon on the second day Wi Fi kept dropping out The staff appeared to be moody and not overly helpful especially when I reported a leak in the bathroom the staff on duty said it was the air conditioning and said he would arrange for some one to have a look at it or arrange another room for us neither of these happened I would not recommend this hotel to a friend and would not stay here again value for money zero and staff need to improve on their customer care , Despite the area the hotel was a short walk to the beach

425623,Ilunion Barcelona, First of all we have a bad impression from check in reception girls not polite with informations about rooms and parking Second one is the room was dirty specially bath dusty and sandy For a 4 hotel we have one little shower gel for 2 persons the fridge was smelling bad , Only good experience we had in this hotel was breakfast and the good location near bars restaurants beach
425624,Ilunion Barcelona, They could have been a little more generous with the towels And the pool on the roof was packed every single day with no space but I guess you just have to get there early but really nothing bad , The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable 8 mins walking to the beach Great little street just 2 mins away with heaps of restaurants that were very good value for money and good food 25 mins walk to the bars and clubs and really could not complain about anything I would stay here again for sure

425628,Ilunion Barcelona, A lot The reception staff greater us with Check in not until 3 O clock when we arrived We just wanted to drop the bags and go out The key cards to the two rooms we had keep not working we were told it was because of our mobile phones but we did not have them with us It was frustrating to have to repeatedly go down from the 7th floor to get them reset The check in procedure was far too long so there was always long waits at reception You should only have to show your passport credit card and sign They seemed to have to manually type in everything while you stood there The sink was blocked and despite three requests it was half fixed three days later but blocked again Lock on bathroom door did not work Some sun chairs on deck broken and need to be replaced , It was within walking distance of beach and metro station that got to anywhere in the city very easily Very nice roof top pool with grass deck area Rooms cleaned very well 
425629,Ilunion Barcelona, The bathrooms have calcium deposits where the cleaners haven t cleaned thoroughly and it s unnecessary given the quality of materials used in the bathrooms no one fixes small repairs like broken lightbulbs in the lobby Where is the hotel handyman Where are the spring cleaning staff Small things matter This is a great hotel take proper care of it ,No Positive

425634,Ilunion Barcelona, 14 Euros for breakfast is expensive bearing in mind the number of cheap options in the area Bathrooms should have toilet brushes , An excellent hotel in the wonderful Poble Nou district Close to all amenities seafront and restaurants We can t speak highly enough of the hotel and its staff

425658,Ilunion Barcelona, The hotel is not centrally located and the fitness centre could use some improvement The WIFI was a bit unstable and could have been a little more reliable and faster There are no extras as far as robes slippers water or a coffee maker which are offered in the room , The hotel is modern bright and clean the rooms are large and the bathrooms are clean The hotel is not located near the busy areas of Barcelona but right outside of the hotel there is a taxi stand which makes getting around to the rest of the city quite easy The hotel has a decent restaurant and proper business centre There is also lots of meeting places in the lobby of the hotel The overall d cor of the lobby is quite nice and modern and the check in was quite simple and quick 
425659,Ilunion Barcelona, The pool is described as amazing on the information guide Its not amazing its small and surrounded by a poor atmosphere The toilet seat was broken and moved every time I sat on it The toilet doesnt have a lock but it does have a fake lock for absolutely no reason whatsoever The safe didnt work I guess the battery was dead on the lock The staff are not great I called reception to ask if the tap water was drinkable The lady there said I dont know I said can you ask someone else there that does know She said please call back and put the phone down Would have been nice to have tea coffee facilities The bed had wheels which means if you try to lean up to watch TV you end up rolling the bed forward and falling back behind the bed It seems to be in a run down area Loads of graffiti on walls on the way to the beach Not much going on Quite a boring location The view from our room was a building Nothing to look at , I liked the fact it was close to the beach It was cleaned well by the cleaning staff The room was a decent size The TV was nice and big The price was cheap

425668,Ilunion Barcelona, Cost was high for what it was but that was probably because the F1 was on the same weekend, Bed was large and comfortable rooms were basic but contained everything we needed

425673,Ilunion Barcelona, The area doesn t tend to cater for the British no kettle in the room perhaps a bit out of the way from the city , Short walk from the beach less than 5 mins a lot of local bars restaurants literally 30 seconds from the hotel very clean rooms

425679,Ilunion Barcelona, The hotel is a bit soulless and lacking in charm the room s are good size but have no coffee or tea making facilities we thought that a bit mean I need a cup of tea or coffee when I wake up The card used for getting into the room does not have the address of the hotel on it we gave it to a taxi driver to say where we wanted to go and he said which one there are five hotels of that name my phone was flat fortunately he lent me his to look up my booking having the address of the hotel on the card would have been so much easier , The location is good there are plenty of restaurant s nearby and the beach is an easy walk the staff were helpful and the breakfast good
425680,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast too expensive for what you get pastries on the buffer are very small Not all staff members speak English The lady on the front deskt wasn t really in the mood to give me proper directions , The room was very comfortable spotless clean They refil the water in the minibar daily that s very convenient

425696,Ilunion Barcelona, The room was a little dirty on our arrival and hairs that were hanging on the wall didn t get cleaned away during our stay The room gets stuffy traveling in March that means it s still fine and you can open the windows I don t know if in the summer the aircondition is on more power Wifi very slow but we had free 3G through our provider which made looking up info easier , Location was fine not too central but everything in easy reach with public transport Close to the beach and you can walk to Barceloneta within about half an hour Easy check in comfortable bed nice shower Spacious room

425699,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, I made mistake wile online booking and took double room instead of triple Hotel changed within the price of double Localization is perfect 7mins walking to the sea many shops and restaurants around 
425700,Ilunion Barcelona, The night we arrived we had to wait for 45 mn at the lobby before being able to check in because there was a computer problem at the reception However the staff was nice enough to provide us with some drinks and snacks while waiting The bathtub seemed pretty cheap as it is only composed of very light plastic the weight of your body on it is enough to deform it Plus the walls around it were quite dirty In general more or less everything in the room looks cheap especially the walls when you take a closer look at it As for the bed the mattress was very hard and the blanket provided was really thin and uncomfortable to use during the night even if it did keep us warm enough Last but not least the walls are very thin so be expected to be disturbed by noisy neighbours This hotel shouldn t clearly be rated as a 4 star hotel , Free bottles of water were available every day which was quite nice It is really convenient to go to the beach from the hotel and going to the downtown from it is very easy as the closest metro station can be reached in less than 10 mn by walk There is a small gym available too and overall considering the price for 3 nights 130 EUR the hotel met many of our expectations 
425701,Ilunion Barcelona, Nothing, Everything was absolutely fantastic Staff friendly and helpful Nice clean very big room Breakfast from 7 to 10 am was delicious Very close to Metro Station 5 stops to Catalunya 5 min walk to see side For me the best hotel

425706,Ilunion Barcelona, The wifi connection was poor No conditioner just schampoo a minor thing The gym was small and old machines , Clean and fresh hotel Big and bright room Resturant with various dishes 
425707,Ilunion Barcelona, I think breakfast is a bit pricey , The location of this hotel is good and easily accessible A beach is nearby for relaxing Hotel room was clean and well maintained 
425708,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, We have stayed here twice and just love the place Such a great location 5 mins walk to the beach but still miles away from the tourist crowds Pay the extra for the deluxe rooms they are such great value really large and spacious with small balcony looking out over the city one way and the sea the other way The rooms are modern with a lovely bathroom with big bath Several English TV channels The hotel is located off a small rumbla with many cafes and restaurants and bars but all very local in atmosphere Highly recommended
425709,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, We spend few days in Ilunion Barcelona It s a quite nice place with really good view from the room Our room was on 8th floor Gym and swimpool on the roof big plus for this hotel Unfortunately the weather wasn t perfect for swim in it Any way location is perfect Close to Metro Station great connection with every part of the city Quite area close to the sea site cheap restaurants near the hotel Recommend you this place for staying 
425710,Ilunion Barcelona, The new management has decided to use a strong perfume which seems to come through the ventilation system and pervade the entrance and reception area I found it extremely unpleasant You could even smell it out in the street on approach After two days I felt quite sick by it I am quite sensitive to artificial odours like these Some affect my breathing and give me headaches I did ask when I was leaving if the reception manager could pass on my complaint about this I have stayed at this hotel 4 times now three under the old Confortel management where this had not been an issue It is not a fancy hotel but safe convenient and comfortable for my needs After this visit however I am not sure I would or could return if the management continued with this practice as the smell became increasingly problematic for me Many people suffer from the effects of artificial perfumes and it seems strange to have such a dominant and in my view sickly smell in this public place What s wrong with the smell of a clean well kept entrance and reception which is far more welcoming Please Illunion Barcelona get rid of the perfume Your hotel is fine without it The other thing I noticed this time which seemed a bit of a negative was the small number of reception staff on duty who appeared to be working very long shifts This seemed to affect one person s performance on the desk considerably This may be because it was in December and low season It was unbelievably slow so I hate to think what it might be in the summer months if the policy of the new management is to cut costs by employing less staff , The location near the Poblenou Ramblas its a safe friendly area with good bars and restaurants away from the main tourist scene and close to the sea and promenade The rooms are large quiet with large comfortable beds and the rooms I ve had a bath as well as a shower which is a real bonus to me Staff are usually pleasant friendly and helpful Its got a great roof terrace for the summer months with a pool sunbeds and great view of the sea and welcome breeze when the weather is hot 
425711,Ilunion Barcelona, The breakfast was not included and it was not cheap at all around 12 euros The daily rates were a bit too expensive but we already knew that , Everything It is 4 blocks away from Llacuna Subway station The room was extremelly comfortable and clean The bed was huge and also comfortable Bathroom clean Wifi works everywhere and was good enough

425713,Ilunion Barcelona, I could smell cigarette smoke from the other room it came from the rest room i think the exhaust ducts are connected so the smoke some how entered our rest room need to recheck the CFM , Staff was very helpful they gave us 110 effort in helping us with any issues we had we had a few problems but it was addressed immediately with an upgrade that we didn t expect Thank you Ilunion staff

425715,Ilunion Barcelona, we stayed three nights in Barcelona the sink was blocked on the first night but they didn t have a technician to fix it and the hotel was fully booked so they couldn t move us to another room We asked for an extra blanket on the first day but they said the room service was closed so they didn t have any extra blanket However the sink was fixed the next day and we were given an extra blanket The bathroom door was broken and wouldn t close , The hotel is very convenient less than 5 minutes walk from the metro station and very close to the beach Our room was very clean and spacious We asked for a Kettle and they sent one immediately Staff were friendly

425719,Ilunion Barcelona, Not really what I would expect of true 4 star Relatively far from city center although not too far from metro stop At full 4 star rates probably a disappointment , Rooms are spacey location close to beach Out of season deal is good 
425720,Ilunion Barcelona, No bad experience Only problem is to get to Barcelonta you have to get a metro apart from that its good well recommended, Excellent staff was really helpful Had a great stay
425721,Ilunion Barcelona, Nothing Can t comment on breakfast as we didn t opt for it but everything was spot on, Location was perfect Just far enough away to be quiet at night but close enough to get to Las ramblas and plaza catalunya by metro or a lovely half hour stroll along the promenade

425731,Ilunion Barcelona, Most of the front office staff seemed preoccupied all the time and are quite dour The only staff who was always smiling friendly and accommodating was the male front desk staff who was on duty during the afternoon night , Room was always clean The free bottles of water were very much appreciated 
425732,Ilunion Barcelona, The coffee machine at breakfast I could not drink the coffee I am not fussy but the milk tasted sweet even through it should have just been milk , Location near the beach

425735,Ilunion Barcelona, A great location but a hotel run with no vision to improve its long term standards They could put a kettle with some coffe and tea in the rooms simple things like this are missing lack of vision to serve the customer, The location was great The room was big The hotel management can do better to improve value The breakfast was really good value 
425736,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast was poor especially the cooked options under cooked bacon swimming in fat Service at restaurant slow had to wait regularly for buffet to be replenished and in the evening had to ask 3 times where my drink order was Restaurant staff seemed clueless Also didn t like the fact that using the booking com website we thought we had agreed a price for all in our party for breakfast but wasn t the case when we got there , Clean and spacious room

425745,Ilunion Barcelona, There was one lady at the front desk who was incredibly rude to me and questioned why I would need an invoice and demanded she should not have to give me one as I was already given one at the time of check in The bathrooms all of the ones from the other people we travelled with were seemingly clean on the surface but the bathtubs and walls were covered with mildew and mould , The hotel was massive and the common areas were very clean Super fast wifi to get a social media fix day or night The rooms were also huge and beds very comfortable plenty of cupboard space and easy to settle in for a couple of days The location was so good right behind a local avenue home to so many local shops and restaurants so we found ourselves not needing to go into Barcelona city for entertainment Nearly all of the staff were helpful and lovely 
425746,Ilunion Barcelona,No Negative, Very quiet and spacious room and we slept really well Great location near the beach in the Poblenou area with its own local La Rambla Access to Metro via a short walk Great views of Barcelona from our window and the la Merce fireworks

425750,Ilunion Barcelona, Breakfast could have had a bigger variety and quality for a 4 star hotel , Located 10 minutes walk from the beach Spacious modern rooms contemporary interior 
425751,Ilunion Barcelona, It is simply the hotel of sorry we don t have Many basic needs are not available such as ironing machine cattle and even trolly for the luggages No body can help for car parking You really feel that it is a half star hotel and I don t know how it was classified as 4 stars hotel , Location and lobby design 
425752,Ilunion Barcelona, The breakfast is possibly a bit over priced at 12 Euros were person Some other developments would be a genuine bar within the hotel open until at least midnight rather than just a formal restaurant area which tended to be empty on most evenings , The location is a key selling point The hotel is within walking distance to Bogatell Beach 10 minutes Llacuna Metro Station 5 minutes very close to the shops bars and restaurants The hotel was very clean there was plenty of space within the rooms and the Wi Fi was pretty strong
