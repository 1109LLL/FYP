358330,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, very good location nice quarters close to the city center but without the tourist stress Very convenient parking garage but also very expensive 25 Euros per night in my country you get a decent hotel room for that money 
358331,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing , We were given a room on the 6th floor with sensational views of the city and museum quarter Room was very clean and bed very comfortable Great location in a wonderful city 
358332,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, There was a lovely restaurant which was only used for breakfast The only other food available was from the bar It was however excellent but the lack of a restaurant appeared to cause a little confusion with some of the other guests , The air conditioning in the room was perfect The beds were very comfortable 
358333,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Wifi was slow and highly unstable To connect to this you ll also need to fill an on screen form with your details which is absolutely not user friendly on a phone screen And why would they need these details anyway They got the same data on record when checking me in so why punish me for connecting to the wifi by making me fill that form Moreover lack of wifi data encryption anybody across the street can sniff your passwords , Great location nice and friendly staff clean rooms decent gym
358334,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, The staff were very helpful in answering queries about places to see and directions etc but what really surprised me was that they located my phone charger and universal adapter that I left in the room and sent it by post to my home That s going the extra mile and I would most definitely stay there again for that kind of support and consideration towards guests

358339,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, At the level I was paying for I expected a bit more I was particularly surprised that there was no consistent wifi in the room sometimes none at all I was on a higher floor so I presume just my bad luck to be far away from wherever the signal is dispensed from But this is the first hotel in a long while that I ve had that issue and it is inconvenient There was an electric kettle to boil water but no instant coffee or tea or other amenities offered , The staff were always very professional and nice at the desk so too the cleaning staff The room was quiet nice amount of space with a little seating area The location is good and easy to walk around directly to the museum quartier 
358340,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Wifi was a bit slow and not consistent , Excellent breakfast Very comfy room Was noisy at night with the window open but used the air con and had a very good night s sleep 
358341,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, No Air Condition in hotel various excuses Too cold outside replacing hotel air condition Has been out No idea when air condition will work , Eggs Over cooked solid mass Bacon Under cooked Budapest K K much better with eggs bacon

358345,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, That hotel is not cost effective You can find better hotel with that price or can find half of the price as same hotel Room is too small and internet connection doesn t work very well Some of rewivers written about location is perfect Vienna is too small city and location is how can be problem My firm had paid the hotel before my accomadation when i was check out hotel want to extra 3 euro for city tax Its the first time I saw payment extra city tax I had belived to decide for accomodation in old guest rewieve but I made mistake , Cold water with lemon in lobby is perfect 
358346,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, I would add just slippers and a bathrobe and salmon on breakfast these are the only minuses which I can say about this hotel the rest was very good, Aazing location 5 min away from the main museums and 10 min from the main royal residence Hofburg Breakfast is excellent the room was clean and nice and helpful staff I would definitely return to this hotel

358350,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The room was comfortable but a little small By European standards it was probably acceptable The bed was comfortable which means a lot to me when traveling The maids did clean the room daily and that is a plus with me The hotel restaurant only opened for breakfast although the bar offered limited fare I did find numerous small restaurants close to the hotel and by and large the prices were reasonable I must have missed the prepaid breakfast option but the hotel only charged 14 EUR for breakfast which was reasonable , It was a convenient walk to several attractions and about a block and a half to the underground as well as suface transportation 
358351,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Although I had placed the Do not disturb card outside of my door the cleaner ignored it and simply got into my room 8 00 in the morning and scared me to death The way I woke up at that day and the time really who starts cleaning the occupied hotel rooms at 8am ruined my mood for the whole day Luckily enough I was at least wearing my pazamas The hot water had no pressure at all and I was struggling to have a shower and even more to wash my long hair The room was very hot since the weather was warm and the aircon not yet functioning in May , Amazing view of Vienna from my 6th floor room I have attached a picture of it Nice large double bed Big enough and clean room and bathroom Convenient location quite central Friendly and helpful staff Wifi was working fine

358353,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, Beds and pillows were very comfy The breakfast quality and selection was excellent The staff were friendly and very helpful The hotel was perfectly situated in a quiet street within a short walk to the sights 
358354,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Don t rely on getting a twin room Despite requesting a twin room 3 months in advance we were put in a double not ideal as I was travelling with my mother When we complained the staff were not apologetic and didn t offer anything to make up for it we really weren t impressed Additionally the air conditioning didn t seem to work and the room was really hot , Breakfast is good 
358355,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing to dislike Hotel is not in city centre but that is reflected in the price so not really a negative , Clean room comfortable beds Staff very helpful Breakfast good 
358356,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Room airconditioning did not cool small room single room hot bathroom floor and no control gym is in the same room as sauna by far too warm for excercising and again airconditioning out of order , Central location
358357,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, We arrived early but the room originally assigned on the same floor as a friend was not ready at their stated time of 3 pm We were however given a substitute on another floor shortly after 3 pm Apart from this initial rather unsympathetic reception the staff were friendly , Extra good breakfast and friendly serving staff The bistro had a small basic menu 
358358,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing to complain about , We had a great stay at this hotel Everything and everybody was wonderful The breakfast was very nice fresh and a great variety of food Very nice and friendly staff The room was comfortable and very clean The location of the hotel is great close to public transportation and is right in the museums quarters 
358359,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing, Proximity to the Museum District and the Hoffburg and the tube station could not have been better Many great restaurants in all price ranges within a few minutes of the hotel We breakfasted somewhere different every day as our deal was room only and had some wonderful imaginative food to start the day We enjoyed drinks in the lobby bar and most nights had the cocktail of the day in happy hour before we went out to eat 
358360,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, My rate of 103 Euro night should ve included breakfast and the 25 Euros charge for checking out 3 hours late when the hotel was empty , Clean organised and professional Great location and proximity to shops and trains 
358361,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, In addition to its all round excellence the breakfast buffet is great High hotel standard at a very reasonable price away from the busy downtown traffic but easy access to the centre and museums on foot or by public transport two metro stations and several bus tram stops nearby 
358362,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, Quick check in all staff are efficient and friendly clean rooms nice beds great breakfast good food homey Close to the subway lots of restaurants attractions 
358363,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, This is not a 4 hotel at best 3 the room was exceptionally small glad I didn t bring a cat One pillow each and the towels are past there best Although it was 23 degrees air conditioning is only available in the summer so the small room became a furnace at night If you opened the window a lot of noise was generate by the smoking room until late at night They supplied toiletries on the first night not replaced and no complimentary water which is usually supplied in 4 hotels The reception and bar area were really nice and the rooms were rather disappointing The bathroom was tiny and in need of some TLC The price was OK for city centre probably wouldn t stay here again , The hotel was in the centre of the Art Museum area so plenty to do in the immediate area close to underground station and plenty of buses so easy to get around The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was really nice with a good selection 
358364,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, no complaints, Very nice hotel The location was excellent for me as I was primarily interested in touring the museums It was quiet but very close to the Museum Quartier tour bus stops and the metro The bathroom was clean and spacious the bed and pillows were comfortable Breakfast was served buffet style with a nice selection of items The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable 
358365,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, When we arrived after a long journey the receptionist said we had booked two rooms She took a lot of convincing it was actually an upgrade to a superior room She was flapping the booking paper about insisting we had booked two rooms Some time later she conceded it was a fault of her colleague , Breakfast was varied plenty of bananas some hotels run out quickly Big choice of food staff at breakfast very attentive 
358366,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The wifi was the worst I ever came across and I had my share of 4 hotels It kept indicating a good signal but if my iPad would connect at all most of the times kept on trying to do so the connection will be lost again within a minute or so This not only made it absolutely impossible to work in my room but was also getting frustrated For that reason I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers Another problem was the soundproofing in my room My windows were just above the tram line which kept rattling them all through the night Finally free access to the wellness suite was included but the door lock was broken i assume and would not accept my key card On all occasions I wanted to use it I had to get downstairs to the reception in my robe and ask for an attendant to come and let me in When you have only a limited time window to relax in between work and dinner with business partners having to do all the extra exercise was not ideal , The bed was very comfortable The sauna was very clean spacious and just the right temperature The hotel staff I met were very nice and helpful 
358367,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Our room had only one small window facing another building and even though the weather was nice the room was always rather dark The pillows were quite high for our preference a choice of thinner pillows would ve been nice , Great location the hotel is right behind the Museum Quarter and the metro station The room was very clean It was also quiet we didn t hear any noise during our stay The bathroom with a bathtub and a good very hot shower was nice 
358368,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, lack of aircon despite booking com stating property has it it does but only in use during summer months Bearing in mind noisy location and hot weekend would have actually slept if aircon had worked Some staff breakfast room greeter overly brusque verging on rude, location i superb in terms of proximity to major sites restaurants cafes bars etc and all forms of public transport size of room cleanliness Relaxed and quiet hotel inside which suited us just fine
358369,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The internet connection was slow not enough even for stable Skype calls , My stay at the Hotel Maria Theresia was very pleasant the place provided everything I prefer neither big nor small no embarrassingly posh decoration very comfortable and clean two elevators Special thanks to the personnel for their friendliness and the wonderful atmosphere My room on the first floor was spaceous and full of light which was really important as I had to work till late The breakfast was superb The metro the main shopping street and one of the few Spar supermarkets open even on Sundays are within an easy walking distance 
358370,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The room was a bit smaller than i expected yet i didn t mind that I asked for a thinner blanket because it was getting warm at night but that wasn t available that made my sleep slightly uncomfortable, Great location 5 10min walk away from the main monuments and nightlife yet very quiet neighborhood so you can get a good sleep Nice and accommodating staff 
358371,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Everything was fine Maybe a bit hot in the room since the weather was warm and the aircon not yet functioning in April , The location is one of the best in Vienna and I ve visited many times The old town is ten minutes away when walking really slow The U Bahn station very close if you prefer to ride anywhere Around the hotel plenty of shopping dining and drinking options Just enjoy Hotel staff very nice good breakfast 
358372,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Be careful not to choose a room overlooking the tramline this is very noisy and runs from early morning Air conditioning set to only work in summer so very hot without window open , Great location friendly staff and a nice room 
358373,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The heating was not connected in the room when we arrived so it was very cold inside and some extrange mechanical noises were listened in the room , Location its gate is just at about 3 4 minutes from a tram stop about 8 minutes from the nearest metro station and about 12 minutes from the city inner ring when you can connect the main tram lines the tram near the hotel finish in this multiple connection stop Cleanliness facilities were fine and breakfast was very good

358383,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, I had an internal room and found it claustrophobic The safe wasn t working when I arrived indicating no one had bothered to check They don t supply shower caps small point but still , Great location I like this hotel but I think they could do a bit better overall 
358384,K K Hotel Maria Theresia,No Negative, The hotel is located in beautiful part of Vienna Only bad thing probably not noticeable for anyone is that the room doesn t look to the city In other words we don t see outside at all Despite that everything was awesome personnel breakfast and service I d definitely recommend to stay at that hotel

358389,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The pillow on the bed not comfortable for sleeping One pillow was supplied and it was too high and had a rubbery feel They are compromising by having a single pillow for both sleeping and sitting lying on bed whilst watching TV this requires a more bulky pillow behind the back , Plenty variety at breakfast
358390,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Cleaning ladies started to knock on the door at 8 30 And they went on , Excellent bed fabulous scenery over the city silent night and interesting neighbourhood Bath tube was very positive surprise 
358391,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing really I wished the hotel had a swimming pool but it s not something I didn t like about it If there was a pool the hotel would have been perfect , I read so many bad reviews on booking com about this property like not exciting breakfast cold room unfriendly staff None of it was true The breakfast was descent considering the size of the hotel and number of guests staff were very nice and helpful and rooms were very comfortable Overall really enjoyed our stay

358455,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, My daughter s only complaint was that they didn t provide shower caps The location in the museums quartier was nice and quiet but it was a bit of a hike at the end of an evening out in the centre of town to get back to the hotel maybe about 20 minutes It didn t matter if the weather was nice but on our first evening which was quite chilly and windy it was a battle to walk back after dinner Still there was a train station nearby that we didn t take advantage of until our last couple of days , The room was spacious with a low dividing wall between our bed and our young daughter s The separate toilet and luggage rooms were an unexpected bonus The free wifi was excellent and was actually free throughout the stay The included breakfast was generous and of good quality We were allowed a late checkout and as our flight out of Vienna wasn t till late that night it was very generous of them to offer us the use of the showers in their wellness room gym facility at the end of a warm afternoon out

358467,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, At first we were a little disappointed that our room was on the back and next to a busy road We decided to see what it was like at night The double glazing shut out most of the noise and the air con was efficient so in the end we stayed in the room given The room was a generous size , All the staff were friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble for them We were always greeted with a smile 
358468,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, They overbooked the hotel downgraded our room but charged us for the originally booked one Tried to trick us by not telling us up front this is not the room type we booked Claimed they have to charge us original rate because it is so in the computer system Room was dirty dust all over the bathroom fungi on the tiles bath sewer blocked how in the world do you clean such a bath By far the worst hotel stay ever in Vienna and elsewhere This hotel does not deserve 4 stars service is unprofessional and room dirty , Location is the only thing positive about this hotel 
358469,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Prices were higher than surrounding bars restaurants though I suppose that s expected They tried to charge me a city tax which I had already paid at the start and even had the wrong credit card number on file for me no idea whose that was The only view was of a different part of the hotel , Staff were really friendly everything was clean and the location was perfect for my needs 5 minutes walk from the Museums Quarter and less than that to the nearest underground station

358476,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Hotel looked very dated Carpet at the entrance says it all frayed faded and needs cleaning Windows looked out on a bleak internal courtyard type area Major disappointment , Breakfast was generous usual type for a hotel such as this Rooms were a nice size and comfortable Seemed pretty clean Very close to the museum quarter and monument attractions Nice restaurants nearby

358479,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Nothing to complain about I would definitely stay here next time in Vienna , Perfect stay Great breakfast well located attentive staff No problem was too big or too small for the hotel staff to resolve While other hotels are closer to the heart of Vienna nothing beats the cost value and the quality of the service provided plus the hotel is right next to some of the biggest museums in the city plus the Hofburg Palace is just a short walk away I have stayed in many hotels in Vienna in the last 7 years and this one is my favorite by far 
358480,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Pillows were very poor , Executive double was a large room with a good king size bed Good quality breakfast buffet with a wide range of choices Evening bistro was also good although choice then was limited but quality good Easy to walk to central city attractions and nearest metro station Tram line even closer Good desktop computers available with printing

358488,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Beware their web description says they have air conditioning But a sign above the switch in each room says it s only available in the Summer a cheap trick which only dubious establishments usually pull It was 25 degrees outside when we arrived and the fan produced after badgering was no substitute Had we known this beforehand we certainly would have booked elsewhere , Hotel is in a good location near to the Museum area with convenient transport links to other parts of Vienna 
358489,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Room was ok but a little small No air con available in the room or the rest of the hotel When the breakfast room was full of people it was hot and stuffy No air con in the postage stamp of a gym was ridiculous Was told it is controlled centrally Some staff were lovely particularly one set of breakfast staff Unfortunately the other set were rude scowling looking at their watches when we went into breakfast 1 2 hour before the end ignoring their tables and not serving hot drinks unplugging the toaster and heated trays for the cooked food and not replenishing the buffet Also they shortened the hours for breakfast by putting up a sign in front of the restaurant but the desk staff and in room information didn t have the shortened hours leading to confusion and further rudeness , Decent hotel executive level rooms are a great size and the balcony is fab Classic rooms are a little small but well presented Not quite what I would expect of a hotel calling itself 4 star but overall a decent hotel and a good location Quiet street nice restaurants in the nearby streets and a 10 min walk to the main area

358492,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Not sure there is any thing to add here It was a bit confusing getting from the underground station to the hotel perhaps your website needs to clarify directions , The overall experience the hotel ambience was very good the staff could not have been more helpful breakfast was excellent plenty of coffee provided without having to ask Evening drinks at the bar were delightful

358500,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, We had a room which overlooked the inside quadrangle Whilst this meant that it was very quiet which was good I m not sure whether another room may have had a view of the city , The beds were extremely comfortable The room was also well appointed and equips The morning breakfast buffet was also extremely good with an excellent selection of food

358505,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, One desk clerk young male could be reminded of his job as ambassador for the city The rest of the staff were helpful and friendly , Shops and attractions were in walking distance Walked to the tube if needed to go elsewhere Lovely time in Vienna and the location of this hotel was fabulous 
358506,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, Crazy hot at night to the point of not being able to sleep without the window open Unfortunately an open window means a very noisy night in this neighborhood There was no heat coming forming the room s radiator so I am guessing based on the common area temperatures that is was coming from the corridors , The location couldn t have been in a better spot 
358507,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, There were 5 steps to get to the reception with no ramp so we had to carry the stroller just for these few steps before we could use the lift Not that important just a bit annoying for a family with a baby , Decent breakfast above average great location close to public transport and just a few stops for Vienna downtown

358520,K K Hotel Maria Theresia, The staff at the reception did not welcome us nor tried to provide any extra help information The breakfast buffet was very poor especially in sweets while you would expect a great variety in chocolate sweets due to Vienna s tradition One day we were treated in a very rude manner by one staff member at the breakfast It was 10 00 in the morning we had filled our plates and were about to sit to a table Suddenly a lady started shouting at me in German not to sit there I asked in English what was wrong and she said tha this table was set for lunch I chose another table and she started shouting again for the same reason Almost all tables were full so there werenot many choices I dont understand why the tables must be reserved for lunch so early and why the lady did not show us a free table instead of shouting, It was very close to the tube station and the room was very clean
