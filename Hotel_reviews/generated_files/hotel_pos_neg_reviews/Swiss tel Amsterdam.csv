308686,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Size of room, My wife and I recently paid another visit to Amsterdam staying at the Swissotel on the Damrak right next to Dam Square The hotel has recently had some renovations especially the restaurant which to me is modern Dutch and very nice We stayed in a select room which was also recently renovated and had a terrific bathroom with a rain shower which I loved and like the rest of the room was kept spotless The one downside was I found the room on the small side with hardly enough room for my wife and I to pass each other between the bed and the desk but we soon got into a routine Speaking about the bed which was very huge and comfortable but boy was it high I recon about 3 5 feet 105cm there was even a menu for your pillows also there was no need to close the curtains just press a button and it was done We were there for an anniversary break and the hotel gave us a curtesy bottle of bubbly which was very much appreciated I had to check in online for our return flights but for some reason I couldn t complete this but the concierge called Albert managed to do this for us saving time at the airport another great service from the very helpful staff at this hotel The hotel is in the perfect location for exploring the city there are bars restaurants shops red light area all within walking distance and believe me it s the way to see the city not forgetting the canal boat trips I would recommend this hotel and will stay there again

308691,Swiss tel Amsterdam, See above Booking com did not give us what I think I booked And cost was a high Euro conversion rate 530 to 601 for 2 nights Was unaware of local tax of 28 till it was presented on Bill So booking com got it very wrong for me and we were just lucky there was other rooms free and helpful staff I don t plan to use booking com again as I thought I was booking through Easyjet, The 1st bedroom booked in advance through Easyjet booking com was awful very small dark view of inner walls opposite no bath I was very upset having paid premium for larger space bath and belief that our room would be one of photos on web with light and extra space and black tan wood It wasn t I immediately called reception and expressed my disappointment as this stay was for my husbands birthday present and to watch one of womens Euro matches family member in one of teams Our friends and family were all staying at the Innhotel but I took time on web and tripadvisor and chose Swissotel The receptionist was brilliant and arranged a free upgrade to a far bigger room with a wall of Windows with fab views over Dam Square a bath and 2 comfy chairs The manager and receptionist fixing this was much appreciated 2nd room exceeded my expectation due light and view But it shouldn t have been awful in the 1st place The receptionist also offered a bottle of sparkling wine for my husband s birthday the next day it arrived promptly when requested All three receptionists and night manager were friendly and very helpful re advice on attractions restaurants and transport We did not eat breakfast in hotel but hear it was very good from other guests 
308692,Swiss tel Amsterdam, We checked in at noon and didn t spend any time in the room at day time Late at night we arrived to our room I wanted to turn on TV Suprise there were no TV remote control in the room In the morning I wanted to drink a botle of water opened the mnibar again an awful suprise because minibar was completely empty I thought I hired a room with TV without remote control and minibar empty one , Location is great Easy access to train station and atraction points 
308693,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Room was very small for the price paid So didn t feel value for money although location was amazing Room had no view , Excellent staff very helpful and warm Bicycles for rent bit pricy but good condition Nesspreso coffee in the room 
308694,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Gym was a little bit small , The location was excellent with shops bars and restaurants in walking distance Central Train Station was also within walking distance The renovated rooms were modern comfortable and spacious Staff were all very friendly and helpful 
308695,Swiss tel Amsterdam, That I didn t book my last night there after returning from Maastricht and the Andre Rieu concert What a mistake I made , Our room was exceptional the Spa Bath even had an Aqua TV so I could watch Wimbledon It was outstanding 
308696,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Some Front desk personnel attitude is absolutely rude and inexperienced Sad and bad Path room is exposed no privacy at all it is a display, Location only
308697,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Fantastic friendly Dutch service Swiss efficiency room upgrade super comfy bed even had an umbrella in the room supplied should you need one Faultless in every aspect and you cannot get more central 
308698,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Bed very soft which I don t like Room small and with only a small window in slanted roof Cleaning not up to scratch left cleaning towel in sink bottle top on floor when I checked in and not removed next day either , Near bars and restaurants and a 10 minute walk from the railway station 
308699,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Honestly there is nothing I could say I didn t like , I ve stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and found the Swissotel to be up there with the very best Absolutely every detail was addressed If there is such a thing as a perfect stay I experienced it at this hotel 
308700,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The re fill of staff amenities was not always timely , Perfect location helpful staff room amenities e g refrigerator tea kettle and comfortable and clean room 
308701,Swiss tel Amsterdam, For the money breakfast should have been included Room is small but attractive , Very supportive informative and friendly staff Wonderful shower beds pillows 
308702,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Did not have breakfast at the hotel but heard it was overpriced , Location was perfect Nice modern design in rooms Bed was very comfortable and room had dual head shower Wi Fi was excellent Did not have breakfast at the hotel but heard it was overpriced 
308703,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing really bad to say The staff doesn t smile much but for me that is not a problem they were efficient and that s what is important Our phone start ringing from 1130am on the check out date we answered and no one talk on the other end if the check out time is 12 they should only start to bother people at that time but overall was very positive, Great location great fomos very confortable
308704,Swiss tel Amsterdam, pillows but it was quickly resolved , The staff are excellent polite nice and friendly They were extremely helpful and professional The location of the hotel is just perfect All clean and nice 
308705,Swiss tel Amsterdam, While our room was away from the street it only had one small window looking out a roof area with ac units which made the room dark , Center of the city
308706,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The Hotel must be renewed And The hotel took 50 euro deposito per night 150 euro total for three nlght for empty minibar This was impolite , Location 
308707,Swiss tel Amsterdam, We d requested a twin bed room but the beds were pushed together I asked reception to help us separate the beds but they wouldn t so I had to do it which was hard as they were heavy and I had a sore shoulder There was no mirror over the vanity in the room so make up and hair had to be done in the bathroom which isn t ideal when you are sharing the bathroom There was a strong smell of drains in the bathroom which I didn t mention to reception as they had been unhelpful with the bed situation so I felt they wouldn t do anything about that either The lobby is small and you have no sense that you are in a 4 star hotel I don t think there is a bar there is just an adjoining cafe I didn t see any communal areas If it wasn t for the location I wouldn t choose to stay at this hotel , The location is absolutely terrific We were told that we d been upgraded from a premium to a renovated room however it was an average room The mattress was very comfortable and we did sleep well Our room was also quiet which is something I had requested The shower was terrific Housekeeping was very good We were allowed an extra hour to check out and reception helped print out our return boarding passes 
308708,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Litter in front of hotel , Location Center of town King size bed We were heading in a bike and barge trip with small bedroom and twins and we wanted a large before we took off 
308709,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The room was suffocating with no proper windows The toilet has a musky smell which makes it worse for me since I was not well during the stay Further the thing about the toilet door is such that it is always closed by default even when not in use In this way hard to ventilate and get rid of the musky smell since the door MUST remain closed The main hotel room door and toilet door should have fixed a stopper for ease of movements , The location of Swisotel Amsterdam is great Accessible to the main shopping streets and the main square where you can enjoy some sun during this period of time or performances going on The staff at the hotel are very quick to respond to calls and situations
308710,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The hotel is too expensive for conditions they offer It is located in Amsterdam city center which is extremely dirty busy and unpleasant, the hotel is a clean island in very dirty surrounding
308711,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Though three members of the staff were exceptional the rest of them were rude They would shout or gesture impatiently , The property is ideally located in the centre of Amsterdam close to all of the main city locations and a short walk from Centraal Station 
308712,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The staff is not so helpful They are kind but they just provide your basic things Whenever you ask something extra they easily say No For instance the pillows are very soft in the rooms and when you ask a harder one they say they can not provide as they don t have in stock In the second day I had to warn them to rate their service as negative in booking com and they have brought immediately Another instance is that they have not provided an armless chair to my room as the present one was too tight for me I believe they don t want to provide these kind of things I don t think I can stay there again , The room is small but enough for one person Location is perfect It is at the centre of Dam Square 
308713,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Service at the breakfast that was not included in our reservation was very poor We felt that breakfast should have been included in the price We were not aware that people who registered at the hotel were offered the free breakfast and Booking com did not mention it ,No Positive
308714,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I don t remember any that I don t like , This hotel is with in the center of everything No problem to shop restaurant and its with in reach from central station by foot The comfort and the security as if you re in your own home I will surely recommend this hotel to my friends 
308715,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Expensive compared to hotels in major European cities where we have stayed No pictures on the walls in the bedroom , comfortable bed Very friendly and knowledgeable staff especially Mirta Excellent location we walked everywhere 
308716,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Only the night desk clerk saying Good morning when I return at 1 am Made me feel guilty for staying out late LOL But seriously there was nothing to dislike about this hotel , The room was comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was excellent and good value they have increased the size of the breakfast area since my last visit a few years ago and it is no longer cramped It is a little pricey at weekends but so are all the other Amsterdam hotels and the location of this one is excellent The rooms tend not to have good views but that makes them quiet which I prefer as this is a noisy are at night The gym was excellent and underutilised as was the business centre What more could I ask for 
308717,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The room and the bathroom were so small that it was very difficult for my husband and I to navigate at the same time The bathroom was only big enough for one person We did not pick the lowest price room specifically for that reason Honestly the room would have been much better for a single person Also there was no view at all In fact the window was so high up that even if there had been a view we would not have been able to see anything , Location was great right off the Dam We were centrally located for everything The Restaurant Royal 98 that was attached to the hotel was also very good Bistro style 
308718,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The room to small for the money and some of the staff not helping not welcoming if you ask any question or ask them for anything there reply your reservation with Booking we cannot help you you should talk with them if I stayed in other hotel maybe we had better experience , The location which is why some of the staff do not care about the Guest 
308719,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Noisy Right next to Dam Square facing tram rails and big noises from the temporary amusement park on the square Hotel staff was not particularly friendly Very expensive for this size of the room and the class of this hotel , Mixed feeling on the location it is conveniently located just next to Dam Square but the place was extremely noisy because of the Easter holiday tourists Nice comfortable bed and a room with a good size 
308720,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Morning newspaper not provided until we requested , Very convenient location and central to all amenities Bed was comfortable though room itself was small when compared to Asia an Australia
308721,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Very weak management lmagine a good hotel in the heart of Amsterdam with NO SOAP for three days waiting for delivery I can imagine hundreds of costumers can t wash their faces and hands , Comfortable and new furnished hotel
308722,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel was in an excellent location and was literally close to everything The rooms were very comfortable with lots of extras and the added bonus of a nespresso machine I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam 
308723,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I didn t like that the cleaning people started vacuuming the hallways around 8 in the morning , The bed was comfortable The room was perfect for my boyfriend and I 
308724,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Noisy fairground in Dam square until midnight No plug socket near a mirror so nowhere to use hairdryer to style hair No hotel only lounge space to relax with a drink at the end of the evening as the bar and restaurant were public so were busy , Everything was comfortable Great room Staff were really helpful and friendly Location was great 
308725,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Wouldn t recommend for more than a couple of nights as the rooms were very small , Close to Centraal Station and practically on de Dam WiFi was a breeze to connect to Staff super friendly Nice variety of TV channels in multiple languages Great for single or business travelers 
308726,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Definitely back to this hotel Staff very friendly and welcome Very good facilities Very clean hotel Perfect location easy access to public transport walk distance to turist attractions excellent wi fi signal 
308727,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Location was great All the staff we meet were very helpful especially the young man that checked us in The rooms had every thing we needed and a very comfortable bed would definitely use this hotel again
308728,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Wifi access a bit slow, The best location ever You can walk to Amsterdam Centraal near Madame Tussaud and the Palace of Amsterdam Room quite small but nice Would love to comeback to this hotel
308729,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The hairdryer didn t work in the bathroom because of the voltage and you had to use it at the desk where there was no mirror There was no outlet near the bed so I couldn t charge my phone overnight and check it when I got a text or a call , When I checked in at the front desk the staff could not have been friendlier or more accomodating I had reserved a basic single room but the front desk clerk upgraded me to a plush king sized room with turndown service Lindt truffles and heated towels It was lovely The bed was incredible I wish I could ve flown it back home with me I can t say more about this lovely hotel and their wonderful staff They made me feel as if I was their most important guest 
308730,Swiss tel Amsterdam, No place for parking had to park in De Bijenkorf and traffic was pretty bad especially during weekends, It s literally in the center of Dam Square across of De Bijenkorf The bus is just few meters walk Magna Plaza Central station all walking distance
308731,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing to dislike, Me and my wife stayed here for 2 nights for our 10th anniversary and the room and location were just perfect the restaurante is also 5 star with amazing food but the best part about the swissotel is how accommodating and helpful the staff were they gave us complimentary champagne and chocolates and not to mention the real pink heart shaped rose petals they surprised my wife with on the bed an absolute perfect anniversary thank you swissotel
308732,Swiss tel Amsterdam, For the price we could have done much better The room was noisy as ours was the last room next to the staff s room they bang around and the walls are quite thin so you hear everything They slam the doors every 10 minutes so they are busy but its annoying when you are on a NA time zone We only went for breakfast once in the hotel it was over priced and all the hot items were cold as there was no heat turned on under them maybe an over site by the staff but we did not come back There are lots of other places to get breakfast so we went out the rest of our stay , We stayed in a premium suite so the room was large and was very nice The location is very central Lots of restaurants cafes near by and close to the Central Station easy walking distance The staff are very friendly and helpful The room was nice and clean which for me is a big thing 
308733,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Clean room excellent service staff location was great Since the first time i came to this hotel the service was excellent One of duty manager Albert Hammerseth was very nice and helpfull He gave us all recommendations about amsterdam And all staffs were very nice 
308734,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Tried to make a cappacino in the room but there was no steamed milk , Great view impressive ceiling Free upgrade to a junior suite Huge comfortable bed 
308735,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Unfortunately we asked for 2 very early wake up calls 10 minutes apart on the morning of our departure which never happened the lady at the reception didn t write it down properly On checking out the guys at the front desk forgot to booked our taxi to the airport Little advise double check to make sure its all written down , We ve stayed there previously so we knew the hotel was in a perfect location nice and quiet great access to station Tram shops restaurants and attractions We were upgraded to a suite which was very spacious and enjoyed the view over looking the square Would stay there again if we come back to Amsterdam 
308736,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I mistakenly left some of my wife s clothes hung up in the wardrobe when we left On return my wife rang the hotel to ask if they had been handed in so that she could pay the postage for them to be forwarded on She was told no that was it just no My wife was a bit taken back by this and asked if they were sure as they had definitely been left there With that she had the phone put down on her A part from being dam right rude this would imply that either they had been taken from the room by staff or that the room had not been cleaned before the guests staying after us occupied it Either way a more sympathetic response from customer services would have been nice,No Positive
308737,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I love everything regards this hotel I would love to find a negative to improve this hotel but during our stay found nothing that would be of constructive feedback , Just love this Hotel in every way Great location room and hospitality Thank you and well done to all the management and staff 
308738,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the room the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and all that for a comparably lower price especially considering the location I ve stayed in Swissotel in Zurich earlier this year where I d give the opposite rating for most of the questions above I only needed a temporary place to stay as I live in Amsterdam For this reason I wanted something close to the office I work at willing to sacrifice the quality for location Surprisingly I got one of the best quality rooms I ve stayed in while it was still dirt cheap Check my rating history here I don t usually provide feedback only if it was very bad or exceptionally good 
308739,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Service was great was upgraded at the hotel Room was very clean staff were extremely helpful particularly in booking tourist attractions to avoid queues 
308740,Swiss tel Amsterdam, My bed was uneven probably due to heavy usage and I kept sliding down the side The pillow was oops flat for our comfort Other than that every thing was excellent , The location was excellent Just 10 minutes from Central Station and very near to the main square 
308741,Swiss tel Amsterdam, my dislike is very much prices are to high which is not good, staff are very help full but prices are to much no swimming pool when i book this room breakefast is include and when i reach in hotel she told me is not include other all things are ok not that much good
308742,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Some little problems with key card system Other than that our stay was perfect , Very nice hotel the staff is excellent and very helpful such nice people The room was great and the location of the hotel is even better Looking forward to my next at the Swissotel
308743,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The bed was a bit uncomfortable and the pillows had no neck support whatsoever I called the reception to request extra pillows but they said they were out I had to make do with folding the pillows several times to sleep comfortably, The location of the hotel was AMAZING Litterally a few steps from Dam square and surrounded by restaurants caf s museums and many attractions Madam Tussaud s and the Amsterdam Dungeon is exactly 3 minutes away The staff were very helpful friendly and went way and beyond to make us feel welcome 
308744,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Beds in our room where terrible the pillows felt about 20 years old Our friends where in a different room and their bed was far better than ours, Hotel was very clean and friendly staff
308745,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Beware of city tax when you leave , The location of this hotel was excellent Right on top of Dam Square and close to all attractions The bed was extra comfy unlike a lot of hard lumpy mattress you sometimes get in hotels Staff were helpful and friendly 
308746,Swiss tel Amsterdam, 100 euro deposit on arrival not mentioned at booking Not the friendliest of welcomes broken coffe machine and burnt kettle in the room Asked to be replaced but wasn t Decor in rooms dated and garish, location
308747,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Wasnt impressed with breakfast had to wait a long time for scrambled eggs and bacon because trays were empty had a great time, Nothing was any trouble to staff and Frances was very helpfuland duty manager offering a better room for wifes birthday
308748,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Thin walls and noisy neighbours On our first night we were awoken by a group of women shouting outside our door presumaby because we were next to the vending machine this noise continued for 15 minutes before they all worked out how to use said vending machine , The location is amazing Second to none in the city of Amsterdam Even if the property was awful which it is far from it we would 100 be staying there again because the location is so perfect Walking distance from everything We didn t get the tram once during our entire trip 
308749,Swiss tel Amsterdam, when i first arrived there was only 2 single beds that they can push together i hate that so i had to upgrade meaning i had to pay extra money however they did compliment us with a bottle of champagne to say sorry the lady at the reception was really helpful and the facilities were great literally dont have a bad word to say, the service was unreal 
308750,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The restaurants at the hotel are average and expensive and the room needed a solid clean it was clean enough but for the price you would expect to not have dust on the some of the benches and lights, Location is excellent and the front desk staff are extremely helpful and friendly
308751,Swiss tel Amsterdam, It looked bigger and more spacious on the website than what it actually was inside which was quite disappointing, Facility s was lovely Bed was extremely comftable very satisfied Was in such a good location too 
308752,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Bed was huge and really comfy lovely clean facilities Located directly in the centre of everything 5 10min walk away from main things to do Staff were so friendly and very helpful I would recommend to anyone and would definatly stay here again 
308753,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was huge and extremely comfortable Also the location was perfect as it was Literally on Dam square and is one of the cheapest hotels of that area The staff were also great as we was greeted each time we entered the hotel lobby Lovely place will return in the future and have already recommended 
308754,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The rooms are very old they have not renewed The rooms were very small and the furnitures were very old Our room was very dusty the cleaning was not done very well The rooms looked like a hostel No room service Breakfast had very few choices This style is not good for a swiss hotel Price too expensive for a service, Just location is nice
308755,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Good as the location is it s like living OnTimes Square very busy very touristy There were 4 cleanliness issues that I requested to be cleaned I had to ask the desk twice and when they did it they only dealt with one of the four I also never like it when hotels have don t mention that they have breakfast choices off a menu for a lot less money than the buffet breakfasts but a lot of hotels do that , Staff was friendly the location is very central east to get to everything by taxi and if you are a good walker you can probably reach walking to everything within a half an hour using you phone GPS If you have not booked the room including breakfast at reception they will offer you buffet breakfast for 17 Euros in a semi attached restaurant but you can go there order of the menu for a lot less and better
308756,Swiss tel Amsterdam, When I booked this hotel I took for granted that breakfast was included in the price as most hotels I have previously booked in Europe included breakfast in the overall price and you would only pay extra for lunch or evening meals etc Overall hotel is fantastic Thank You ,No Positive
308757,Swiss tel Amsterdam, No room service no house keeping very dirty very unfriendly in past years it was nice but now it became like a hostel Fire alarm at 6am and nobody says sorry about that And 10 years old pillows in the hotel It was really bad , Nothing
308758,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I wouldn t really say there was anything I didn t like, The staff couldn t have been more helpful and the room was gorgeous if I was to stay there again I d want the same room Location was spot on too 
308759,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The room s layout is very strange the bed is huge and twice as tall as usual but it occupies so much of the room that there s no room to fully open your suitcase , The location is excellent the warm towels they hand you when you re checking in are a treat 
308760,Swiss tel Amsterdam, It seemed from the add at bookin com that breakfast was included suggesting it as a special offer it was on our checking out that we understood it was not the case NEVER were we told about the price for breakfast we didnt ask as we thought it is included and never was it mentioned that it is not included and whilst checking out we understood this was the case the staff at reception said they have mentioned it before which was not the case and the whole discussion was not in the lovely spirit of the hotel at all otherwise the hotel was lovely and it was a pity ,No Positive
308761,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing, The room was spacious and clean the bed was very comfy and the nesspresso machine was very much appreciated above all the location of the hotel is outstanding 
308762,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Breakfast wasn t the best selection we had to ask for hot food to be made up, Free room upgrade on arrival Perfect location the comfiest bed we have ever slept in 
308763,Swiss tel Amsterdam, everything for my needs was catered for there was nothing I did not like, location about 80 yards from the Dam Square towards the station the standard of the rooms the friendliness of the staff the overall experience the great coffee in the rooms and the quietness of the location yet also being very central A special thanks to Albert Hammerseth and all the staff 
308764,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Everything was perfect, We received a very warm welcome by staff were upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the square every facility good comfortable bed and pillows excellent restaurant recommendations and service on check out would highly recommend and would definitely stay again
308765,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing Location was great comfortable room attentive staff reasonable room rates perfect hotel highly recommend a stay here, The view of Dam square from the room window was terrific and staff were very helpful
308766,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful at all times The location is as good as you can get right next to dam square you couldn t ask for more You must eat at the royal 98 restaurant next door their food is incredible 
308767,Swiss tel Amsterdam, check in took quite longer time as single lady was at the front desk while a lot of guest wait for check in value of money is high especially in out of season Novemebr , Well I stayed for very short time eight hours as was having a flight at early morning next day Overall the hotel is very nice friendly and helpful staff great location most of services were available nearby sightseeing couldn t try breakfast 
308768,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is really well located and it s our second time here The staff are really helpful and their beds and pillows is probably the best I ve ever had in any hotels you hardly want to jump out of bed Special recognition also goes to Aprilla at the front desk she was indeed very wonderful cheerful and really helpful with everything Would definitely visit again over and over again 
308769,Swiss tel Amsterdam, We were upgraded to a business suite that was very outdated If our stay was any longer than using the place as a bed it would not have been acceptable Very misleading compared to the photos , Location is excellent Staff are friendly
308770,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Housekeeping staff need to be consistent in ensuring supplies and towels are in order , Excellent location Reception staff was very good and friendly and helpful Facilities are great 
308771,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Staff upon arrival our arrival at 9 pm were not so welcoming Insisted upon taking both my child s and my passport out of my view to photocopy Even though the room was paid in full with my CC through the secure booking com website they insisted on my producing a CC to authorize 50 for incidentals and to prove the card was there Staff could not explain what incidentals or what or whom the proof was for exasperating and unnecessary when you just want to drop your bags and relax When we get to the room there is a menu card for many different types of pillows to request from the front desk free of charge When we call we are informed that all the pillows were taken for the night Why not remove the card when you are advertising something that is not available Then we realized that we left a bag in the lobby that contained an IPad In a panic we rush down and they had it behind the desk Very strange that staff would not bring the bag up immediately or at least phone us to have us come down Very poor customer service overall , Location was great Bath tub was clean and long Bed was comfortable 
308772,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Can t think of a thing Wait I had trouble with a computer in the business center but I have trouble with computers especially Apple computers everywhere so the trouble was with me , The bed was very comfortable the coffee maker made excellent coffee and the water in the shower was nice and hot But best of all were the people at the front desk and in housekeeping Everyone was friendly helpful and knowledgeable and everyone had a good sense of humor I like that And I heard stories especially from Myrthe about Christmas in Holland as a child That made my visit 
308773,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Gym is minimal but you can still improvise with the equipment , Everything was perfect Staff welcome nice spacious room bed was so comfortable complimentary coffee facilities shower was divine room 241 lovely I have had a lot of holidays in hotels and apartments but i can honestly say this is the best and most memorable hotel experience that i have ever had I will gladly return to the Swissotel 
308774,Swiss tel Amsterdam, We booked a room with a kingsize bed But got one with two single beds The person at the reception said that there were no more rooms available It was late and we had no choice than to accept the room wich was so under Swissotel standards The next morning we complained to the manager in charge and she helped us to change the room The newer one was much more modern with a kingsize bed as we wished to have one It s sad to know that if we had not complained about the situation no one would help us out , Location
308775,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Charges such as city tax and room deposit should be communicated better to the customer as they had not been mentioned until check in , The king size bed was luxurious and the pillows were super soft 
308776,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The card reader in the room was damaged lights automatically went off every 5 minutes we had to pull out and reinsert the card every 5 minutes when we were in the room We had asked for a king size bed instead got 2 seperate beds brought together We were in a hurry so we did not have the time to ask the reception for a change, Very good location easy access from the Central Station just a 5 10 minute walk 
308777,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Price seemed to be quite a bit more than when I booked Will be wary of small print on booking com site next time would have been cheaper to book hotel direct, Nice big bed very good location

308779,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were excellent and welcoming Beautiful room We had a disability room and it was excellent Two different shower bench facilities Quiet room good size The location is right at the heart of Dam Square but once inside peaceful Small entry meant we had very few steps from front door to elevator and disabled room was close to elevator so great access Lemon water and apples available all day and water bottles on request We also were provided welcome wine and munchies The new restaurant is modern not as elegant but a nice varied menu and excellent pizza 
308780,Swiss tel Amsterdam, absolutely nothing, They extend the check out until 13 00 instead of 11 00 the location was perfect i didn t need to go anywhere far for any reason I honestly think that my staying was perfect I didn t see any problem of any kind

308782,Swiss tel Amsterdam, pillows are to soft and sink away to nothing but still very comfortable, the hotel staff max was exceptional in his services even sorted a bottle of free bubbles for our wedding anniversary and upgraded our room even called me from Amsterdam to ask what type of flowers my wife liked
308783,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Location is excellent being in Dam Square but the downside of this is that outside noise can be heard in the lower rooms at night so perhaps it is best to request a higher floor , Staff were very helpful and efficient especially the Concierge Rob He could not have done more for us There is a tram stop right outside the hotel making travelling around very easy 
308784,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I had a junior suite on the 6 th floor over 300 euro night very noisy the Windows were not properly sealed and there was a fan in the room that was continuously on even with the air switched off The request I placed in booking was not even looked at please high floor but not top floor with sloped roof and at check in they gave me a room on first floor upon my request to change I was given a room on top floor with pillars that were greeting a sloped roof , Very central walking distance from rail station 20 meters from dam square

308786,Swiss tel Amsterdam, There was a recently hired room attendant who searched through our stuff most likely looking for money or small valuable items We immediately reported the incident to the hotel manager and were pleased to see that the management started a highly professional internal investigation ASAP They checked who entered our room and the video recordings in the hotel They let us know that the person who searched through our personal staff was a recently employed room attendant who failed to show up at work the next day Apparently this person was not hired directly by Swissotel but he was working for a company providing room attendants to hotels in Amsterdam This was the only discomfort however I must say it was enough for us to decide not to stay at Swissotel again in the future The hotel only presented apologies for the incident and did not try to compensate in any other way , Great location right in the center of Amsterdam near all the attractions Very friendly staff helpful polite willing to resolve problems Very high quality free WiFi with great speeds and stability 
308787,Swiss tel Amsterdam, There wase a very disturbing noise in the rooms They told us that they are aware of it it is coming from the central air condition system s compressors and can t be shut down Changed three rooms Only the final room was a recently renovated room and quiet Hotel in general needs serious renovation , Location and staff That s all Nothing else

308801,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Location, We booked three rooms when we arrived we only found 2 We had to find a third room in another hotel We asked for a refund for the two rooms and they refused so we had to stay The bed was really really bad our legs are up and the heads are down We asked them to fix it and they did last night 5th night and we felt like we are sleeping on a bord not on a bed so we have not slept that night No good TV channels 
308802,Swiss tel Amsterdam, In the photos on the web for the type of room we chose it showed a view of the square but in fact most rooms including ours just had a back view of nothing much except the back of more rooms So check in advance if you really want a view of the square , Excellent location right in the center Nice staff The breakfast bit was closed for refurbishment so cant comment on that The room was nice and clean 
308803,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Not informed the restaurant in hotel being refurbished so lacking motel services Staff not friendly never smiles or acknowledge you Could not help with anything Just a too bad attitude expensive for service they supplied , Bed was comfortable modern and clean
308804,Swiss tel Amsterdam, No bar or restaurant due to refurbishment which was not known at time of booking but to be fair this was not a issue , The location and the most helpful Staff the room was very comfortable with great facilities plus the housekeeping was top class

308820,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Unfortunately some noise from hotel renovations Unable to hotel bar restaurant due to renovations, Location excellent staff very helpful rooms very comfortable spacious and clean
308821,Swiss tel Amsterdam, This time the bed was a bit uncomfortable , I always prefer to stay at this hotel in Amsterdam Few minutes walk from Central Train Station and a Tram Stop just infront of it makes it the best choice It is expensive yet worth booking 
308822,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Restaurant is in renovation You have to go out to a very closed hotel to have breakfast Breakfast is a little poor they should offer more variety , Very nice hotel In the city center Very comfortable and beautiful rooms Nice and helpful staff Made things easy Very good tram connection 
308823,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The noise from hotel construction woke us up early 3 days in a row The gym facility was not large enough for more than one or two people at a time The location was very central but also very raucous We requested the firmest pillows available and they still were not firm enough to prevent neck pain , I loved being welcomed with a tin of stroopwafels The staff was always friendly and helpful We were happy with the cleanliness and security of the hotel 
308824,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Construction work in progress Could not sleep in the afternoon due to noise Noise started again at 7 00 am Unacceptable We need a full refund please, Location

308834,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I paid for upgrade to balcony room only once there they said we can not use it When we saw what they considered a balcony it was laughable Can not call it a balcony , Room size
308835,Swiss tel Amsterdam, maybe i say maybe a bit more careful for the bathroom cleanness just from my personal view, The bed was excellent The room was very comfortable and very well equiped I have no words to say for the girls on the reception They where all very pleasant friendly professionals and warm I could keep saying more about their perfect behavior 
308836,Swiss tel Amsterdam, It was my 60th birthday My son booked a surprise treat for me Maybe a bottle sparking wine as a welcome gesture and a greetings wishing me a happy birthday , Can t answer that as too early to get up for breakfast restaurant next door 
308837,Swiss tel Amsterdam, noisy street behind the hotel specially after midnight and close to morning During my stay always some drunk guys were making loud noise , location room conditions
308838,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing everything were perfect , The junior suite was amazing And the hotel locations is magnificent Staff are so professional and helpful all of them are highly talented young
308839,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Didn t like that breakfast wasn t included in charge of room and had to be paid for separately 12 50 also is a bit expensive for the breakfast that was provided It was in the neighbouring hotel granted as swiss tel kitchen was being refurbished but I feel it was a bit of a let down only thing I can fault in the whole hotel , Location was absolutely fantastic can t be beaten Staff were very friendly and helpful and ensured we were as comfortable as possible Lovely stay 
308840,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Just restaurant in the hotel, Hotel rooms and staff all excellent no breakfast facilities due to refurb but temp facilities at next door were fine Great location lovely feel 
308841,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The hotel facilities are not good hotel practically does not have a hall and breakfast area you had to go outside of the hotel in order to get a breakfast , Staff was very welcoming They reacted very friendly to the problem we had at time of check in mistake in reservation dates Room was quite convenient Nice view on Damsquare from the window Weather forecast and welcome chocolate was provided on a daily basis Thank You to the wonderful staff 
308842,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Very noisy were up literally ALL night with the noise from the all night revelry, Location was great step out of your hotel and you are in Dam Square 
308843,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Expensive price too noisy because the hotel is just on the side of the Main Street and the center of Amsterdam The driver hotel called to send me the airport he kept checking his iPhone the entire journey to the airport which is very very dangerous , The location is perfect close to the Dam square and 10 15 mins walk to the central station I was upgrade to the suite Taxi service is nice spent 45 euros to schiphol airport 
308844,Swiss tel Amsterdam, the whole staff was not hospitable they made us pay 200 euros for smoking by the window while opened and they told us that if i smoke again they will want us to leave the hotel and call the police worst hotel I ve ever seen in my life I m telling everybody not to go to this hotel at that location there are a lot of good hotels don t choose this one , only the location
308845,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The shower pressure was really disappointing reminded me of a three star hotel The hotel is rather old than new from many perspectives , Perfect location for almost anybody who needs to stay in Amsterdam Very good free wifi speed 
308846,Swiss tel Amsterdam, When our friends called for extra water to the minibar the receptionist advised to drink tap water because it was late at night , Location location location 
308847,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The facilities are in need of a total makeover We stayed on the 6th floor in which you could hear that the air handler needed a tune up The room was very dated though immaculate in its cleanliness The room had too much furniture in it for a room of its size Also the bathroom had a large soaker tub in a room that would have been much more comfortable with a shower The restaurant was closed for remodeling which is a good sign The decision to lease the street front portion of the building out which I m sure is a nice money maker left the poor hotel with a tiny lobby completely out of touch with what people are looking for in a modern business hotel I hope they reconsider that and remodel the lobby in the future as you couldn t ask for a better location , Bed was perfect especially the pillows and Swissotel has a fantastic pillow menu to request even more pillows The nightly turndown service left chocolates bottles of mineral water and the next day s weather forecast The front desk staff was very attentive and friendly The location is great 
308848,Swiss tel Amsterdam, No breakfast at the hotel you d have to go to a place next door Bathroom has a door but it s glass not suitable for people that are with someone and love their privacy , They ve upgraded us to a Junior Suite as we arrived the following morning due to delay Very nice of them 
308849,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The bed although big was bumpy and had two large pits where clearly some larger people had laid Also the window noise insolation was very bad we were on the 1 floor facing the square and could hear everything , Great location and easy check in and check out
308850,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Shower can be renewed TV channels are not enough Disposable toothbrush and toothpaste could be placed near bathroom sink GYM can be developped These are the things that i remember , Location is good Choclate left by cleaner is good It is extra energy for Amsterdam visitors 
308851,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Replace your mattresses worst sleep ever Also your staff needs to be mindful of what they say some of us are bi lingual and saying A in Dutch and B in English is just silly it wasn t a big issue just something that needed to be repaired and wasn t really so I let it go but somewhat deceptive nonetheless , The location is great if you want to be in the middle of everything the rooms were quiet and clean 
308852,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing, A very comfortable clean hotel and the staff were excellent They even gave us a water bottle chocolate and the next days weather every evening The location was also great We would definately stay there again 
308853,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Room was an ok size price was quite high , Nice staff and hotel We could rent bikes directly from the hotel which saves time even if it s a little more expensive 
308854,Swiss tel Amsterdam, having to pay the evening before and then pay city tax the day after why could I not have paid both when I left Also external noise in my room , All very good see my review on TripAdvisor 
308855,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I stayed for 4 nights and they did not change my beddings once I also had had some minor problems otherwise with the cleaning staff the staff at the reception sorted it out for me , Excellent location in the heart of Amsterdam Wi fi is brilliant Fast easy The staff in the reception is very service minded I will consider staying at this hotel next time I m in Amsterdam

308858,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, I was lucky to find a room here after being stranded late at Amsterdam airport for the night I was kindly given an upgrade to a marvellous room which I unfortunately could only enjoy for five hours before a very early rescheduled flight the next morning This small short luxury was a much needed relief from an otherwise terrible day of travel chaos Should I return to Amsterdam in the near future for more pleasant reasons I will definitely keep your hotel in mind Thank you Sincerely David Jenkins Associate Professor of Law University of Copenhagen
308859,Swiss tel Amsterdam, i didnt like the fact that someone knocked on our door and asked if we where smoking in the room We dont even smoke , I liked the location it was very central The reception staff are very friendly check in was fast We where with another couple and their room wasnt ready at the time so we where given a free boat trip for four free bottles of water left next to our bed and on departure nice hotel 
308860,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Minor issues is that breakfast area is not inside the hotel but in a place next to it and the card system need to pass it 2 3 times in order to open the door , Best value for money Everything clean and tidy The staff was very helpful 
308861,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The showers could have done with more pressure The tea coffee should be restocked with alot more milk packs etc each day We didnt end up staying on our first night which was booked due to delays in getting there because of Eurotunnel they could have been a little more supportive with trying to get us a refund for our first night as we informed them of not coming that night , The room was very comfortable slightly on the small side but still very comfortable and clean Staff was brilliant Offered us complimentary fruit platter for our anniversary and were very lovely the way they approached us to offer this The extra pillows you can order is a very nice touch just make sure you order way in advance to get what your after We didnt end up having the breakfast but prices seemed reasonable The hotel had a lovely smell to the hallways and lifts 
308862,Swiss tel Amsterdam, No restaurant so if wanted breakfast had to go next door Therefore decided to go off site to cafe instead , Convenience near to Central station and attractions Staff helpful Little touches like turning down beds water chocolate on pillow robes and slippers 
308863,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The staff at the front desk should offer vouchers for events without having to be asked The coffee machine in the room was very complicated and the instructions for use were inadequate Otherwise no complaints, Excellent location Very friendly and helpful staff Clean well appointed room with all needed amenities The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and well laid out 
308864,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Breakfast pooooooooooorrrrrrrrrr, Very nice hotel but bad and poor breakfast staff are more than perfect very helpful every was good expect the breakfast
308865,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Breakfast was in the restaurant next door sounds inconvenient but 4 steps and you re in So not really a negative I rarely eat big breakfasts so popped two further doors down and bought a waffle and coffee , Super clean super friendly staff and great design Liked the little touches here and there Chocolates and bed turned down at night with slippers etc Fresh lime and lemon water in reception whilst you are there The bed is SOOOO comfortable and soft like sleeping on a cloud plus you can get different pillow types according to your preferences The night before I stayed in the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky 5 stars and was very poor my room was still dirty when I arrived and checked in the Swissotel whilst ranked 4 star is light years ahead in service and customer care My thanks to Myrtha Manager who upgraded me to a suite when I told her my previous nights experience at the Krasnapolsky 
308866,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I was completely shocked to learn that breakfast was not included Also for such a high rate you would expect a good breakfast it was very average , I loved the staff at reception they were really polite and friendly 
308867,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Everything was great in this wonderful hotel , I keep coming back to this hotel because of the great services and hospitality Specially Ms Tina Geurts the front office receptionist for her outstanding efficiency and wonderful attentive services 
308868,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, Walkable from Central Train station and to major sights The room was so quiet which you wouldn t expect especially that that it is right off the main square with carnival rides 
308869,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Value for money in my opinion is little expensive but still an excellent choice specifically for its location , The location of this hotel is excellent Facilities are excellent too some staff are friendly and especially Lindsey She is very professional 
308870,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Although room was spacious and bed comfy it was in need of slight update as furniture was looking tired and slightly shabby Still a good sized quiet room , All reception and hotel staff were really helpful and welcoming especially Karina the duty Manager who went out of her way in making our stay that extra special 
308871,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The room window is facing the floor to ceiling window of the department store it s kind of awkward when their customer kept looking at us while shopping we had to keep the drape closed at all times Check in was not that smooth we booked four rooms but only three were available after official check in time My mother in law got her room quite late in the evening , Bed is so comfortable expresso machine in the room fruits and bottled water in reception area is a plus Staffs are helpful he even helped us lifting our luggages to our hired minivan Thank you Location is excellent Lots of attractions and restaurants within steps 
308872,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Hotel staff told us that breakfast was 12 50 per person without informing us that tourist tax was not included in the price Overall breakfast served was of poor quality , The bed was large and comfy Clean and spacious room Location was central Staff was friendly 
308873,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Terrible value for money definately not a 4 hotel Rooms weren t cleaned properly staff generally inattentive and room was absolutely tiny even thought it cost us 1200 for 3 nights No hotel bar or facilities either , Great location
308874,Swiss tel Amsterdam,No Negative, good situation in center next to royal palace station and next to everything smiling staff i come several time in amsterdam every year but this time i came for king s day and I had the budget to rent a room in a beautiful hotel such as the swissotel The room is so confortable the bed a pure pleasure there is a lot of cheapest hotel round the center but you can t compare the confort and service with swissotel

308876,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Restaurant was under renovation no restaurant or coffee facilities at all which was not stated at time of booking however they did provide the hotel facilities next door for breakfast it just would have been nice to know this on booking , Very helpful and polite friendly staff lovely rooms
308877,Swiss tel Amsterdam, It was overpriced during my time might be because it was a weekend with events during my days , Location is the best Very clean and friendly staff Good facility 
308878,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Pillows are too flat The value for money seems a bit high for the facilities provided though the location is excellent , the location is next to Dam square

308880,Swiss tel Amsterdam, States non smoking but guests were smoking and you could smell it The room size was poor and the bed size requested was wrong I asked for a twin room with two single beds and ended up with a double bed and a single at the bottom of the bed which I kept bumping into as it was in the way Bath was dirty so as stayed for one night did not use it Grouting around bath was very poor standard and I stayed at the hotel Amsterdam next door but one two weeks previous and that was cheaper and was a much better hotel , Corridors and bedsheets
308881,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Restaurant being refurbished but restaurants nearby open for breakfast etc so was not a problem Some of the bedding was rather threadbare which was a surprise given the quality of the rest of the furnishings , We had booked this hotel quite a long time ago so had a good rate We were then given a complimentary upgrade to a Junior suite which was spacious and very comfortable so very good value for the price with side view of Dam Square Staff extremely helpful and courteous Very central location lots to see within walking distance Trams stop outside and Central Station a 10 minute walk away We would definitely stay here again

308886,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Well I had a reservation half an hour before I checked with booking Com for 488 bed only after checking in there was a walk in guest and asked for a room and they told him 169 INCLUDING breakfast So I asked if I can get this rate so they told me no because my reservation was non refundable and they even didn t try to upgrade me or even gave me breakfast So booking Com tricked me and the hotel even didn t try to make me satisfied ,No Positive
308887,Swiss tel Amsterdam, There is no restaurant bar in the hotel at the moment and the rooms are small We ve stayed in Swissotels before including the one in London For the price about 360 U S it isn t a great value at the moment Coming in on a Friday night the Dam Rak was very busy and a little intimidating at night , The beds and staff are great We got great restaurant recommendations from staff and when we were leaving early morning they made a couple of cups of coffee for us It was very kind

308955,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I thought the price didn t measure up to the age of the facilities Small room with aircon that didn t work and poor lighting for 537 32 Aus for one night I expected something more for the money , Location made it easy to do everything on foot 
308956,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I found the room too small if you are travelling with more than one luggage or with a huge luggage the standard rooms might not be that comfortable to fit in , Of course I loved the location I2m sorry that we havent rented the bikes the day we arrived but from Swiss tel everywhere is easy to go to 
308957,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I first got first floor room facing the street If you wake up early at 630AM it is fine however noises will disturb if you want to sleep until 8 or so Ruben the manager on duty was kind enough to get me another room next day, Location is good Staff helpful Coffee machine nespresso in the room

308960,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The bed was too soft It was hard to regulate the temperature to cool the room down And it was too noisy outside to keep the windows open However when the windows were closed it was quiet in the room , The location of this hotel was perfect Very close to Dam square Staff was very courteous and helpful 
308961,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Advised to park at the Hilton good call but it was extremely difficult to get to due to roadworks Staff should be able to advise on route Also drove to Zandarm similar situation a precise address or post code would have been helpful for navigation , Clean modern friendly staff great location Nice room in good condition 
308962,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The view from the room was just an inside wall which is a shaft between two buildings even I paid for premium room and I informed the reception agent but with no response, Location of the hotel is amazing located in the heart of Dam square

308964,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Pillow is way too soft maybe a choice would be great, Helpful and friendly reception staff and housekeeping clean spacious room including bathroom love the little touch like handwritten weather forecast notes Keep up the good work
308965,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Lacking in milk for hot drinks in the room on the first night did supply more when asked Very expensive for a night For info no view breakfast was extra , Staff very friendly helpful and attentive Suggested ideas we hadn t considered and gave important information we hadn t thought to ask 
308966,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Worst ever experience with Swiss hotel On arrival day we were checked in at 7 pm only room was not ready We asked for 30 min late check out receptionist first approved but next day his colleagues refused to give us extra 30 min for checkout Beds in the rooms not comfortable Paid over 500 euro per night for 1 star level accomodation, Nothing positive about this hotel
308967,Swiss tel Amsterdam, You must pay for the view on the dam square and you must make the reservation dirctly with them if you want a room with view on dam square , The location is amazing the staff too Especially David Charlotte
308968,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing Can t fault this hotel or it s staff , Super comfortable bed immaculate room Great breakfast with plenty of choice All staff were first class but Reception staff were outstanding We will certainly stay at this hotel again 
308969,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Very rude staff at the bar and reception Bed was extremely uncomfortable they had to add another mattress to the bed , Very good location close to Dam square and Central station
308970,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The maitre de at breakfast must hate his job he was just plain rude in response to a simple question , Location the breakfast was very good and plentiful bed comfortable 
308971,Swiss tel Amsterdam, For the price you expect breakfast at least to be included TV selection was very limited Certainly a hotel that was not value for money , Staff in Hotel were brilliant Business centre internet was a bonus Location to all Amsterdam was excellent Room although small was adequate in that it was clean and everthing worked as you would expect 
308972,Swiss tel Amsterdam, I arrived 1 30 pm and they gave me the room at 2 15 pm they were very slow and late in check in The room is very small and old furniture with poor Internet connection An advice don t go for the location itself as there is no specific center in Amsterdam , It s location is great and breakfast was delicious 
308973,Swiss tel Amsterdam, Nothing , One of the best hotels in Amsterdam Really courteous and professional staff Fantastic location Clean well thought through and comfortable rooms 
308974,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The coffee making facilities were dusty and the mattress was too soft The pillows were also too soft and flat , I liked the clean comfortable rooms and in particular the tea and coffee making facilities 
308975,Swiss tel Amsterdam, The rooms are of really low quality Even though the corridors are new or refurbished there is lot of work yet to be done in the rooms they are uncomfortable and very old Not worth the price I would only recommend this hotel if you have only one night to stay in Amsterdam, The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful
308976,Swiss tel Amsterdam, They gave us a funny bed sheets at start Sadly it is way too expansive for a small room and small bathroom The management should look into that It feels the amount of money which I paid too high for the room type I selected The bathroom door open outward it was dangers when someone standing outside or opening the room door therefore there was a clashing I advise to switch it to sliding I tried the breakfast and it was not to great not much selection other cafes around the hotel are better Also the outdoor cafe was not welcoming for such a great location it should have improved Would I come to the hotel again Yes because of the staff and if they lower the cost to match the actual size of the room , The hotel has a great location the staffs are so friendly helpful and they have business canter available for checking your booking Important note if you are with a family get a bigger room than the standers to enjoy the hotel if the cost is reasonable to you
