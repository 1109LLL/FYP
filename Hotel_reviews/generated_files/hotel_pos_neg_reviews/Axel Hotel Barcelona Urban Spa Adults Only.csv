273131,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Compared to other hotels I suspect you may find better value for money however you pay for the novelty of the hotel which does not go unnoticed , The Axel is known as gay friendly and it definitely was We had a good stay nice rooms and bathrooms and is walking distance from a host of restaurants and nightlife 
273132,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, the bed was kind of a rock the soap was wrapped in impossible to open packets and when they were finally opened were very small and did not foam up at all shampoo was similar , the food was expensive for the value and not well prepared the staff were friendly and helpful 
273133,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, This is my second visit to the property and pleasantly surprised of the rooms nicely renovated Skybar lovely as always and common areas The property centrally located with easy walking distance to main attractions The staff is truly friendly and come you with a beautiful smile Certainly will be back soon 
273134,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The interior rooms don t have a view and they also open up to the smoking courtyard which smells like cigarettes , The location was fantastic the staff was very accommodating The general manager Marc Sancho when he heard that I was not happy with my room he made sure that I didn t have to wait to get an exterior room with balcony overlooking the quiet side street it was lovely 
273135,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, , Returning for a multiple time and still satisfied Once again I got a room with a balcony overlooking the street It was fantastic Open the windows and feel the vibe of the neighborhood close them and total isolation The reception staff are doing a fantastic job Andre was once again the one to check me in and out thanks Andre John who desperately tried to find me a transport due to the taxi strike thanks for your sincere efforts Javier and of cource Alexandra who is exemplary The cleaning staff are doing a great job as well and a simple good morning to them is returned with a great smile Also many thanks to Marc the GM who is very friendly and accommodating and also a great professional The new restaurant Nikkei 103 is a great addition And the Sky bar yo enjoy the pool and sun during the day and great drinks and events at night The Wellness Club 33 is a must to visit for a massage or training or just using the spa Total bliss Thanks Sabrina for the great job and friendship This hotel is close to so many things like bars and restaurants Casa Batll Casa Mil also known as La Pedrera the great shopping street of Passeig de Gr cia also known for its modernism buildings Totally happy here 
273136,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, It is not very clear in the description of the hotel that the Axel hotel focuses on the gay community Customers should be notified much more clearly beforehand what type of hotel it is to prevent surprises ,No Positive
273137,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The bed wasn t very comfortable a bit too firm but the sheets and pillows were great The bar was a little pricey as was the mini bar in the room , The bed wasn t the comfiest but the room itself was lovely and the rooftop pool and bar was amazing The suite was great and a huge terrace 
273138,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, There was a strong smell of sewage from the shower drain however this did not disappoint our stay House keeping can be a bit noisy while cleaning rooms next door often hearing them banging the Hoover against the wall skirting , Staff were always attentive to our needs Always greeted with a warm smile by them 
273139,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing, The Skybar every evening was great and relaxing The room was spacious and modern A lot of choice in the breakfast buffet The aircon in the room 
273140,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, n a, great location great facilities and ambieance super clean received world class service from Alexandra professional and friendly personally the best hotel ive ever stayed in Europe thank you for a wonderful stay will always be my 1st option regards David Horne
273141,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Wi Fi was very slow as were the elevators The rooms had no tissues or luggage racks The counters in the bathrooms were non existent , Great location The pillows were good and the staff kept the rooms clean each day 
273142,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Not to have been informed that it was an exclusive gay hotel, Big surprise was that it was exclusively gay and I had not noticed it when I booked I didn t like the surprise and my son with whom I was traveling even less Bookings has to make it clearer in the booking process Otherwise the hotel was fine 
273143,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I payed 170 and then breakfast was not included This hotel is absolutely not worth this high price It is nothing special , It s close to a lot of nice restaurants
273144,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, One person at reception doing everything and no concierge meant checking in was slow and cumbersome despite really good staff Lifts are very slow Wi fi not good on 7th fooor Spa very nice but Bathers really Breakfast not open till 8 am on day of departure Sorry Its a lovely place looks great but not cheap and maybe under delivering , A very well presented place Comfortable and very nice rooms
273145,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Once we had an issue with hot water it wasn t hot but next morning it was OK Access to SPA is paid we didn t have time for it anyway but I got used to such services being included , The stuff was very welcoming and polite They shifted the room class for no additional cost and gave advice where to go till we waited for a check in time Room was not big but cozy with a street view They also had a great bar on the roof as well as small swimming pool If you want to stay somewhere close to the city center axel would be a great choice 
273146,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing to complain about , The rooftop bar was really amazing The staff were so super friendly even when we left our luggage with them from 12 00pm till we left for our flight which was quite late the evening Loved the 12 00 check out
273147,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The pool is more of a bath then pool The Skybar gets very crowded and noisy in the evenings , Fantastic location with friendly staff The Skybar is a really good facility 
273148,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooms are very small if you don t pay the 40 euro upgrade Hardly room to open even one of your suitcases No where to have a coffee near reception You have to go the pool on the 8th floor Always going to nearby cafes , LOCATION
273149,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Very little storage space not an issue for me as a solo traveller but no where really to store stuff Some guests looked a bit out of place I assume Axel is marketing itself as more mainstream but it might put gay guys off, Lots of activities drinks on the roof top bar show and a plentiful breakfast buffet 14 Staff friendly got a free room upgrade not clear what this added as the room was not huge Nice pool deck
273150,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Overpriced room too small no proper wardrobe to fit clothes Really poor lighting in the bathroom No chance to dine at the restaurant as we were never told or advise to book a table in advance Never told at reception lift worked with room key No bath which there should be as we paid 350 a night It was a nightmare as I had to bring the card I booked the room with which wasn t specified anywhere it Was utterly hassling They were quite rude over the phone dealing with this matter too , The location some of the staff was friendly 
273151,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Night time emergency and bathroom lighting not conducive for a goods night sleep Room felt a little tired and certainly didn t feel premium when compared to other standard rooms at a similar price, Bed comfortable and location
273152,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, One of the rooms booked had 2 sky bar bills charged to the room on one evening we all used cash throughout the holiday and charged nothing to the room at any point clearly the bar staff do not ask for the room ID card when charging otherwise this could have been avoided this was embarrassing when checking out and not a pleasant way to remember the weekend , Rooms very good clean beds great Sky bar excellent 
273153,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The Urban spa is misleading The spa is not part of the hotel and you must pay 10 Euros to use the steam and sauna rooms You have access if you purchase a massage Hotel guests should receive complimentary spa entrance Especially at a rate of over 250 a night , Great location 
273154,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Read above, Not a lot I also was not aware on booking it was a gay hotel Nothing against gay people but wouldn t of booked if this was clearly stated
273155,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Great location very comfortable and attractive room and a terrific bed Staff was super friendly and helpful We did not make use of the spa but will plan to next time 
273156,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, One little thing they charge me for a bottle of water twice when I did pay at the reception before I left I guess they didn t put it out in the system apart of that all very very good , Amazing staff and the room was perfect everything in place with a view we enjoyed it very much Thanks to the staff for the service 
273157,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Beds were quite hard , The location of the hotel is supurb 5 minutes walk from 2 different Metro lines great breakfast salon around the corner multiple nice little restaurants in the direct neighbourhood 10 minutes walk from Plaza de la Catalunia and the Ramblas Very clean hotel soundproof windows very friendly staff Great rooftopbar 
273158,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I didn t like to be charged twice On check out I paid everything in cash both the stay and the mini bar Later though I was charged via credit card the amount of the mini bar again Ridiculous as far as I can see And that leaves me with a grieving thought was this the negligence of the staff or just a petty theft ,No Positive
273159,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing , Room was large Bathroom shower was huge and all glass Frank at the front desk did a wonderful job of checking us in answering all questions helped us with our luggage he couldn t of been more helpful Cleaning staff left the room spotless Hotel was clean new and modern We checked in at 2am and was in our room in 5 minutes Wow Great job 
273160,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The room clean standard whilst good was not routine Usually mid to late afternoon siesta time , The customer service was outstanding How to help was the approach to resolving any issues The breakfast options and food quality choice impressive with staff so so obliging nice 
273161,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Except for 1 or 2 employees that were really nice the rest of the staff was just ok The premium room wasn t premium at all Amenities on the room were quite poor The hotel charged my credit card prior to my arrival the reservations rules stated that I would only paid upon arrival causing the incovinience of having to reimburse the First transaction Moreover the currency rate on the reimbursement was higher than the original transaction leading to an extra payment Blackout curtains didn t fully block the morning sunlight , Very good location good gym facilities
273162,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We booked the hotel because although we knew it was primarily a gay hotel it did say heterosexual friendly and the photos on booking com were inviting enough We booked our hotel at a non refundable price and later in the week when we visited the website we noticed it was full of sexual photos naked men etc clearly not the same photos on bookings com We tried to cancel through the hotel and Bookings as we believed this was false advertisement We did not receive a favorable response from either party and we were not willing to lose over 1000 00 so we chose to stay At check in our room was not ready even though we arrived after 5PM The lights did not work properly and we actually had to turn certain lights on and off through a fuse box The rooms were noisy and one night were woke up to the smell of pot and a snake alarm going off We will not stay here again , Enjoyed the location which was ideal Could not have been better Staff was friendly 
273163,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Horrible room service I stayed for 3 nights and my room was never cleaned before 4 Afternoon although I put a notice on the door several times I had to bring the issue to reception as the staff don t speak English Slow internet connection , Spacious room and confy bed bathroom lacks privacy though 
273164,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing everyone either met standards or exceeded them , Everything about the hotel was wonderful The room was very spacious and comfortable the staff was excellent the breakfast was great etc Overall a great place and very centrally located to all the fun in Barcelona The breakfast had a very wide variety of choices to suit everyone The food was fresh and very well prepared We were on the 7th floor on the 8th is the pool area not in use too early in the season and a bar I was a little concerned there would be noise from the bar but there was absolutely none One touch that both my partner and I appreciated was that the hotel manager made himself very visible and was there to ask us about our experience He even made a point of calling us part way through our stay to confirm everything was to out liking These touches make a property stand out from the big chains of hotels 
273165,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We didn t realise the hotel was really targeted at gay men While it wasn t problematic and it was heterofriendly the marketing in and around the hotel was very pointed It ether should be more clear the hotel is really for gay men which is totally fine or the marketing should be toned down We kinda felt like we shouldn t be there , Staff were friendly Room was comfy and clean 
273166,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Instead of a glass wall of the shower into the bedroom they could have used more storage But I understand it is a fun aspect of the property , Excellent location in Eixample lots to do and see Staff was efficient and helpful Rooftop bar was ok for a quick drink 
273167,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Stayed in Two hotel by Axel during this visit and the fact of a heated pool in the roof top of the TWO hotel gives positive points vs the main Axel Hotel , The atmosphere was very good Nice people and spa area not busy The room was great 
273168,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, There was not enough storage furniture in the room so most of our clothes stayed in suitcases , Great bed very roomy bathroom with a separate toilet Staff were very friendly and helpful Location for eating places transit and tourist sites is very convenient 
273169,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nada, Great location amazing staff the hotel manager was amazing and nice everything was perfect Super clean great place Want to live there 
273170,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The room was extremely dark Not a great value for money I expected more from 4star hotel scratched bed frame mould in the bathroom etc Spa pool was 10 per entry, The bed was amazing really big and comfy Great location close to all attractions in Barcelona Nice big shower Roof bar was pretty cool
273171,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing to report on dislikes , As this establishment falls under the hospitality industry I would say that it is doing a very good job there I was welcomed by Andre who did a very good job in check to satisfy my requests tnx Andre Of course Alexandra once again gets top marks in doing an excellent job and was happy for her promotion I was sad to see Daniel go but was delighted to hear that got a well deserved promotion to lead TWO It s good that there is reward for a job well done and internal promotion for deserving people as it reflects on customers Wellness 33 is great and the staff very friendly accomodating and professional Many thanks again to Sabrina Gabriel Juan Carlos and a great welcome to Martin who is a very special addition Hope to see you guys soon As mentioned by most the location is very convenient to a lot of places and can easily move about either on feet or public transport The room was cleaned very well and the staff was friendly when I dealt with them There was some renovation in the ground floor but did not disturb So my 5th time was once again satisfying 
273172,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Late checkin 3pm , The checkin is late but was then made up with wonderful staff and great breakfast Lots of fun at the roof top bar and was very comfortable as a solo traveller 
273173,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Noisy sound isolation is not great Old building sometimes faucets in the bathroom randomly leaked Hotel restaurant is a sushi place which also delivers for room service so it lacks simple things like fries and burgers for room service I do not want sushi for midnight snack , Friendly staff Clean Modern interior Nice rooftop bar Great location
273174,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing really , Totally quiet and very comfortable room even though on the street side of the building It got the lovely morning sunshine Recommend requesting it Excellent breakfast with a huge range of lovely things to eat Rooftop bar a nice addition 10 min walk to the Metro 
273175,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Noisy at night room dark at back of hotel someone urinated in the elevator on Saturday still not cleaned on Sunday although reported to staff , Staff very friendly location excellent
273176,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Between some things that happened to their puor was when I checked in at 5 00 am and after 5 minutes left the hotel I realized that I had forgotten my ipad in the room I immediately called the hotel informing until then oriko told me that when the Housekeeper would get the ipad and they would be sending me On arriving at home without any contact from the hotel for infirmations about me if they would have received my email with the address and bank coordinates I decided to call and then I was informed that they had not found anything in the room I checked the location and I declined connected in the hotel I informed them on the phone and asked for a time that they would check again unsuccessfully So after trying to track the device again it informed me that it had been disconnected with its ultoma location inside the hotel And without much hope I left my secretary in charge to see what she could do and after many emails yricados with the hotel the only response was that nothing would have been left in the hotel when my secretariat began the procedures for a complaint with the evidence Registered on the last locations of the ipad and with the schedules and informing the hotel Surprisingly after a few hours I was informed that surprisingly the ipad had been found as magic inside the room where it had said to have left by means of an email followed with many rollings of how it would have happened but no apology for the happened, Great geographical location in the city
273177,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Gym and spa time is not good Spa close at 11 00 PM during the week and 10 00 PM for weekend It is nice if they close more later , All stuff were so friendly and kind 
273178,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The Spa downstairs when we used it was cold and we had to pay 20 euros which we didn t know because it doesn t say on the website or anything ,No Positive
273179,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, It is difficult to sit and watch TV in bed because at the pillow end behind your head there is a sort of a shelf making it impossible to rest your back, The location and friendliness of the staff make Axel hotel a good choice and also great value for money The room was a good size and very clean I highly recommend this property 
273180,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, check in has been a pain done by an apprentice with no one from his colleague as a result 15 mn for a check in that was really not efficient and good check out just profesional and distant, room size bed confort bathroom breakfast
273181,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, It s not the first time for me in Axel I know it from the opening time and they do not need another good feedback if you never been there you must do it It s a special place I want to leave a feedback because this time I was attended by new staff and I have to say that Alexandra was so kind helpful Thank you very much 
273182,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Very nice hotel The staff is very friendly and helpful The location is top Rooms are very beautiful I recomend this hotel to everyone Breakfast is delicious 
273183,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Hotel charged me just after my booking was confirmed even there was info we will pay just at the hotel Be carefull it s heterofriendly hotel what we didn t know ,No Positive
273184,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Make sure you get the room from the picture In the superior category there are different options , This is a sexy hotel very well placed The environment is very mainly thought for gay clients If as heterosexual you are comfortable with it I think it is a good choice otherwise you may find it too gay oriented There are pictures of semi naked men all over the place The room has an amazing transparent shower right in front of the bed They offer shaver and condoms in the toilet kit They have a spa with all sort of massages even something called tantric massage and they offer massage service to the room This place is nice for honeymoon or romantic escape 
273185,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, classificacion of the rooms is strange I booked the same room category but got a far smaller and less good equiped room as last two times Gona be carefull when booking again in case I gona consider it for my next BCN trip , Rooftop terrace was great
273186,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The bed was uncomfortable and noisy From 10 am there were noises from construction which would last for 3 4 hours So it was impossible to take a rest between 10 2 pm The spa was NOT included in hotel rates Room design was a real dislike At all other hotels when we had problem with the noises in room We would get a new room at least with one day delay At Axel hotel despite of my continuous complains it didn t happen They tried to fix the issue and keep us in the same room they changed the bed so it was less noisy but the noises from 10 am onwards was always there until our last day I believe that the rating is somehow biased as not so many hetero couples stay in this hotel The atmosphere especially in the sky bar was not right for a hetero couple , The spa was nice and the area is great Very central and close to nice restaurants 
273187,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Noise from skybar till 3 pm every night was terrible After 1st night we had to change to room and helped a little bit New year s eve was horrible Couldn t sleep before 7 am because whole hotel was total party hell Including hotel restaurants which were open till that time fire alarms and people partying So this is good hotel for party people but if you want to sleep it s no good , Staff was friendly Bed was good and also spa was good 
273188,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, restaurant was being renovated didn t have the minimum of room service such as tea they couldn t provided and I didn t like the fact that it wasn t mentioned at the time of booking, Location staff 
273189,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, If the roof top jacuzzi was open in the winter, The massage in the spa was fantastic the lady at reception was very help and the masseur named Danny was fantastic
273190,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The balcony door not closing good air and noises comes through The air system can t be set correctly it switches between warm and cold not so good in my opinion Some noises from the inside of the hotel during all the evening maybe an ice machine ,No Positive
273191,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Room bathroom has mold and the door frame is ruined by water at the bottom The prices at the bar are not competitive to the good bars in the city basically located next door to the hotel I m sure some of the revenue is lost due to this fact , The location is great Room design is cool
273192,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Does not offer what is expected of a hotel with this rating no bottled water in room no coffee facilities no room service and no in house restaurant Although I am entitled to an early check in according to Booking Com check i was available LATER than the check in time , Location vibe and well equipped gym Front desk friendly and helpful 
273193,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The check in process seems unnecessarily complex lots of running back and forth to a copier and printer Other hotels are able to handle this without leaving the front desk , The inside rooms are very quiet which is important for us The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful about storing our luggage until we returned in the evening 
273194,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The hotel restaurant was in renovation during our stay so the breakfast were served in a nearby cafe Tasty and fresh but no buffet May not suit to those to like BIG first meal of the day You have to pay extra for the spa That was an unpleasant suprise for us Later we ve checked the info on booking com and there is a small note on the bottom of the hotels page Easy to miss when booking , Superb location Comfy and clean rooms Nice staff 
273195,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Fantastic hotel in a very good location close to everything alot of restaurants in the neighborhood Tha staff was fantastic The hotel may be a gay hotel but it ius trully eterofriendly and it is worth it to visit it Trendy with a lot of facilities exactly as a modern hotel should be 
273196,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Very expensive and you have to pay for a lot of extras , Hotel is very stylish and set in a nice area staff friendly and you pay extra for breakfast but it s worth it 
273197,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Being a regular guest at the Axel Hotel in Berlin I knew what to expect the house music in the lobby the rather tacky interior design the muscled and half naked men on each leaflet they all are part of the Axel brand It serves mainly the mainstream gay male audience and welcomes straight guests as well But Axel Hotel Barcelona seems to lose focus on their main clientele a bit The Urban Spa is ran by a different company and has to be paid extra so it isn t part of the hotel anymore Extremely prudish staff there is rather off putting The Skybar on the rooftop has a beautiful sight over the city and is quite busy on the weekends too Unfortunately the advertising of events doesn t always correlate with the event itself A bit more attention to details there might help All in all still a great experience and a good value for your money , Staff is excellent the house from the outside stunning The room we got was nice and big And even the brand new breakfast location across the street did serve excellent food though there was a bumpy beginning 
273198,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The room was very spacious the fittings in the room were of a good standard bed was comfy too Johnathon the man who checked me in and made the rest of my stay pleasant was the top man anything I asked for he provided with no complications Would definately stay here again 
273199,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Too many staight couples which I noticed negativally especially in spa No cupboard just some hangers over minibar cleaning staff came very late after 4pm I missed a gay or pay per view channel Elevators did not work properly and no restaurant , First time in a gay hotel nothing too flamboyant which is fine with me just little things I appreciated in my room safe please disturb sign I liked the spa Sky pool bar the rooms were nice and the bathroom was nice too The place we took our breakfast opposite the street was very nice We didn t want to go with the 14 deal and ate by menu I will go back to Axel hotel 
273200,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I have no complaints about my stay , I was warmly greeted by the Staff Aleix at the front desk and received a room upgrade at no extra charge John at the front desk gave me great local options for breakfast and dinner Having late cleaning service was a nice option although I didn t need it I visited the rooftop bar once during my stay and really enjoyed my time up there Pablo made sure that my glass remained filled haha
273201,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I was leaving 6 o clock in the morning and I couldn t get a coffee and the gym was really bad they use so much perfume in the air They use air freshener all over it so horrible , The staff was amazing the location was great
273202,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Internet connection was quite poor and intermittent Staff friendliness and attentiveness hit or miss , Great location with lots of good dining options in close vicinity The gym was better equipped than most equivalent or higher category properties I have stayed at I enjoyed the ambiance of the terrace bar on the top floor The breakfast which was hosted at Bloom across the street due to restaurant renovations was outstanding and a highlight Rooms were clean and basic but functional I had a premium room which was a little bigger than the standard room but still relatively small when compared to other properties I have stayed at in the area for the price 
273203,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Wi fi very slow , Good location Easy walk to Pla a de Catalunya 12min to catch Aerobus to Airport Gym small but better facilities than most hotels Staff very friendly 
273204,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Rooms are old mattresses aren t comfortable There was no place in the bathroom to hang our stuff or even leave our toiletry We could hear our neighbors in their bathrooms , Extremely good location very nice team
273205,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Unfortunately I have stayed in this hotel during CPhI exhibition and the price was doubled that the regular fares , The hotel is central located and the staff is very nice and helpful Lots of nice amenities like gym sauna and rooftop pool and bar 
273206,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Beds were very hard Didn t seem to make scene to have bath room towels in the room and not in the bathroom No wash cloths need 4 towels in a two person room not just one for each No soap holder in shower Disappointed that the spa was extra and not clothing optional like the web site seems to show or make you think ins clothing optional and men only, Great Location Staff seem very friendly did like the roof top bar Great Views
273207,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Hi Best hotel with very helpful staff Very good breakfast Amazing location Good facilities If youre looking for the best gay holiday experience this is the place
273208,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The shower was leaking The gym and pool are a bit neglected We paid over price in compare to other people who stayed there the elevators didn t work 1 for 2 days and the other part of the time so we had to take the stairs to the 6th floor , Great location Very nice hotel 
273209,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Not enough towels provided But they supplied me with more after requesting , I was upgraded upon arrival Very nice lady at checkin Went smoothly Great room corner with art deco balcony Bedding was great bathroom too Visited the rooftop bar also nice service despite other reviews All together a great place to stay Just look for the special offers and then its really affordable Will come back for sure 
273210,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The staff was among the friendliest we encountered in our travels They took genuine interest in making sure our stay was fantastic The location is centrally located only a short walk from the Gothic district My wife and I loved this hotel 
273211,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We were there for the weekend and bar staff on roof top pool were unfriendly and incredibly slow with so few customers The breakfast buffet was very good but hardly anyone eats at this very nice restaurant morning or evening even though the hotel was full I don t know why the Axel hotels don t provide wash cloths sponge for the showers Same in Berlin and just like in Berlin the showers pour water onto the bathroom floor because the shower glass was installed incrorrectly in both locations I d definitely stay at Axel Berlin again but not Barcelona Its bar staff at the pool were unfriendly and rude and they close the pool and jacuzzi at 6pm and that s where everyone gathers and where we spent most of our time and money when not sightseeing or clubbing , Nice hotel Decent location 
273212,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Even though we booked the more expensive version of paying upon arrival whole amount was charged to my card anyways and returned next day Since I had different currency on my account that s why I chose not paying via card I lost eur 50 in conversion rates overnight So I payed more to get a certain service and I did not get it anyways Booking com placement stipulates many times that the card will not be charged and that was one of the considerations when I am making a decision,No Positive
273213,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The mattress was very hard on the bed and the room would have been made better by having tea and coffee making facilities in the room, The room and balcony was fantastic and the pool area was great the staff were very friendly and the location was perfect 
273214,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The wi fi some times is weak depending on the room location and there are deadspots in the rooftop , I like the fact that the hotel has so much to offer The Skybar is just fantastic for both relaxation and socializing The area is also nice with bars and restaurants nearby 
273215,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The only slight criticism I would have is that every now and again at night and in the morning it sounded like the shower suddenly turned on and was letting out water but I imagine it was just the piping , Amazing rooftop pool area and bar Very friendly staff and lovely modern bathroom We had a free upgrade on arrival and loved our spacious room This hotel is also a great location for walking into the city centre or grabbing the metro which is 2 blocks away 
273216,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The staff are fabulous especially the receptionists who were very helpful and welcoming Our room was spotless and comfortable I would definitely return 
273217,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Hotel is very tired and needs a revamp Feels about 10years behind Has a horrid smell in the lobby from the spa and pool below Staff at the pool bar almost non existent Has the potential to be amazing again , Good location 
273218,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Mixed gender toilets comdom in the toilet stains on the bed This hotel is poorly described by booking com very gay hotel with gay sexual innuendoes and pictures around the hotel with sexual connotations ,No Positive
273219,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The kingsize bed and pillows were very comfy and the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly As we were there as a treat for our wedding anniversary they upgraded us and the manager bought us up a bottle of fizz on the house Couldn t fault them and highly recommend 
273220,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The rooms were well appointed and comfortable The location very convenient to the local gay scene and all the cities best attractions The roof top pool bar is a great place to see the sights of the city and is very enjoyable Looking forward to staying with them again 
273221,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast was outright poor Cheap orange juice undrinkable coffee croissants as if they were taken out of a sack of industrially made ones with one year best for date Other guests new better It was almost empty on a Sunday morning , For gay travellers it is a great place to stay 
273222,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The hotel rooms are not practical bath robe hooks in the hall way no storage in the bathroom weird furniture with no functional purpose air con settings are hot or artic , Great location
273223,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast lacked any imagination We stayed for 7 nights I recommend you change a few elements around choice of fruit hot food etc The cost would be negligent the impact strong , Reception was amazing 
273224,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I was not aware that this was a gay hotel and although this did not affect my evaluation I think that this should have been apparent on the booking com website The hotel website has been updated since this was booked The details in the hotel stated that the spa was for gay persons only I did not challenge this but this is sexist and again was not apparent not the website Whether you can prove this i don t know , Very friendly and helpful staff and clean room
273225,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This gay hotel has seen it s best time Gay people are willing and able to spend a bit more money on their journeys but therefore the quality of the place and especially the service has to be good and friendly Both is not the case Management should really think about not just taking the money from their guests but more providing a perfect ambience and service , The location is perfect in the middle of the gay area but still relative quite rooms due to good isolation of the windows
273226,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Very pricey bar on the roof 13 for a cocktail is a little much for Barcelona standards check in time 3pm and no sooner i ve worked in reception at a hotel and people always check out earlier so i m sure they could be more accommodating to people arriving on early flights, Rooftop bar was pretty cool but lacked atmosphere in the evening a little music would have been great Reception team were very friendly and helpful Loved the room and the showers were great really close to metro and gay nightlife so will definitely stay again when we come back to Barcelona
273227,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The staff could be more service minded special the staff at the roof It should also beposible to buy food later in the evening at the roof The hotel is too expencive compere to others , The location is Perfect 
273228,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The Bathroom products is not good there is noise comes from sky bar lightings in the suite are bit dark the lefts takes long time to come and always full in the evening expensive drinks at Sky bar small pool, Great Location The Sky bar is a very nice crowd
273229,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast was boring and felt like missing some stuff I wouldn t pay 14 for it but it was already included Didn t have breakfast last day as I preferred to have breakfast outside , The confort location service 
273230,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, the roof top bar was expensive but probably no more than most hotel bars, The hotel is very stylish the room was lovely with comfortable beds even though we overlooked the Main Street the room was very quiet The staff were really friendly and very helpful The staff couldn t do enough to help us plan our trip recommending places to visit and helping us book tickets The hotel is very hetero friendly and my sister and I were made very welcome by everyone Great location fabulous breakfasts great roof top Don t really understand people criticising for having to pay for breakfast foods not included in the main breakfast or that a gay hotel looked and seemed too gay we loved our stay here have recommended it to friends and will stay again 
273231,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, over priced for drinks at the bar , Comfortable bed very clean room robes and slippers in room great customer service friendly staff good location to centre modern hotel free wifi connection
273232,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Everything The place is horribly bad , Over rated a complete waste of money The gym is tiny the rooms are tiny no closet not comfy The pics of the pools A BIG LIE The pool and the jacuzzi were so small it fits barely to 3 people together So disappointed and very shocked It is absolutely not worth it 
273233,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood It s an extremely firm mattress Our requests for extra pillows were ignored The requests were treated with respect just never answered or acted upon No extra blankets either There is almost zero storage for any clothing so my suitcase just had to sit on the floor There isn t even a rack for holding a suitcase so you have to crouch down to deal with it In the shower there s no place to put anything even the little bar of soap so shampoo and everything was on the floor I guess they take the minimalist design very seriously Breakfast was convenient but dull with eggs that were very overcooked after sitting around for a while I don t think I would stay there again It wasn t awful just not what I would expect for the price They re banking on being a gay destination hotel , The location is very central and convenient The hotel is generally very clean and well maintained The staff were all pleasant to deal with The elevators were a little crazy to figure out at first but once I did they worked quickly and I didn t have to wait a long time I had a room facing the street with a balcony and the windows did a great job of keeping the street noise out The roof deck is very beautiful and a nice place to hang out although super crowded at night since it s a popular venue The gym was surprisingly good too It s a tight space with good equipment to use The spa was pleasant although the steam room was broken my entire visit They deducted 2 euros off the usual price as compensation 
273234,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, A bit expensive bar on the terrance 13 euros for a drink The pool is not really a pool but a half a meter deep cool down area The premium room had a balcony but NO chairs , Great Staff Good breakfast Location Keep in mind that this is a GAY Hotel and hetero friendly 
273235,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Uncomfortable environment everything geared to being explicitly sexual Would not cancel booking when they saw how uncomfortable we were at the hotel and in fact charged us double the agreed room rate No mention on Booking com that the hotel was for predominantly gay and in your face Worst hotel experience ever Unable to relax Booking com and Axel hotel could not care less about customer service or your vacation enjoyment just their profit , NOTHING STAFF ATTITUDE TOWARDS HETROSEXUALS APPAULING 
273236,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, They couldn t check us into our room until 4 30 after being told room would be ready at 3 00 Room was small and bedding smelled of stale cigarette smoke , location
273237,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Whilst we had a great stay the description of the hotel is a little ambiguous It is not Gay Friendly it is 100 a Gay Hotel This was not an issue for me but some travellers may find this compromising , The hotel was very central and in a good area 
273238,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Perfect experience No complaints , Beds were very comfortable as were the comforters the room was spotless and the balcony view was phenomenal Everyone was very friendly Reception went out of its way to answer our questions in great detail You seriously can t go wrong with this hotel 
273239,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Quality of room finishing a is poor with a bad smell when we checked in Rooftop pool spa had no atmosphere with no music Breakfast provided at the hotel is very average Despite being a renound hotel the experience did not live up to the hype a distinct lack of atmosphere continuity and social areas in the hotel left us disappointed in the experience , Great relaxation area wellness spa
273240,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Poor customer support and hospitality Security below standards While criminal activities were going at broad daylight the staff could not be bothered and let the customers and victims unattended Very bad experience Very disappointing ,No Positive
273241,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, There a problem I think in all rooms other guys complained to the reception the very bad smell from the air conditioned in the bath But the staff seem not to be interested to solve it ,No Positive
273242,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooms aren t very sound proofed It could just be our room but we seemed to be right next to an internal sewerage pipe and being on the 2nd floor we could hear the flushing of each toilet and what I imagine to be the contents of the flush hitting the ground , Very friendly and helpful staff Beautiful hotel and in a great location for the gay scene and a 5 minute walk to the metro station The rooftop pool bar is also very convenient 
273243,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast is very limited and no tea and coffee facilities in the room Seems as though room service is also always closed You should improve this , reception staff are lovely especially Andre 
273244,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Bar staff on room sky bar SOME were rude blank and looked uninterested looked like they begrudged serving you Maybe they should rethink their career , The receptionist lady on the front desk was absolutely amazing She made sure we had everything we needed and was always helpful and smiling 
273245,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Weak internet connection Gay place not mentionned on booking com we were not the only one surprised When you decide going to the swimming pool as a man it is a little embarassing They make you feel you are not like them VERY BAD POINT FOR BOOKING COM AS IT WAS NOT MENTIONNED WHEN I BOOKED LAST TIME WITH YOU GUYS I AM AFRAID OTHER HETERO WE CROSSED IN THE LIFT SAID THE SAME , They upgraded us so ok for that although the premium is not tremendously different than standard room in courtyard or other big hothel chains 
273246,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The location is very good The room was cleaned the bed comfortable and the shower was amazing The personal is very friendly The top floor bar is very nice beautiful view 
273247,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, No milk with the in room coffee machine When we asked at reception why we were told this was a special hotel that supplied free condoms But no milk for the Coffee Later the duty manager insisted it was a misunderstanding , Excellent room Jnr Suite and breakfast Staff very attentive 
273248,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I like a firm mattress but the bed here was too hard firm even for my liking , Staff was extremely friendly and helpful Great location Close to other gay businesses clubs and LGBT community Easy to get around the city from this central location Rooftop pool jacuzzi and bar was great for lounging in the afternoon and on the weekend nights it was quite a busy social scene Modern boutique hotel rooms were very well appointed comfortable and stylishly decorated 
273249,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This hotel neglects to mention just how in your face it is as a male gay hotel As a lesbian couple even we felt uncomfortable at the explicitness of it from the moment you walk into the hotel even in your room This would have been fine if it was disclosed transparently on booking com and perhaps was a generic LGBT hotel They have great facilities roof top bar Spa gym but we simply didn t use them having been put off by the whole demeanour of the hotel Wifi is horrendous So don t expect good usage all the time , The location of the hotel was great Short walk to universitait metro and a few places nearby to eat Notably bloom across the street which was great for breakfasts The hotel was modern the bed comfortable and the bathrooms were clean and modern too 
273250,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The shower was see through from both the bathroom as well as from the bedroom , The room was spacious and the layout was nice with the toilet shower and sink behind a wall and the bed on the other side of the wall 
273251,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Location its just perfect restaurant around are the best Look for Gaudim restaurant La flauta just in the corner and best pastries at La Pastisseria Definitevely the best 
273252,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, This is a fun hotel but for a more mature crowd It s a gay hotel so not exactly family friendly Nonetheless super happy with the staff namely Dany who helped me clear up a booking issue So grateful and thankful with your help Dany 
273253,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, the only negative for a smoker is the breakfast room as it is located in the house and therefore no possibility is the coffee with cigarette enjoy but there are on the other side of the street a nice cafe where you can sit outside , The staff at the front desk is super nice and friendly 
273254,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I have been at this hotel and at other Axel hotels several time but this time was definitely the last time Room Air Condition didn t work Water in basis didn t run through disgusting No shower towels Wake up call forgotten Reception didn t handle complaint properly From Check until check out staff was impolite and arrogant Breakfast very basic and less quality and quantity than before I am traveling through out the year a lot and can recommend to book other hotels in Barcelona for less money and better quality and service ,No Positive
273255,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The fact that it does tel you that this hotel is for gay people is terrible we walked in and there was pictures of men all over was not right they did not tel you this on booking com I was so pissed off everywhere you went pictures of gay men , Not much 
273256,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, wi fi was so bad and not work Rooms are very very small and room cleaning service is so bad mini bar and other services are so expensive, only good location
273257,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This was my second stay after 6 years at Axel Sadly I got hugely disappointed this time Reception staff were constantly head down on their screens throughout our stay of 5 days and nights never attentive or genuinely interested in helping Even when there was no one queueing we had to wait for the reception guy to finish his so important and never ending thing every single time Breakfast was seriously bad They charge you extra even for basic fried eggs coffee was the worst We paid for a premium double room yet still asked to be charged 10 per head for every single spa access Rooftop pool is basically an oversized bath tub Apart from one guy the whole house keeping was shambolic One day we left one of the hand towels on the floor to be changed instead they took both of the towels along with the floor towel without replacing them with fresh ones Bathroom got semi flooded and we obviously had to wait until the next day as there is no house keeping after 5pm In other words it all comes down to the management which is simply taking advantage of its gay selling point , Rooftop bar 
273258,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This hotel is 90 Gay Only All of the reading materials wall art posters adverisments are for gays only Not family friendly Pool is very small and we were the only straight people there Most everyone was nice , Location was good rooms were clean 
273259,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooftop pool could stay open for chilling dipping in summer after 8pm perhaps to 10pm It still was really lovely up there , Everything was really good 
273260,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Location, Nice hotel with a great location Spa was a disappointment Steam room was out of order and pools weren t warm Looks like the spa should be great but just ok Bed was uncomfortable I could feel the springs poking through Rooftop bar was fun though crowd was a little full of themselves I probably won t stay here again but might visit the rooftop bar next time I m in town 
273261,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing, I am writing this review from the roof deck of the Axel Good enough that I am staying again On this occasion I arrived to find that my internet booking had not The hotel matched the rate and gave me an upgrade It s that sort of place And yes it is hetro friendly Great roof bar and pool best hotel gym I have encounted 
273262,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Small unpleasant smell in the bedroom Bedroom on the courtyard very dark crazy in Barcelona Swimming pool is minusculous whole look of the hotel is kind of dated, Great location in Example Front reception very helpful
273263,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The customer service at the pool and bar was absolutely terrible WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED No English tv channels Needs much better customer service we asked for the tv to be fixed as the channels were all fuzzy due to ariel connection and was told they would log it and maybe would be fixed the following day they need to accommodate the hotel guests as much as they accommodate the non hotel guests at the sky bar pool bar room deodorizer for the hotel foyer smells like a gay sauna as soon as you walk in , Things that I did like about Axel hotel was the room was comfortable the bed was large and comfortable the room was serviced daily 
273264,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Room did not get cleaned until after 4pm every day Breakfast very basic, Our Room had a Terrace and nice view Location excellent right in the middle of Eixample Very friendly staff
273265,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast was poor some eggs and desert which was very low quality It will be better for hotel not to serve breakfast at all or to serve the proper breakfast as it might be , I was on vacation with my girlfriend and stayed there for 2 nights Excellent staff they were very proffesional and helpful The room was quiet big and clean with the nice balcony 
273266,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, On check in clerk begins selling upgraded room which I refuse First room terrible Windowless overlooking inner smoking atrium dark and smoky Immediately return to frontdesk to enquire about the upgrade and am told since I used a towel I can t change rooms until the following day Constantly overheard receptionists trying to sell upgraded rooms to arriving guests Rooftop is crowded drinks significantly overpriced barstaff not the most attentive 10 minutes to get a drink on a crowded Friday night while bartenders doing shots with friends Corridors elevators dirty and need cleaning and updating Minibar charged but not used Hotel needs a good refreshing as it seems to be relying on its reputation rather than making an earnest effort at providing high quality four star accommodations , Great location The rooftop bar and pool is refreshing on a hot day Waterfall shower and bathroom clean modern and lots of hot water Very good lighting Comfortable bed and pillows Final room impressively located streetfront with great balcony no noise when window closed Cold fridge 
273267,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooms need to be updated with better user friendly design and refreshed decor For instance only had 1 tiny towel hook very small desk only 1 bed side table for a large 2 person room Did have hanging space but very little other place for clothes or suitcases other than on floor Needs more hooks towel racks bathroom counter space and more usable surfaces in the main room Also more plugs on both sides of the bed at the desk etc so many gadgets to charge when traveling , Great staff and rooms very clean Perfect location Room was nice sized and had a small balcony 
273268,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The hotel breakfast was an okay buffet style breakfast but not worth the 14 euros Instead walk about a block away to Brunch Cake for the best breakfast ever The hotel is surrounded by amazing restaurants that are like a block away enjoy , I loved my stay at Axel Barcelona And I can speak from my experience it is indeed heterofriendly As a solo female traveler I would highly recommend staying here I felt extremely comfortable and everyone staff and guests were extremely friendly I also feel like the hotel was in a great location in the city 
273269,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This hotel is a cheater with terrible staff and management I booked a premium room to this hotel and they gave me a regular one When we asked for a change they said to come next day when we get there next day we should come earlier Next day after arguing more than half an hour with an arrogant receptionist when we able to talk with some in charge they said the pictures of premium room in booking selected by an agency and they will change it I waited to write this appraisal two weeks if there was a real misunderstanding or they were cheating on tourists I saw that there is not any change be careful about this hotel Finally when they changed the room it was obvious that the room I paid 1 5 times greater than the ones they had me to stay There was not any money refund or apology They caused me almost half a day for everything It was one the worst hotel experience I have ever had ,No Positive
273270,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast was plentiful but mediocre the eggs and coffee were REALLY bad if you wanted different eggs or an espresso for instance it was extra Drinks overpriced especially at daytime Pool towels not always available Lounges at pool scarce due to locals not pool guests Jacuzzi was cool never even warm Pool was COLD Spa is a waste of time and money It was extra , The staff
273271,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Takes a little while to get used to the timings that food is available , Great location and lovely facilities especially the roof top pool bar area Hetero friendly 
273272,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Under 18s couldn t use the gym My son has left school though he wasn t able to use it even when attended by an adult , Excellent location staff polite and helpful Breakfast had excellent choices 
273273,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Soundproof this hotel please To be woken up in the early hours by a hetero couple screaming in the throes of orgasm was supremely tacky and worthy of a flop house not a luxury hotel Improve the breakfast Come on you must know it is pretty awful with all the complaints Can t you make decent coffee and eggs Jeez louize , Loved the Skybar and the gym Bed was fine and comfy Nice refurbished room with balcony 
273274,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, even though I honestly didn t have anything from the minibar at all upon checking out they tried to charge me for 2 bottles of champagne This was a great shame and left a bitter feeling I am so careful and always take my own things to drink Everyone knows the price of minibar items is ridiculous I d stay here again but I ll get reception to empty the minibar straightaway to avoid any false charges and agro, The location roof top pool and bar are great 
273275,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The fact that when we booked this hotel the breakfast was included When we turn up we found out it wasn t like that , Stuff and the place were amazing
273276,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The lifts seem to have a mind of their own and the skybar could do with a few more members of staff The man working there seemed under a lot of pressure Also although the roof terrace is great for sun There is a distinct lack of shade , I had a fantastic stay we were upgraded on arrival to a room with a view of the city The staff on the whole were happy polite and very helpful The spa was brilliant Well worth the 10 We didn t realise it was a gay hotel This however was no problem As a straight couple we didn t feel like it was ever a problem And all guests were very friendly 
273277,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The lack of real coffee at breakfast The instant kind just doesn t wake me up that well , Bedrooms are very nice and very clean It s in the middle of all the have to see it sights 
273278,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Again the breakfast could use improvement , This is my 4th time in 2 years Another great experience Top marks for Alexandra and Dani and of course the other receptionists I dealt with Thank you for you professionalism and friendliness Also clean room and a great gym and spa 
273279,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, All round great, We were 2 straight girls that stayed at this hotel and I must say we was made to feel very welcome and would highly recommend staying there The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very modern Thank you very much 
273280,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Late check in as room wasn t ready, Beautiful large suite Recently refurbished and shows it Great gym Good breakfast Pablo in the Sky Bar are all Medellin boys as gorgeous as this guy who makes a killer mojito
273281,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The decoration of the hotel is out date , The best of this hotel is Dani at the reception such a nice welcome with an amazing smile and always prompt to help It s always good to be greated every morning with a nice smile and called by your name That s the kind of reception you should have in the best hotels 
273282,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The only thing we did not like was leaving to go home , The rooms were cleaner every day to a very high standard with fresh sheets and clean towels everyday And the staff were extremely friendly at reception the cleaning staff and bar staff Everything was great 
273283,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, glass door in wc and shower D, Nice view from balcony and nice balcony in Premium numbers but glass door in WC that is not closing completely is not the best solution some people prefer more privacy in wc breakfasts were quite good but everyday the same But we could recommend this hotel to others 
273284,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, next time they should tell me that it is a gay hotel every where you been confronted with naked pictures of men too much sex oriented , very nice an quite room good design
273285,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The hotel is hetero friendly I was travelling with my mother who is 70 she is old style I was not expecting to see posters advertisement and videos on all tv showing Gay man in bikinis massaging each other I respect Gay people however this was to much for me I didn t feel comfortable there ,No Positive
273286,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, this is a gay people hotel Booking website did not inform us that it is a Hotel specifically for gay people where sexual pictures and nude guys pictures are all over the lobby elevators rooms and everywhere The hotel is not as per standard for a 4 stars hotel at all The place smelled bad and the furniture was old The entire time i felt that the place is very dirty one of my billow has stains Breakfast was not good at all And the cancellation is 100 for TWO nights shows that they get a high probability of people wanting to cancel thier reservation Wanted an iron one night and they told me they ran out of irons I actually was eager to check out as soon as possible , The staff were great very helpful and nice 
273287,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Too many ads posters etc with semi nude men I absolutely love the gay friendliness but a bit more subtlety would be appreciated , Bathroom is very very comfortable and spacious Separated toilet from shows area is highly valued 
273288,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Asked for a twin bed on booking online and when I arrived we had 2 joined beds I called reception and they told me they didn t have any room with twin beds however the next day when returning to my bedroom in the afternoon the beds where separated Also after requesting a taxi to the airport on the morning of departure for the evening we waited 15 min and taxi never came We had to get one outside hotel on the street Otherwise staff was mostly friend and nice , The location Close to most places Walking distance 
273289,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Beds feel a bit tired already Rooms overlooking Montaner can be quite noisy, The breakfast buffet is delicious and well stocked with spanish traditional delicacies
273290,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Need to ask cleaning staff to help change used towels Also it will be nice to have some coffee some small spoons to make a hot drink , Friendly staff great location for first time visitor to BCN walking distance to casa mila and many nice places end up walking for 3 days around the city many good food around too Also booked the place with a gym and it was nice Did not used the spa though Received a upgrade to a bigger room which was very nice and able to see the street 
273291,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, On the first day we complained about the noisy bathroom door Nothing happend On the second day my tablet got stolen from the closed hotel room No apology no complimentary drink no advice how to behave On the third day the music was so loud we could not sleep We did not complain as we left anyway the other day We will never stay in this hotel or any hotel of Axel chain again and suggest you to do likewise ,No Positive
273292,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooms are not great value for the money They re okay and the beds are comfortable But there is no closet space and the bathroom is a bad design There is no housekeeping service after 5pm a glass broke in my room and the desk manager offered to give me a broom so I could sweep up the glass myself The breakfast was horrible The whole gay hotel seems to have been designed by some tasteless straight interior decorator thinking that they know what gay men like so that they could capture the gay dollar Because no gay man designed it it s just poor all the way around ,No Positive
273293,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Over priced drinks poor standard of rooftop bar low quality breakfast No kettle in room Had to pay extra for the spa , Staff were very friendly and helpful We had trouble with our key cards using the lifts the staff were great sorting them out especially when we got stuck in the lift 
273294,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, 9 hours after settling the final bill at the reception upon checking out I received a notification from my bank stating that an extra amount was charged over my credit card by the hotel I wrote to the hotel to inquiry and they replied to me saying that the Cleaning Staff has found missing items in the mini fridge I wrote back to them stating that I haven t used the mini bar at all during my stay but the hotel wrote back insisted that the items was missing and I should incur the charges 9 hours after checking out I didn t make a big deal out of it because the amount charged wasn t big However this ruined any good experience i had in the hotel ,No Positive
273295,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Great location but it s all I would not advise anyone to go there It s just a way to rip off gays They overcharge for everything There is a fitness centre but before even touch the machine you have someone from the staff warning you about everything They ask you to read a list of rules and sign it The gym is okay but it s nothing that precious that one can touch Then at the reception when you check in they warn you that after 5pm no one will clean the room I feel the whole Axel experience is very unfriendly 
273296,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The bar area was extremely dark and not in use or we certainly didn t see staff in there and no customers Bad lighting in the bedrooms especially if you wanted to read Nowhere to sit except on bed , The location
273297,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, This hotel is only suitable for gay men We arrived late to find there are pictures of mostly naked men all around the hotel and the online description is purposely misleading Adverts for massages all around the hotel felt very seedy Checked out immediately the next day ,No Positive
273298,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The only thing I would say is in rooms one big light on the wall was not working and we could hear people in the bathroom next to us Also marks on the walk and the patterns in furnishings where not dated just not very nice or very up to date Breakfast a little pricey at 14 30 pp , Location was fantastic within walking distance of almost everything Would not fault location The staff were friendly and helpful Spacious room with nice shower and bathroom space Balcony was nice too We are a heterosexual couple and still felt comfortable staying here and we felt welcome here so I would not hesitate to stay again I would recommend a stay here 
273299,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Minor inconvenience for me but there are 4 or 5 steps down as soon as you enter the main door so not good for people with limited mobility There may be another entrance for wheelchairs but it wasn t obvious The elevators and the area next to them in the lobby are dark but I think it is intended to evoke a mood , I am not gay but I thought it wonderful that this hotel is a safe and welcoming place for people that might other experience discrimination elsewhere I wish them every success Location is good as it is just two blocks away from one of the stops that the airport bus makes and a few minutes walk to the main tourist strip 
273300,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, breakfast was really poor booking com did not inform us that this was a GAY hotel very in your face as its advertised every where in the hotel slightly seedy No tea or coffee making facilities in the room shower room looks directly into the bedroom drinks on the roof bar very expensive the spa is chargeable at 10 euros per person per visit and you advertised this as included GAY SPA very noisy at night time, the staff were very friendly and a very good location good local restaurants
273301,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, There was a strange noise coming from the bathroom it sounded like a bucket of water was being poured in the toilet at random times I thought there was a ghost The drinks at the bar were really expensive , Staff very friendly the rooftop jacuzzi was warm and the facilities were good We ate breakfast once and the restaurant was really nice The bar on the roof was cool Also very close to brewdog bar We walked to the beach in about 30 minutes 
273302,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Our premium room was extremely small there was little space to put stuff away no wardrobe Decor and furnishing cheap and tacky zero taste Breakfast boring stale bread limited choice Not worth the money for sure , Location was excellent bed comfy That s all I can be excited about
273303,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, It s not the best value for money And pretty drab for a four star Plus I found it quite noisy the double glazing isn t very effective However staff were nice , The check in was good and I got a free upgrade 
273304,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, They call themselves Gay Hotel so why do gays have to run away from drunk and very aggressive straight Russians with their girlies and several bottles of hooch in the Whirlpool This happened twice on two days before they shut down the pool sorry for the inconvenience Obviously policies stop here at money too Breakfast is simply a joke Coffee and Tea are cold and just undrinkable bread is dry like sawdust Fried eggs Voil 4 50 Sign it before you eat it The smell in the Bath is overwhelming you ll need a good stomach And forget to sleep Beds are hard as wood and the motor of the whirlpool is running the whole night above your head We measured it 68 decibel Though we think that most of customers stay there for other reasons and to spend as always too much money ,No Positive

273314,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Checking out we were wrongly accused of consuming alcohol coke from minibar I had to argue my case The receptionist on duty could ve handled this better We were at the mercy of housekeeping staff who thankfully double checked confirmed no items were missing , The young man who checked us in was very friendly explained everything so well and very kindly upgraded us to a premier room The room was very comfortable excellent design and spacious It gave us some ideas on designing our house The location meant La Ramblas and most restaurants bars were within walking distance I agree it is a heterofriendly hotel

273336,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The hotel needs renovation On the lower floors this has begun and so the hotel may be in better shape in a few months The fittings in the room are all getting a bit shabby and need repair The maid service is rudimentary and they should do better Leaving dust on the floor in full sight is just sloppy The bar is nothing special but seems to be quite popular The television is very limited In other Axel hotels there are movies and series to watch or rent here nothing except basic cable The idea that there is a charge for the spa if you don t book a treatment is kind of astounding At the normal rack rates that is unacceptable , The Hotel is a hetero friendly Hotel in The Gay neighborhood so the location is good Actually location is the best aspect of the hotel at this point The Decor is modern in style The staff was friendly and mostly helpful The spa is nicely designed The bar on the rooftop is fine I was upgraded free of charge to a suite which was nice Quite a large room with living room on the top floor The room was comfortable if a bit shabby see next paragraph All in all an OK to Good experience

273339,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rooms are so 2010 The building was under construction during my stay so I think management have read all the bad tripadvisor comments from summer 15 and have decided to pump some millions of euros to refresh the rooms looking forward to visit in summer 16 Don t forget about the lobby , Excellent customer service Sky bar looks great location is amazing didn t have to use metro at all Obviously the whole idea leading all hotel group is amazing and that s one of the main reasons I ve chosen this place 
273340,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing I d always try and stay here, Beautiful hotel well situated in Barcelona Loved the rooms They are quite intimate which I like Staff are very friendly and cute which is always nice
273341,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I did not like the cooperation with your stuff specially the ketchen stuff because they as money without any thing inside the breakfast special iam Muslim and I did not find to eat and I ask 4 eggs they ask me more money 12 uro for what I did not know, I like the location
273342,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I booked for a big bedroom for as we were a couple and they gave us a two small beds put in together We couldn t even sleep together because the beds will split apart at the moment we move We tryed to get changed the room but they told us that I had to pay more it s not about the money But I booked a matrimonial bedroom and already payed for it The Internet connection was very poor The room oldfashioned style I mean maybe this hotel was chic at the 90 s But come on guys we re already 2016 and for the prices you ve got for a night I can get better rooms and the worst thing ever is to see how dirty are the carpet on the aisle on the way to the rooms Awful , There was only one guy of the staff who was really nice and helpful with us when we arrived we also like the sky bar That s all

273344,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, when asked for an extra cover as it was cold at night they said they could not offer me another I had a hard time sleeping as I was cold cover was on the thin side partner pulls for himself all night I thought asking for an additional cover would be a simple request but apparently for them This was unheard of the staff at the spa gym were extremely annoying and we did not feel welcome when interacting with them breakfast was poorly served and unappetizing we were charged for an upgrade to our room and received a room with literally a brick wall view this hotel is in desperate need for a renovation The facilities look dated and old ,No Positive

273357,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Breakfast is boring No spanish food at all Price quality range is off Its a 3 star hotel with 5 star prices Especially in the Sky bar, The athmosphere in the hotel was good and most things are in walking distance from the hotel Like cultural things but also bars and restaurants
273358,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I didn t know that the hotel is a gay friendly hotel when I booked on booking I preferred to know this before paying 100 euro night , The location of the hotel the roof with the pool and bar
273359,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We were unfortunately given a rather tiny room with absolutely no daylight so it truly felt like a prison Lots of cracked tiles in the bathroom , The location is great and very handy for a city trip

273361,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, The Axel is and excellently situated hotel Walk to everything including the Sagrada Bars and restaurants in abundance and as with all of Barcelona the food is extraordinary around this hotel Great basement gym and the roof top bar is special This is a gay hotel which is straight friendly and anyone going to Barcelona should give it a thought 
273362,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, The rate is too high for the overall quality of the hotel it is easy to get lost when going down to the restaurant as well as finding your way to reception from there Too many elevator shafts so easy to get turned around and the aforementioned receptionist We were checked in by a trainee and a lady from reservations both chapeau but the other person present could not be even bothered to smile , The location their roof top terrace bar most of the staff were very welcoming and open to help one of the receptionists I would most definitely relocate to both another department and a different field of work the bed was extremely comfortable and both my partner and I he joined me last minute and this was not a challenge in any form or way felt very welcome In addition the bottle of sparkling sent up as the request of an exterior room plus a wait for our room could not be met was a great detail on pat of the Hotel

273366,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, As a gay hotel my first afternoon was exposed to 90 female customers I thought I d paid twice the price of the straight hotel next door to move onto yet another straight hotel The straight women and couples I was surrounded by seemed completely unaware of it being a gay hotel they were being welcomed into I felt I could Not just be me which was the point of booking, Centrally located and potentially great facilities
273367,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We stayed in a suite 702 which we expected to be luxurious however it was badly in need of refurbishment Overall we were disappointed , Staff were very friendly Location was good 
273368,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We took a suite and the walk way was so narrow we walked in the glass door all the time When I asked to be moved they mentioned at reception hotel is fully booked yet ok booking com I seen available rooms I did not want my money back but wanted a comfortable room as we kept hurting ourself in the glass door , Location of Hotel
273369,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, We stayed in a suite which we expected to be luxurious however it was badly in need of refurbishment There was a constant drone from the ceiling possibly the motor for the pool on the roof which was right above us Room wasn t particularly well cleaned A chlorine smell permeated the corridors Overall we were disappointed , Staff were very friendly Location was good

273372,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, i stayed several times in this hotel but this time i took a suite wasn t happy with delay on cleaning the room in the 7 days i stayed i had to ask 6 times Can some one please clean my Room usually i had to stay 6 to 7 hours out of the hotel and come back and find the room not cleaned i complained 2 times their excuse is the Suite floor don t have many rooms and cleaning people are on other floors , the staff were excellent the rooms were nice cozy

273375,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, the room and especially the bathroom are little bit out of date the cleaning of the bathroom should be definitely improved you can t open the curtains and have to stay always with artificial lights on otherwise no privacy at all, good position
273376,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing in mind , Very friendly staff got an unexpected upgrade which was great the location is perfect the bar at the top is fun as well All in all great experience 
273377,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Room 518 a small quiet room in the back courtyard facing a corrugated iron with little natural light Stain on duvet toilet roll handle coming off the wall extremely bad TV reception The shower glass door is faulty and did not slide well The dark corridor and carpet worst for wear Wifi was bad Room 611 the bathroom switch was faulty , Good location 
273378,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I wish the blankets on the beds were thicker The thing blankets and the cold AC made it difficult to sleep , The facilities amenities are excellent 
273379,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, To low staffed in peak hours both in reception and in the Sky bar Running out of wine one day and not solve it either same day or latest to the day after is not what I expect from a hotel where I pay this much for the hotel and for the wine Maintenance of the hotel is disappointing A bit run down I would say Jacuzzi only partly functioning roof top terrace and the sun chairs are run down Move of the experienced waiters from Axel to the new hotel have changed the atmosphere to the worse , Perfectly situated for the Gay traveler
273380,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, nothing to complain, another pleasant stay our second in the middle of Eixample value for money ratio quite good for Barclelona conditions friendly helpful staff
273381,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I felt the price was a little expensive If it was about 500 less on a 7 night stay it would have been perfect , I liked having a weight room in the building The Sky Bar in the building was very nice I enjoyed the gay friendly atmosphere It is conveniently located near a lot of gay night life as well as a lot of Barcelona sites 
273382,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, First of all our room wasn t ready for check in We had to wait until 3 30PM to check in The room was too small for 2 people to stay in The air conditioning wasn t working properly when we first arrived The toilet seat was too adjacent to the wall next to it Althought we have requested a high floor the check in counter put us on the second floor The staff were too overwhelmed and not friendly to welcome us or even listen to our requests The room phone cant call the reception or house keeping , The location of the hotel 
273383,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Service at the roof bar dreadful One night the barman was moving seats around Asked him to refresh our drinks only to be told we would need to wait 20minutes for a barman Then he finished moving the seating and then went behind the bar to serve us In other words it was more important for him to move seats than to serve waiting customers Needless to say we went elsewhere Also got back to the room 4 40pm room not made up On arrival at 4pm room not ready Generally felt customers were an inconvenience to the staff The rooms and d cor tired look like it hasn t been decorated for 10yrs , Location was good good to have the roof bar and terrace

273387,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only,No Negative, Ok I probably have high expectations and after a few years multiple stays in this hotel it s beginning to look a little tired round the edges That said I would still highly rate this place Booked in advance you can get a really good rate for a superior room with an amazing balcony in the centre of Barcelona The room was clean and quiet with a very comfortable bed Breakfast was above average for the price of the room If you like weight training fitness the gym in the basement is outstanding for any hotel We enjoyed our stay and would recommend the Axel hotel to friends 
273388,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, I am just not accustomed to such a tiny bed it was a twin and that s unusual these days but perfectly doable The cleaning staff is a bit slow at getting the rooms done and complete with towels , I loved the staff he other hotel guests the location the bar and the general atmosphere of the hotel was great 
273389,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, its all a bit faded and needs a refurb Reception desk under staffed and perhaps a little bit snobby Need to be more friendly , the bedroom was good nice shower and very large comfortable bed

273394,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, It s was quite expensive for that hotel maybe because it was during the Circuit or something like that but the price was high for that hotel In my opinion the breakfast has to be richer than what they exposed But I really liked the hotel , I liked the room and the place where it is A very good location and beautiful room The staff was really nice 
273395,Axel Hotel Barcelona Urban Spa Adults Only, Nothing everything whas horrible first of all the hotel did not say that it is a gay hotel and also they put pictures that they show on booking that are not true at all everything is a scam , Nothing everything whas horrible its a scam
