92589,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, Appeared to have been recently refurbished to a good standard very clean and tidy Was slightly nervous looking at the pictures of available rooms in the price range at other hotels on the night of my stay but I needn t have worried The room was perfect for what I was after which was somewhere clean to rest my head after a concert Would happily stay there again if I m in the area very reasonable price considering it had an en suite 
92590,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing, Very friendly staff near the tube station I was attending the Depeche Mode concert at the Olympic stadium on my own It was the night of the terrorist attack at London bridge Although we were not near the incident staff were very helpful with me being on my own reassuring and checking I was ok 
92591,Old Ship Inn Hackney, They didn t have room service or an elevator But the winding staircase is charming , The decor of the room was very simple yet unique It was a very cozy space that was supremely comfortable 
92592,Old Ship Inn Hackney, It was super hot when I stayed and had the windows open My room was at the front of the pub so there was a little bit of noise from below for a couple of hours in the evening Didn t bother me but worth noting , Brilliant location really nice pub and rooms very comfy and recently decorated Great value for money 
92593,Old Ship Inn Hackney, No fan in very hot weather no hairdryer in the room so bring your own I had to bring my car as I was travelling elsewhere the next day I would not recommend bringing the car as you will be reliant on finding parking The hotel is a stones throw from Hackney Central overground so easy to get to via public transport , Location was central room was freshly decorated and spotlessly clean An ideal hotel if you are attending any event at the Olympic Stadium
92594,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The staircase was grotty and smelly getting to room Room like a sauna with no air con or fan Bed uncomfortable Carpet in room old and dirty , Room was ok
92595,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, I found the property very central and easy to get to Lots of local shops and restaurants within walking distance The room was very quaint cosy and clean The staff were friendly and helpful 
92596,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Room 5 had trickling water noise all night from some boxed in pipework and an extractor fan on the roof outside, Quality sausages on the breakfast always makes a difference
92597,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Not much info by the staff on Parking The Sofa Bed in the room is to big as when erected as there was 3 of us you could not move around at all Be aware the Pub Closes at 1am on Saturdays You could hear quite a lot of noise in our room , The Ambiance and location of this Hotel was Great Good food Room was Clean and decorated very well Would def go back and stay if I was visiting that part of London again 
92598,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Hackney central very noisy area and quite run down in parts so could be a bit intimidating to visitors from overseas , Very central location Nice friendly pub and hotel Clean room and good food available downstairs
92599,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Liked everything, Very welcoming good pub restaurant very good vibes everything u need like coffee tea water is in the room I loved it Excellent location in Hackney close to all public transports Close to pubs and restaurants Upcoming new district in London very recommendable 
92600,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Noise of kitchen extractor fan running continuously throughout the night this was accompanied by the smell of cooked food that had been extracted until the early hours of the morning Continuous sound of water in the boxed in pipework didn t help in getting a good nights sleep , Excellent breakfast bathroom as new room ok Access to room being via bar I was somewhat apprehensive my local is a country pub the bar pub somewhat shabby chic style with emphasis on shabby Atmosphere in the evening excellent and a good range of real ales My concerns soon waned 
92601,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I put the do not disturb sign on my room as I didn t want my room made up and when I came home in the evening it had been done with my things moved around and my carrier bags which I needed thrown away , It was a two minute walk from Hackney Central tube station 
92602,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I was very much looking forward to staying at the Ship Inn but there is so much wrong with the hotel part of this property I was really disappointed My room had one of the most uncomfortable beds I have slept on for decades Re the bathroom there were already items in the bathroom bin when I entered the room the spare toilet roll was a partially used roll and the shower sliding doors did not close properly The bathroom was overall clean but the shower cubicle could do with a good scrub as there is quite a bit of limescale Re the room itself the sockets on one side of the room did not work the TV remote control did not work and half of the commands on the TV itself didn t either It was full of dust under the side lamp by the bed The kettle did not switch itself off when boiling water and the milk was past is use by date Definitely overpriced for the quality of accommodation provided , The bar staff is very nice and friendly Great choice of drinks in the pub I was initially a bit put off by the fact that they show football matches on screen but this pub is organised in such a clever way that it does not affect patrons not interested in football I got a room at the back which was very quiet Location is exactly what I was looking for 
92603,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I know London prices are expensive but it did seem a bit expensive for just a night although the price of the full breakfast was reasonable I did not have it so no knowledge of quality I suggest chucking in a free cup of coffee and a croissant would make it feel better value at little cost to the provider The entrance off Mare St was a bit daunting along a short dark alley with an inebriated chap sitting on the step at the door of the pub but in fact it was not a problem The stairs up to the rooms were a bit tatty but the room itself was fine , The single room was simple but comfy and clean and quiet looking out on the alley Plenty of tea bags and coffee sachets I got extra milk from the bar in the morning I didn t have a drink or meal but the interior of the pub looked inviting Staff seemed very friendly and laid back Much more character than a cheap chain hotel I would go back especially it was slightly cheaper Plenty of buses on the door step 
92604,Old Ship Inn Hackney, so noisey the pub is just under the room and you got the music until 1 am in your room including bass frequences in the morning you got various noises of the hotel all around its a nightmare plus on a sunday at 10h30 after that bad sleep they just cant serve you a breakfast anymore in the pub what a joke it is ridiculous , very small but nice and comfortable room good recent bathroom 
92605,Old Ship Inn Hackney, No real tea in room just fruit tea bags Homeless woman sleeping in corridor outside our room She was well known to staff so happens frequently ,No Positive
92606,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing, One of the best places I ve stayed for the price Friendly staff clean room perfect location It has the benefits of a laid back pub hotel atmosphere but with cleanliness and modern quirky room decor of a boutique hotel 
92607,Old Ship Inn Hackney, a Access the stairs to the first floor were very steep b No power points by the bed I am forced to use a CPAP machine and had problems plugging it in c Holes in the duvet cover d Noise in the alleyway next to the Hotel, Room was large and included a sofa and small table The bathroom was well appointed but I did have difficulty in accessing the bath because it had been recessed into an alcove and could only be entered by climbing in the end of the bath
92608,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, Very convenient location for my needs Friendly staff Room not luxurious but adequate had all that I needed and was clean and comfortable Loved spending time in the bar restaurant and just being able to go upstairs to bed Good selection for breakfast but coffee was cold that might be my fault for going down for breakfast at the last minute 
92609,Old Ship Inn Hackney, As above the pub it might get a little noisy in summer if you leave the window open Was not a problem during my stay with the window closed , Great location within a couple of minutes from Hackney Central comfy modern bedroom and friendly staff Very good value for money 
92610,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nobody there when we wanted to check out Website gives wrong times for bar says it shuts at midnight when it shuts very promptly at 11 in fact I was made to feel uncomfortable when ordering drinks at 10 45 , Room was comfortable and bathroom nice Tea and coffee making facilities No traffic noise as room overlooks a pedestrian passageway Close to bus stop and Hackney Central Overground station 
92611,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Room very small even for a single Hard to find corridor light switches in dark Room overheated and couldn t turn radiator down , Good position value for money for area
92612,Old Ship Inn Hackney, My only slight complaint was that my room was next to the kitchen extractor fan which was a little noisy, Excellent location the staff were really friendly the breakfast was cooked to order and was excellent As a lone traveller it had a good and friendly atmosphere about the place
92613,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The fry up was a little bit overpriced The stairs are steep and narrow so not accessible for mobility impaired people , The continental breakfast was simple but nice and the coffee was great 
92614,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Bathroom was a little rough around the edges floor tiles need replacing but everything was clean and tidy , Excellent location well placed for public transport cafes and bars Very comfortable bed 
92615,Old Ship Inn Hackney, When I entered the room I found it extremely small and the heating was full on tried opening the window to sleep better and not suffocate the room was right above the pub s entrance and the noise of people smocking and laughing right under my window was impossible Beside I slept very badly all night once the street noise settled down the noise started behind my door either people coming back late or leaving early the sound of squeaking wooden floor was intolerable and kept me awake since 5 30 am My single bed was so soft and springy it felt like sleeping on a bouncy castle To finalise I was asked to check out at 10am although most hotels let you use the room until midday Totally disappointed to be most honest with you The chap at the reception was friendly enough but never gave me the internet code and was working from behind the bar during football night so I could hardly hear what he was telling me , very clean also the green psychedelic wallpaper quite a modern touch
92616,Old Ship Inn Hackney, We arrived at 15 00 and the rooms were not ready the duvet cover in my room was damp The other residents on my floor were very inconsiderate and noisy throughout the night The breakfast came with salad why oh why , Not a lot 
92617,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Room was advertised as a family room but they just shoehorned a second bed into the room leaving absolutely no space to move No shower curtain meant water went all over the bathroom No toilet brush No comment Bathroom tiles were coming away Creaky floorboards , Location was close to overground station Pub downstairs was great good food and fun 
92618,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The room no5 was really great but it got a bit warm for us I had turned the radiator off , A great Sunday roast lunch friendly and helpful staff great location for Olympic Velodrome 
92619,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, The location was fab Staff friendly Room ideal for one Lighting on stairs poor and enterence and hall way stairs needed a revamp as it did not reflect the rooms As above
92620,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Be aware that downstairs is a very popular pub and noise from the pub can be heard to the rooms until late especially on weekends , Excellent location and good travel connections Nicely decorated room Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent breakfast 
92621,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Rooms could be bigger but that s being picky hey this is London Cleanliness friendliness outwayed this minor observation , Rooms were contemporary very clean Ace shower The staff were all friendly really helpful We stayed on a busy Saturday night lots of people eating but we were looked after our food was really really good The vibe was chilled Great location for Hackney Empire the surrounding area indie boutiques flower market etc We re runners we found a good one hour run through local parks so lots of green space nearby too All in all a fab weekend 
92622,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Health and safety poor Fire alarm went off at midnight but nobody else in building to advise lucky no fire Had made our exit down winding stairs from top room Phoned 3 contact numbers but no response , Room was clean with comfy bed Nice bathroom
92623,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing other than the fire smoke alarm going off at 5 30am which was out of the hotels control however the time it took to let us know if it was a real fire or a test should have been quicker We had to work out for ourselves procedures should probably be checked to mitigate any other risk in the future However would definitely recommend even if it meant burning in my bed , The breakfast was amazing Best eggs in ever eaten Staff upon welcome breakfast waitress service bar service and departure was second to none Rooms atmosphere food was excellent would definitely stay again Great value for money close to central London and perfect for our business trip where we needed six separate rooms Would Highly recommend and will definitely be staying again in the future 
92624,Old Ship Inn Hackney, It was a little noisy It seems like they ve partially renovated but left some things out Stingy with linens , It has personality The pub is open late Good value 
92625,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Not obvious entrance if you just use postcode as main entrance is on street behind main one use street name address instead Also general Hackney comment Train into City is rammed at rush hour so factor that in , Food was great dinner and breakfast limited menu but tasty Really handy for Hackney Central Room I had was spacious and staff friendly 
92626,Old Ship Inn Hackney, We arrived late at night with our bags and the bar was busy which was a little frustrating getting to the reception check in , The food is excellent and good value The bar itself has a lot of character and is querky in a pleasing way although I have no doubt that others may not like the appeal The room was fantastic Don t be put off walking up the backstairs it s a bar but the room was excellent from the bed bathroom and decor 
92627,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Corridor between the reception and room feels a bit like the back of house of the pub but don t let this worry you about the standard of your room everything else was spot on , You are never sure what you are going to get when booking on the internet but the whole experience has been really good The pub itself has loads of character with friendly staff and a good range of drinks and although I never ate there the food looked really good and the price was reasonable The room was nicely decorated clean and tidy with everything you needed Internet worked really well and the TV was a nice addition All in all excellent 
92628,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, These days when I go to London I want to stay in Hackney as my daughter lives there with her boyfriend And this place is virtually just a minute s walk away from her place You can either enter through the pub or through the hotel entrance at the back Fairly informal and relaxed atmosphere which is something I personally really like The Old Ship Inn is just around the corner from Hackney Empire and on Mare Street or around the back from Sylvester Path This time around I arrived really late but there was no problem whatsoever for my daughter to pick up the key for me Great service Stairs were a bit narrow and winding but hey It s the back of a pub and the rooms are on top of that very pub I like it Gives it a quaint and personal feel Only thing was that I didn t quite know how to get out in the morning but there was a button just slightly beside the door that I didn t see Not right AT the door but near it Anyway This was no biggie and I got out from the staircase and into the pub for breakfast I had a full English breakfast and it was simply to die for No black pudding but still extremely good Really good The girl at the counter had some problems understanding English but she did her best and seemed friendly The room was towards the back of the house where there s a rather narrow street which means people residing on the other side of it are able to look into your room should they choose to and vice versa of course I didn t think this was a problem at all as the window was frosted but if you want more privacy Creaky floors but to me again it gives it that quaint and personal feeling Also shows that it has history Once I was awake I could hear the creaking of the hallway as people passed but it really wasn t anything that disturbed me There are far more disturbing noises all around London traffic police cars lorries screaming druggies and drunkards and what have you 
92629,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I reported that my partner s necklace was missing This was placed in her bag the night we arrived I witnessed it When we arrived home it wasn t there The manager rang me back and said the housemaid was on her day off and he would interview her personally on Tuesday and ring me back I have not yet heard from him I did report that the housemaids young son accompanied her when she was servicing the room I appreciate that this is a difficult situation but he should really have contacted me by now ,No Positive
92630,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, Friendly Helpful Staff Clean comfortable tidy rooms with trendy d cor Great location easily accessible to shops parks and transport links Great food including the freshly made English Breakfast The accommodation has its own personality alternate experience being connected with its vibrant casual pub restaurant 
92631,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, The buses pull up directly at the door of the hotel so it s a super convenient location you couldn t ask for more friendly helpful staff and even the coffee was great 
92632,Old Ship Inn Hackney, TV wasn t working one of the bedside lights wasn t working and especially room next to a generator that was running after midnight , tidy room decent breakfast 
92633,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Stairs a problem if you have poor mobility Simple breakfast no choice , Easy access to to tube Not too far to central London Staff helpful Pub has some good craft beers
92634,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Very small room and narrow single bed Tired decor furniture had seen better days The floor nooks and crannies not clean Creaking floorboards Very little choice at breakfast , Friendly and helpful staff Quiet at night Less expensive than some places nearby 
92635,Old Ship Inn Hackney, When we arrived the room hadn t been cleaned just tidied up to look like it had been They were very apologetic and gave us a free drink whilst we waited for it to be sorted out The room was hot and noisy , The staff weren t really on top of things eg cleaning rooms not knowing what there was available for breakfast however they were exceptionally friendly and were quick to help when they realised there was a problem 
92636,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The rooms were too hot but we managed to overcome any noise from the open window because we were so tired , We needed a relaxing and comfortable overnight stay as we were attending a nearby festival the room fit that bill Staff were friendly and attentive 
92637,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I can honestly say there was nothing I disliked about this place The only thing I can think of is the fact that there are quite a few stairs up to the rooms The stairs are quite narrow and may not be suitable for someone with a disability, I have been staying in London at various different locations and hotels over the last two years and I have to say this has been by far one of my favourites I was somewhat apprehensive about the accommodation being above a pub however there was no noise or music that I could hear from my room The room itself was much more spacious than I had thought and the bed was really comfortable Not only was the stay at Old Ship inn really enjoyable the hospitality of the staff there was amazing they bent over backwards to help me in the morning by printing off some documentation I needed I cannot thank the staff at Old Ship inn enough for their kindness In the morning I was made a full English breakfast which was delicious All in all a really enjoyable experience Thank you Old ship inn 
92638,Old Ship Inn Hackney,No Negative, The staff were just great and very accommodating Room cosy squeaky floorboards but we coped Great brekky and could asked what we would like cooked Enjoyed our stay as it was so close to trains etc gorgeous English Inn we would stay again 
92639,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Booking information held by venue stated that I was not expected until the day AFTER I had booked and family room I had reserved was not available for the 26th An available double room was given instead Fortunately my son who was to share the room with me was delayed until breakfast time so the fact that it was a double room was fortuitously not an issue I was given a partial refund for the smaller room , Good breakfast and staff eager to please and to make it an experience to remember Room very clean with good facilities 
92640,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing at all , Everything really but especially the staff so obliging and really helpful In addition the freshly cooked English breakfast was superb my compliments to the chef 
92641,Old Ship Inn Hackney, No extra toilet rolls And only an almost finished one in the toilet Also the lead for the kettle to the plug socket was so short it could easily have led to an accident , The staff we re friendly and the pun was nice 
92642,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The sofa bed in the room was all ripped there was no bath mat and no spare toilet roll was a bit noise has a motor bike kept driving up and down quite late in the night apart from that it was good, Room was comfortable and good facilities breakfast was lovely
92643,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Access is poor Some staff were unhelpful Rooms are noisy and cramped Lacking in facilities eg broken kettle and no cot available so we had to take our own Only one member of staff offered to help with taking the buggy up the narrow winding stairs ,No Positive
92644,Old Ship Inn Hackney, We had to leave early 7 00 a m on Sunday which was within the checkout times Although we had told the staff we wouldn t want the full breakfast we had ask for coffee and toast None were available The cleaning staff was in but that was all No one was available to check us out and when someone did call they told us it was all taken care of Upon checking my credit card I found that the charges had been made as agreed upon but they had been processed 48 hours BEFORE our anticipated check in Our booking agreement stated we had until 24 hours before to cancel without a charge and we would not be charged until we reached our accommodate In this case it wasn t an issue but not very good business , We were very close the train stations great access to bus stops We needed a place in the Hackney area and the Inn fit the bill We were very pleased with the layout and cleanliness of the room The full English breakfast was included and was served by friendly staff The food at the pub below is great as is the music and the beer 
92645,Old Ship Inn Hackney, There ia a narrow stairscase to the second floor but they offered to help with all our luggage , The staff were extremely accommodating We arrived at 11am knowing that we needed to get ready for a wedding Our room was waiting for us Liked the tea coffee and water in the room Even had hair straightners 
92646,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The room was very good value but constant air conditioning noise all night think that was why it was cheaper , Good location and comfortable accommodation and ideal location for our visit 
92647,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Hackney is not my favourite part of London and the cost was quite high , Comfortable room in a room above a decent pub in the centre of Hackney The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean 
92648,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Admittedly the staircase at the rear could be awkward for some but that is a quirk of an old building The cooked breakfast in the morning could have been a bit hotter but if you notice no one serves on hot plates now probably due to health and safety and spurious claims to being burned Apart from that it was good , The pub downstairs is the minimalist design that is bare floorboards and bare brickwork but that is my type of bar As for the bathroom in the room itself I couldn t have got it any cleaner if I had used a scrubbing brush and bleach myself I ll definitely go back 
92649,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Decent pub to stay at but let down by breakfast staff who couldn t make Scrambled Eggs and served Baked Beans cold but worst of all who were 15 minutes late in arriving to open up on my last day This is a hotel which would be suitable for those with any walking difficulties due to quite steep stairs , Decent pub downstairs which did nice evening meals even if the menu wasn t huge A couple of really good Real Ales on tap and Cocktails were two for one on Thursday night until 9pm Within a few minutes walk of Hackney Downs Hackney Central and London Fields stations and virtually next door to Hackney Empire theatre There are numerous places to eat drink and shop nearby 
92650,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The entrance to the hotel and the hotell reception together with the very narrow stair and the carpet which were worn and dirty gives a very bad first impression for a 4 star hotel The room was small and the bed uncomfortable , Location and the staff
92651,Old Ship Inn Hackney, This is not a 4 star hotel It has to be down graded to a 2 star or less Room was not cleaned on one of the days The Saturday I was leaving all staff turned up to work late except for the cleaning Breakfast was late Checking out was late because there was no one there, The location and the staff
92652,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing really unpleasant but there is still despite the gentrification of Hackney something a bit seedy about the place it would not be a surprise to meet the modern equivalent of the Kray twins somewhere in the neighbourhood I suppose that it is a bit expensive for what it is but there isn t much in the way of alternatives in the area , The Old Ship is something of an experience The entrance to the hotel is via a shabby door in a dark alley behind the Hackney Empire then down a narrow passage behind the bar which is the main business of the premises there are only about 8 hotel rooms Up a rather dirty stairway with built in creaks and into the room which given the build up was a pleasant surprise Quite large comfortable and clean quiet and with reasonable bathroom and facilities The staff from the bar were pleasant and helpful The food is OK if you like burgers 
92653,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Nothing, This is an absolute hidden gem Yhe rooms are well decorated the burgers are amazing Good selection of lagers and ales The manager goes above and beyond my expectations Fantastic experience Would highly recommend 
92654,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Old interior squeaky floors carpet does not look very clean small rooms Too expensive for what it offers in my opinion , friendly and helpful staff The second floor rooms are relatively quiet 
92655,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Facilities basic for the price of room Bed linen had not been changed and complimentary water bottle opened and partly consumed Description of room and facilities not as found, Staff friendly Helpful when discovered bed linen not changed Very handy for local music venue
92656,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Rooms are quite small and cramped and the bathrooms similarly so Towels had stains on and other toiletries not left in reasonable quantities The stairway to the rooms is dark dirty and needs updating with new lights carpet etc , Breakfast was very good and the Old Ship is a lively pub with good meals in a great location near Hackney Central station Good value for central London 
92657,Old Ship Inn Hackney, I do not understand why I was proposed 3 double bedrooms instead of two we are a family of 5 as in one of the rooms there was a third bed just to be prepared , I liked the bedrooms and bathrooms and the pub at the groundfloor decorated for Halloween brrrr The breakfast was quite disappointing above all for the children 
92658,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Breakfast was rather poor cold baked beans leathery bacon also cold all served on cold plates really can t understand why it wasn t freshly made and served hot We ate elsewhere the next morning , The bed was comfy and had good clean sheets Bathroom was clean with soft white towels but no bath mat which seemed rather odd 
92659,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Room was tastefully decorated but blandly modern which was a shame since it s a lovely old building Bed could have been more comfortable and the sofa bed in the room was also pretty knackered , This place was a little better than I expected from the reviews Staff were friendly and helpful nice toiletries and decent coffee etc in the room breakfast was fine great shower and wasn t too noisy even though it was a Saturday night For London I d say it was pretty reasonable value 
92660,Old Ship Inn Hackney, All good , The location is excellent and the atmosphere was enjoyably lively Breakfast was good and the staff were friendly and cheerful Good place to choose if you need a city place to stay 
92661,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Single bed No heating Frayed towels Location of sockets Noisy extractor in the bathroom Plug for bathroom sink didn t work , Very familiar with it as I used to live nearby and use the bar regularly 
92662,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Room could do with a little refresh Breakfast a little on small size but good quality, Lovely pub in london Very good food and drink Easy to reach Friendly staff
92663,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Difficulty carrying luggage upstairs More appropriate for fit young adults , Location central for transport and other facilities Good for a few nights 
92664,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Parking is problem for overnight Hackney station carpark closed on the one day we needed England rugby result , Did what it said on the can Worked for us Wholesome breakfast cooked order 
92665,Old Ship Inn Hackney, The room was very warm perhaps the noise from the air conditioning was a bit steep, It would be important that the breakfast had more variety there are guests from other countries who are not accustomed to the typical English breakfast 
92666,Old Ship Inn Hackney, there is a very loud and crowded bar downstairs i couldnt understand where was the entrance to the hotel because there are no obvious signs so I had to force my way inside the bar with my big bags And then I had to drag my bags to the second floor myself cause nobody would help the room is ok but the bathroom is very small, location was ok
92667,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Hotel was closed when I arrived midnight I waited on the door called the hotline and finally sneaked in with some guests coming in Carpet in common areas is dirty Guy at restaurant didn t know if breakfast was included , Location 
92668,Old Ship Inn Hackney, Very creaky floor and it being above a pub it was quite noisy but that is only to be expected , Nice and quirky different from chains like Travelodge Excellent pub with great food
92669,Old Ship Inn Hackney, If I can be picky The room was super hot and there was a fan that didn t do much The room was hot compared to the outside temperature so I think it was above the kitchen , We had a great time The manager and staff were awesome The food was truly delicious The pub itself was quirky we had some drinks and then retired to our room The room was really pleasing and the provided soaps were to die for I actually nicked one
