406374,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Very expensive poor serivce staff are not friendly at all They can not provied iron to your room and the lundary service expensive and will take long time They take long long time to answer the phone calls, Location Breakfast
406375,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The room Smelt terrible from The bathroom water drains, The location was great the room stunk like a toilet it was gross we had to leave the tiny window open to get air in the room 
406376,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Absolutely nothing comes to mind We will use this hotel as our base in any further visits to Milan , Ideally located right behind the Duomo in the centre of town and handy to most places of interest and public transport as well as a small supermarket just off Via Verziere beside Chiesa di San Bernardino 
406377,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, We had literally no view from our room We were at the first floor in a small shaft between other rooms We had no natural light in our room at any time Also i didn t like the fact that my personal ID was not enough for the reception and they requested the passports for both me any my boyfriend What if i didn t have it with me I usually don t travel in the EU with both my password and ID What would have happened then I wouldn t be awarded my already paid for room , The room facilities were great the style of the hotel is very interesting
406378,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The location was brilliant so close to the Duomo and shopping district easy walk to Della Spiga would highly recommend this hotel and the sister hotel in Rome
406379,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, They didn t provide us a baby crib the room smells very bad concierge service is below average , location and giving us an early check in for one room 
406380,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, They went on about having special pillows but they were the worst ever just couldn t get a good sleep on them spent four night fighting with pillows , Great location near Duomo Gallery and LaScala
406381,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, I did not like the service of the reception in any way I was attended by 3 of the receptionists and they were truly unprofessional to say the least I booked two rooms one room for 2 people for 3 nights and 1 room for one person for 1 night We were sent to the rooms in an inverted way the single person got a big room and the two others were in a really small room on the following day we checked out from the small room and said that we wanted to keep the bigger room since two people would remain in the hotel for two more nights the receptionist said she could NOT allow that because that room was already booked to what I had to question because when I booked two rooms I asked them to be close to each other or at least on the same floor I was given rooms in different floors and the explanation was that the hotel guarantees a room for my booking but it cannot guarantee a specific one well it seem that for some guests they can do so I did keep the big room but I will never stay in this hotel again it is not worth it to be on vacation and having to argue with people who should be willing to treat you right, The location the person responsible for checking if everything was alright in our room and the wifi
406382,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, nothing, Great Hotel we stayed here in June 2017 perfect location to get around Milan surrounded by wonderful places to eat and relax and the shops the Cathedral is literally 3 minutes walk away Rooms are clean beautiful and spacious we had a long meandering walk from the elevators to our rooms but we didn t mind There s no noise from outside considering it is right next to the Duomo The Lobby is nice bar area is large with lots of comfy sofa s Staff are very polite and want to make sure your stay is great Wifi is very good across the whole complex The price is fair I would definitely stay here again if I return to Milan
406383,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Can t think of anything , Very comfortable room AC in rooms and in hotel hallways were in good working condition Staff was helpful personable and knowledgeable 
406384,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The menu for the restaurant in the hotel was very limited and the food was uninspiring , The location was perfect right behind the Duomo Staff was accommodating and it was nice to be able to get a taxi right outside the hotel Our room had a walk in closet which was a nice surprise 
406385,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, My room had no view There were no nice amenities It was a bit cramped space wise It was a bit dark since it only opened onto the inner part of the building and thus no external face to the light , Only the location It is just 2 short blocks from the Duomo and from La Reniscente the best department store in the world 
406386,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast is ok not the best I think it needs more lighting inside maybe more direct sunlight in the lobby and it should have an outdoor sitting area , Friendly staff Large hotel with good size rooms rarely found in the big cities The location was perfect very convenient for shopping 
406387,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The room i got this time was nice but very very small in size as well as no view Although i had booked a superior room Taking into consideration that that was my third stay within six months My daughter booked a standard room and it was more spacious , Love the hotel newely refurbished rooms as well as loby the location is just perfect
406388,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The staff especially during the breakfast They are lost and did not seat me And the concierge was very tense each time i asked for train or airplain ticket reservation I did them online eventually, The location
406389,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, You can pay slightly more and get a much better hotel Plain and old design which is quite surprising given it s in the heart of Milano Entering the hotel is like entering a military base I had a friend with me who wanted to come up to the room for a few minutes so i can drop my luggage The lady insisted that he has to leave his id at the reception and pick it up on his way out Shower was not working properly Do not disturb button was not working No price menu for the minibar , Location
406390,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Staff not so friendly at front desk and at the breakfast area , Rooms were clean and renovated Noise level ok for sleeping Great location Bar staff very nice 
406391,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Staff was not friendly because they were prioritizing the large group check ins Usually happy to stay here but this last time I had to complain before i got the usual service , Location
406392,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The air conditioner doesn t cool enough and front desk staffs doesn t so friendly and helpful I was informed them to send thing to my room and they sent to another room and don t know how to get it back Terrible , Newly furnished and cleanliness
406393,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, We chose room selected on check in option and received a very nice deluxe room The walk in robe was fantastic to store all our luggage The rooms were very new upgrades recently and very comfortable The staff organised to stow our luggage in check in and check out and made arrangements for a car to take us to the airport All round great experience 
406394,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, They give always the oldest rooms no matter if you have been before like a client very high prices like a 5 star hotel but the other things are too poor Never come back at this hotel , Nothing about this hotel only the good location
406395,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, For the price I would not stay again The location is the main thing going for it We had a triple room which on arrival were told we d been upgraded I dread to think of what the original room was as the third bed was a sofa bed At 300 per night a 3rd bed was expected No iron in the room and when we rang to get one we were told we could have it for 30mins or pay for delayed return Only one bathrobe provided but two more were supplied when requested Bathroom supplies not replenished as used Upon departure there was no questions asked about our stay or feedback All in all it s a hotel charging far too much for what it actually provides Location is its main advantage , The bathroom and its huge array of towels and the shower were fantastic The pink slippers and turndown service on the first night was lovely The king bed was great pity about 3rd bed though Foyer areas are great and modern and coolly comfortable to chill out in 
406396,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, This was my 4th visit to Rosa Grand and I would chose this hotel in Milan over and over again Location is SUPER prime minutes away from the Duomo and the staff is super helpful My favorite is the odor and fresh rose smell the second you enter the lobby
406397,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The room was facing to the courtyard so no view at all This is the same for almost half of the rooms That did not bother us as we were there to see Milan , The hotel was located in the center of nearly all attractions of Milan It is right next to Duomo and fashion district and walking distance to Brera The hotel was clean and modern The breakfast was nice with enough variety The room and the bathroom was big enough equipped with a fridge and a coffee machine 
406398,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Not one hotel we have stayed in in Italy has had two racks for suitcases when there is a double occupancy Not a real fault of this very convenient and well presented hotel, Tea making facilities in our room Good bathroom and fluffy towels
406399,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The initial room allocated was completely unacceptable even though part of a new extension It was very dark looked out over concrete as on 1st floor and needed a map to negotiate the endless twisting narrow corridor and consequently a long trek to the lift Wonderful bathroom but its size was at expense of the bedroom We asked for a change but told we had to wait until next day so we did not unpack The receptionist made notes on our requirements Next morning we found that no notes had been left for staff so we started all over again We chose a room on 5th floor with light and were told it would be ready by 2 00pm We checked in at 2 45 only to find the room was not made up The receptionist told us she had rescheduled the cleaning for 3 00 pm but didn t inform us We took occupancy at 4 00 pm No apologies along this journey After that things looked up and it was a nice room except the safe deposit box didn t work and our things were locked in for 36 hours and it was an engineering issue not just another client code problem We had stayed at the hotel before which the hotel knew and had been given a very nice room So the original room allocated on this visit was an even bigger disappointment Despite the many good points about this hotel we will not go back too risky and too much effort to correct the problem, Excellent housekeeping and concierge very good bar restaurant location by the Duomo and after we demanded a change a very nice room
406400,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The staff the valet parking the location the comfy rooms the amenities the bar restaurant decor everything about this hotel is spot on We only stayed here one night but this is one of my favorite hotels now They really make you feel special and the hotel itself is beautiful A touch of luxury that helps you unwind after shopping or trying to get emergency documents at the consulates as we unfortunately had to I very much look forward to returning some day 
406401,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The front office staff that attended to us when we came back to get the keys to our second room was quite surly , The location of the hotel is just perfect for shopping and moving around Milan 
406402,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Nothing, Everything about this hotel is beautiful The location couldn t be better and the hotel itself is fabulous Pay for the breakfast at least once while you are here its worth it

406557,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Internet is slow even the one on payment I have seen faster connections elsewhere where it was also free On a hotel of this caliber maybe the high speed connection should be faster and free and if not free much faster The fidelity program is a little complicated points can be accumulated only if one reserves from the membership site There are companies just like mine where hotel reservation is centralized therefore is not done individually The company obviously does not use the membership site so whatever can be accumulated is lost Maybe it would be kinder if the hotel accumulates points like all the other hotels upon presentation of a membership card after the settlement of the bill , Personnel are wonderful

406562,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast everyday is the same Some variations should be made so that those who stays longer will not be bored with the food every morning No stunning views out my window as it is facing the internal ugly courtyard , Closeness to the Duomo shopping centre 
406563,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The bar is not very cosy and so not really inviting , Location is perfect for business tourism and shopping Room was excellent with nice view on Piazza Fontana Staff is excellent and very kind 
406564,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Unhelpfull stuff beside one young african guy young ladies from reception were very rood unpolite and completly unsuefull For 200 euro per nigh they gave me room without daylight on first floor and even i stayed for 3 days they could not change it Rooms are ready for renovation concierge is more for fun then usefull On reception i noticed that gust that came form street got better price then me from booking com for 3 nights they got better for one night Complete disapoment Stuff from booking com should make some report to them , Only location
406565,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Nothing, Excellent location and very friendly staff Breakfast was very good but I imagine it would get busy at peak times There were plenty of staff in the breakfast room 
406566,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast was not what it should be in a hotel like this Almost basic and not tasty , The upgraded room from superior to junior suite was excellent We loved it apart of the mattresses of the bed that were really firm not that comfortable 
406567,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The mattress was a little bit too hard, The location is perfect for shopping just a short distance from Piazza Duomo The room was excellent recently renewed with view on the square 
406568,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The main restaurant menu choices were just average Expected it would be better Unfortunately I had a horrible view but I was not there to gazes out of my hotel window , Room was very clean and met my needs completely Location price was very good Staff was very attentive 
406569,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, On checking in we requested a twin room since I was travelling with my son on business They could not find me one and also they could not find my reservation and I had to show the my booking com reservation on my smartphone for them to believe me A complete mess up of checking in , Location is the best in the whole of Milan I always stay here when staying in Milan 
406570,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The room was awful Staring at some wall smell from the kitchen was unbearable This was our third stay in this hotel but I doubt we will ever go there again Internet coverage in the room was poor and allowed ONLY two devices for free , The breakfast was excellent The location is perfect 
406571,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Limited view of Duomo Only two devices could hook up to free wifi , Fabulous location few minute walk to Duomo and some of the world s best shopping Excellent restaurants in walking distance Good varied buffet breakfast Nice spacious room Very accommodating staff Were able to accommodate an early check in and late check out 
406572,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Booked and paid for a delux room with a view of the Duomo however upon arrival the receptionist confirmed that a standard room was booked and as a favour she gave an upgrade free of charge to executive The so called upgrade was a tiny dark smelly pungent cigarette smell room with an internal view of construction site We had to insist on a room change which was subsequently provided The new room was very good modern clean with a view of Duomo Poor selection and variety of dishes at breakfast the items available were rather tasteless , Nice room Comfortable bed Clean
406573,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, There was a bad smell in the room like if it is coming from rotten pipes, The hotel is very close to the Domo and the room is specious and well designed Also the staff were friendly and helpful 
406574,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, In the restaurant the waitres blond around 40 45 very unpolite and arogant We make complain about that Other staf very nice Parking expensive , Location 
406575,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Even if they provided mefor free the paid version of Wi fi which is supposed to be somewhat fast it was still slow , The location and the courtesy of all personnel 
406576,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, all in all perfect, Great staff we were leaving at 4am to go to the airport so they offered to have a breakfast box ready for us to pick up at check out which was fab Rooms in new block lovely modern large rooms not much to overlook outside but fantastic location 2 3 minutes from Duomo 
406577,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, the room was overlooking building which was going on till we left They did offer another room which was not great or i would have to pay more for a suite This is the second time with you that i was given a bad room Think that this is because i book with an agency and dont go direct Hope this wont happen in xmas as i want to go to Amsterdam ,No Positive
406578,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Nothing , An excellent location near the Duomo The hotel is very clean quiet The room was excellent The staff were friendly and helpful Very good value of money Wifi was free Highly recommended 
406579,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, It is absolutely ridiculous how the price changes according to whether or not there are events going on in the City For the same room 3 times the usual price ,No Positive
406580,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast is standard many less stars hotels offer better breakfast Compared to what is offered the breakfast ist much too expensive at 24 00, The central location The friendliness of the staff The quietness of the room 
406581,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The management of the hotel are using the people Example me and my family were having health issue diaries and vomiting we asked for room cleaning 3 00 which is not available however they change the room and they charge us 150 EU just for cleaning the previous room , The location since its close to the Domo only
406582,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, Absolutely unbeatable location right behind the Duomo Close to public transport shopping and restaurants Staff were very helpful on check in and even upgraded us from a Superior to a Deluxe suite Breakfast had great options including lots of cakes 
406583,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Staff service bad Checking in so late There is no special dealing for the honeymoon even no flowers on bed Bed so hard so uncomfort Staff so so bad Late room service Looby not nice, Nothing really I didnt liked it
406584,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, I always go to this hotel once or twice a year But this time was awful the AC wasn t working in the room we died of heat and couldn t sleep well which is what ruined my whole trip Then the concierge was awful he didn t have the patience to look for and book for just one restaurant Ultimately he sent us without booking to the worst italian restaurant Finally I had pre booked and pre paid for myself and my fiance in the room so 2 adults but the first night as we came back to the hotel the receptionist wanted to charge us for the extra adult thinking I was bringing some kind of girl back to my hotel room He then checked my booking and confirmed my point It was humiliating I am definitely not going back to this hotel After years of being their loyal customer it is a shame their quality went down drastically , Location is very good hotel is clean 
406585,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The only thing is breakfast Was not as good as the hotel, Easy to locate Filing as if you are at home The only thing breakfast is not what We expect it should be better during our stay we found insict on the brid Thank you
406586,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, No water bottles in the room This should be abailable free of charge and the one we buy at the hotel super expensive No iron available even by request The gym requires dumbles The breakfast needs more variety Only one concierge and not always available We were not given taxi options and ended up with the expensive one The room rate is over the price range The internet was for limited devices and had to reconnect every day, The delux room was perfect for 3 Loved the refurbished room I believe the superior needs to be at the same standard I loved having my room next to the gym and quiet
406587,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was a real disaster Too many people too little staff for serving water out of supply no more glasses no more tables simply the infrastructure is not enough for the volume of guests , location good staff really nice and professional and kind
406588,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast was a bit chaotic Too many people set up of table didn t make it easy to navigate to and from the buffet , Loved the location Staff was accommodating with the possibility to give us different bed types 
406589,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, the room was big and its nice But the TV was too small for this distance , very healthy breakfast provide posibilities for vegiterians and the Room was renew and feel good 
406590,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, As i was traveling with the family and be it now all kids are with smart devices we were limited only for 2 wifi access which doesnt cut it , The suite was big and comfortable nicely designed 
406591,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The hotel rooms have been renovated and the rooms have not been renovated rooms I advise new because the old need for more attention and frankly very location of the hotel is excellent and close to everything and breakfast needs him more interesting
406592,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Bad service for a hotel of this category The only contact with the hotel personnel which is really pleasant is the one in the reception Rather than this the people that answer the phone and take care of room service are beyond rude I did not have a bottle opener in the room and needed to ask for it twice It finally arrived more than 1 hour later when I was already sleeping Also the personnel during breakfast do not speak english Someone from the hotel took my room key from the table while I was serving myself the buffet Once they found it they would return it to me but fail even to apology While offering a large buffet breakfast was poor in taste with scrambled eggs tasting sweet , Location Renewed rooms 
406593,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, 1 Quot DELUXE room 416 is absolutely disgusting Even standard room is better Very old and very dirty seats armchairs lightcyan colored made of the cheapest suede or whatever Not even to touch not to have a seat Office styled furniture two glass based stands one on wheels office clerk chair What happened to my favorite 4 hotel in Milano 2 Room service IGNORING please clean my room on door sign NO EXPRESS LAUNDRY CLEANING service , 1 Very nice location 100m from Duomo 2 internet is fast it is better to get a sim card for 10 month 4G wireless 
406594,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, 1 Room soundproofing is too poor 2 Expensive, 1 Location is unbeatable 2 Breakfast is average selection 3 Staff helpful 4 Very clean hotel 5 Selection of T V channels
406595,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The breakfast was a bit chaotic and the scrambled eggs obviously made from some kind of powder not real eggs not easy to find an avaiable table , The location was perfect right next door to the dumo The hotel was clean and elegant Liked the guy in the bar exceptional good service 
406596,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, i had an upgrade once for the new renovated room since that I time I always stay in this hotel choosing the new room Great nothing to complain about staff is also very friendly in the hotel Location is great easy with the parking 
406597,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, No self parking valet was badly managed Can not drop the car with bellman rather need to take the keys myself to the reception Need to pass by the reception every time i needed to pick up my car No hotel lobby so cant relax in the lobby when back from a long walk Front desk staff were short tempered concierge was not helpful when asked to help with some bookings he asked to search the web for the event page and make a booking , Location is exceptional and accessible to the Duomo walk Hotel renovated nicely 
406598,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione,No Negative, The whole experience from arrival to departure the staff went out of their way to make sure everything was satisfactory The breakfast buff is a must
406599,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, The photo of the hotel which is showing here pictured the entrance only which is the only bright spot of the hotel I can describe the hotel in one word gloomy From the reception to breakfast restaurant it was so dark and smelly like a sewage smell I felt depressed Also it was crowded with the terrible crowd noisy and in pleasant , The location of the hotel 
406600,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Room service restriction upon requesting iron and table They refused to provide them due to unjustifiable security reason , Location of hotel and lobby
406601,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Breakfast was atrocious scrambled eggs overdone fruit bowls left empty no bacon or sausages due to clientele perhaps sweets too sugary Room facilities were mediocre Internet was simply not available during our stay , Location is brilliant 
406602,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, I felt badly let down as I booked an executive room as part of our honeymoon at considerable expense and got a small family room with poor bathroom facilities tucked away in the olderst and un refurbished part of the hotel I had worked on business on a large conference here some years ago and had a good experience so was very disappointed, Lovation
406603,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Nothing not to like about the Hotel and all staff except 1 Savo The Wifi wasn t working for most of our stay and when we enquired about it and he responded with a very loud and direct NO to Fara One word of advice to Savo there are better and Nicer ways of Saying NO than the one YOU chose , Location is perfect for central Milano not far from anywhere if you want to shop and eat 
406604,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, I had to send a package by courier the concierge wanted cash direct and was unable to charge it to the room Concierge acted like it was a bother for him to answer questions regarding sending a package and information on the Expo also , Great location just next to Duomo 
406605,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Free wifi is very slow and need extra cost to upgrade to a faster version Lobby is nice but the room is a bit old style No ironing board provided , Unbeatable location very convenient for walking to attractions or to Metro 
406606,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, We could not get confortable services Almost all staffs there are not so good Especially very hard to find concerges Breakfast is also terrible , location is only good point 
406607,Rosa Grand Milano Starhotels Collezione, Coulnd t get wifi to work properly Somewhat too crowded breakfast had to fight our way to the buffet Felt a little out of place as Europeans as most other guests where from the Middle East a little unexpected when in Milan , great location spacious staff as friendly as you would expect at a hotel of this caliber Got upgraded to suite which of course was very positive Staff showing up with extra towels in the evening was a nice touch
