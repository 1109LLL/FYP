452658,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There was no fridge in the room however it s not problematic , The room was spacious with three comfortable huge beds The bathroom was very clean with multiple cosmetics included The tea cups and kettle provided in the room Location very close to the direct train to the city centre only 15 minutes very convinient Close to the two big stores with food and some restaurants 
452659,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Wasn t happy with location booking com stated 2 7 miles from centre when it was actually about 5 Although very near to tram bus stop direct into city centre we would of liked to have been closer Nothing in the area for tourists and a non alcohol area and hotel too which we did not realise The night bus from 1 5am was unreliable and difficult to use so we had to make sure we were back before 1am or pay 30 for a taxi Again we did not like this A shame because the hotel itself was good , Breakfast was excellent Air conditioning was brilliant and quiet Daily cleaning and towel replacements 
452660,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel is far away from the city centre taking long time to reach the main attractions Communication between rooms not working After a fire alarm at 3 30 AM there was NO announcement that there was a false alarm in fact there was NO announcement at all which raises concerns about safety ,No Positive
452661,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The staff was amazing almost all the time There was one girl who was very unhelpful along with the guy running the restaurant They sent me back and forth between the two of them when I was just wanting to look at a menu In the end they pretty much just brushed me off and we re actually very rude about it Also the internet was terrible It constantly would drop and we would have to keep re logging in The room was very clean but the shower did not drain properly it was kind of gross honestly ,No Positive
452662,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, The room was quiet and well equipped with comfy beds The staff were very helpful and friendly giving excellent advice as we had never been to Amsterdam before Easy trams to the centre and a good supermarket with the tastiest fresh sugar doughnuts nearby 
452663,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Hotel in need of redecoration renovation very dated and worn Staff could be more friendly Room was generally clean but bath rail where towels were kept was very rusty lamp shades ripped curtain wouldn t close properly so too much daylight in the morning bedside lights didn t work woke up every morning with the upstairs toilet being flushed and showers being taken bad plumbing On our last morning room service knocked at 9 30 to see if we where still there I was having a lovely sleep until then For what we paid VERY overpriced and DEFINATELY NOT 4 star ,No Positive
452664,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, My only slight dissatisfaction was the breakfast It was not expensive but it wasn t great either Perhaps it had been there for a while since we did not eat early but some of it didn t taste fresh at all , The room was great with a lovely view of the canal opposite It had all the things you would expect a hotel to provide shampoo conditioner soap and more I don t often find a hotel that provides you with a toothbrush and toothpaste Surprisingly the coffee in the room was great as well The staff were great and very helpful 
452665,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, hotel is excellent and staff are good and easy access about 15 mins from central amsterdam from tramp good will recommend our friends and officials for future 
452666,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The bathroom stank and the beds were not comfortable The rooms were all untidy and very old fashioned it s not worth 4 starts it should be a 0 star hotel Will never come back here , Nothing Worst hotel we ve been to 
452667,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Asked for smoking room to be told is none also couldn t upgrade after asking for one even though no one else in hotel had upgraded , Tram stop not far away I
452668,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There were a number of problems with the room itself that staff didn t seem to either be able to or care to fix The door didn t lock from inside the room tub had no plug TV didn t work While none of these things are a huge deal it was a bit annoying when all added up , The location was great Close to bus and metro stations but away from the busiest areas of Amsterdam There is a great little square right there with a grocery store bank and restaurants 
452669,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The only negative for me was the location 30 min tram ride to Dam Square , We were upgraded to a larger room not sure why It was very spacious extremely clean and the bathroom was great as well Though it not in the city center there are lots of restaurants and bars around There was a supermarket and mall within a 5 min walking distance as well The closest tram stop was less than a kilometer away 
452670,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location was a little far out for us as we went into the centre every day but this was made easy by the tram, The room was clean and we were able to store our luggage after check out
452671,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Staff training is essential , The staff was rude It put us in such a bad mood The entrance to the garage was broken It made it hard to get in and out of the parking area The garage was filthy The hotel is not at all central It takes over half an hour by tram to get to the sightseeing areas The room itself was nice We had a view of the river
452672,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Very noisy rooms at front of hotel could hear conversations outside First hotel I ve ever stayed in where you can t have a drink in the bar ,No Positive
452673,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The way one staff member dealt with the payment at the reception was disgusting The lady who checked us in was rude and unhelpful There was a technical problem with the hotel receiving our payment on arrival via card payment One particular staff member said it was our problem and that we couldn t stay unless the payment had gone through even after calling my bank for confirmation that the payment had left my account After three hours of dealing with this situation and finally speaking to booking com who spoke to another staff member The man agreed to check us in and apologised for the problem The rude staff member made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome , The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable even though we had booked a double bed and were given two singles 
452674,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Directions could have been clearer We took the airport shuttle bus to a Best Wester hotel only to find out that hotel was a different one Double backed and took the public bus there , Staff were professional and nice Rooms were very comfy and all the toiletries have been provided 
452675,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel had more of a feel of being a hostel Majority of staff were rude and unapproachable if I required any assistance I was made to feel as though I was an inconvenience to them I had booked a double room but was allocated a room with two single beds pushed together The hairdryer in the bathroom was covered in dust which has been there for sometime , The tram system is excellent and took about 10 minutes to get to the city center 
452676,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel is a bit old and the passages need some nice air freshness The pathway outside the hotel is also a bit unclean , It s a nice cosy hotel but very old school The location was perfect for me as it was away enough from the hustle bustle but close enough to be well connected The staff was Super nice and there are plenty of halal restaurants in close vicinity 
452677,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, location was not great as it was far from Amsterdam central, I just had to spent a night so it was fine for that it was clean and spacious and access to metro was on walking distance but quite far from Amsterdam central abt 30min train ride
452678,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The cleaning of the room was appalling When we checked in the room was dusty and when we complained to the cleaning lady she said that that is the way it was and no amount of cleaning would do When she left my wife cleaned up the room and all the dust and dirt etc on second day too used coffee cups were not cleaned replaced Toiletries were not replaced no spoon to mix coffee Overalll very unhappy with cleaning on all 3 days H e this must be the fault of the person handling it as we didn t encounter such problems in our two previous stays in the preceding week , The reception staff are excellent and very helpful 
452679,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, A lot of noise in this hotel, Hotel isnt isolated in front of noises and it has so noisy Really i didn t enjoy my stay beacause 1 for two nights we have the worst nidgt our life There are a lot of terrible young Next to our room They made a lot of noise until morning and although we get the feedback to receiption again continue for second night it was very bad memory of our trip and we missed two days for our plan because me and my freind had a bad hedache for this reason 2 the bath of hotel is not clean because it has a bad slope on the floor and a lot of water collect on the bath floor 3 Nobody doesnt help for carry luggage and its so upsetting for woman 4this hotel isnt 4 star hotel
452680,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The rooms were dated and handles on some furniture were missing with a string tied to them so I d say they were in need of repair and a room revamp But was still value for money We didn t use the restaurant so I couldn t comment on that , Hotel was very Close to trams and buses all going to city centre and airport There is a Lovely daily market and convenience shops within a two minute walking distance from hotel that was handy and cheap Hotel has vending machines for bus and tram ticket can be used on both transports hotel staff were helpful and friendly The Toilet and shower were clean and excellent The Bed was super comfy I would use this hotel again 
452681,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, the location is quite far from the central station but it was fine for us to take tram 13 14 for approximately 30min to get there , The staff is so helpful Rooms are clean with nice facilities The hotel did everything we requested for example to fold towels in bird shapes XD
452682,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I am sure you are aware it was not in keeping with your standards or of the media pictures The hotel appointments and surrounding area were substandard Sad I have stayed in best westerns Most recently in Nanaimo and Halifax They were far superior to this location I worried about my personal safety and hotel room security , Not much Stay away 
452683,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location of the toilet paper was a strain to reach the Wife is not that supple anymore The bedsheets came off the bed and wrapped themselves around my legs No bar , The 4 nut granola mushrooms and Latte Machiatto were all lovely 
452684,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The only negative I can think of is the approach to the hotel which is a little dirty littered with cigarettes but that doesn t really matter very much to us , We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights Our stay was lovely and it was a nice hotel with clean rooms and good facilities We didn t have breakfast included but that wasn t an issue at all because of the many cafes situated outside the hotel as well as a supermarket just 2 minutes away from where you could easily get breakfast groceries Tea and coffee facilities were provided in the room The location was also good It wasn t exactly in the centre but the connections were super easy as the tram station is 2 minutes away and it s a direct tram to centraal station which takes 20 minutes We particularly liked this because it was quiet at night away from tourists so we got a good nights rest The staff was also very friendly and helpful Would stay again 
452685,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I was a bit disappointed when I need to pay for the breakfast I thought I can get the complimentary breakfast with the price of the hotel but I was wrong At the end I need to pay extra 10 euros pp for the breakfast but it worth the money , I took bus 69 from Schiphol airport to Blue Square hotel It is so convenient to use public transport in this city It only takes 5mins walk to the bus tram station and we can get to Dam Square in about 25mins However I can see a lot of HALAL restaurants around the hotel 
452686,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The restaurant is like an oversized cafe and the food is basic but well cooked and nicely presented And despite the info to the contrary has no bar or liquour licence A small mini bar fridge would have been useful for water and cool drinks , Hotel out of town but easy access to transport to the city and to the airport The hotel is good but not 4 star Good sized room with great shower but old fashioned dark furniture 
452687,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, They charged extra after check out time even I asked for half an hour coz we arrived at 11 39 am from shopping We stayed 2 nights and the no disturbed sign was hanging by the door so I just asked for towels and toilet tissue and the staff was very helpful, Location and parking
452688,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel wasn t definitely on the level of a real 4 stars hotel The staff also had to be reminded to carry out duties such as the replacement of sugar in the room The fridge wasn t included and a deposit of 50 had to be given , The position of the hotel was very convenient Only 20 minutes on the bus to get to Amsterdam central 
452689,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Small things like lack of soap holder in the shower panel, Had asked for a room with shower as I didn t need a bathtub They read the comments and had the right room for me
452690,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, Excellent location close to convenience stores and restaurants as well as public transportation to city centre and the sprinter Room was comfortable and staff was great 
452691,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Not clean around front entrance No fridge in room , Its proximity to the city and in particular its position in a Turkish quarter This meant some very nice local Turkish restaurants and a friendly cosmopolitan feel The area was quiet Very good value breakfast

452694,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nothing really , Staff was friendly I paid 15 euros for 24 h for car parking and in last day I stayed just one night I gone after 18 PM with no pay for extra hours was 4 hours 1 hour 1 5 euros Tram station are very close aprox 150 m and just with one line 14 goes directly to Dam Square in 15 20 min 
452695,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel is in need of a refurbishment The furniture in the room is dated and the exterior entrance area frankly not very clean , The staff were friendly and welcoming
452696,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I was pestered for my entire stay to pay for the hotel even though I told them my bank have confirmed it has been paid for they took the money out My account without my consent when we was suppose to pay in cash then tried telling me for 3 days they hadn t they wouldn t allow us in the room from 12am until 3 30am on the last night because of this until they realised their mistake was not happy as we had a flight to get at 8am then 3 days after I m home they then take the money again I wrote them 2 email complaints and still no reply , Hotel was ok
452697,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Room was located at the front side with the main street and often noisy Furnitures were in not good conditions , Good breakfast Direct public bus connection from amsterdam city center and main station 
452698,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, poor coverage of a free internet noisy pipes in the wall many sockets didn t work when all lights were off during night, bathtube in the bathroom 24 hour doors open beautiful room TV comfortable beds supermarkets nearby Jumbo and A H
452699,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Not only this hotel doesn t stand to its supposedly 4 star classification but has dirty carpets has no basic amenities in the room No fridge no table tissue and despite advertise has no internet connection in the room To top it up it has extremely a poor customer service who only seem to hear you and not listening to a customer s concern Have been lock out of the room twice already as the card didn t work And initially had to wait for half an hour for the paper work to be processed twice due to lack of attention by staff at reception Tried to cancel to go to a different hotel but there was no one to process my request Lastly prior to travelling to Amsterdam I requested one of the booked rooms to be changed from a twin a triple which I got a confirmation for from booking com but on arrival had to go through the whole process all over again and pay the difference Not sure why this had not been processed already And lastly having to sit in the lobby to use wifi connection is simply an awful experience I ever want to repeat and expected from a 4 star hotel ,No Positive
452700,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Its far from the city , Location is far from the city It should indicate thier that you need to take tram after 12 midnight So that the costumer know 
452701,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, Friendly helpful staff Beds were extremely comfortable and I particularly liked that there were 4 beds in the room No pull out or sofa bed to make up 
452702,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There was no bar at the hotel which the guy at reception informed me was for licencing reasons If i had know this was the case i would have never stayed there ,No Positive
452703,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Overcharged I originally booked for 8 days but due to late arrival of my mother s passport and visa I had to change to 2 days I contacted the hotel enroute to Amsterdam and they hiked up the price of the room to 721 euros for two days They said a cancellation would cost 400 Euros When we arrived they confirmed that a room was normally150 euros and 2 rooms for 4 guests would be 300 but they had only a single room with 2 double beds for which they would charge 560 euros for the first night and 160 for the second night I have been booking through booking com for several years and previously was offered a 10 discount I have never paid 560 euros day for a standard three star best western twin double bed room ever I feel booking com best western should investigate and refund us the excess charged They did offer us free breakfast and car parking but only on request , Breakfast
452704,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, It was a bit pricey for the room we got But all accommodations were expensive this past weekend due to some concerts and bank holidays 25 28th May , The Hotel is 30min away from the center It is clean and good quality 
452705,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, The rooms were very clean and accommodated 3 people very well The location was great we used Uber to get into downtown Amsterdam We didn t explore anything around the area of the hotel only used it to sleep and park the car 
452706,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There was no bar As a lone traveller I was looking forward to socialising in the bar with other guests after a lo ng day walking around the city Also there were no amenities to relax with like a spa or a pool , The room was comfortable and clean
452707,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nothing really Except there was no br though it was mentioned that there was , The location friendly and helpful attitude of the staff except for the dining room staff who did not have the customary smile Perhaps they were very busy 
452708,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The whole place needs redecorating it s rather gloomy inside especially on a dull day Also there aren t enough clothes hangers in the wardrobe only 2 per person , Very helpful staff Fairly good breakfast buffet They found some soya milk for me on request Interesting location with easy links by bus and tram to city centre bus about 20 mins Good local market mainly aimed at local Turkish and North African element of population 
452709,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The restaurant breakfast buffet was not satisfying also some room services needed to be improved , The location is in the very pleasant place and easily have access to all you may need In addition staffs are awesome They are very kind polite and responsive 
452710,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, During 3 night stay the bed sheet was not replaced and the room was not cleaned up properly, Location is good surrounded by many stores and restaurants
452711,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location is on the outskirts of major tourist attractions but efficient transport connections actually helped us to comfortably acquaint ourselves with more cultural aspects of beautiful Amsterdam The neighborhood gave us a wary initial impression but proved to be very safe quiet and friendly , Registration staff incoming and departing were extremely accommodating and informative They added to the quality of our two days in Amsterdam and created an excellent impression for the Blue Square as one of the best of the six hotels we stayed at on this trip 
452712,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, No fridge in a room econom class room , Although it takes 30 mins by tram to get to the hotel from the city centre this accomodation is a deal It is situated in a quiet area and we had a beautiful view from the window there was a pond with boats WiFi was the fastest I have ever used The staff were very polite and friendly We were allowed to leave our bags in a baggage room after check out till late evening Temperature in a room was a little bit cool but the hotel provides you with a warm blanket Oh and they give you 2 pillows per person even if it is an economy class room 
452713,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Only a small thing I found the room temperature too warm for me, Staff Patrick in particular location room v clean if not a little too warm can t wait to get back 
452714,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Pillows weren t that great but that s probably me just being picky Also the beds were two twins pushed together Was difficult for a couple to sleep in , Great accommodation Staff was very knowledgeable about the area and helpful pointing you to the popular spots Would definitely stay here again 
452715,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Entrance to the hotel was littered with cigarette ends from either the staff or customers that no one had cleared up Looks untidy No one has cleaned up this area around the main entrance at all during our 4 days stay there The food for breakfast was awful not to the standard that we are used to at Best Western One evening meal and one breakfast were enough not to rat there at all , The room was clean and quite big for 2 and wifi was pretty good The hotel is located not too far from the city center It is about 20 25 min tram or bus ride to Centraal Station 
452716,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There were things in the room which didn t work as expected for instance some lights didn t work the room was all right but I guess it needs a little bit of attention The managers should lower the price or keep them working as they should Also there was not a refrigerator in the room , Staff were awesome everyone was exceptionally kind and helpful Seriously very nice people 
452717,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Check in laborious it s a long way from central Amsterdam but there are trams and buses 15 minute journey Very few TV channels working in room , Clean decent shower
452718,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Honestly I would be being picky if I found anything other than it would have been nice to have been able to sit in the hotel and have a late night drink but there were supermarkets nearby so we brought in our own and relaxed in our room , The bedroom was clean and very comfortable We were upgraded to a lovely standard room which was a nice touch There was not a sound at night so we had 2 fantastic sleeps which is not always the case in a hotel One of the best bathrooms I have ever had in a hotel perfect shower From reception to the cleaning staff to the porter who looked after our luggage on the last day everyone was lovely 
452719,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nothing really to complain about, All was fine only problem was location but transport links to amsterdam sq were fine front of hotel was very scruffy but once inside great
452720,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The wifi is really unstable and I couldn t connect to the internet sometime The sound insulation is bad in the bathroom and I can hear my friends in the next room There is a bus station within walking distance but the transportation is not convenient comparing to the hotel near the train station , The room is spacious and good in general 
452721,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location Not the touristic area of Amsterdam Plus there s nothing around but Turkish restaurants , Cleanliness amenities room is big and very comfortable
452722,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, needs renovation specially bathroom I already informed the hotel Wifi is very slow not worth it I also informed the hotel, close to shops friendly staff good public transport clean rooms
452723,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, It s 25 minutes from sloterjik station 35 minutes from shophol airport Bus and Trump sataion 1 minute walk from hotel Helpful staff and nice breakfast 
452724,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, Excellent location for public transport the number 69 bus goes directly from the airport to the front door of the hotel The number 7 and 14 tram go from the front door straight into the city Staff are very friendly and the rooms are spacious and comfortable 
452725,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, We were not greeted with a smile at all at any stage by the receptionist Julius during the check in process He also told us that the breakfast would be 10 per person for the stay however breakfast was really 10 per person per day amounting to 60 overall had I known this I would not have made the decision to include breakfast, Rooms were very nice and bathroom was also Food at the lounge was very nice
452726,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Wifi was really slow and also it is far away from city center so you cannot walk to there Except these here is nice to stay , Perfect room to stay with your friend comfort bed and room Really clean and tidy Friendly staff good breakfast 
452727,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Lots of garbage behind the room windows hundreds of cigarette butts toilette paper tissues plastic bags right behind the window Neighbourhood is dirty , Rooms reasonably clean staff attitude OK 
452728,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Just the distance from the centre but not enough that I wouldnt stay again which I will , I like this hotel I have stayed a few times unlike the cebtre of Amsterdam the stairs are normal and the rooms have plenty of space and are not squashed The prices are usually quite hood for a hotel like this 
452729,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Wifi signal is poor Staircase to the hotel filthy and full of cigaret buts Carpets on 2nd floor badly stained Male staff member on duty around 3pm on Monday was very rude No dubble bed in a family room ,No Positive
452730,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The computers in the lobby could use some stools for users Standing to use them was a pain , Front desk staff were friendly and helpful Very close to public transport easy to get to city centre 
452731,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, My friend s handbag got snatched in front of the hotel entrance but unfortunately the hotel s CCTV couldn t show the location of the crime in fact it happened just a few steps from the hotel s entrance hotel s sfatt did not help much during the incident, There s plenty of food choices around the neighborhood
452732,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Would be nice if there was a mirror outside the bathroom so one can keep getting ready outside the bathroom , We liked Melanie who helped us at the front desk Room was clean roomie and we loved the three beds with enough shampoo for all of us 
452733,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, It was not a pleasant stay in Blue Squre at all The first three nights were fine But the cleaning did nothing but made up the bed and changed some stuff in the toilet But on the forth day we left Don t Disturb card at the door but the room was broken into What s worse it smell a strong paint when we went into the room All our suitcases were moved onto the bed Two friends in another room had the same experience One of my friends passport was placed on the carpet it was in her suitcase We are angry And the wifi here is super slow I don t know how could it make a four star hotel Its location is far from the downtown as well Anyway please think twice ,No Positive
452734,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel restaurant is total failure Yes in the lift you can see all mouth watering pictures of dishes but in reality tomato soup tasted like it was from the can and duck was so sweet that I could barrely swallow it So we visited the restaurant once on our first evening there and never again That was the biggest dissapointment for 4 star hotel We certainly expected more Plus there is a No Alcohol policy meaning that instead of having a glass of vine or beer you will have to drink water or sparkling drinks Overall hotel looks worn off and needs to be refreshed, Staff was very friendly and helpfull we had a room with 2 single beds but at the first opportunity they managed to give us a room with a double bed Rooms vere kept clean and tidy and altrough breakfast was not included in price you have to pay extra 10 eur per day for that the food offered was very good for that money Next to hotel is very good market in which you can buy fresh fruits e g 1kg of strawberries costed only 1 5EUR Location is good you can take bus 69 to from Schiphol airport to there and to Amsterdam centre you can get wit Tram No 14 
452735,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Balance between location and price paid Too expensive for where it was , Very friendly and helpful staff Connections to centre were very good however 
452736,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room has no window The first room I saw was tiny and there there people partying and shouting to each luther of their window while smoking it s a non smoking hotel Resraurant was terrible Empty and Served no wine or beer,No Positive
452737,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Windows did not open so no fresh air , Staff are amazing very friendly and helpful It s on the pickup route for main tourist attractions Free wifi was great 
452738,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, unbelievable small room and even smaller bathroom bed to soft room was clean but the entrance of the hotel was scandalous dirty I was a shamed that I bring my family here , room was clean
452739,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, We have asked for wine glasses from the restaurant and they offer us only the plastic one And the waiter was too arrogant , In our room the air conditioner was broken So we ve got another room on the next day And the receptionist brought us the extra blankets 
452740,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Not clear where the hotel parking lot is Rooms were a bit noisy Breakfast was OK but very straightforward , Room was fine It all looked fairly old but was still in a good and well maintained state Breakfast was OK Tram station is on a 5 mins walk from the hotel but it takes 30 mins to get to the city centre by tram 
452741,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Terrible hotel The room had so much dust When I opened the wardrobe it falled on me The area around the hotel is really sketchy Avoid the hotel , Nothing good
452742,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Kommunikationen mellan Restaurangen och receptionen kunde ha varit mycket b ttre Dom hade ingen koll p vem som hade bokat frukost och man var tvungen att ta med sig en frukost voucher varje morgon Systemet fungerade inte och det k ndes v ldigt oldschool det r ju trots allt 2017 Frukosten var helt ok deras la carte var inte bra , Billigt boende och man fick det man betalade f r Helt ok service och mottagande gratis wifi 
452743,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Seats dirty and ripped in the restaurant also carpets in the corridors really needed a good cleaning, Rooms cleaned daily Location to the metro into central Amsterdam
452744,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Staff not the most enthusiastic and welcoming though not obnoxious Poor wifi reception at times was not consistent Room only came with five coathangers in the wardrode could do with more than a couple more to hang shirts Hotel itself was very nice but the neighbourhood itself seemed a little worse for wear particularly in comparison to the city centre Although this was reflected in the bargain price , Very clean room Furniture not overly modern but of high quality Comfortable bed which was changed and made up daily Cleaners also restocked coffee in room Bathroom was spacious with large bath and a shower hanging above it Included a hairdryer Iron ironing board available at reception Good quality breakfast buffet The place was quiet at night Two decent not overly expensive supermarkets less than five minutes walk away Deka Markt and Jumbo Transport links very good with regular about every 10 minutes trams from very close by to the Central Station 13 and Flevopark 7 and 14 the latter stopping at locations such as Rembrandt square and the Rijksmuseum 
452745,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Pillows were a little too bulky and the option for breakfast is a little overpriced 12 95 per person per night They don t serve alcohol which wasn t an issue for me at all but it does state that there is a bar which no longer exists Other than those minor issues everything else was perfect , The room was a lovely size and really clean the beds were made up every day by the time we got back and new towels were put in the room if we needed them The shower in the room was honestly perfect I wish I could have taken it back with me Transport links straight into the centre are about a five minute walk in each direction from the hotel The receptionists were always more than happy to help and knew a lot about the area transport links things to do The hotel is a bit further out but as I said it shouldn t be a problem when there are great public transport links outside A single ticket which you could use for up to an hour were 2 90 but also a 48 hour ticket was 12 50 and you can use on the bus or the tram I did not find the location an inconvenience at all due to how effective everything else was The 69 bus goes from Schiphol Airport straight to the hotel I would definitely recommend and stay at this hotel again 
452746,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The only negative was the wifi connection A bit unreliable and at times wouldn t connect at all , The room and private bathroom were very clean and spacious The shower was fantastic great water pressure and large Staff were friendly and helpful and our room was serviced each day with new towels tea and coffee and anything else we needed Beds were comfortable The room itself was quite elegant The location was great Multiple tram stops and bus stops leading to Amsterdam Centraal and Dam Square were essentially right on our doorstep Staff also were helpful in providing travel cards to buy for the public transport which saved us the time and stress in working that out by ourselves we got a 4 day travel card for the tram bus and train Parks shops and food places were within short walking distance If you re up for a long walk the walk to Amsterdam central area only takes about an hour and is a nice way to explore Overall I enjoyed my stay and this hotel was amazing considering the price I will stay here again 
452747,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Our initial room we checked in too had no working wifi so had to pack our stuff up and move room This was pretty annoying Very cold in the morning to be fair, We paid a very good price for the quality of the hotel 
452748,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room was a bit worn in general the wallpaper was dirty carpet worn etc could do with updating but nothing too serious , Really nice property with accessible public transport to the center right on the doorstep Staff were very friendly and helpful 
452749,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, The room itself is big and very spacious It was really superb Transportation wise is very nearby and access to the city centre is just half an hour We did use bicycle to the central area for a day and is so worth it Must try 
452750,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Its a bit far from the center but train stop is 100m from the hotel which takes you straight to Dam square, Amazingly clean and comfortable staff is extra nice one of the best values for money I ve ever seen rooms are spacious and nice In 100m of hotel there are trains buses which will take you to every place in the city so going around isn t problem
452751,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The rooms facing the main road can be noisy as the tram passes in front of the hotel Also its quite far from the centre but both tram takes you there easily , The room was nice sized with everything you need The stuff was helpful as well 
452752,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The only thing we didn t like is the pillows they are all way too high which makes guests difficult to fall sleep and stay asleep , The room is clean and we had a fantastic view The front desk agent who checked us in was excellent We loved her hospitality 
452753,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, It is very institutional more dormitory than hotel Tired Fits the neighbourhood , It was perfectly okay for the money First impressions weren t great very tired but staff were good and raised my appreciation of the place 
452754,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The facilities need a major upgrade Our room keys stopped working on a daily basis on our third night we were told we cant get into our room for the night and it will have to be opened with a drill in the morning they gave us a new room but we couldn t get any of our belongings for the night the next morning the morning staff had no idea this happened and took them ages to resolve wasted almost half of our day the services is very poor the day we checked in there was construction taking place in the hallways it smelt like paint everywhere and it was difficult to walk through the hallways I m extremely dissapointed with our stay , the location was perfect to get into Dam Square 
452755,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The price we were quoted on booking com was wrong it was 38 more then we were told The sheets weren t changed while we were over there as the same mark was on my sheets from when I arrived to when we left the cups weren t changed either as my friend had soup in her cup and we came back there were still soup marks in the cup It was way to cold in the room even with the heating on We had to have two quilts , The wifi was fast and it was a good location 
452756,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Check in could be earlier , Public transport was easy to get to the hotel from the airport You can either take the shuttle which is 20 euro round trip if going with a group over 4 people or take public transport The staff was helpful in telling us which tram or bus to take to go to the destinations we wanted to go while we were there There are a few restaurants around and a great hookah bar right behind the hotel 
452757,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Food leftovers under the bed Dust in cabinet of watercooker Windows were dirty Glasses and coffee cups were dusty and dirty Compared to the last time i stayed there not a lot of things changed That is 8 years ago Maintenance is poor Staff is ok but not well trained Wondering if one of them has the Hotel school certificate Suggest to clean and fix things in the hotel Elevator got stuck for example Otherwise they can loose license This is not the Best Western as it was but more a hotel like in the red light district , I was upgraded but bedroom was not really clean 
452758,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room didn t have a fridge Two single beds attached together to make it double was extremely uncomfortable , Location was good as Dam Square is 30 mins away with tram station in the same street 
452759,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Not the best TV with strange volume settings for each channel and the device itself not working properly After a long day of walking and exploring the best way to relax before going to bed would have been to watch some movies or series in English Most of the channels were in native language , The hotel suited our needs being a place to sleep in and having easy access to the city Took only about 30 minutes to reach the centre by tram Had lots of grocery stores and cheaper restaurants nearby if you don t want to eat at the hotel 
452760,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Reception and Diner could be nicer and warmer , Decent Breakfast Clean room with confortable bed and a quiet neighborhood amazing location with great connections to Airport Bus 69 and city centre Tram 14 and 7 
452761,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The layout of the bedrooms We didn t realise the room would be so small and the beds would be back to back , The staff were very friendly and willing to help with any questions we had about the area The hotel was warm and comfortable Easy access to the centre by tram and a bus to the airport 
452762,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Everything Always a problem we checked in our room was wrong firstly then the second room was broke the heating wouldn t work or tv and they moved us again to a third room finally where they finally said is ok, Nothing from start to finish was a disaster False advertising of hotel and rooms on your site 
452763,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Bed sheets had stains Pillows were way to fat Would rather two thinner ones than one massive fat heavy one, Beds were comfy It was quiet Nice price 
452764,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Our trip was in February The temperature was below zero sometimes The rooms were too cold and wouldn t heat up So the central heating seemed weak The bathrooms also had a cold breeze coming through Perhaps the windows needed proper insulation As for the free wifi that was troublesome We couldn t log on and when we did it was for a few seconds I had a chat with the friendly staff and they are working on changing that though , I liked that the rooms were spacious and the bathtub was pretty large That s a luxury nowadays There is plenty of storage drawers closet space etc They also provide toiletries There s a boiler and a decent variety of coffee and tea in the room Basically you will find everything you need in the room I got an awesome deal on my double room Their prices are competitive for a 4 star hotel You get your money s worth and more I think if this hotel fixes a couple of things it could easily become the best hotel in Amsterdam 
452765,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Wifi was temeperamental very strong during the daytime and early morning but very slow in the evening and night Also we are very environmentally conscious and didn t want the towels to be changed but they were changed , The staff were very pleasant They offered us fresh free fruit 
452766,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, My bed side light did not work Approx 30 mins by tram to the centre Longer by night bus If you make that journey in the morning back again early evening then out again for the late evening and back the travelling time mounts up On one night we had to wait more than 5 minutes for the night porter to appear and open the front door for us , The two single beds were laid out back to back instead of side by side A sturdy wooden suitcase cupboard was in between This was unusual and a bit quirky and I think reduced the usual volume of my friends snoring The shower was invigorating and I came out feeling very relaxed Bus 69 runs directly between airport and hotel no need to change anywhere 
452767,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Where do I start We arrived to be told that they only had a double room for me and my wife for one night We would then need to move to a twin room for the next two nights We rejected and asked to be put in the same room for all nights They then gave us a twin room not a double bed I had to push the beds together myself Under the bed there was drink cans jewellery and underwear We called the manager to view the cleanliness of the room and he said the cleaners are not told to clean under the beds We asked for a refund as we were about to leave the hotel and all of a sudden there was a double room available for all 3 nights Our towels were not changed for the whole stay even though we threw them on the floor in the bathroom as advised by the signage on the wall I had to result to taking towels from the cleaners trolley Finally wasn t happy that after being 5 mins late to check out we had the manager knocking at our door asking us to pack in the corridor as they needed to clean the room because they had the room booked I will never ever stay at a best western hotel again , The breakfast was ok That was probably the highlight of our stay Everything else went horribly wrong 
452768,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, nothing, The hotel is very clean comfortable beds close to public transport close to local shops and restaurant and staffs are very friendly and helpful We really enjoyed our stay here 
452769,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The heating that we left on during the whole night brought us terrible headaches in the morning I guess it was our fault but anyway don t forget to turn the heating off , Our room was clean and comfortable and the staff was nice and helpful WiFi was fast There s a couple of bus stops very close to the hotel so it was very easy to get to the city center You can rent a bike and buy tickets at the reception 
452770,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, They gave us a room the first night where the Windows didn t close right and the heating system did not function proper They change the room the next morning without any comment The Breakfast didn t offer a lot of variation or fressnes , Room was clean und there was good public transport connection into Centrum

452778,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Check in receptionist was obviously annoyed by the former guest in line Most annoying thing there was literally NO WIFI CONNECTION possible in our room It was necessary to open the door and stand half way in the corridor to receive the minimum of signal still websites took few min to load or did not work at all Since we only stayed 2 nights we did not report this A 4 star hotel raises guests expectations Neither free water bottles slippers a fridge were found in the room A 0 5 water bottle costs EUR 2 50 This hotel fits more a 2 or max 3 star hotel It would have scored definitely higher in customer satisfaction if expectations were not unnecessarily high through the communicated 4 stars , The hotel is very close to various bus and tram stations going to from the Airport and the city center There are several supermarkets in walking distance 2 3 min Hotel room has a good size and is very clean Bed is very comfy and shower is very good Luggage can be stored at the hotel after check out 
452779,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Had to pay extra for breakfast and for a double bed rather than 2 single beds but I guess that s pretty standard , Easy check in and out Good breakfast Close to tram stops Clean rooms 
452780,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location not great and there are better more central hotels that I would consider paying a little more for just for the convenience It s 30 45 minute tram journey to Dam square from this hotel Can be a bit of a pain if you like to nip back the hotel in the day or if you want to get back to bed in a hurry at the end of a long day However tram station is just outside the door step and easy connection from Airport taking the number 69 bus from stand B14 Decor was a bit dated but you get what you pay for , Staff were friendly and helpful Overall a great price 55 euros per night and you get what you pay for 
452781,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location was not good 28 minute tram ride from hotel to downtown spots This area is very Middle Eastern with few restaurant options The hotel has a restaurant but it was mediocre at best and there is no liquor served A bar in the front of the hotel is closed Many times there was only one person at the front desk and the lines got long one day housekeeping didn t show up until 5 pm , Rooms are big by European standards what we Americans have come to expect in the US Stayed over New Years Eve but price dropped significantly on the next day s stay Staff was courteous and spoke good English

452786,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel overall and the room are a bit shabby Stains on the curtains and lamps broken lights in the bathroom The temperature in the room and especially in the bathroom was very low and we were constantly freezing After I made the reservation the hotel contacted me by e mail in Dutch that I don t understand a single word of and asked to make a pre payment through some kind of website Also they had a problem with pre authorizing my card After the problem with the card was solved I was still asked to complete the payment through their website within 24 hours or my booking would be cancelled I was travelling and had very limited access to internet This was the first time that the hotel can t just charge my card with the payment info they have from Booking com Overall it took me a lot of time and stress to confirm my reservation , The hotel is a good value for money combinations It is pretty far from the city center but very easy to reach with the public transportation
452787,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location of the hotel was pretty poor Only a few places to eat and drink within walking distance all of which shut quite early The main shopping centre is about a 20 30 minute tram bus ride , Bed was surprisingly comfortable Room was very clean Lovely shower

452790,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location is a little bit far out of the city We found it quicker to hire bikes and cycle into the centre each day than to catch public transport There is not a lot to do within easy walking distance of the hotel I spent 10 on public transport in 3 days and I think my brother who did not have a public transport card spent more like 30, Overall fine hotel nothing particularly special about it but very clean and tidy with all the things you would expect
452791,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel didnt have double glazing but did have big windows which would not have been a problem except the bed was right beside the window The heating in the room was good and the heavy crtains helped but there was a constant draught and the bathroom was always cold , The room was a good size the beds were comfy the place was very clean and the shower was great

452796,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Far from city would be better to pay extra for city hotel if you want to stay out till late as taxi drivers will charge you 40 euro once they see your tourist, Clean rooms but room service staff kept annoying me after I had declined service 
452797,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nobody has to wait for too long to be checked in If your CC machine doesn t work that is not my business I do not have to carry hundreds of Euros with me , Very clean and comfortable Not in the center but lots of rests and markets around the hotel

452802,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, First of all had a huge problem trying to cancel my booking and at the end it was just impossible even when the hotel receptionist had already told me I could do it without any charge and it was stated in the cancellation terms as well Apparently there was a misunderstanding with booking com but the person that answered me at the hotel when trying to cancel the reservation was just disrespectful without any interest on helping me as a customer and did even hang up the phone just to avoid the conversation Second of all when we entered our room it had a disgusting odor like a swimming pool and the glasses inside the bathroom weren t clean Finally the hotel was too far from the city center Would never recommend this hotel to anyone ,No Positive
452803,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The single room was quite small and difficult to move around There was a problem with the heater and even after reducing the thermostat it was still incredibly hot , The breakfast and dinner were great The staff were friendly and the double room was quite large and the hotel is close to a direct bus to the airport and a tram to the center which made moving around very convenient It was also possible to purchase the bus card from the reception which was a pleasant bonus

452832,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, On arrival the room was not ready All of the bookings within our group were wrong Room types etc The Air con was broken The sink did not drain and was blocked asked 3 times to be fixed and nothing was done The shower flooded No fridge in room No water in room No Bar Alcohol in the hotel Hotel was very dirty and needs redecorating everything peeling back or falling off Night staff very very rude to customers You have to pay for parking even though the hotel owned the car park and it is part of the same building a total rip off , Nothing this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in 
452833,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location is far from the centre which is a problem especially after midnight as you need to take a to go back to the hotel , Almost everything was very decent
452834,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room view could have been better, Location was near to public transport routes and a shopping complex with several options for buying food and items of daily use
452835,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, It is actually located rather far from where all the actions are , I like the fact that the room is very spacious air conditioned the bathroom is really comfortable complete toiletries TV and reliable wifi 
452836,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, First room which we got was with really wet carpet I suppose something was leaking in the bathroom So the smell was just awful and plenty flies in the room The receptionist changed this room for better one because of that so this was cool but I think it s better to take an eye on such things Also cleanliness should be better for 4 star hotel we ordered breakfast to the room and put the tray to the corridor so our tray was there more than 1 day Also so garbage in corridor next to elevators was just on the floor like the whole day , Hotel location is quite good as there are several tram stops around and this is a quiet neighborhood Rooms are big and I liked the furniture like old style hotels 
452837,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room was not what I expected but still enjoyed my stay Hotel had an infestation of spiders which is the only issue for me , I enjoyed my stay at the best western I would stay again A bit of a distance to the centre but happy that buses trams do travel to and from and also a night bus Perfect hotel 
452838,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Small rooms, Cleaned rooms Wifi works very well Bus 69 direction Shipol airport and trams 7 13 14 direction city center stops near the hotel Good breakfast
452839,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nothing in particular I did think the property was suppose to be closer to town center , Good beds Also very accommodating with my in regards to my special needs The on site restaurant was good value and the meals were well presented and quite tasty 
452840,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The hotel is located quite a bit from the center the area it is in seems kind of dirty and all in all not as nice It is right next to a busy road and during the night a few loud motorbikes disturbed my sleep I was shocked to find out that the hotel doesn t offer free parking to it s guests this should really be changed The hotel wifi also needs improvement and I d like to be able to buy beer bar was closed , The room was large the furniture nice the bathroom exceptional and I really liked the kettle for tea and that the hotel had everything from a comb to a toothbrush not to speak of soap and conditioner for the guests 
452841,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Room too small TV is less than one meter from the bed No late checkout for genius members Have to pay for that per hour Smelly toilet No fridge in the room Luggage are stored behind the reception for few hours only , Close to bus tram stations that take you to the center in 30 minutes Also bus 69 to the airport in 45 minutes Wifi was free and very good Restaurants supermarket opposite the hotel Breakfast was good with many choices worth the 10 euro cost Nice view if your room is in the back of the hotel 
452842,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Could hear shower in next room Would have liked choice of hot chocolate drink , Great breakfast Staff really helpful Really convenient for tram into centre 
452843,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The description said it was close to centre but wasn t, Very nice hotel Said it was close to the centre but was a bit of a trip to get there Would recommend this place though as it was a nice place and public transport is close an good
452844,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, This hotel is tucked well away from the city a 20 minute tram ride and definite taxi back 25 45 one way from the city if you are staying out late There was hardly any wifi signal in the room staff was not very keen to help It wasn t bad but not staying there again I am afraid , I am having to think hard about the good points so that is that 
452845,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Staff were very unhelpful and appeared obnoxious Didnt show any customer service and wouldn t help when asking for directions info about the Centre or even airport info Other guests warned us about this aswell No one was around at 6am to Check us out or order taxi s etc,No Positive
452846,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There wasn t a fridge in our room and there wasn t anything to do in the area It took approximately 30 mins to get to Dam square via tram We found it inconvenient how we had to pay by the hour for a late check out It was 10 euros per hour and we could only stay 3 hours extra after 12 Nevertheless we will be returning to this hotel , The staff were extremely friendly The room was clean Our triple room was spacious 
452847,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There were no full length or even any separate mirrors in the rooms which made it difficult when getting 3 people ready in the morning and evenings as the main mirror was in the bathroom , The beds were absolutely amazing slept solidly every single night Also very quiet in the corridors and you couldn t hear sounds from other rooms or even rooms above which was surprising for such a large hotel 
452848,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location is very poor as well as there is no secured parking even nearby price quality is not matching, Clean rooms and good internet connection
452849,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nois of street Same price 12 50 Euro per day for breakfast for a 5 years old kid Linen in four days did not changed , Near to the bus and tram station Frindly staff Big rooms

452852,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room was not having king size bed though two single beds were joined together Also the room was not ahving any mini bar option which was quite surprising, The hotel was clean and tidy and was very comfortable Also hotel provides information about different city tours which was quite helpful 
452853,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, breakfast needs to be enriched with more things parking place and elevator to it need to be more klean , Room spacious clean and quiet with a canal view Good double bed Girl with curly hair in the reception probably at the evening very helpful on our issues with parking our car 
452854,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Nothing , The pleasant service I like to come to a comfortable room when I am travelling so Best Western always meets expectations Friendly staff Good breakfast No issues 
452855,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The location was far from the center of town This was somewhat offset by the public transportation options Something to consider for elder couples or families with young children , Comfortable with a good variety and quality of breakfast foods The staff was very nice helpful and spoke English 
452856,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, The room was quite spacious for one person It was a direct shot on the bus from the airport and the staff was very helpful On my next trip I plan to stay here again 
452857,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The other room we booked hadnt been cleaned at all just the beds were changed The room itself was tired and dated For the money that was paid thd room wasnt worth it , One of the rooms we booked was good 
452858,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, the staff were very rude On my last day the reception staff was extremely rude The room was not cleaned properly breakfast at 10Euro was a rip off The hotel is far away from the town center and it takes almost one hour on tram Overall I had a very bad experience here,No Positive
452859,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location is a bit far from touristy area Breakfast buffet is good for max 3days stay All repeat menu at least introduce new item The hotel is very basic , The staff were very helpful Breakfast buffet is good Beds were comfy near public transport Good place to stay in Amsterdam if your on a budget

452861,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I thought the hotel was great for the amount I paid , The staff were very reponsive when I approached them about an issue regarding the room service For so reason my contact lense case was discarded They gave us free breakfast for my troubles and also prvoided me a location where I could buy a new one The hotel room was fairly large and was very clean The location was outside the main city but very close to public transportation Also there are nice jogging trails behind the hotel 
452862,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, We requested a double rather than twin room staff could not change our request for the first night of our stay Double room was much better Hotel has a huge number of anonymous but comfortable rooms Staff unfriendly as they are constantly busy The neighbourhood is at least 30 minutes commute from the city Not convenient if you want to visit the city ,No Positive
452863,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, poor wifi connection in the room hotel located in a not particularly nice area taking over 20 minutes on public transport to get to the city centre some sockets in the room weren t working faulty vending machine in the lobby, comfy beds toiletries replenished daily tram tickets available at the reception room rather spacious
452864,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, A mini fridge was missing from room Would have been a convenient fixture , Clean room perfect location quiet calm surroundings Ease of transport outside hotel Friendly neighbourhood 
452865,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, They seem to be charging different rates for each day of the week despite staying in the same room this seems to be standard practice in Amsterdam hotels 85 for Tuesday and Wednesday 115 for Thursday and 150 for Friday evening despite sleeping in the same room They initially put us in a twin room expecting us as a couple to sleep separately We complained and with the help of Booking com and the proof of booking a double room we managed to cancel that booking and make another booking for a double room with the same hotel saving us over 100 All in all it wasn t a good experience to be provided a twin room when the booking email said we would get a double room On top of this charging us 100 more for that unwanted twin room was not a good practice for a hotel in Amsterdam No apologies offered by the staff making us feel like we were battling for our contractual right to stay in the room we booked It took quite a while to settle the problems , It was in a quiet location away from central Amsterdam 
452866,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, It s bit of far But there is bus tram direct to and back from city airport Price abit spicy due to late booking , Friendly stuff quality of bed pillow and comforter Comfortable room 
452867,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, Hi Every thing were excellent except of Internet Rooms usually do not have WiFi access Let me say in Farsi for the visitors from Iran 
452868,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I was surprised that the wifi wasn t working at all second floor I dropped smth in the bathroom and when I bent to pick it up I couldn t help noticing that the under side of the toilet bowl was rather dirty Not that I normally care about it because normally I don t inspect that part of the toilet but nevertheless In my room I had stuff for making tea cups teabags sugar but no kettle That was really disappointing Let s be honest it s a 4 star hotel but a rather shabby 4 star hotel Though on the whole the price quality ratio was still very good , Very comfortable bed Very quiet location Really easy to reach both city centre and the airport by public transport 
452869,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, I reluctantly booked this room as I knew it is not located in the heart of Amsterdam but I was very glad I made this choice The tram is very close by so getting around was never a problem In addition it turned out that I felt ill by the time I got to Amsterdam so I was able to rest comfortably in my room The hotel is very clean and comfy so I would definitely recommend it to other travellers 
452870,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There was very weak wifi at the room we couple with my wife They give us the two single beds , Room was clean Bed was good Location is no bad You can go main station with a bus 
452871,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The trams stop at half past 12 at night and the buses aren t too easy to figure out A map showing the bus lines and where about s to grab them at the hotel would be good , The fact that the tram service runs right down the street and can bring you into the City Center via the 14 tram or into Leidseplein via the 7 tram 
452872,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The kitchen staff could have been a bit more friendly and helpful When we asked for Decaffeinated Coffee they stated they had none then a few minutes later they produced some for us The mushrooms tasted a bit bland and the bacon had way too much fat compared to meat , Rooms were very clean and comfortable The Coffee was good and a good selection of fruit cold meat and cheese for the breakfast 
452873,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The room walls could have been cleaner Seem to remember a similar review But we didn t mention it so who knows if they would have had a scrub down had we complained The breakfast is half decent at best , Great location away from the centre of Amsterdam but close enough to nip back for a change of clothes and a shower before heading back into town for the evening For the price you will not find much better value for money around the city 
452874,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Its entrance was never clean and nobody even care about its dirt hotel appetance is not hotel standard appearance my room didnt have window and i couldn t use AC bec We were having flu then we had to suffer of its poor ventilation,No Positive

452878,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The staff didn t change the sheets during our 3 day stay and anyone going should respect the local customs got told off for taking an open bottle of alcohol into the local chicken fast food restaurant but it was only open because the shop keeper kindly opened it before we left the shop we were not drinking , Like the hotel not too far from central Amsterdam but the area has a large Muslim population so are not as liberal as the people in central Amterdam but very friendly and welcoming
452879,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Location was a bit far from anything to do in the city center Our room was tiny for a quadruple room and there was something smeared on the wall that looked kind of like blood The ceiling above the shower was completely peeled away as well Only Turkish businesses around hotel , Staff and breakfast were very good 
452880,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Room lighting needs serious improvement Stayed overnight so wasnt much of an issue , Clean rooms and bath however they show signs of being an old property Helpful staff and checking in late around 10 at night called the hotel early though wasn t an issue Good view of the water body behind the hotel from our room specially in the morning Location is accesible easily from the city centre 
452881,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Cost was too high Can not justify the value for money charged No parking for big cars Vans, Parking spaces where available near by Tram and bus connection to Centre
452882,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, I Wonder why fey don t redeem d rent via credit card online when I reached der for check in I had to pay the rent in cash , Room s hid clean
452883,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Had to wait for about one half hour to have a kettle replaced despite several reminders , Generally the staff were helpful approachable The room is spacious clean comfortable Location can be considered v good Several Bus tram stops are within walking distances Bus 69 from the airport stops near the hotel takes you to the airport on your return journey That s v convenient 
452884,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Honesty this isn t even a 1 star hotel let alone a 4 star one What a completely worn out dump, Leaving was the best thing no wonder they ake you pay on arrival outside is a dump inside is very tired
452885,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The smoking area is at the door of the hotel everyone throws the butts on the floor and no one cleans it the first impression when you arrive at the hotel is not good The location is not good because it is mainly a turkish area and there is not much to do if you are not turkish But the public transport to the centre of town is excellent , Good breakfast value for money Very attentive staff Modern bathroom Clean room
452886,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Hotel was quite away from the main area of Amsterdam although there was great tram service which took around 20 minutes to get into the centre breakfast was 10 euro and wasn t very nice, reasonably priced and comfortable
452887,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Received bites only after sleeping there potential bed bug infection They should also have more staff ready to assist when the queue is long , The staff were very nice and patient when asked for information The place looked clean 
452888,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Felt rushed at check in and didn t get any advice on transport or attractions Room wasn t serviced after the 1st night No bar service available at bar Shops restaurants were all Turkish near the hotel I d advise to pay a bit more and stay central , Shower good Bed comfortable 
452889,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The road entrance was quite dirty and full of cigarette ends Care should be taken to check regularly and keep tidy Location further from centre than I thought good transport links, bed comfy wifi acceptable tea coffee in room welcome
452890,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The cleanliness was good but not excellent The table where the hot water coffee pot was located in our room seemed a little dusty The tub was cleaned but there was grout on the bottom ledge of the glass that could have been removed We had to pay 15 Euros a day for parking There was no refrigerator in our room The hotel did offer to hold items in the reception area s fridge but we did not think this was practical The food seemed over priced I paid 5 euros for a small tomato soup that tasted like it was right out of a can , The front desk staff were very hospitable and helpful The dinner in the hotel was pretty good My son had a burger with french fries It was prepared well The room we Stayed in was huge It was enough to accommodate my family of four comfortably The location was great It was about 300 meters to the tram and the bus The hotel sold tickets to get on public transportation as well as the museums The directions for taking public transportation was very clear We were able to get to places like the Anne Frank House Dam Square Pancake House The Hard Rock Cafe and the Van Gogh Museum within 20 minutes from the hotel I am picky about cleanliness and safety The overall cleanliness and safety were good The hotel was good I would classify it as a 3 star instead of four stars for expectation management 
452891,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, could be good to have a fridge in the room WiFi working but with a lot of stops and only in some places in the room, Nice neighborhood with supermarket and restaurants next to the hotel You can reach the center of the city using 3 or 4 different buses 
452892,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, No privacy at all Soundproofing was zero You can hear your neighbor taking a bath like he was next to your pillow Walls made of cupboard , Friendly staff good location good wifi acceptable breakfast but not to lose your head off 
452893,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Staff were not very helpful and had to wait at least 10 mins before anyone would speak to you plus booked a double bed never got it at all and there was no attempt to help sort it I understand if the hotels busy but why give u the option to book a double if you don t get one , It s was clean

452899,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There s nothing negative about this hotel it is exactly as it is described It doesn t have a bar or a gym or any leisure facilities but this is not the point of the hotel it is a comfortable place to rest after a long day touring around Amsterdam , The proximity to tram and bus stops that can get you into the city center in 20 mins and to the airport in 25 mins Very clean comfortable rooms with extremely helpful friendly staff

452902,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, The hotel was about a half hour tram ride from the city centre It s in a more residential location which means that there are cheaper options for eating out which is great There is a cafe across the road next door to a library that was so well priced and delicious and not to mention beautiful

452931,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The fire alarm went off at 2 30 am requiring everyone to evacuate the building They should have made a PA announcement when it was safe to go back but instead it was word of mouth from one guest to another how do you know if that is reliable information Apparently a guest was smoking in their room in this non smoking facility Maybe the hotel rules sheet given to each guest should state that the smoke detectors are sensitive enough to react to cigarette smoke on top of noting the 200 cleaning fee charged if guests smoke in their room , Front desk was a little busy but the restaurant waiter was very helpful with our touristy questions Location is somewhat convenient about 3 minutes from the bus stop to get to the airport and it takes around 30 min to get to the airport Also there are busses to go to the city centre although we didn t try that 
452932,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Wifi signal is poor and unstable in my room , Reasonable price big room good range of room facilities Location is ouside the city centre but with such a robust public transportation system in Amsterdam it is not a big deal Plus it s only 30mins to airport by bus 
452933,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square,No Negative, Staffs are really helpful They provided maps of the city They also have the one day ticket for tram and bus to go around the city There s a supermarket nearby to buy sandwich snack and drinks Although the hotel is a bit far from the city but when we go to the city center by bus and tram it ll go round the city just like a hop on hop off city tour 
452934,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, 1 The staff They were very rude and very unwilling to provide any kind of services 2 The room was really dirty and they didn t cleaned it during my 2 days stay I visited Amsterdam for business reasons I went to the hotel at 20 30 pm after a long day in the city and they had me waiting for more than 90 minutes not giving me the room but not cancelling my reservation as well The problem was that i didnt had the pin code of the card with me The women in the reception was really rude not helping at all and mainly not providing any solution at all She said that she have to ask her manager and that the manager was outside and will return 4 hours later At the beginning i tried to find the pin but when that wasnt possible i asked them at least to cancel the reservation so that i could get a new hotel Again she wasnt doing that as well To make things short i had to wait 1 5 hours in the lobby without knowing if i have a room and without any answer from them When i really couldnt wait any more and forced the reception to take an action she told me that i could stay for 1 night my reservation was for 2 days and that tomorrow they will answer what will happen Amsterdam was really full and the options for hotels were really limited i had to go to a long day in work and there i was without knowing if i will have a hotel the next day or not Please just imagine how was that experience The next day i couldnt sleep since i was waiting an answer from them i literally couldnt sleep since i had to find a solution by 7 am but they still didnt do anything The night reception guy was again unwilling to help and told me to wait the morning team The morning reception was at least kind and assured me that i will have the room for the second day When i returned the night they have locked my room I went down to ask for the key and they just gave me another key without saying anything else , The bathroom was the only space that was cleaned enough i hope 
452935,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The place was quite dusty We moved the cabinet to put the beds together and had to dispose of the dust particles underneath it by ourselves Also some kind of dirt could be seen on the wall The pressure of the shower was quite low showering was not a great experience , The friendliness of the staff 
452936,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, we have 3 single bed instate 1 single and 1 double the staff is very rough no nice at all and i think because them have problem with italian guy because after speak with a lot people italian them say to me over there receive the same treatment from other guys from this place the restaurant is expansive is well water you must pay for park and is expansive is well the second day after the day before order dinner with room service who clean the room don t collect back the dirty dishes but leave all in the room , i like about this hotel just the breakfast and the bathroom inside room 
452937,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, There was some problem with shower water did not go out of basin for a long time Also hotel is approx 20 minutes by tram from city center But tram stop is close to hotel , Breakfast was good Room is also OK with air condition Personnel was helpful 
452938,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, The carpeted room floor was very wet in some places and especially smelly no hotel slippers are there so bring your flip flops The bathroom was quite clean but the shower head grip was very loose The safe was closed with no default pin code so I had to wait for the reception to open it , The location is good the reception is well staffed the receptionist was friendy and helpful All three mattresses triple room were comfortable 
452939,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Everything really We booked this place well in advance requested a double bed but all we got in return for our stay was two single beds pushed together A member of staff greeted us at the front desk on arrival as we went to pay the amount for the four day stay Hidden Charge He proceeded to tell us that there will be a City Tax of 18 charged to us on top of the payment Which I questioned him about but in response we got no real solid answer The hotel had a bar to the front which was both derelict closed as another member of staff pointed out She told us if wanted a drink we could have one in the restaurant situated at the rear of the hotel Where we overheard another member of staff talk bad of some other guests staying at the hotel that only wanted to have a few drinks in the bar that was closed Like us There was an overpriced no change vending snack machine in the lobby that had not much seating for guests The area in which we were situated in Amsterdam was both dull depressing which was very overpriced also Area unknown to us before booking They didn t seem to cater for any outsiders on small things such as recognizable foods or any beers so on We even found some of the locals not so friendly There was also a long rough ride to town on their metro system Ticket price for an hour in the city 2 80 or 7 for 24hrs Sometimes the sleeping at night was mostly disturbed due to other guests coming going about the hotel banging doors We were also unhappy with the fact that there was no smoking area set aside for guests but all there was was the outside steps of the hotel in the busy street Then at night out there for a smoke you had to go through their door system of buzzing the door bell to get back in Well lastly I would never recommend this hotel or area to anyone traveling to Amsterdam , Nothing really we were just delighted by the grace of God to vacate this hotel depressing area 
452940,Best Western Plus Hotel Blue Square, Breakfast not included but not a big problem , Very nice personnel They even gave us free tickets to enter Holland Casino in the city center where my colleagues won 3500 Euro
