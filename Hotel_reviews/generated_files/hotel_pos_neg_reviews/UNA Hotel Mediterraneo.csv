478288,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, They allowed us an early check in And the property is only five minutes walk from Porta Romana metro station which goes directly to Duomo and Central Station 
478289,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The room really wasn t like the picture Not sure where that was but I assure you all I didn t see that The lifts were annoyingly slow The room cards were annoyingly unpredictable I had an awesome view from my room of a fire escape if you like that sort of thing , I am struggling to find things to like The breakfast was ok The staff doing breakfast and dinner were good 
478290,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Parking terrible The hotel does not have private parking They tell You to go to parking that is actually so suspicious You need to leave the keys to the owner of the garage and the guy working their is not normal and U get afraid There is PUBLIC PARKING very close to the hotel 250meters Better park there , Like location and clean rooms 
478291,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, We like the location it was very easy to reach any part of Milan by public transportation The hotel has exceptionally friendly and helpful staff The room was comfortable and very clean It was important that the air conditioner worked properly I would recommend this hotel to my friends to stay 
478292,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, Staff is lovely we arrived very early in the morning and they gave us the room immediately Location is 3 blocks from metro station really convenient and if you want to go at night to Navigli for dinner the taxi back to hotel is 15 20 Breakfast buffet is not huge but has several options and all very tasty Several nice restaurants and cafes in the area 
478293,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, We were very happy with the stay and i must say i ve never slept better in a hotel bed before In addition the quality of the breakfast surprised us Really nice food and a wide variety We did encounter a power shortage in the room cause unknown not that it matters We contacted the lobby and they sent a member of staff to check it out We literally waited no more than 30 seconds before he was at our room Big thumbs up from a couple of satisfied Danish guests 
478294,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The room could use a bit more cleaning Some corners showed that the furniture or fixtures were old , The staff were very friendly and accommodating The breakfast was delicious and filling The location was near to a lot of establishments Wifi was fast and reliable 
478295,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Although it s not on a main road there is noise from the traffic at the front when the windows are open If you prefer quietness then request a room at the back , We have stayed several times at this property It is located in a pleasant area with many locals and residences in the streets nearby There are excellent restaurants and access to the subway system is very convenient If you prefer to walk and window shop then the Duomo can be reached in about 20 25 minutes The hotel is not lavish but it is clean pleasant and recently refurbished Book a superior room if you want more space The breakfasts are good 
478296,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, There were not cofee maker in the room , The location was very convenient Tram and metro were very close The room was a litle small but very clean with excellent bedsheets and towels The breakfast very good Nearby there were very good restaurants The staff was great 
478297,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The price per night was high but Milan is an expensive destination Given this the value for money was good Also the room was too small There wasn t enough space for two people , Very clean hotel Bed mattress was comfortable Metro station is 5 min walking away and there are many restaurants around with good italian food The breakfast had plenty of choices and good quality The staff was very friendly and helpful We had a problem with the bathroom and the reception reacted immediately 
478298,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The retro design of the hotel is not my cup of tea Rooms look very old due to yellow curtains Mini bar and room service quite expensive for hotel category Only one set of towels despite double occupancy Long waiting times for elevator , Extremely friendly staff and service personal Excellent breakfast Hotel only 3 stations from center duomo 
478299,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, there were no slippers in the room and it s my own fault that I forgot my hair straightener in the room Wifi was not so fast , we have note regarding our request for 2 single beds however the rrom is one double bed When we requested they couldnt change the room but arranged the room accordingly Stuff is very friendly Also bed is very comfortable and the breakfast is excellent Really excellent dozen of fresh food and options Hotel was very clean and rooms are big enough I will definitely prefer it in my next trip to Milan 
478300,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Lift was very small and 1 didn t work often Hot food at breakfast was cold by 10 00am , Receptionists were so nice and very helpful Room was lovely and big and always cleaned Superior room included mini bar Highly recommended Breakfast selection was great 3 restaurants that share the square with the hotel are amazing 
478301,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, For me personally beds and pillows are to soft But if you like them like that then they are perfect , Location is GREAT 20 min from Duomo if you go on foot Metro station Porta Romana is just round the corner and you are only 3 metro stations from Duomo Furhermore there are couple of great restaurants near hotel my recomendation Abbottega Food for breakfest was good notning special but it will keep you full 
478302,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Breakfast wasn t freshly made bread were hard and scrambled eggs were really cold and limited choices Lots of stairs at the entrance and no help makes it hard if you have luggage Internet very slow Its 10 mins away from duomo by trains but there is a train station 2 mins away from hotel, Rooms are great And near train station
478303,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, The position is perfect for going around the city far 5 minuts from the metro M3 Porta Romana In few minuts you can reach the center of the city Perfect 
478304,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, high steps at the hotel entrance it s a bit difficult if u are carrying a heavy suitcase and there is no porter for assistance , i liked the variety of food offered at the breakfast buffet i liked the quick access and easy to use WiFi Internet connection 
478305,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, no drink water e g elect Water pot supply We arrived late evening shops around were closed when we ask for staff they said only room service for tea or coffee no hot water provided even I ask to paid for it , Good breakfast 3 minutes to metro 
478306,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, If I thought I was going to a three star hotel I probably would have rated it higher No Gym proper restaurant or bar The internet is terrible unless you want to pay more not a tactic I would expect from a four star hotel If you are a person that likes a hot breakfast you will be very disappointed Scrambled eggs that look like a child made them terrible bacon with mini hotdog sausages also a poor choice of cereal Basically my main gripe is they are mascarading as a four star hotel while offering the service and facilities of a good budget hotel , The room was modern clean and of a reasonable size The location is quite good with many nice restaurants just outside the door 
478307,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Parking in the garage nearby is a little expensive but okay for Milan , We stayed for one night in the UNA Mediterraneo What we really liked was the breakfast tasty and fresh huge selection and the friendly and helpful staff who helped us with the luggage Wifi worked well and was free The room was not big but very clean and comfortable with air condition and a big and nice bathroom At night is was very quiet although the Hotel is quite central and one is almost next to the subway We definitely recommend 
478308,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, We didn t like staff at the breakfast They didn t care if something was missing They asked us several times for a room number changing shifts were very noisy and ruined our breakfast Breakfast itself was great but people serving it should be more polite , We enjoyed our holiday there Hotel has quite convenient location and is very well equipped Staff were very nice and helpful at the reception Room was super clean and we had everything what we needed 
478309,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The room key lock was hard to open Less of other facilities and wide lobby due to space At that time money paid is high, Staff are very friendly Cooperative Located near Metro station to connect you easily to center Few food outlets available nearby 
478310,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, placement of single bed in front of desk and chair area made it a bit uncomfortable to work , fantastic location excellent breakfast very helpful staff very comfortable beds parking nearby will definitely book again next trip to Milan
478311,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Personally I would have liked some personalized little touches to the room a colored bedspread decorative pillows a couple of fresh or even dry flowers etc , Excellent location near Bocconi University tram and metro staff very friendly and helpful comfortable beds and fully equipped bathroom Good breakfast even though could add a bit more variety the extra charge for fresh squeezed orange juice well worth it Would definitely stay there again 
478312,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, I hate the way the breakfast is handled the staff is kind but the quality and the variety of the products is really really really bad Value for money Absolutely not , Good location you can take the underground from Porta Romana to go anywhere or if you feel it you can have a 15 minutes walk to the marvellous Duomo of Milan 
478313,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, The heating was too high very hot in the bedroom, The staff at our arrival very nice explain what to visit how to arrived We had a fabolous dinner in a restaurant recommend by the hotel Nice breakfast confortevole bed 
478314,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, No WIFI at all looks much worse than in pictures on booking com noisy rooms doors were almost broken no night bar in 4 star hotel awful coffee at breakfast extremely expensive for such kind of services,No Positive
478315,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, we booked 5 double and 2 single rooms 2 days prior to arrival reception called telling that there is a technical problem and single rooms would not be available in the hotel one option would be accommodating group in 3bed rooms or moving 2 guests to other hotel with number of calls we managed to keep only one single room and the double rooms , good location lots of nice restaurants just across the street metro very close 
478316,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, If I went to Milan again I would consider a different hotel next time It was quite far from the city and the canals area 20 30 minute walk For the cost of the hotel I would have expected it to be closer tot he city The entry of the building was lovely quite well looked after But the hotel room itself looked old and very much like a university dorm It was very small and cramped The bathroom was the same old and small The air conditioning in the room was quite noisy compared to other hotels I stayed in The staff ordered organised a taxi for us when we left to go to the airport Hotel staff told us it was a flat rate of 90 Euros but when we got to the airport the driver demanded we pay 120 Euros This was realty disappointing and frustrating , Complimentary breakfast was good a really good selection of food to choose from and good quality too 
478317,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo,No Negative, Great hotel near Porta Romana Very comfortable and clean with great staff and delicious breakfast Just 5 minutes walk from the metro station Quiet street 
478318,UNA Hotel Mediterraneo, Air conditioning was not going below 27 C and it was 32 outside Staff could not help when we found out as it was already 8 pm Not exactly what I expect in a 4 stars hotel We found a piece big one of ceramic in our scrambled eggs We immediately showed the staff and they apologized and took away the plate where we found it and left the other one nor the tray at breakfast counter I had to call them and explain that we were lucky we found a big piece and did not just swallowed it and that there may be small pieces in the eggs and those are hard to see They did remove the tray and replaced it and brought me an omelette , Location is good very close to subway station Beds are comfortable
