8121,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, As I said the coffee maker didn t work Apart from that I loved it , Perfect location for the Stade de France and Metro to centre of Paris Good bus links to Stade de France bus stop right outside hotel Pleasant walk back to hotel afterwards I loved the diverse nature of the area Coffee maker did not work apart from that the room was spacious clean and comfortable Better than I expected 
8122,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Oh hotel is quite nice but sorry to say the location is terrible not acceptable Hotel should have a shuttle for guests to take them to the closest metro station to avoid walking through the intimidating neighbourhood especially with kids , nice selection for break fast good coffee
8123,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location was far from airport and Trocadero where I wanted to mainly visit Also the breakfast was rubbish Hardly any variety , The bar next door was very convenient and brilliant 
8124,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Hardly any tea coffee in the room and a charge at reception for more for the coffee machine The restaurant attached was very expensive and at night there isn t anywhere nearby to eat you need to take the metro to another area , Breakfast was good room very clean and comfortable and helpful and friendly staff Useful to have microwave etc in room Close to the metro too and there is a cash machine shop and cafe right beside the metro 
8125,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, There are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents Because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family One night we made a group of 4 adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely It is very crazy and it will be worse and worse ,No Positive
8126,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside HOWEVER it is not as severe as any of the reviews I have seen previously Yes there are quite a lot and I can see how some may be slightly intimidated There are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable Police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are , Room is good comfy beds good size bathroom and toilet isn t massive but plenty of room for what is necessary Fridge and microwave so we could store our lunch for the day Area has a franprix and 5 minute walk to the metro so you can buy cheaper food to snack on and get to the centre relatively quickly 
8127,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, I didn t like the fact that it s located close to the refugee asylum seeker camp, Room was sparkling clean food was awesome and staff very nice 
8128,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning Terrible views from the room Unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter , Comfy beds Good room layout 
8129,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Horrible location loud discotheque right under the hotel not so great breakfast on paper plates and cups the breakfast area is in the reception no soaps in the rooms the separate toilet room is very small Overall not worth the price at all , Big rooms
8130,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location We stayed there so our son could walk to an event at salle Pullman les docks , Breakfast was above and beyond never seen anything like it Room was perfect Service was perfect Clean bright everything you could need refrigerator microwave huge bathtub 
8131,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location was terrible I expected more from the Novotel brand I was very disappointed We booked and paid for 3 nights and left after one I have never felt so unsafe in my life , The accommodation was spacious and clean 
8132,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Staffs , Staffs are not good They don t know how to deal with costumer and even not respect They are very rude and talk with bad manner They have to learn some more how to deal with costomers If they still behave like this no one come back in Novetel Hotel never and ever They gang up with taxi and charge us lot of money for only 10 minutes way 
8133,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard , location
8134,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location is in a very economically depressed area There were over 30 homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro The rooms have paper thin walls I not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until 0200 in the morning It was so bad I could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed ,No Positive
8135,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in 5 minute walk We use metro for all our visits ,No Positive
8136,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping There were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area ,No Positive
8137,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location of this hotel is horrible When we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood This hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around When we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station We felt very insecure Staffs were okay but I feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling Few of them were just lazy with their answers Also They don t really smile , The rooms are spacious and nicely designed We also had our little living room which was very convenient And it was clean 
8138,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The walk from the Metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone However would not recommend for single females especially at night , Clean big rooms and very good breakfast
8139,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless While we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe The hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc We did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel So this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there We opted to taxi in most of the time , Rooms were very nice we had a ac issue with one room but the hotel was very responsive to take care of the issue Great breakfast Other than that the facility was excellent 
8140,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside Europe Furthermore there is so much garbage lying around It is the worst neighbourhood I have seen in Paris One does not walk outside feeling safe Staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists Breakfast was not well organized Dirty floor location of food not logical Mediocre food PAPER PLATES , Clean room with decent air conditioning 
8141,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, There are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital We mainly used uber to travel to places , Excellent value for money Very cosy and comfortable Staff were very helpful Very happy with the service provided 
8142,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location as such doesn t look safe specially at night Lot of people homeless near by not judging , Location is far from centre but it s cheap and good also near metro station 2kms and cheap by uber Staff is amazing U can hire wifi for 10 a day good speed and 150 security 
8143,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Where do i start 1 Horrible location Even though it was walking distance from nearest metro Porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 Its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons We reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic We spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 Entrance Thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con , Breakfast was nice really nice croissants cheese yogurts etc
8144,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Where should I start This hotel is rated a 4 star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families The metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area It looks like a war zone The area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel It is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel You have to take taxi to ensure your safety I do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced I asked for a refund and management refused This hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in Paris, The hotel was clean and staff was helpful 
8145,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though , the family room given to us was big the kids got a lotsa room to play around we had a double bed and a single sofa bed with a pull out in the room loves the separate shower area in the bath room the bath tub is extremely clean and the water pressure was good the room was very clean the front desk service gentlemen were really nice On our first night there as there s no nearby food outlets the service guy proactively recommended some food delivery services and provided us some leaflets and recommendation We had nice hot yummy pizzas and Japanese food delivered right to our room the location is about 8min walk to the Metro easy asses to where we need to go 
8146,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Too noisy in the street by night Nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until 3 am Room too hot Area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel Would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant 10 min walk , Breakfast ok
8147,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault Still they are clean and large Breakfast lacks vegetables , Great rooms large clean well equipped Awesome staff several games at reception for kids and not only 
8148,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Terrible parking They let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched Location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea I do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families ,No Positive
8149,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location of the hotel isn t the best, The hotel the staff and everything else is great but the location isn t so good its a really rough area
8150,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, There were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor Nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with If you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout We re still waiting for one 3 weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great , The room was amazing value for money Plenty of room to spread out for a young family Self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay 
8151,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Hotel is located in very rough area of the Paris due to that We had to order unhealthy take aways Unable to explore and experience local area Travel via Uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet ,No Positive
8152,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me,No Negative, The rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either 
8153,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty I was travelling with wife and 2 kids I was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us The reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something I have never seen before, the rooms are clean and cosy the staff are polite and helpful
8154,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good , The room was nice
8155,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite Breakfast selection was poor Same selection every day Staff were not very receptive Room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them , Rooms were clean and spacious 
8156,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Firstly it s located in a bad place Just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population It feels dangerous to go alone in the streets Facilities were ok As it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant But this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant They claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi Rooms weren t cleaned properly Someone s inner were lying inside my room Toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane , It was just an ordinary hotel Didn t turn out to be bad but wasn t able to live to the standards of Novotel The only good thing was that they were able to arrange taxi for you 
8157,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible And in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people This made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night Breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options Hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e No tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room , Rooms were nice and spacious 
8158,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, the room was so hot I could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak I use my data the location was quite unsafe , the hotel was clean and comfort 
8159,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Room appears clean but smelly Bad odour in corridors as well Breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from Parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out The area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy Could not wait to get out of that place ,No Positive
8160,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location is really rough and nothing really around We took uber everywhere to avoid walking around the area as it was really off putting had a lot of beggars Really nice hotel don t know why they would put it in that location, The shower was really nice so was the room 
8161,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The second bed was a bit decieving from the listing We thought we were getting a 2 bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain , Seemed like a newly renovated or just new hotel Great facilities in the rooms 
8162,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend Again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible , Initially counter lady was nice to us but when we asked for 2nd floor room spl request already accepted by hotel due to health conditions she put us on 7th floor not comfortable to us despite repeated requests nothing done we had to stay at friends house for from paris 
8163,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location makes you feel unsecure There were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel The hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway , Good clean towels without visible stains
8164,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location and neighborhood is less to be desired Graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover Please look after your belongings when approached by beggers When traveling at night use VTCs type very reasonable price, Room was very cosy and good standard 
8165,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up Surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people Area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts, Really clean comfy and spacious room 
8166,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Area in which hotel is located is not the best one , Clean facilities are good Espresso coffee machine in room Good Size room Value for money Metro is 8 min walk
8167,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, nothing, everything this is best place to stay very nice people there and they speak more than 5 language it was just perfect very clean nice quipements nespresso caf machine in your room and 3 capsules every morning
8168,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor It wasnt very pleasant to walk over Also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope No explanation why , I liked the big spacious rooms the fridge and microwave in room was very handy 
8169,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it , Great staff spacious and meticulously clean room breakfast started as early as 6 am very close to metro station except constant plumbing noises heard in my room 
8170,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, We have 3 persons when I booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me , The room is comfortable and staff are nice 
8171,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room Our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there Very poor service , It was quiet but that was it
8172,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility But then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall , Closeness to metro station and chick appeal of restaurant
8173,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down Hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out Breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item The same food was brought out that had been out the day before The same Stale quiche had been put out all three mornings I was there , The bed was very comfortable as they always are in Novotel 
8174,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The price is more relative to the location than the hotel Although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times A small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room This didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others , The staff were really attentive and helpful with all queries Hotel quality was really good for the price and there was a good selection of food at breakfast Can t fault the hotel Also had a nice view of the Sacre Coeur from the room Although it is right by busy traffic from main roads the room was silent thanks to two sets of Windows 
8175,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, As a woman travelling on my own I thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant I was also disappointed that the English language TV service in the room did not work as advertised , The room was spacious comfortable and clean The bathroom was well appointed with no frills The staff were helpful 
8176,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The staff were super rude and not helpful at all Half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave When we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it Eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed Also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of Paris in an area full of Drug Addicts and some other unpleasant creatures Better get a room in the centre if you can afford it ,No Positive
8177,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, If you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush, Clean and comfortable beds
8178,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood NEVER even try to book there there were people using DRUGS just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us The staff was not helpful and grumpy On top of this the TV was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators Later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of Paris right next to the dumping ground A BIG NO if you want to stay SAFE ,No Positive
8179,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Slightly small reception Basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of 18 euro all day , superb lovely modern room very comfortable beds Secure and Safe Hotel
8180,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Air con didn t work properly They threw away my water bottle which was on the desk , Lovely spacious room Separate toilet and bathroom 3 sinks Divider in the middle of the room Great location for St Dennis stadium and Gare Du Nord Modern Blackout blinds 2 sets of windows so room was very quiet 
8181,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Parking is super expensive Hotel staff really dishonest We had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill , Room was very spacious clean and stylish 
8182,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, I booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person When explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately She would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and I received was one of the worst I have ever experienced I would never stay here again and I would not advise anyone else to stay here , Nothing 
8183,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, A lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if 10 year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid St Denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what I needed Avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast I and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff Take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle , The hotel was close to a venue we were attending also close to a metro Clean comfortable hotel good size rooms and bathroom No tap end on the bath and room enough for two 
8184,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell There is no aircon Lucky for us it was cool weather but I can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable The area is not safe We walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us We just kept walking faster and went into the metro station It was very scary as we had our 10 month old baby with us We are so grateful the man did not hurt us , The room was a good size Very comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful 
8185,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Paying extra for parking The room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads Lots of people begging and living rough outside, Friendly staff
8186,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around There also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting , The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they had a good knowledge of the area The fact that it was such a direct route for Stade de France we were there for the rugby match France v England 
8187,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, I could not fault anything , Stayed in Paris last year and hotel was poor real disappointment and not what it looked like in photo s We were delighted with this hotel and it really made our stay more enjoyable I would and have recommended it to others since our departure on Sunday The staff were very helpful and friendly 
8188,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than 480 euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms ,No Positive
8189,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area, The bed and room was lovely very spacious and the hotel itself was very clean and well decorated
8190,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere I want to see in Paris Although I did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure , Highly responsive staff New wide clean and comfortable rooms Coffee tea water is complimentary in the room The big table in the room and microvawe is a plus
8191,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Is the worst possible location The hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter Not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station , Hotel looked clean but can safely say this is not a 4 star hotel
8192,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me,No Negative, I booked online for my parents and called the hotel with a couple of requests The receptionist was very helpful and professional The booking and payment went very smoothly My parents said that they loved the hotel and that the room was very nice They also loved the breakfast and booked it for the entire stay 
8193,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or Uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area There is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel Or maybe there s a secret passage that I missed who knows In any case after walking 10 minutes I felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro , Soundproofing was adequate considering that the hotel is located right next to the boulevard p riph rique the highway that goes around Paris 
8194,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Poor housekeeping service Housekeeping staff were not able to understand English Difficult to explain your needs , spacious room Microwave and electric Kettles were provided 
8195,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too , The hotel is good big room nice bed the staff is very friendly So the good part is the hotel 
8196,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone , The room was perfect Staff were fantastic very helpful and couldn t do enough for us we forgot to lock our safe one day and nothing was touched Would recommend this hotel to everybody
8197,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere , Spacious rooms with nice view knowing I was in the 10 th floor with a great bathub near to the metro nice breakfast as well
8198,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard, Rooms were really clean and I am a very fussy person with cleanness but give it 10 10
8199,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, However the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel My family and I didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security I don t recomend , The proximity to the subway was very good
8200,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, the location I would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night, nice hotel comfortable room friendly staff and nice amenities we were surprised there was even a nespresso machine in the room 
8201,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The location is very poor There are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel No taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood There are prostitutes in same area Saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on The view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc No Eifel tower views from my window , The suite was excellent as it had the things I like including espresso machine fridge microwave dining table large bathtub separate shower separate toilet closet extra single bed couch good double bed fairly close to Metro which is the subway system 
8202,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass Would not recommend this Fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways Not good if you re using it as a base to explore Paris attractions Stay somewhere else , Staff delightful with one notable exception 
8203,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Nothing to say all was good, Location to main station was excellent and metro station was near by Staff where very friendly overall a very good place to stay
8204,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, As you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of Paris It is not far to get into town once you reach Porte de la Chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed Let s just say I wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless I am in a group of 5 guys There are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around Porte de la Chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there Gym needs to have some weights and a bench Aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups I suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay , Great amenities and very clean room Good base for us to visit all the tourist sites Nothing exceptional about this place but great value for the price if you compare to other accommodation in Paris 
8205,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, very bad service the door card did not work twice have to go down from 7th floor to the service disks staff members don t feel any sorry about the door card did not work no sorry don t care customer s feeling,No Positive
8206,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The air condition is not working Poor in every thing, The hotel is no air condition it s too hut you can t sleep or stay in room no way to get more it s better to look for another hotel
8207,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Outside the hotel too many migrant and not good location, Hotel was nice and clean
8208,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me,No Negative, The place is well connected to all tourist spots in the city
8209,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Homeless activity around hotel tents, bed very comfy location good for access to airport local to tube station
8210,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, The hotel was further out than described and surrounded by migrant tent communities , The layout of the rooms was comfortable 
8211,Novotel Suites Paris Nord 18 me, Staff attitude, Location
