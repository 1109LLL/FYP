431720,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The air con in the room was very loud and didn t keep the temperature very low during the night although it was very hot outside , The rooftop pool and bar were really lovely 
431721,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Couldn t locate the access to the stairs on the third floor Signs indicating where the stairs are would have been very helpful especially if there was an emergency , The breakfast spread was sumptuous

431724,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Didn t like that when I booked the accommodation I asked for special requests and didn t get them atall even tho It was my engagement and Boyfriends birthday the room had the worst view And to top it off there was no shower in the room so we had to wait half n hour for that to arrive and that took time off Are day and we didn t have long here atall As we came to check out we asked if we could extend are room or even have somewere to shower etc all that was available was he swimming pool I didn t find this place very helpful as they didn t even try and help I m gutterd as I enjoyed the actual hotel but it will take a lot for me to want to stay again as I love Barcelona, Room was clean and comfy beds

431728,Catalonia Eixample 1864, There was a drainage smell in our room for all our stay We used to open the terrace for it to go away but it always welcomed us every time we went out and came back in , Room was great and facilities were very good Also location is perfect being in the middle of everything and every attraction can be reached by walk

431731,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Facilities poor no kettle in room rooms very dark and look into other rooms so therefore curtains need to be kept closed no air conditioning in chill out area and smoking area , Roof top pool and location

431737,Catalonia Eixample 1864, 1 I had to pay my full 4 day stay upon arrival I travel a lot and this practice is a rather akward one Thta kind of makes you feel that there is not the minimum trust that you will pay at the end of the stay which there is in all other hotels worldwide where I have travelled so far 2 No air condition was turned on coming home every evening the room was fully dark and hot like a stove 3 I had taken 2 items from the from mini bar a tiny 0 25 cl bottle of still water a small chocolate rice bar Total price 11 25 euros That is not only too expensive but a dishonest ripp off ,No Positive
431738,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, The hotel is in a nice part of Barcelona nice little eateries supermarkets and tourist attractions are easily accessible from here we walked to most of them Underground car parking at the hotel was easy The bed was very comfortable 
431739,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Not only was the hotel room dirty with a bathroom that clearly hadn t been cleaned the staff was the biggest disappointment The staff was disrespectful and impolite talked to us in the least pleasing way possible In this hotel long gone is the time where you speak with clients in a nice and respectful way everything is done with violence I don t know if I am allowed to name employees but my complaint wouldn t be complete without this Jordi A special thanks to you for being the worst reception staff member I have met in my life for treating me and my brother in the worst way possible during check out The hotel would be a better place without you working there And this remains a euphimism It is clear that we will never set foot again in this hotel And neither should you , The hotel s location is excellent

431743,Catalonia Eixample 1864, A minor thing but I hate shower curtains really unhygienic and should be replaced with glass but that s true for all hotels still with curtains , Bathroom was for for use except dated 
431744,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The selection of drinks at the pool terrace bar were very limited and when asking for a cocktail they had ran out of most spirits so only had wine , The roof terrace is lovely big comfy beds and the staff are very helpful 
431745,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Some Bathroom tiles had black stuff First day complained about the air conditioning and it could not be fixed till the next day Could have used another chair or small sofa chair One of us had to sit on the bed , We did not use the facilities The room was large had a full length mirror decent size bathroom Accommodated us with a king size bed at check in Smoking outside areas provided within the hotel since there are no balcony s in the hotel 
431746,Catalonia Eixample 1864, When we asked for a taxi to be organised you ordered a private company which was 20 euro more expensive than a taxi We were not very happy about that s , Did not eat at the hotel 
431747,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Very expensive for what we got I wish I stayed somewhere else to save I wanted to splurge on the balcony with pool room but it was not worth it The pool was empty 2 out of the 3 days we were there and the balcony had no view I don t recommend this room at all get a less expensive one , I loved the bed Friendly staff Good location 
431748,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, The hotel is close to metro station which makes it easy to get to different parts of Barcelona The staff were friendly and breakfast was great Lots of little restaurants within less than 5 minutes of hotel to get you out and about 
431749,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Breakfast buffet disappointing especially for the price Noise levels within hotel high could hear people above and next door not good , Bed comfortable Shower pressure very good View after asking to move rooms great
431750,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We paid to have breakfast for the seven days but food could have been hotter Selection also could have been better for what we paid compared to other hotels we have stayed in the same area , We had room with a terrace which was good as rooms are quite small Hotel is in good location for centre and the beach 
431751,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was very dark due to the window on the internal yard and it was not possible to open the window therefore the smell was not fresh The elevators 2 for a big structure were often crowded and there was not easy access to the stairs especially to go on the terrace reachable only by using the elevator , The position and the terrace on the roof
431752,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I requested feather pillows three times then gave up The staff were very average and so was the hotel The interior was very dated and felt dirty Noisy room from the plumbing a c and road Bad smell in the room through out our stay Long waits at reception desk even though there were queues ,No Positive

431754,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The air con in the room was very poor Even with it on at max fan speed and lowest temperature setting the room was too warm and this was in early June Would not like to be staying there at the height of summer Thought the room and bathroom would be a bit more spacious at a rate of 220 per night , Excellent location for sightseeing and public transport breakfast also excellent nice rooftop bar also 
431755,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No Water provided No Coffee sachets provided Hotel charging INR 30 000 a night and a client staying 5 nights at least basic water and coffee sachets should have been provided every day , The staff were very helpful especially the staff at the reception young kids doing an excellent job Very helpful 
431756,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Staff responsibility towards the guests , I left my cloths in the hotel in a hurry as I had another booking with the hotel after a day so its hotel responsibility to take care of your guests and their belongings but it didnt happen Its realky shameful how a 4 Star hotel reacts 
431757,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Hot food was cold At checkout challenged on 2 occasions by staff to pay bar bills that some joker had booked to my room , Clean and modern hotel in ideally situated for centre Good secure underground parking 
431758,Catalonia Eixample 1864, This is a big and noisy hotel Marbel flooring in all the hallways so the sound of high heels suitcases and housekeeping would carry really well especially at night My room was faced away from the street but not to a backyard It was faced around the elevators which were pretty noisy when in use which was pretty much all the time When I opened the window my room would smell of sigarettes The hotel has a smoking area om the bottom floor not very ideal for us who like fresh air No heating in the bathroom floor This IS a good and modern hotel but I found it to hard to relax there Will not revisit , Great location Good size room with bathtub Really serviceminded and helpful staff 
431759,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Our room was really dark as it looked onto a wall of another set of rooms Couldn t open the curtains no privacy if you did , Modern clean and good sized rooms

431762,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Gee maybe a tour on one of the yachts in the harbor LOL, The staff here was top notch Loved the room also spent time on the roof top terrace which was very nice We had coffee at the adjoining coffee bar every day as well as some beers after our long walks The girl waiting on us was so accommodating Front desk people were so helpful with directions advise on tapas bars etc The location was great Loved the BIG pillows Was a little nervous when booking in a foreign country but this hotel could not have been better Would stay again with no hesitation 
431763,Catalonia Eixample 1864, For the price not good value No view no coffee and tea facilities in the room despite me asking for them breakfast very silly price Bed was not the romantic double requested but two singles pushed together fell down the gap a couple of times , Very clean and simple great hot water quiet
431764,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Complementary water and tea coffee in the bedroom would have been appreciated for this standard Room was a bit dark and with a vis a vis on another room , Very nice hotel great location in a quiet area but close to Plaza Catalunya and 2 Gaudi houses Sunny terrace with small swimming pool on the rooftop Possibility for a late check out against a small fee 
431765,Catalonia Eixample 1864, My idea of a 4 star hotel based on my experience is far from what that hotel offered Small room poor hotel facilities roof top space opened until 8pm that s a joke I would expect much better for the price , One and only advantage of the hotel is its location Very nice surroundings with lots of restaurants and within walking distance to major turist attractions 
431766,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Nothing I didn t like about the hotel and location , The location excellent for sightseeing and shopping Loved the sitting area outside on the pavement Very quiet for the location Great for walking which we did lots of 
431767,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Free WiFi was available but couldn t access my emails due to security issues Satellite TV was poor quality transmission jumped and skipped , Professional and courteous staff Clean and comfortable room Decent but not fantastic breakfast e g fruit yoghurt fresh coffee cereals cold meats but only one choice of eggs scrambled Gym and plunge pool an unexpected bonus 
431768,Catalonia Eixample 1864, For a 4 star hotel all the decoration was pretty old not modern at all the breakfast wasn t included The room was pretty basic there were no toothpaste in the bathroom the customer experience Could be better, The bed was very good comfortable and big The staff was kind and friendly Location very good
431769,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Better communication between reception and the restaurant We were told by reception we did not need to make reservation for Saturday evening When we went to the restaurant they were fully booked and did not really offer any help to accommodate us so we went out of the hotel to eat , We did not eat anything in the hotel 
431770,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The beds were hard and slid on the floor when sitting up at night The front desk staff were pleasant but not very knowledgable about local activities amenities etc the breakfast buffet was mediocre in quality and choice apart from nice bread When the room was cleaned a used tea cup was washed in the bathroom sink and left to dry there very average and not a four star experience I would not recommend to a friend apart from location and would advise against paying for the breakfast option , The location the balcony and the view from the balcony
431771,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Staff were a little stand off ish Room altho perfectly functional were very small , Breakfast selection was amazing Very attractive looking hotel It was extremely clean
431772,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Room temperature was a little on the warm side but this may be as we hadn t mastered the air con Some of the rooms were a little dark just because of their location in the hotel they were shaded quit a bit But you re not in your room for very long so it s fine , Staff were friendly efficient Overall look of the hotel was lovely Roof terrace was fantastic Location was perfect Infrastructure was excellent 
431773,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, Handy for metro stations Clean beds comfy and friendly staff Never had breakfast as overpriced and get a coffee and croissant for 2 euros from many nearby cafes 
431774,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The hotel is a little tired and in need of updating Considering what we paid I do not feel we had value for money Wardrobe only big enough for 4 hangers Hair dryer in bathroom very old No tea coffee facilities in the room , Nice bed
431775,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Unfortunately there was not much light coming through the window because of the direction the sun was coming from and the height of the building across But I spend most of the day outside so that was okay , The staff was very friendly and eager to help The standard room had a really really comfortable bed the bathroom was very clean The cleaning staff was very friendly too and did a great job keeping the room clean and tidy The area around the hotel is perfect to stroll around you can easily reach shopping streets and touristic points by foot if you re not a lazy bug 
431776,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Metro station is a 10 minute walk away , After I got a very noisy room next to a room being renovated the very friendly staff gave me a room on the other side of the hotel and it was very quiet I did sleep so well during my stay 
431777,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We requested a smoking room and it was a room with a large window that led out to other rooms there was no air so the smell of cigarettes in room was awful I traveled with a smoker We thought we would of had a balcony for a smoking room , The beds were comfy staff friendly
431778,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room next to ours was under construction The constitution workers woke us up at 08 30 three days in a row It was like a building site When we complained they said that they had no idea that the workers start drilling before 10 o clock such a lame excuse This whole experience was really bad since we were on vacation and we couldn t get a decent sleep They shouldn t give you this room when they are renovating the one next to it and there is banging all the time Thanks to God that we weren t there during the day cause it would have been even more frustrating As a compensation we were given a free breakfast on the last morning The room itself was okay and the bed was nice apart from that it is more like 3 starts than 4 , Good location comfortable bed 
431779,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Music at breakfast and in the lifts One sneery member of reception staff other staff were great , Comfortable great breakfast good tea Very good location 
431780,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The only thing was rooms open into a courtyard where people smoke and of you use the window the smell comes up Bring your own shampoo conditioner only have a one use all body product which is typical in Europe , Amazing front desk staff We had a little issue in room when we arrived and literally in minutes it was resolved Made us feel very welcome and appreciated as a customer Vako the young man at front desk is amazing If everyone cared that much and went the extra mile for their customers we d have a perfect world Also deck is nice and cafe bar at front of hotel a nice convenience All staff were great bellman door desk well trained staff 
431781,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We arrive in the morning bit tired the reception head was teaching student or a beginner its took long to check in bit shocking no greetings no smile just cold face how could new girl learn there was no complementary water battles in the room no shampoo or soap was replace second day for a 4 star hotel , It was convenient to walk near shopping area and bars restaurants The room was clean good size bed as requested The only girl at the resection was very helpful with smile

431783,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Some noisy guests around mid night bad room was ok just a bit on small side, Price Good bed good internet OK new gym Location Garage big enough for Barcelona city standards
431784,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Better English language TV would have been good , A relaxed and friendly staff make for a carefree stay The breakfasts are superb and definitely worth the money Terrace rooms have nice view of the square Good shops all in walking distance 
431785,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Room with window on inner courtyard Temperature in room too hot and not manageable Rooms are small More a 3 than a 4 star rating, Great location underground car park friendly staff at reception
431786,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, The Bed was huge and really comfortable I thought the pillows were also great The staff were very helpful and we were recommended a great restaurant for dinner

431790,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Some staff were very friendly and helpful and others were not The staff were quite variable It would be nice to have a warmer welcome in the breakfast room a smile would be nice and for staff not to argue with guests but rather discreetly check things out before responding It seemed as if some staff were doing a favor for guests rather than being paid to provide a service The room cleaning was variable It seemed to decline the longer I stayed even though I was paying the same daily rate Start as you plan to continue so there is no change in the service provided , Some staff were absolutely lovely and extremely friendly and helpful The location is terrific and overall I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this accommodation 
431791,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Nothing in particular , Very clean and comfortable room Excellent location and I could walk to a lot close to public transport for things further away The rooftop terrace has a good view 
431792,Catalonia Eixample 1864, They didn t clean the room properly Never use here they don t change the bed sheets Disgusting They only change the amenity and towel No more than that , The receptionist was good
431793,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No fault what so ever, Staff were great pet friendly Loved the roof terrace Great location 3 min walk from the main high street And breakfast variety spot on we will be going again
431794,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was much too hot especially at night and the air con wasn t powerful enough to cool the room so we sweated for five nights , Excellent hotel but in the wrong place We had understood it was IN Las Ramblas not fifteen minutes walk away 
431795,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Reception was very busy with one receptionist answering the phone and attending to clients so one could not be in too much of a hurry, Room was warm and comfortable on a rainy day in Barcelona
431796,Catalonia Eixample 1864, One day there was a seminar and the environment got a bit chaotic plus smell of food was everywhere , Good location Friendly and helpful staff pleasant interior
431797,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I missed the manual shaver in the bathroom, Hotel is very closed to Plaza Catalunya therefore it has a very good connection to the airport bus 5 min walking and three subway lines Personnel is nice and in the room there anything you need Very calm and comfortable 
431798,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Nothing Was all great , Very clean modern big rooms with great facilities Everything you would want or need inside Staff very welcoming and helpful Love the roof top terrace with the see through pool Little nice touches was the free water and chocolates in the room We also had a huge terrace attached to our room which was now to relax outside in private Location is right in the centre and near everything beach town centre tourist attractions all within walking distance Easy to get to from where the airport bus drops you off at the centre Excellent value for money Would definitely stay here again 
431799,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Four star should have coffee and tea making facility in room Room was basic Asked for a room with a terrace or balcony but didn t get one despite having an email saying available , Staff helpful good location
431800,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The rooms are small The bathroom was so small you have to sit on the toilet sideways The service from staff is very slow Great if you are with friends and want to chat Not so good if have had a big day of walking and just want some dinne shower bed Breakfast on the first day was outstanding However the next few days this was not repeated My advice go early because once the tray is empty it is not refilled , The Hotel is only a short walk to the old town 
431801,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Travelling with another woman we had asked for single beds but had to spend 2 nights of 5 in a huge double bed then 3 nights in 2 singles pushed against each other so little difference The young receptionists seemed unsure of processes so were slow The restaurant menu had 4 cod dishes in the Fish section More variety would be good , Comfortable beds kettle tea coffee facs toiletries safe double double glazed terrace doors so completely sound proof from traffic Just 2 blocks from main street Passeig de Gracia Would stay there again but in a cheaper room We were on the top floor 
431802,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The price is too high compared to the quality of services Few electrical plugs in the rooms Wifi relatively slow , Relatively large room for Barcelona Good situation 
431803,Catalonia Eixample 1864, A bedroom space that was user friendly Possibly the worst layout of wardrobe access Rm 611 I have ever experienced Mirrors should never be on sliding doors with a safe that when it was open prevented the doors from closing , Good location Friendly Helpful staff 
431804,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Rooftop pool very small, Extremely clean and convenient location for shops restaurants and walking to various attractions this can take at least an hour or so if your heading to the port and sea front from hotel 
431805,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Nothing special I could noticed , Ideal location at more or less 5 to 15 min from the renown places by taxi Friendly welcoming and helpful staff Great amenities such as a small but nice fitness room and a splendid rooftop swimming pool get some snacks and a nice bottle of wine for sunset time worth it a must see Haven t tried the food or breakfast but seems decent for what I ve seen 
431806,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Some equipements are old eg the aircondition noisy when operating The price is relatively expensive , location is very good close to the two Gaudis and shopping area a lot of restraunts surrounding and public transports are nearby The staffs are very very nice and helpful really thanks them very much And everyday the hotel provides a big bottle of water and chocolates which is warm 
431807,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was really a corner and rather small Moreover it was a bit dark as it has only a small window The furniture felt old The sound proofing is really bad We heard people coming late at night and room service cleaning up early in the morning It was very loud and and we could not sleep For almost 200eur night for the double room it felt overpriced The check in was way too long It took more than 15 min to check in and there was not even a line Two reasons 1 the receptionist was waiting for the other two to finish another check in that was taking forever as well to ask a question before starting my own check in 2 their computer system was very slow , The lobby bar is nice and cozy and has good service sandwiches tapas coffee The hotel is very well located in this upclass area of Barcelona 
431808,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The staff was extremely rude and indifferent for several requests I have paid the usual fair yet they gave me a handicap person room where the bathroom light was keep on flashing like a discoball and the bath drain wasn t working When I asked for a change I had to fight all the way through it until I have got another room Requesting a late check out felt as if I am asking for free car to the airport The hotel would do way much better if they manage to teach the staff to be more friendly more happy and more welcoming , The hotel was very vibrant the building itself the area and the rooftop 
431809,Catalonia Eixample 1864, we got a smoking room although asked for regular room eventually were moved to regular inner looking patio room would not choose a room like that definitely not for the price paid , good freindly staff
431810,Catalonia Eixample 1864, It was all good , The staff were always helpful and efficient The location was an easy walk to Passeig de Gracia and Rambla de Catalanya Lots of lovely cafes and restaurants nearby Swimming pool was a little luxury after a day of sightseeing Loved it Would happily stay there again 
431811,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No air con in main part of hotel weak air con in rooms Rooms very small inward facing not especially comfortable Tiny pool not very sanitary , Great location nice roof terrace good sized beds 
431812,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I would prefer it if the sides of the pool were not see through and if the terrace was open a bit later as it is currently closed after 8pm , The beds were comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was lovely with easy information for different dietary needs gluten and dairy free The roof terrace was very relaxing and a nice place to rest after a day sightseeing or sunbathe 
431813,Catalonia Eixample 1864, , Overall set up excellent food ambience and the historic buildings around Most places of interest accessible by public transport or within walking distance
431814,Catalonia Eixample 1864, It would have been nice to been offered a pot of tea or coffee at the table rather then help yourself from a machine , Good choice of breakfast Staff friendly and hotel very clean 
431815,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The bathrooms were very small The bedrooms were small too and it took ages to get cocktails to the rooftop Air con was outdated, Loved how helpful the staff were and their rooftop pool it was very cozy The bed was amazing and the view from the view keeps you busy The hotel s location was perfect with good restaurants nearby 
431816,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Pool was nice and relaxing But wouldve been even nicer if slightly bigger and deeper , Bed was superb Extremely comfortable Iron was also handy and surprisingly good 
431817,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Just a minor issue but it would have been helpful if there were some hooks in the bathroom to hang towels and more shelf space for clothing in wardrobes , Nicely decorated apartment in minimalist Scandinavian style High ceilings with tall windows let a lot of light into the apartment Special mention and thanks to Carlos at the front desk who was very friendly and helpful and chatting with him in the morning to get advice directions etc was a great way to start the day Metro is only a few steps away which is a big plus 
431818,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We only ate in the restaurant once and did not like it I had cannelloni and have never tasted anything like it it was disgusting We never seen the restaurant busy I suggest changing your menu and lowering our prices , Excellent location friendly and very helpful staff Good choice for breakfast Most attractions are in walking distance and we got a 5 day metro ticket to see the sights these can be bought at the metro station for 32 euros and the trains are very clean Lots of eating places near to the hotel Pool is not big but is it great for cooling off 
431819,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Absence of balcony very slow elevator Chairs in the room were damaged and need replacement , Hotel is located in Barcelona Center very close to Plaza Catalunia but in very quiet street Staff was very supportive and friendly Breakfast was good but the same every day 
431820,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I visit Barcelona twice for year and always in your hotels I think the breakfast is very expensive for what you offer I found less choice in the cakes almost nothing anymore and before was not so , the bed is really comfortable and all the employers are kind 
431821,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Cleaning of the rooms was below standard Top shelf of cupboard full of dust and previous guest plastic bag Next day the bath had not been cleaned, beautiful building great location near Paseo de Gracia Rooms of good size and up to modern standards for Barcelona efficient if not very attentive staff 
431822,Catalonia Eixample 1864, room is average not super top I guess in accordance with the level of this hotel wifi took some time to connect but staff help me very well, staff and their kindness
431823,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The apartment would benefit from having a kettle but only a minor drawback Convenient location although not a particularly scenic location views of main highways and a car showroom garage 15 min walk to nearest beach and cafe not too much of a hardship Owners really welcoming would definitely stay again , Lovely contemporary apartment very comfortable and well presented Air conditioning was a real bonus Very convenient for town beaches and shops Would definitely recommend 
431824,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Extremely tiny pool It s not a swimming pool More like a glass enclosed oversized tub Some may consider it a cooling off amenity , Hotel location within 5 minute walk of Passeig de Gracia Quiet room A C operated well Soundproof windows Bar tapas menu though limited was well prepared Generally friendly efficient staff 
431825,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Bedroom felt very dark cramped no view from window looked out at brick walls , Staff very helpful friendly Comfortable beds good breakfast choice 
431826,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Expensive for what you get Remember to take shampoo conditioner etc as only basic bathroom extras Room pretty small and not well aired Breakfast fine but pretty basic Not enough staff at times can wait 10 minutes to get answer to 1 minute question due to que at reception , Good location Very easy to get around the city Pleasant and helpful staff though one person to cover reception and consiege not enough Clean though a bit ramshackle in places 
431827,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Gym was very basic and pool area a little tired , Location was spot on and you could walk to centre and catch many metro Pool area was nice to have after a bit day sight seeing 
431828,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Pool area too small for size of hotel Bathroom grubby Do not disturb signs would be good , Staff very helpful and friendly Close to Metro station 
431829,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The pool was a bit small and there were not very many lounge chairs for sitting in the sun , The staff was extremely helpful and friendly The room was very quiet The location was excellent 
431830,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Pool ok but it is a fish pond Gym which is very small was also out of order , Breakfast was very good Staff were very helpful in reception housekeeping and restaurant Location is close to shops and metro and not bang in city center 
431831,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Air conditioning was not the best , Fantastic location in the Eixample area Very close to cafes restaurants and the sights of Barcelona Reception staff Vako and Anna were excellent and very helpful with information on the area and very accomodating with our needs 
431832,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, Perfect location in the city center of Barcelona Extremely kind staff very good service Only for the staff I would book this hotel again Also a perfect room and comfortable beds Would recommend this to everyone 
431833,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The only downside was the lack of sound insulation The inner rooms are so close together and if the Windows are open then you can hear everything going on next door , We booked at short notice The pool on the terrace was magic the room was super The staff were most helpful Loved the location All of the key sights were easily accessible by Metro Shopping was in the doorstep 
431834,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We travelled for friend s hen do and all the party members arrived at different time Couple of our friends arrived on Saturday around 2pm when the check it starts and where told that the room they booked is not yet ready as the guest who is currently staying in it is refusing to leave didn t show up for check out They were told the issue will be solved an hour and they were offered free drinks vouchers and temporary room so they could leave their luggage and change Then we all spent the rest of the afternoon on the beach returning to the hotel around 8pm It turned out their room was still not vacated by the previous guest and the hotel staff told them without any sign of apology that they will have to stay in their temporary room as there is nothing they could do until the other guest shows up for check out The room my friends booked was an upgraded room and they were placed in a standard The hotel staff s attitude was this is what it is deal with it rather than apologising and trying to make things better After an argument that started the male receptionist decided to finally call the hotel manager for advice and after spending 10 min on the phone came out of the office and decided to talk to a different customer completely ignoring us When we were finally attended again we were told once again there is nothing they can do about the other guest and that my friends will have to stay in the temporary room however they will refund the difference for the night and move them to the correct room the next day They were also offered free dinner at the hotel restaurant but we came as a group and had our reservations made at different restaurants No other compensation was offered The next day our friends decided to use their free drink vouchers at the bar , Location
431835,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The customer service was abysmal I travel regularly and I have never been treated the way I was at this hotel I booked a room with a terrace which was not available when I checked in 2 hours after check in opened because they could not get in contact with the previous guest to ask him to leave 8 hours later after spending the day at the beach my room was still not ready as they still couldn t get in touch with him No apology No proper explanation since clearly they have a key and can remove the trespasser so we stayed in a non terrace room our whole trip Anyway they gave us 2 welcome drink vouchers when we checked in so we decided to use them the following night before dinner We asked the barman what we were allowed to have and he said anything so we ordered 1 amaretto and 1 gin and tonic As I lifted them from the bar to take them to my table another barman appeared and said the first one made a mistake and we had to pay for the drinks since they were not part of the welcome voucher options Obviously I replied to say since the mistake is yours and you cannot pour the drinks bank into the bottle surely you can t make us pay for it He insisted I refused to pay so he poured the drink down the sink I have never experienced such a petty response from someone in customer service The bar man was called Rajib and he was awful Who does that At check out we asked to speak to the manager which we had done every day He apologised for the above and offered to give us anything we had taken from the mini bar off our bill but we hadn t taken anything from the mini bar No other offer of a discount was made instead The worst customer service I have ever experienced and when we were checking out we could overhear other guests complaining too I have never posted anything before but I m doing this to help people Please do not stay here Barcelona is beautiful and this hotel ruins it , The location was pretty good as it was walking distance to two of the Gaudi houses and La Rambla 
431836,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The view from each of our 3 bedrooms was described on booking com as having both a city view and garden view All of our rooms looked out onto another wall of the hotel and you only had a view into other peoples rooms , Very comfortable beds all had a good night sleep
431837,Catalonia Eixample 1864, May have been a little overpriced The room is small everything is really tight Can t get any space by the pool which is a shame because the roof top pool is really nice area nice view but hardly any room to lounge , Really great staff very friendly 
431838,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Hot breakfast Bigger cups for tea Hot scrambled eggs Table not to be completely cleared when I went to the counter to get something Bigger variety than 5 different kinds of sausages Did not think the room we cleaned very well Not enough beds by the splash pool which was called a swimming pool which it is not Day staff at reception not at all helpful Night time staff two ladies were very helpful No literature to guide for daily trips Couldn t get on to email account Expected better from a four star, The bed was comfortable Anna a receptionist was very helpful with showing us where to go but that was after being there a few days Centre location
431839,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Air con in one of our rooms didn t work very well , Great pool area with attentive bar staff reasonably priced drinks Very comfortable beds clean bedrooms 
431840,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Pool much smaller than picture and not enough loungers, Great location good restaurants nearby Room a bit small but beds really comfy very quiet air con good and maid service excellent
431841,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was very small for 3 people 1 adult 2 teenagers all twin beds The window faced a VERY small interior courtyard so you couldn t open the curtains unless you wanted people in the glass elevator or other rooms to see directly into your room Would not recommend for 3 guests Hotel buffet breakfast was expensive so try to get it included in your overnight rate or go to one of the great pastry coffee shops nearby , Convenient location nice small pool deck on the roof Quiet for sleeping English speaking staff at reception 
431842,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Everything cost a little more At no point during the booking process was it made clear that I would have to pay more for two single beds But that is what happened when I arrived ,No Positive
431843,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The Rooms were tiny we booked two adjacent rooms as we have two children but the rooms were not connected and very small The room was poorly appointed and the bed was worst with broken springs and uneven feel We booked the hotel for 3 nights but checked out just after first night The hotel staff was trying to be helpful but the language was a big barrier and even getting simple items like Coffe Mugs was a challenge and we were provided paper cup from the coffee machine , Staff was extra helpful but that could not overcome the hotel issues
431844,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I didn t like the coffee , The balcony was huge and the room was clean comfy and pleasant Loved it location is also great close to everything by walking distance 
431845,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We were offered a discount on the breakfast at the hotel Better to have breakfast included in price , Very good located hotel a few blocks from Placa Catalunia Small pool and sunchairs on the roof 
431846,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Interior is tired and old Pool is too small and there wasn t enough deck chairs or sufficient sun umbrellas Lifts were slow and not efficient in picking people up Gym is very limited not really fair calling it a gym as it has only running walking machines , Location is very good Staff were very attentive 
431847,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Had to pay in full at check in They would not accept a ore authorisation on my credit card Strang for a hotel if this standard Room was a bit small but ok Room had an odour Air con was a bit noisy , Comfy hotel Large breakfast selection Has a pool but it s small Looks bigger in the photos
431848,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No coffee in the room , Great location friendly and helpful staff The breakfast was not free but we were given a special promotional price Great selection of food Given a bottle of water 
431849,Catalonia Eixample 1864, During our stay the air conditioning wasn t working properly although the staff were very understanding and obviously trying to rectify the problem The pictures on the website were a little misleading in regards to the size of the pool just a plunge pool really and the rooms I d expected a balcony or at least a view but we got rooms facing the interior with a view of the lifts , The location was very convenient beds were comfy roof top pool area was nice even though the pool was very small The breakfast selection was excellent The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating 
431850,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The balcony for our room could have done with 2 sun loungers as it was a room for 2 The tv channels did not relate to what was on the card so for example the football should have been on Channel 5 but was on Channel 5HD located on 79 It was a bit counter intuitive and reception weren t able to help , Very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived at reception We were early but they gave us towels and we went to the very sweet rooftop pool while we waited At reception they gave us a map and used a highlighter to mark where we were and how to get to a couple of places no big deal but really useful and done with no fuss 
431851,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Terrible bed Two singles pushed together and one kept tipping up if you leant on the end of it , Staff were excellent very helpful Lovely roof top terrace and the guy behind the bar was really nice 
431852,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I felt it was quite overpriced for what it was the room was very basic in addition there wasn t a huge selection on the menu at the rooftop bar and you are not allowed to bring food drinks from outside to the terrace , The roof terrace was a nice addition along with the pool although it didn t have a deep end and was definitely not big enough for more then 10 people Once you familiarise yourself with the location it is quite a good location 
431853,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We had an issue with booking the room and the hotel wouldn t let it slide which I thought was poor customer service to start with Then the receptionist offered us complimentary drink vouchers and told us to get a beer When we went to the bar they told us only wine or water was available with the voucher which was a disappointment The room was spacious but offered very little light and there was also a tile hanging loose off the wall in the bathroom behind the shower Then the rooftop pool was nice but on the first day we went up to find no staff to serve at the bar The staff were also unprepared to give change and there was a shortage of loungers at the pool as well All in all the friendly staff and location were not enough to entice me back to this Hotel and I won t stay here again , Although there was an issue with my booking the staff were friendly and offered advise where they could Even let us use the pool after we had checked out The room was spacious and kept clean every day The location was ideal only a 20 min walk max from most tourist attractions or 10 in a taxi to other venues The rooftop pool was lovely as well 
431854,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The place has a pool on a rooftop which is open only till 8 pm it would be a great place to enjoy a drink at night though , The stuff is very friendly and helpful The place is in the very center of the city you can virtually see all major attractions within 20 min walk 
431855,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Wouldn t change a thing , Definitely worth getting a room with a terrace Staff are friendly and happy to help with any requests Excellent location for all sightseeing spots and great selection of bars and restaurants nearby 
431856,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Breakfast was not good It was served until 10 30 but by 9 50 many of the choices were already finished eggs tortilla small sandwiches Also the pool was much smaller than expected It was like a big fish tank and with 4 very loud and disrespectful guests using the pool when I went up I lost interest n staying in the pool area , I liked the room very warm colours and comfortable Also the front desk Staff were excellent very friendly 
431857,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Staff were very rude and unhelpful When being served they would answer the phone My friend cut her foot and asked for a plaster she was told they didn t have any then when she asked another member of staff she was given one When being served for drinks by the pool the waiter stopped serving us half way through to serve somebody else , Hotel was pleasant with nice decor
431858,Catalonia Eixample 1864, There are no weight training facilities in the gym , Roof pool and terrace area is fantastic Pool isn t massive but it s very nice Room cleaned daily 
431859,Catalonia Eixample 1864, thin walls can hear noise from hallway triple room is crowded, Friendly employee fast wifi clean room great location near Passeig de Gr cia lots of stores and restaurants around
431860,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The breakfast was a bit expensive for what it was , Location is great friendly staff clean although the floor never was lovely roof top terrace Two little supermarkets just round the corner and some lovely Caf s Good choice for a long weekend of exploring 
431861,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We were two friends who often share a room but NEVER a bed We were allocated a room with a double bed despite requesting two singles However it was quickly and seamlessly sorted out and the luggage removed to the new room , There was a great choice for Breakfast my favourite meal of the day Excellent We did have a meal in the restaurant on arrival which was good but the following evening choice not so good and what we did choose was not pleasing 
431862,Catalonia Eixample 1864, My room has unpleasant smell The breakfast hardly change and lack of vegetable and fruit , The location is perfect Very close to the most famous tourist spots The staffs are friendly and helpful 
431863,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Bedding no top sheet asked for one told unavailable Air con didn t work temp was nearly 30 too hot for a quilt Couldn t get quilt out of cover stitched in Very unhelpful and uncaring, Locaation
431864,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I called the reception to make a wake up call They didn t wake us up I asked for a bottle of water feom the room service they said they closed the cash machine so I had to go down to their bar to get the water in my pyjamas We asked the reception to book a big taxi van for us because we have many luggages and of course they said yes but They actually didn t I never write a review before but in this case I have to as I never experienced a horrible low grade service such as this hotel beforw The hotel is rated 4 stars only because of the location but the rest I would give 1 star only The room is dirty bathroom is also old and dirty Air conditioning is ild and has noise It was truely a horrible experienced to all of us I will never recommend this hotel to anyone Its not worth the price , Only the location
431865,Catalonia Eixample 1864, In a city that comes to life after 9 00pm it was a disappointment to find the lovely roof terrace was closed at 8 00pm meaning we were unable to enjoy one of the features we d chosen the hotel for , This is a very nice hotel in a great location All very smart and nicely decorated a very comfortable room and quite quiet despite a nice balcony overlooking the road Very friendly and helpful staff and a very varied and plentiful breakfast The underground parking was good One pays for the city centre location in Barcelona but our pre trip research paid dividends with this hotel with one exception 
431866,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The traffic was noisy athough the room had two sets of double glazing on each of the balcony doors which made it bearable The prices of food and drinks in Las Rablas were a rip off and far more reasonable in the area of the Hotel, Location was good because the hotel was approximately 12 minutes walk from Plaza Cataluya which meant that the restaurantes were more reasonable than in the centre The Staff were very helpful 
431867,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I booked a king sized bed but unfortunately there was only a room with a twin set of beds Staff gave me a free breakfast for that though which was much appreciated, Staff was very friendly very clean facilities
431868,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Breakfast was nothing out of the ordinary it would be great to find a hotel that did something slightly different , Great location for my needs I had a balcony which was lovely for the few days it was really warm The room was clean the bed comfy the minibar well stocked The cafe bar was good as well to grab a coffee during the day 
431869,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, It was so wonderful from the beginning when we checked in The services were so considerable and the attitude was very nice with useful suggestions The hotel and rooms were clean and tidy quiet as well A bus stop is just one minute walk away from the hotel I enjoyed my stay here so much and I will choose it if I go to Barcelona again 
431870,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The restaurant was a little out of our price range to eat in regularly though plenty of others nearby that were easier on our budget , A beautiful hotel in a great location Room was modern and clean facilities were great bed was super comfortable and staff were lovely and welcoming We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend to others going to Barcelona 
431871,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Bar staff slow and poorly trained Bar closed at rooftop pool so you had to go to reception bar wait for 30 min for drinks or food to be delivered and if order was not right another 20 min before it was sorted , The beds and showen were brilliant Hotel lovely and clean
431872,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Air con very loud in room coming on and off all night and traffic noise outside meant we couldnt leave windows open Rooms small and in need of updating , Location location location roof terrace and staff helpfulness
431873,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Room small and facing interior courtyard with view of other interior rooms Room didn t make you feel at home in the hotel hence left every day asap to eat elsewhere same with dinner I imagine a prisoner released from his cell doesn t go to eat in the prison canteen Having said that had we been on business it wouldn t matter , Location 
431874,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Having to leave , Great location fantastic facilities very comfortable I had the deluxe double with terrace fantastic room with a shower you could fit 8 people in lots of hanging space in the wardrobe a fridge mini bar Krups coffee machine free safe a massive full length mirror and a terrace you could host a party on It had two very comfortable loungers you could use them as beds if you had to a table and chars and a lovely bench with big pillows which is under an awning which means you can sit out even if it s raining The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor was very fresh and modern The terrace doors keep all city noise out it was so quiet when they were closed The staff too were lovely and helpful The roof terrace has great views and great for relaxing The pool is a little small but a great feature 
431875,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Cleaning and sanitation of the toilet and the bathroom could be improved , The staff were very friendly and accommodating as we had requested for the room to be changed as the first one given had a distinctive smell The breakfast was excellent 
431876,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Very overpriced The rooms were very shabby No tea and coffee facilities There were a couple of staff that made you feel like you were being a nuisance , The location was very good 
431877,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Roof pool is like a goldfish bowl and bar is tiny not like in photos also staff were knocking on door very early and at least three times per day with water or sweets or to turn down bed etc , Staff were nice
431878,Catalonia Eixample 1864, I have written to the hotel about them charging me twice for one stay Once a day before my arrival and that to about 4 hours earlier than my cancellation time and the second time they charged me at the time of checking in and I reported the same to the checkin manager he said it was not reflecting in his system but if it is so it would be refunded Still waiting for the same Also we have written back to them on the same issue about a week back with the credit card companies charge alert but still there is no revert or confirmation about the refund Expect Booking com to solve this case since the credit card information was taken with the assurance of no charge and then this happening was a surprise , The hotel has a good location and very friendly staff 
431879,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was very small Table chair backed into bed No inroom coffee, Great location good restaurants and a grocery store nearby Close to subway shopping sites Nice rooftop area with pool cozy bar and restaurant

431881,Catalonia Eixample 1864, it is a very noisy hotel the sound proofing in the rooms appears to be non existent you could hear people talking next door and even using the bathroom , the staff were really helpful
431882,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Fitness centre needs upgrade Also the floor can be wet because of the swimming pool on the top floor The lift was often dangerously wet , Location and value very good Wifi strong Good hot running water 
431883,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, Excellent location Within walking distance of many areas of the city and good location for restaurants Two of Gaudi s buildings were within two blocks of the hotel Lucan sp at reception was so friendly and helpful When we had a water issue one evening it was properly dealt with and we were compensated for our inconvenience We were here 4 nights and felt very comfortable We would go back 
431884,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Room was next to street corner quite lot of noise thru windows Rooms and building bit out dated but old charm and clean , Excellent location short walk to two metro lines and train Good breakfast friendly staff Nice old building

431888,Catalonia Eixample 1864, below standard 4 hotel and airco not working because it s still winter according the hotelmanagement Very disappointing Room had temperatures around 30 degrees and sleeping was everything except comfortable You could open the window but we are in de centre of Barcelona so a lot of traffic noise day and night In my opinion if you have 4 stars a good climate control MUST be working otherwise we can also go to an hostel or something although the rooms have enough equipment the look and feel is a bit depressive by the use of dark and old wooden plates against the wall Give it a fresh color and it would be much better It s a shame that 2 negative things made us decide to never go back to this place We stay in many hotels and this hotel has a good opportunity to become a good 4 hotel but they NEED to improve on the climate control , Location nearby shops cultural activities and food places Rooftop terrace very nice and relax Quite rooms no sounds from outside and inside the hotel Internet connection very good Nice bed
431889,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Although the room was elegant and very well appointed it was too small for three people I requested an upgrade and it was not available the front desk was kind enough to send bottled water and chocolates We really would have preferred a larger room I soon realized that I could have booked a larger room in a different hotel and in the same neighborhood for the same amount of money I will seek a larger room in the future as I mostly travel with my husband and family The room was actually too small for two It seems to be a perfect fit for a business person traveling alone , The staff was amazing Beginning with the efficient doorman Andres and then the very welcoming Carolina at the front desk to the extremely polite Vako they all gave us excellent attention and good recommendations The hotel is quiet and in a great location walking distance from many great locations including Casa Batl The beds were comfortable and the room was quiet The terrace is a nice touch and there is also an outdoor or indoor caf where we had a welcome to Barcelona beverage on the house I was excited about the workout facilities but with all the walking we did it was not needed

431892,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was not fully done after the 1st night tea cups were left only 1 bathrobe bathroom not tidied up This may be an isolated incident though but not pleasant at the price we paid considering we upgraded ourselves, Good location and welcoming staff breakfast is good without being overwhelming

431896,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Some problems in the bathroom Leak from the room on top flush not working but housekeeping was very helpful and fixed this quickly Air condition could be stronger, Nice hotel by Passeig de Gra ia Metro station very clean Gym limited to three cardio machines but still convenient and handy Complementary water bottles and towels in the gym Quite did not hear any noise but room a little hot even with the A C at highest 
431897,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The doors were a little thin meaning you could hear everything going on in the hallway , The hotel was perfectly fine Nothing to blow you away but certainly fine

431905,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Triple bedroom was tiny No ventilation in room A C was not working so we had to keep window and door to room open to cross ventilate our room no privacy or security because of this , Great location and friendly helpful staff The bar served American style cocktails and food service was delicious Tourist information was available from front desk Cab service was immediate from front door Roof top area excellent 
431906,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, Hotel location is very central close to Passieg De Gracia station bus connection to the beach Plenty of great places in the side streets to eat and drink not the typical touristy expensive joints but more where the locals would go Getting to any part of Barcelona airport rental car location was perfect 
431907,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Put up in another catalonia hotel we found out when we were their they have two hotels they did not put us up in the one booking com booked us we had no city view no baloney no swimming pool no bar on roof top ver up setting with the way they operate they even told us they have another hotel two blocks away with ever thing we expecting but got none at the hotel we were put up in ,No Positive
431908,Catalonia Eixample 1864, the pool is small above ground glass tank it was a little intimidating to swim because you re really on display , Comfy rooms nice towels and toiletries great breakfast
431909,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Pool was a bit disappointing as it was like an over sized fish tank not flattering when taking a dip , Clean comfortable beds we had rooms with a terrace which was wonderful Buffet breakfast was good liked having fresh eggs cooked or an omelette 
431910,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, The location was extra good because it s near all the main areas I like the balcony really spacious The only thing the swimming pool area was small and never have an empty chair but if the hotel could provide an extra long chair on the balcony then the problem will be solved I guess 
431911,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No machines or weight sin the gym only 3 cardio machines but not a big problem just a few more items would be nice , Super location very hip clean and modern Super easy check in and check out Gorgeous rough top lounge area 
431912,Catalonia Eixample 1864, We asked from a quite room facing the inner yard we go a room at the 4th floor where in the first floor there was a balcony for smokers and all the smoke went up to our window on the 4th floor We moved to another room on the 4th floor in a different area but this was too close the the AC engine on the roof, very helpfull staff
431913,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Dated design no robes or slippers no coffee or tea making machine minibar isn t refilled regularly floors are not mopped daily The most important negative is thin walls and use of ceramics for the corridor floors you can hear very well every sound in the corridor or from your neighbours Isolated non adjacent rooms have little daylight as they face the building s well inner courtyard , The location is great and the staff are polite Rooms are well sized and comfortable Roof top 
431914,Catalonia Eixample 1864,No Negative, Lovely Hotel Great Location I loved the Rooftop with swimming pool very relaxing Staff very helpful Friendly would Def go back again 
431915,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Asked to pay in cash following consumption of a meal in the hotel restaurant without being presented with a bill This was a first , Conveniently located
431916,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The main downside is there was no view from my room at all with not much natural light I think this is the case with lots of the rooms Maybe other buildings are designed this way in Barcelona , Staff very helpful and friendly
431917,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The cooling system had a leak so there were damp spots all around it and some water was even dropping to the wardrobe and the floor We signaled it to reception but they simply told us that there was not technical assistance during the week end and they did not offer us another room Moreover both lifts were broken on Friday afternoon and after that one of the two elevators was out of order during all the weekend That was a major inconvenience given that our room was located in a 4th floor and the pool in the 6th floor The pool cool but the tiniest I ve ever seem , The location is pretty good in walking distance to Pla a Catalunya the bed is very confortable the terrace is very nice with a cool but tiny room 
431918,Catalonia Eixample 1864, they tried to give us a smoking room what smelled very badly despite I asked for a non smoking already during booking At first they said it is not possible to change the room because the hotel is full At the end they were willing to replace the room to a non smoking one we booked the hotel mainly because of the rooftop terrace We planned to have a dinner or a drink there maybe it is our fault and it is described somewhere on the hotel s site It turned out that the roof terrace is just for a pool and closed after 20 00 We arrived 20 30 for one night so we did not even have a chance to go up there , good location comfortable bed
431919,Catalonia Eixample 1864, No weights in gym which was disappointing , Staff were very nice overall very helpful and polite Roof terrace with pool is small but very nice and we got great use from it We didn t eat at hotel so can t comment 
431920,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The pool is a little small , Staff was exceptionally friendly going out of their way to do all possible to make your stay enjoyable Well located and very attractive building entrance Room was well decorated and bed very comfortable An amazing roof top view 
431921,Catalonia Eixample 1864, On the last day we could not keep the room We had a late flight and there was no where to shower in the hotel We asked for a alternative room and we were told that the hotel was full yet there was still availability on booking com website There is only one public loo in the lobby a long way from the 6th floor pool when you have no room facilities This spoilt our view of an otherwise good hotel , The location was perfect We had a terrace room the terrace was great and it was just as expected a great place to relax after a bust day discovering the city
431922,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The beds are a bit hard the sheets are only blankets which aren t very comfortable When I was resting in the room there was someone knocking on the door it was a stranger and I had no idea what he spoke It s quite frightening I don t know why there could be someone out on the hall , The location of the hotel is pretty good and the hall is very nice My friend and I stayed at the hall for 2 hours to wait for an available room Also the service is good we ve left our staff in the store room for almost ten hours and they were kept well 
431923,Catalonia Eixample 1864, after booking i found that Renaissance Hotel was 3 euros more Renaissance is five star more near to shopping and more Facilities , location bed expensive
431924,Catalonia Eixample 1864, Room had a rubbish internal view of courtyard and lift and poor natural light, Rooftop pool is lovely staff were very friendly and helpful restaurant was good and reasonably priced gym on site was handy Although the location is a bit out from the main tourist areas it is well placed for public transport and tourist bus
431925,Catalonia Eixample 1864, The room was listed as 20m but it was probably not even 12 plus is was on a corner of the building so it was not even square really a third of it was cut off The bed was too small my husband 182cm had his feet hanging out of the bed The cleaning staff woke us up a couple of times at 9 9 30 in the morning but we fixed that with the Do not disturb sign the next days , The location is good very close to 2 metro stations Girona and Passeig de Gracia that we used a lot and a lot of buses arround the hotel It s also pretty close to the center to Placa de Catalunya 15 walking minutes The staff was really friendly and helpful they knew english and were ready to help us with anything right away At the reception all the waiters and the staff at the breakfast restaurant We ve got a deal with our booking for 20euros a day for 2 people for breakfast which was fair enough We tried to get breakfast the first day at the restaurants around the hotel but it did not cover all the option for 10 euros a person plus coffees and juices etc Well we eat a lot for breakfast so it was more convenient for us this way There was a great variety for continental breakfast the only minus was the lack of fresh veggies but we survived The pool even if small was awesome really nice view and cool feeling to have a bath on top of the city We were at the pool in the evening after all day walks and it was generally only 3 4 people at that hour so it was pretty free and very silent The view from our room was really nice We had the window on the front towards the street but if you get one with inside courtyard view it will suck pretty much cause if you open courtains everybody from the elevator will see inside your room The street was extremely nosy but the room had 2 set of doors and it isolated properly We didn t really use the air conditioning as the weated was always pretty windy at our floor 4th and it s been rather chilly during the night with the closed windows The bed was really confortable though rather short Wifi was great really happy with that Coffee in the lunge is amazing They have 2 computers at 1st floor with internet for clients use where we printed some tickets and the flights Was very helpful
