456658,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Very tiny room but I suspect this is typical in Amsterdam , The five flies restaurant next door should not be missed It was stunning and delicious The hotel was also beautiful The location was perfect It was very easy to get everywhere on the tram The tram to convention center was only a few blocks away The neighborhood was fun and lively with many good restaurants nearby 
456659,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Our room was very small and was nothing like the photographs on your website This should have been a single room we had to move the bedside cabinet before we could open the wardrobe door we were only staying for one night but still needed to use the wardrobe We found this most unacceptable as the room was not big enough to have spare items of furniture init , The hotel was great good location good facilities and excellent breakfast Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable 
456660,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Whats not to like , Breakfast buffet was great included champagne strawberry and served until 11o clock which was great after a late night however the hot choice became more limited the nearer 11 it got Very central location for most things and lots of restaurants on the same street if you didn t want to go into the centre of the city but it was a bit noisy at night if your room is at the front of the hotel

456665,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The up selling of a canal view room was pretty aggressive I had to decline many times Even if you want it I recommend declining until they offer you a discounted rate at the desk I believe it went from a EUR 40 down to EUR 15 a night Regardless we opted for a quiet room with no view and it truly had no view as expected but it was also at one end of the hotel so it was super quiet , The property looked newly remodeled Our bathroom was clean Our bed was comfortable 
456666,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The superior room 115 was so small we had no bedside tables I could not see the tv from my side of the bed though my husband could Only one power point so we had to ask for an extension as my husband uses a sleep apnea machine On the first day we went out for the whole day and came back at 6 15 to get ready to go out for dinner but our room still had not been made up , Good location

456669,NH City Centre Amsterdam, As a family of 5 we required 2 interconnecting rooms Upon arrival late afternoon only one of the two rooms was available and the second wasn t ready until later that evening The rooms were not interconnecting which meant that we had to separate 1 adult in each room with separation of the children In the days leading up to our arrival we emailed the hotel to ensure that interconnecting rooms would be arranged The email was ignored though upon checking with hotel staff they had received the email , The staff on site tried hard to rectify our problem after check in though was not possible to due to a full house

456680,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Be careful with your expectations of the sleeping arrangements here I thought we had booked a room with double bed but arrived to find they only had a twin available for us When I queried this I was told that NH hotels only guarantee a room for two people when you book and that rooms with double beds are dependent on availability Not good when you have booked four weeks ahead and specified what you want I felt I wouldn t use an NH hotel again for this reason ,No Positive
456681,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The first superior allocated room was very disappointing It was meant to have a view and it was small Initially they said we couldn t move but let us move next day after persuasion , Great location Eventually got a good room

456693,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Bathroom confiquiration was not the best because of the small size and the way the shower door opened You almost had to open the bathroom door in order to get into the shower because the shower door opened out and you had to squeeze between the shower door and the bathroom door , Best location with steps away from great restaurants and sites Staff was very accomodating and offered us free breakfast because they did not have the room we initially requested but were able to give us comparable accommodations by a larger room and bringing in an extra bed 
456694,NH City Centre Amsterdam, At first we thought the room smelled a little funny strong but it may have been that it was very recently cleaned It was only on the first day so it didn t bother us too much , Great staff
456695,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Cleaning service was usually around 4pm which was not convenient as at that time and after having left the room in the morning we returned for relax Difficult to carry the luggage on the steps at the entrance of the hotel leading to the front desk , Great location of the hotel close to the main sights of the city There are also many restaurants and shops in a very short walking distance All the staff was very polite and always willing to help or to provide information

456701,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I booked and payed 960 Euro a superior room for 2 and ended up in a very small double room like the one for single use The stuff is not in particular friendly and interessted in the guests I was never asked if I liked the stay there They charged extra fee for room deposit which I only will get back in a few days strange habit The breakfast area is like a big cantine with guests running around the counters I saw nicer smaller places near by where friends stayed for same or even less price , Breakfast was ok 
456702,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We booked a room with two single beds We paid around 270 euro incl tax and breakfast a night and were first put in a room barely big enough to swing a cat around Upon our request we were given a slightly bigger room but still far from the photos you find on your website when booking , If there is one person who makes your stay at NH City Center in Amsterdam worthwhile then that is SRI the lady who welcomed us at breakfast each morning She is a rayon of sunshine Thank you Sri

456706,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We did not have our room cleaned on the first day despite raising this with the staff twice that day We also did not have cups glasses replaced on the second day when the room had been cleaned The staff were not particularly friendly or apologetic I also think the quality of the room is not up to standard for the price , It is in an excellent location

456709,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Our double room which cost over 400 euros a night was so small that it had space for only one bedside table This was despite the fact that it was advertised on booking com as having a seating area and space for a spare bed if necessary The hotel offers no facilities such a computer printing etc and the breakfast is uninspired Further the hotel takes an extra 100 euro deposit which takes several days weeks to refund even after the bill has been fully paid Overall this does not feel like a four star experience despite the four star price tag , Location view and friendly and hard working staff
456710,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Rooms very small plus they charged me for extra 300 for parking without telling me and I don t even have a car and when I go to them asking about that they told me oh it s a mistake and we will refund it to you after 4 weeks and after long talk explaining that it s there mistake and they can t just take money from people just like that they refunded it to me in cash and you will carry your luggage from main entrance to your room coz they don t have someone to do it , Just the location

456722,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Checkin time is at 15 00 when I arrived at 15 15 it was quite busy at checkin The first thing I heard was an employee almost yelling at a guest we have over 200 rooms of course we don t have the rooms ready at 15 00 Staff generally didn t seem very engaged Further as a business traveler the wifi is a disaster You get a little for free at a slow speed really not ok it s 2017 , Rooms are clean

456728,NH City Centre Amsterdam, No leaflets in the foyer for attractions Need more teabags coffee etc as limited but did bring us more when requested, Supplied toiletries Very comfy bed
456729,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We originally booked a superior room and when we arrived it looked more like a hospital bedroom , The staff were lovely Mike on the front desk was super helpful and was a great local to meet as he was very knowledgeable and welcoming 
456730,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Only One reception staff I found that she had an impolite manner to react with non English speakers She cannot be calm to mildly speak and clearly in English to customer It is just like she want to finish everything too quickly , The location is in middle of old city but equally far from all highlight sights such as train Rijkmuseum and others Breakfast is good 
456731,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Quite noisy when in your room sleeping , The firm beds were great and the breakfast was great The staff throughout the hotel were so friendly and helpful 
456732,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The toilet kept running a long time or started running again Reported to the reception but in the time we were there nothing could was done, Location is very good We had a triple room very roomy although it could be a little cleaner the ceiling had some cobwebs on it and the third bed stood against a cupboard whose surface was sticky Nothing a little rub with a wet paper towel didn t solve but still We liked the restaurants immediately in the surrounding streets T
456733,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The rooms was quite small for being referred to a superior and the staff at check in were not that helpful but part of that is also to blame to booking com as it screwed up the booking itself , The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice Great breakfast that was really a highlight 
456734,NH City Centre Amsterdam, For first timers it should be advertised that there s a city tax to be paid , Nothing I didn t like about the place very nice facilities and staff and very helpful 
456735,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Staff at reception could be a little bit more friendly The only thing I didn t like in this hotel was the fact that doors opened in our room and guest from neighbour room just walked in We were both shocked , Perfect location Didn t need breakfast as we could go outside and pick one of the bars or cafes there are plenty of them Comfortable beds nice shower Staff at the bar very friendly 
456736,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I booked a double room but was given a twin room Was told room preference was subject to availability and blamed Booking com when I said that wasn t made clear to me or that I wasn t informed that my preference wasn t available until I got there This was a little disappointing I was told I could have a double room if I was prepared to pay extra but at almost 500 euro for 2 nights I thought I was already paying enough , Breakfast catered for everyone
456737,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room was cleaned by a cleaner who must of cut themselves as there was blood in the bath on the floor a trail of blood from the en suite to the main door It also wasn t mentioned that I needed a 100 Euro deposit also Had to pay a city tax bill l Could ve been informed about this before flying over I though city tax was included , Modern not far a walk from the centre Nice staff 
456738,NH City Centre Amsterdam, the female staff at the reception were horrible check in time was above 20 minutes the receptionist that did our check in was not welcoming not smiling did not even look at us and was talking to her colleague in a foreign language while we did not know what we waited for totally not respectful also at check out we found out she had mistakenly or not over charged my credit card without permission and non of the staff was able to give us a refund we were VERY disappointed did not feel welcomed AT ALL , the room was clean and in good shape the location is good

456741,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Reception staff female very abrupt and borderline rude Room was shocking Was not clean at all after rinsing hair from both the shower and sink I got showered to walk to the bedroom which was as big as a matchbox And my feet were black Bits of dirt and dust all over floor and the toilet was disgusting Had to clean it myself orange rings around the seat Absolute disgrace especially for the extortionate price they charged for a room no bigger than a prison cell Woken every morning at 5 30 6am by trolleys being banged of eachother or walls above the room ladies heels on the tiles in a room above staff shouting crashing of things onto floor Was an absolute nightmare four days never been so disappointed , The location was about the only good thing about this place Reception area clean bright and welcoming pity the rooms are like a prison 
456742,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Our room was oddly shaped and thus very difficult to furnish leading to a poor use of space It had only a small window towards a small inner courtyard and few and oddly placed electrical outlets The free WiFi was limited to a fairly low speed , The location is great right next to The 9 Streets The bed was very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent 
456743,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Thought the breakfast was expensive especially being as they didn t do a full cooked breakfast only certain items , The overal cleanliness was perfect and the view from our room looking over the canels was lovely 
456744,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Staff unprofessional at the best of times Booked a twin room but was given a double room which staff refused to rectify , Breakfast room service was great Room was cleaned and fresh towels were provided daily

456768,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The only dampener was that we had to pay an extra EUR 15 for a room with a double bed I did request this on Bookings com and as our train was delayed we checked in late and would have had single beds pushed together which is never ideal , The breakfast is really good and highly recommended the rooms are clean and well thought out and the location is very good

456777,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Unable to get roomservice one night due to a party which is understandable however it would have been nice to be informed beforehand , Paid for a double twin room so we pushed the beds together the next day after the cleaner had come in there was a joining piece of material in the bed to make it into one and it had been made as one bed its the little things that count Also very helpful staff who clearly explained any questions you had

456802,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I just had a terrible experience at nh City Center in Amsterdam It is a pity its decay in service and comfort I had stayed there for a couple of times before less than ten years ago I decided to give it a new try from Nov 16 to 24 Bad idea The elegant old fashioned design is gone all over lobby and rooms It is all now in the same ugly formica style new decoration we find in any cheap hotel But nh City Center prouds itself to be a four stars It can be on paper In which concerns beauty and confort it is at most a three And in service forget about it The staff is arrogant or incompetent or both 1 Forget the promise of 35 m2 space and a room with a view We ve got a 25m2 if so and just one of the three windows facing a canal the others showed ugly roofs So if they give you the key to room 207 just say no 2 No cleaning in the first day before at least 3 PM even as asked with a signal in the door When I called the lobby attendant answered they had not finish the service yet No complaining No rush The cleaning by the way is lousy 3 Don t expect ponctuality at the delivery back of the laundry It was late of course without any info or excuses of course And I had to ask for it three times 4 One last thing to keep this short In the departure day beforehand in the morning I asked at the front office for a late check out to 1 PM just one hour later than the usual The girl in charge told me yes Of course the key has stopped working at noon and another girl from the front office call me at 12h35 PM to tell me the check out time was noon Of course I just picked up my luggage passed by the front office and took a cab to departure to never again stay or allow any friend or aquaintance to stay at nh City Center ,No Positive

456804,NH City Centre Amsterdam, They did not mentioned that you have to pay a caution for the mini bar and most of all they did not inform me that paying that amount with a debit card would not freeze the money only temporarely but for a period of 1 to 3 months this should be mentioned in the hotel description , position is perfect and the hotel is quite clean and modern our room was little but cozy great view over the canals
456805,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We are a couple but only had two single beds I found the bed not very comfortable , Staff were very helpful Hotel was well situated in the centre of Amsterdam
456806,NH City Centre Amsterdam, the room was very small and dirty full of dust I had problem for having the correct invoice they made the invoice to me not to my company and said could not change it There was a mistaken pre authorization on my credit card even after I paid the full bill which is still on after 5 days , the position of the hotel between DAM and Leidsplein square the bathroom big and modern
456807,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Didn t get the double bed we requested got 2 singles pushed together They said it was down to allocation on arrival what was left , Lovely view of canal nice big room clean and modern hotel situated in a nice area not too far away from shops bars Didn t use restaurant or facilities so can t review on that hotel was a base for us Plenty of restaurants to choose from on the same street or couple minutes walk through shops take you to Rembrandt square with lots of choices 2 coffee shops within a minute walk away Tram stop on next street so getting around was easy 
456808,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I booked the hotel and was given 2 prices The first was the price before any tax was added the second was the final price with all taxes added When I payed at the end of our stay the hotel had added an extra 20 so be careful someone is in the wrong either the hotel or booking com , The hotel was in an excellent location within walking distance to almost everything we had a triple bed room it was a gorgeous spacious room very clean 
456809,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room had just one tiny window I guess it was the worst room of the entire hotel they gave us two separate beds joined together even though we asked for a double They said that it was just a request keep that in mind that u can not be sure what kind of bed u ll get, The location was perfect

456813,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Would have loved some breakfast tea with milk in the tea coffee facilities in the room just provided earl grey with coffee creamer Also maybe a decaf coffee pod for the Nespresso Checkout was very slow maybe should have more than one receptionist on in the mornings , We had a triple room which was spacious enough for 3 enthusiastic shoppers The shower was excellent fluffy white towels and a proper hairdryer thank you The tuck shop in the foyer is a perfect for snacks drinks Hotel is in a great area plenty of cafes restaurants nearby open from 7am seems to be 10 mins walk to Dam Sq Anne Frank house or 9Streets 
456814,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I wish there would have been more choices for evening meals and that the hotel wad more acessible with a stroller now you had to walk up 2 flights of stairs to get to the entrance, Amazing hotel with a lovely location exellent breakfast and nice staff Clean comfortable and definetly worth the money
456815,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Superior room was very small Only one bedside table Bedside lights didn t switch off individually Air con light shone onto bed at eye level , Great choices for breakfast fresh cooked dishes 
456816,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The price paid due to size of the room was not fair There was sockets that didn t work and the mirror on the inside of the wardrobe door did not open as it hit a wall so was pointless Room was very small , Size of our room was smallest I have ever stayed in The cost did not reflect the room standard and wa a purely based on location 
456817,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Size of standard double room is too small We didn t have where to put suitcases When you enter the room you have to sit on bed because there is no space let alone small sofa I think that pictures of the rooms are of larger rooms , Breakfast was nice and location is superb 
456818,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Had bed and breakfast which wasn t to my liking thought that there would be more choice , Rooms where spacious and clean Hotel location was brilliant 
456819,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I think that the check in and the checking out process vould be far more efficient as both seemed drawn out Our room was booked excluding breakfast but we chose to take breakfast on our last day As we paid in cash in full on check in including a mini bar deposit the hotel records showed we had no credit and the waitress seemed to struggle to book us in and charge it to our room We were seated and were expecting to settle the bill on check out but the waitress was extremely panicked by the fact she couldn t charge the breakfast there and then and wouldn t leave us to eat in peace she wanted to escort us to the desk to sort it with reception before we d finished Not very professional at all , Good selection of hot cold drinks in the rooms gowns slippers too

456822,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Rooms could be a little bigger and staff at reception called screaming at me to check out without checking I was staying for two nights Minor issues Book in advance as I did last minute and paid a lot more than usual, Rooms are small but super comfortable and has everything you need Location is amazing close to all the attractions
456823,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Checkin was a little long winded with lots of questions to answer The cost of the hotel at 260 per night room only was excessive , The hotel was very modern and clean We booked a quadruple room for 2 adults 2 children which consisted of four single beds It was very spacious and clean although there wasn t enough coffee facilities provided for everyone When we asked for more they were provided quickly We didn t have breakfast at the hotel as this was 17 pp 
456824,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Expensive breakfasts grab one from the local cafes on your doorstep Ask for extra teas and milk at reception as you only get a limited supply in your room , Large room comfy bed free wifi great reception staff and fabulous location close to everything but not so close you heard it all night 
456825,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Nothing I would stay here again if I went back to Amsterdam , The room was lovely spacious and clean and very comfy big bed Central location friendly helpful staff and a pleasant relaxed informal atmosphere Excellent value for money

456827,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The staff were quite abrupt which was a shame Also the size of the room was vastly over represented we had a small double bed and a single within arms reach of each other Not what I d expect for a superior suite at that price , The hotel was well located in the city centre

456832,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I paid a substantial amount of mula for the xtra large superior room and got a tiny room for the first night I was then moved into a larger room after complaining but the staff blamed booking com for lying about the size of the room After I pointed out they used photos from their website and that I paid extra for a extra large room they agreed to move me for the remainder of my stay The hotel would of happily left me in the box room I was never reinburst for the first night You also have to pay a 90 deposit on arrival that they say you get back Took at least 2 weeks after our holiday for it to be returned , Great location and very clean and nice views of the canal 
456833,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room often got a weird smell in it coming from the drains in the toilet , The property was in a really good location and it was clean This was also one of the best prices I could find for my ADE stay everywhere else was charging extraordinary prices

456835,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The breakfast variety was very limited and over priced , The hotel is in a fantastic location with great facilities The rooms were both clean and comfortable 
456836,NH City Centre Amsterdam, the room that was reserved for us was unacceptable as the room was very small and the bottom of the window started at two meter I am 1 84 high and i could not look out of the window we did get another room at 25 euros more per day we were happy with that room and spend our 9 day there happy please do not sell rooms without windows or windows from which we cannot see the weather or roads or another building the room I am talking about Room 625 We moved to room 023 which was great but at a price , the staff was great and helpful at any time

456838,NH City Centre Amsterdam, When we arrived at hotel it was shortly after 4 o clock in the day we proceeded to check in and this is where we hit the problem We where told our room was given away as we had not registered with the hotel before 4 now I have stayed in lots and lots of hotels and never heard of such a thing So please bear this in mind when you are checking in Though the girls on the desk sorted it all out for us and provided us with a complimentary drink while we waited , The location is excellent being only a 5 min walk from Dam Square The hotel rooms were clean and tidy at all times though slightly small for 3 adults sharing but we managed fine The staff were absolutely excellent throughout the hotel particularly the ladies on front desk nothing was too much trouble directions tourist info and even down to printing out our boarding passes The breakfast was great and provided a wide choice juice tea etc hot food cereals fruit pastries etc it just set us up for the day Would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again 
456839,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Was not given a double bed room even after requesting in the booking Changed on day 2 but was given an interconnecting room and guest on the other side was so loud and noisy had to put up with this for 3 nights Window in the room was not insulated and had cold drafts of wind right next to our bed and could hear all the street noise throughout the night Chef male at the Egg Station was grumpy , Cleanliness was superb 
456840,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Hotel was a little bland , Breakfast was excellent Location was very central plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby and all the main tourist pulls nearby 
456841,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Nothing, Location is great There are many lovely cafes and restaurants on the hotel street Very comfortable and clean hotel It was a great accomodation for such a price

456844,NH City Centre Amsterdam, More electrical sockets especially next to the beds , Great to find our old friend Sri still in the breakfast restaurant service and the quality still very good 
456845,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Booked double room but was giving a twin as they ran out of doubles also the beds were very hard and the air con seemed to be kicking out a fair bit of dust as we both woke up with dry throats and mouths each morning despite drinking plenty of water and not smoking anything , Location was perfect
456846,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Although it was a twin room there was only one glass of each type and one sachet of each type of tea etc Not a major complaint but oddly out of character with everything else about it and seemed a little mean spirited , The staff were delightful and engaging from our first contact on arrival until we left This includes everyone from receptionists to cleaners all of whom couldn t have done more to make our stay a great one The room and all other parts were spotlessly clean and looked as though they d just been refurbished It s in a great location within walking distance of Central Station and right on the 17th century canals with bars restaurants cafes within a few yards 
456847,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Chamber maid was really grumpy tea milk and tissues were not replaced and the room was only cleaned very quickly We were more or less chased out of the room after our late check out at 2pm , Great location next to 2 great restaurants and really easy by train and then 3 stops on the tram from the airport
456848,NH City Centre Amsterdam, While we were there the WiFi went out and stayed out for 3 days Could no one have resent in any sooner This meant I had to check my e mails etc in the lobby and my partner ended up with about 100 worth of overage charges on his iPhone , The location was perfect the property was pleasant and modern the breakfast while a little expensive was good 
456849,NH City Centre Amsterdam, When we checked in they gave us a tiny room with 2 single beds we requested a double bed We had no other choice but to pay to upgrade as it was late The other room was better However the bed was squeaky and moved about The room was equally very small Pictures on the website are misleading The free wifi didn t work and the TV kept loosing signal Overall not impressed for the price we paid , Once we changed rooms the view onto the canal was beautiful 
456850,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Room wasn t ready when we arrived We had to wait close to an hour after check in time Internet in the room didn t work for 2 of the 4 days we were there, location was good

456852,NH City Centre Amsterdam, On our last day the internet was available only in the entrance area , The location is perfect The breakfast is perfect You need to request some of the food such as cakes and fruit from the lady who stands at the back of the buffet at the breakfast I like this because it prevents people from touching everything which i find disgusting 
456853,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The hotel was very basic No bar no restaurant although it advertises it has I requested a canal view and agreed the extra cost but was given a room at back with view of dirty courtyard into other Windows This was a birthday weekend and was very disappointed with service and lack of any faculties in hotel Wouldn t stay there again , Location
456854,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The double room was tiny This was our only grievance There was a free standing enormous mirror which there wasn t floor space for It needed to be hung on wall , The pastries at breakfast were delicious The staff so courteous The hotel was in a lively location near to bars and restaurants We liked the simplicity of decor of room 
456855,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The first room was very small and warm as the sun was flooding into the room However the staff were more than happy to let us move and upgraded the room for free , This hotel is in a fantastic street lined with restaurants bistros bars and bakery s Also close to the tram and many attractions The room we stayed in overlooked one of the many canals which made a great view The staff were all very helpful pleasant and happy to help
456856,NH City Centre Amsterdam, House keeping room cleaning was non existent Called a number of times to ask when the room was going to be serviced never happened , location of the hotel is excellent 
456857,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Very noisey hotel we was on the 1st floor and there was 4 floors above us Could hear every door close and every foot step people took above us Apart from this we turned up at the airport at 3 35pm way past the allowed check in time only to be told our room was not ready and to come back in 40 mins after a 20 hr flight this is somthing we was not at all happy with just wanting a shower and a chill They offered no re fund or upgrade or any appolagie for this For a 4 star expensive hotel this is very unacceptable in my opinion , Great loacation pretty central to everything
456858,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Only two things that could be better was the breakfast price could be more competitive for hotel guests Not impresssd about having to pay 17 Euros at check out for City Tax , Overall cleanliness modern fixtures and fittings Free WIFI was a bonus

456862,NH City Centre Amsterdam, As a couple we booked a double room with a double bed However when we entered our room there was 2 single beds We contacted reception and they advised there was nothing they could do as there was no other rooms with double beds available It was not until we asked for the manger and highlighted repeatedly that we booked a double bed did we receive any acknowledgement of their mistake We were then offered complimentary breakfast the following morning along with a change of room the next day When we were checking out they tried to charge us for the breakfast However when we explained the situation to the receptionist she quickly removed if from the bill However given the mess up they should have insured that was noted and did not appear on the bill , Very clean great location
456863,NH City Centre Amsterdam, First we were offered a room without a window it didn t say that when we booked the room 5 mins after seeing that room we went back to the reception and it was not possible to receive the full payment back NH keeps the amount they reserved on your credit card for around 2 weeks before it is released again When we tried to change the staff was friendly but still the price is way too high for what you get namely being put in a twin room with an extra bed which had been stored in a dirty archive We waited several hours to get the extra bed I wouldn t recommend this hotel unless you probably book the room with view , The location is perfect it s just around the corner of many bars and restaurants and around 10 mins of walking to Dom or 15 to the museums Breakfast was fresh and nice bathroom clean although it was a bit small Elevator got out of order while we were there 
456864,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room felt a little clinical and lacked personality Perhaps carpeting the room and hanging a painting would make it feel a little more welcoming , The location was perfect 
456865,NH City Centre Amsterdam, When we booked dinner on the first night I could not find the restaurant the receptionist took us outside to show where it was The Five Flies , Staff always helpful and friendly Close to city centre and museums OK for main rail station Wonderful breakfast

456867,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room could of being a bit bigger The hall way was way too wide spacious and whey unnessessary Space could of been used towards making the room bigger , Our room gave as a good view of a canal close to city centre Room bathroom was very fresh nice and comfortable Staff were very efficient 
456868,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The room was tiny Size of a closet The bed was stuck in the corner so my husband had to crawl over me every time he got up at night There was no mirror in the room except for the small one in the bathroom If onen of us was moving around the other had to sit on the bed No way it is a 4 star hotel , Location is convenient
456869,NH City Centre Amsterdam, a little bit expensive but not a big gap comparing to good hotels in Amsterdam and be aware that you will have to pay additionally 9 euros per night as taxes, The food at breakfast was really good a lot of options the staff was really helpful and the location is great really clean rooms and hotel the size of the room was everything you need

456875,NH City Centre Amsterdam, On arrival I was charged 25 for early check in but I didn t get refund for early check out at 6am I ve never been charged taxes by the council before 19 14 It would ve been better if it was included in the price or at least being informed in advance , The hotel was nice and clean with all the facilities we needed

456886,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I didn t like the smoking is not allowed in the room, Every thing This is the best hotel in Amstrdam And the best location Even the landry is chep and fast
456887,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Staff attitude towards customer Understaffed for a 4 star property for every request even housekeeping related has to go to the reception which itself has mostly 2 staff at max For any maintainence request they only have one answer we can t help it In fact we hired 2 rooms and some channels appearing in kids room were not coming in our room so everyday we placed a request but they simply said it can t be done The warmth itself is missing in the staff attitude towards customers thus not giving a nice feeling Upon check in i told the agent that kindly give us good room while the reply was ok we only have good rooms the way it was delivered it more seemed like f you Coming to rooms i can t believe the difference in room size in the two rooms one was nice and big while other was 30 percent of the size i paid the same amount of money for each room but after the check in experience i decided not to raise any request again , Next to tram stop and coffee shops Great breakfast and nice staff in the restaurant

456891,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Cleaning of the rooms below expectation considering it was a superior room and 200 per night WITHOUT breakfast Had to ring most days to ask about if room was going to be cleaned missing towels etc etc When it was cleaned it wasn t cleaned properly very disappointing for the star too Robes and slippers were also NOT provided even though it stated it would be in a superior room didn t complain as wouldn t have used them but it was the principal of it Wifi hit and miss Superior rooms meant to have sound proofing but could hear exactly what was going on in the next room even running the bathroom tap I m sure there are better about for the money wouldn t go back to that hotel , Location was great
456892,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Information between booking com and the hotel doesn t delivere good enough The hotel didnt know that we come with a child The extra bed that they added was not comfortable , Breakfast was lovely Perfect location 
456893,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Communication between Booking com and Hotel was poor Resulting in disagreement by Hotel that I d booked for 3 and not 2 people Hotel not efficient at serving a good buffet breakfast Milk supply seems to be difficult for a bizarre reason , Good boutique hotel in a fabulous location 
456894,NH City Centre Amsterdam, At the end of my stay at this hotel I was told that if I consumed anything from the mini bar in the room it would be charged out of my deposit If I had been told at the start that the things provided in the room where not complimentary I would not have consumed anything, rhe staff are extremely polite and efficient
456895,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The wi fi signal in the hotel was not very strong and kept losing connection We were on the 4th floor Pillows were too soft , The location was perfect close to the main station and the city centre Rooms were clean
456896,NH City Centre Amsterdam, This property presents a facade of an up to date hotel It is definitely NOT what it appears to be The reception staff three individuals at different times became surly and argumentative when I had to correct their wrong assumption They also had no explanation why the room was not ready on check in past the stipulated time 15 00 The cleaning staff is unaware that if you place the Please Clean Now sign on the door at 8 00 am you have the right to expect that at 15 00 the room will be clean The room was dirty candy in the shape of hearts were in the corner perhaps left from Valentine s Day this was early August Also the housekeeping person failed on three of the four days to replace the Body Wash and Shampoo even though the empty bottles were in full view The housekeeper also failed to replenish the notepad even though it had been only used to indicate that the four euro on it were for her The beds do not have electrical outlets so if you use a CPAP machine or other devise you are out of luck unless you bring your own extension cord The shower was so constructed that a person slightly larger than average size could not enter it Someone had obviously ordered the glass partitions without measuring the opening There was no coffee maker in what was described as a premium room only a water heater with instant coffee Who drinks instant coffee in 2016 The website for the hotel advertises a refrigerator in the room but going back to my original comment concerning the facade that is created the refrigerator in the room was so filled with their overpriced items that you could not place even the smallest item of your own in there They had even removed the shelves on the door to crowd more of their items in it All in all this was a hotel to be avoided To be clear I have stayed in other NH hotels in Amsterdam Brussels and Berlin I certainly hope that this property is an enigma , The location was great in the city center as the name implies 
456897,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Noisy fan even if turned off Could not be fixed on Sunday because of lack of maintenance staff Parking very expensive, Excellent central location Clean and well maintained Competent staff Beautiful view on city and canals quiet at night

456903,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Room size a bit small check in very slow safe was locked not enough tea and coffee, Location was a bonus proximity to trams and flower market and shops very good Bathroom facilities very good 
456904,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The free wifi was unusable for general surfing and you couldn t go back to choose the pay for option The parking was useless as there is no directions for how to park on the website They say it s onsite but you can t just pull in when you arrive as there are no signs and traffic in Amsterdam is horrendous at the best of times , The location was fantastic 
456905,NH City Centre Amsterdam, When checking in we were asked to pay 150 deposit that would be paid back at check out giving that we didn t use the mini bar or had any snacks 150 euro was abit of a shock to us as we were not informed of this before booking We later found out that we should have only had to pay a 50 euro deposit and that the girl checking us in charged way to much and they couldn t understand stand why she wanted 150 We did get I back but it was alot of our spending money gone which was an inconvenience for us , The hotel was nice 
456906,NH City Centre Amsterdam, size of rooms were very small once booked we were not told up front of the bed selection when we arrived a couple we were told there were twin beds and no standards the hotel was very nice and worked with us to accommodate but very disappointing this was not recognized , great new renovation and the location was walking distance from a variety of places Very quiet and great views on the canal 
456907,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Because we booked through Booking com instead of Trip Advisor we needed to pay 19 per person daily for breakfast rather than it being free with the room which was the special on Trip Advisor all summer ,No Positive

456911,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Unfortunately it s stairs in out of the hotel at both entrances not unusual for buildings in Amsterdam adjacent to canals but something to be aware of both for mobility and luggage handling , We were three adults travelling together so had a triple room beds were great But the standout was the staff friendly and very efficient They had great advice about where to eat locally where to find a great steak and public transport to get around it s less than 100 metres to the tram either to the city or the museums district 
456912,NH City Centre Amsterdam, My doughter s crashhelmet was lost The rooms were too small and cold so we had to change the rooms When we we changed the room the housekeeper forgot to bring one of our bags to the new room and when we asked for it they said that it is lost, The Room was clean location was good 
456913,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Room 503 clean with all the optionals wifi comfortable bed phone was small and wardrobe too The room was a special price offert so all the other rooms I ve seen are larger , Nh City Center is the best place to stay in Amsterdam Centre Spuistraat is 5 min to Dam square and 1 min only to tram stop giving Nh City Center has a privileged position Breakfast embraces all european typologies croissants cakes fruit cheese eggs pancakes everything is fresh and delicious Nh staff is always at your disposal giving you all the information you may need bookings places to visit train program and many other Useful information Bathroom and room clean and comfortable 
456914,NH City Centre Amsterdam, nothing , Location of the hotel is amazing and near to many places like Dam Square and in the same area you can find plenty of restaurants Room size was more than perfect for family of 4 members almost each one in a separate bed very big room enough for many luggage very clean room and they care about everything

456916,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Small room staff not helpful arrived for 10am check in then was told the room wouldn t be available until 1 arrived back at 1 then waited for another hour and a half , Cleanliness that s about it
456917,NH City Centre Amsterdam, There was often litter on entrance steps which gives a bad first impression People smoke there and just drop their cigarette butts on the steps, The bed was so comfortable I would like to ave brought it home with me 
456918,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Weird layout of room Eg side of bed close to wall Reserve deposit Charged to our credit card as well as our final payment so we were charged twice , Excellent locattion and a good modern hotellrecommended but check the bill

456926,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Two things 1 We were asked to pay the full sum in advance before we had even seen the room although we had given a credit card no when booking via booking com 2 The room was tiny and dark so vastly overpriced they sold it as a superior room That is why we would not come back , The beds were very comfortable and our room was quiet so it was easy it get a good night s sleep The location was perfect we walked everywhere

456931,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The bedroom was tiny You could not walk around the bed instead you had to shuffle out the bottom of the bed Housekeeping staff are very loud in adjoining rooms despite having do not disturb on the door We even had a call early morning from reception to say our shuttle had arrived but we hadn t ordered one instead of an apology the receptionist said my bad Very poor response , The staff we came into contact with were polite and friendly and the location was good 
456932,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The second day we arrive at the hotel both my bag and my friends bag zipper were bust open and the pockets were open and my friends sunglasses and case were gone We locked our bags with a locker but still someone manage to go through our stuff Poor cleaning Some staff at the recepcion were rude There was one time when a guest went to a recepcionist because his key card wasnt working and instead of making a key which takes 10 seconds she yell at his saying he needed to wait because he was annoying her Also the room was a lot smaller than showed in the pictures , Location

456935,NH City Centre Amsterdam, On the second day we returned after a days sightseeing to find the room flooded from the aircon system When i went to reception i was told to switch the aircon off and that will cure the problem What they failed to accept was that this was a major leak that had soaked shoes and luggage It took over 20 mins to get a manager to accept that there was a problem We were then moved to another room that was noisy and not as comfortable The hotel did give a small discount but it really spoilt our stay , The overall quality of this hotel is very good The breakfast if you partake is excellent 
456936,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The staff at reception were incompetent and rude On checking out I was told that I d checked out and the bill was paid neither was correct It took 20 minutes to generate the bill then the room rate was incorrect No explanation of the issue no apology , Staff were helpful and well mannered at breakfast Hotel has good city centre location

456938,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Second time on NH chain and this was not great No complimentary drinking water as the drinking station has been removed Daily room cleaning only emptied the bin Glasses unwashed Toilet roll left on bed was wrapped underneath the duvet not even removed Bin emptied but was left on top of the cover not inside I could have paid the same amount for a better if not higher star rating competitor with nearer location to old town Tiny room compared to RBLu which charged similar amount , Reception staffs are welcoming Period 
456939,NH City Centre Amsterdam, When we arrived we booked 2 room for 2 adults and 1 kid They wanted to put us in 3 rooms bc they said they dont allow that that this was bookings com fault When I showed them what it was published and that they say they let kids in the room they had no other option that give us 2 rooms instead of 3 But when you are on holidays you dont want that kind of poor attention right Then we said we wanted breakfast they said ok and the following morning we had problems Even the lady at the entrance of the breakfast was threathening us Poor attention That kind of hotel needs better customer service, Great location and great facilities Very nice breakfast room 
456940,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The hotel is far from the train station The breakfast was not good when compared to price choices were limited Above all I was overcharged for my stay and have not received any response after several e mails that have been sent to the manager and front desk manager ,No Positive

456943,NH City Centre Amsterdam,No Negative, It s is my 5th time in NH City Center and I was very surprised to learn that the hotel was renovated just recently I think the hotel is perfect especially for families thanks to its great location Spui is close to 9 streets just behind Kalverstraat Rokin The Dam Flower market all are 5 10 min walks with kids and Jordaan is 20 min walk with kids What more can you ask Well the street is full with restaurants Luden is just down the stairs and Italian Dante as well Asian restaurant across and at least 5 more place to eat or drink in 100 meter distance Spui street is perfect my favorite street in Amsterdam 
456944,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The free option for extra bed in the triple room wasn t known to the staff They added me the extra bed but only as a special request , Very central Close to the 1 2 5 tram lines Lots of resturants Very close to the flower market and the shooping street 
456945,NH City Centre Amsterdam, small rooms especially canal facing rooms rather go for a room with no view poor selection of tv channels no channels for english movies or normal daytime television The only 2 channels showed old movies from the 60s 80s no personality in the room, location is perfect breakfast has a good selection and the eating area is modern clean and a nice space
456946,NH City Centre Amsterdam, drugged out kids sleeping on the steps unfriendly staff at check in a very small room no functioning air con a tv very very far away from the bed amazing work as the room was so small but the layout of the room so bad a maid banging at the door at 8am to make up the room and again at 9am, nothing
456947,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Normally we have put a message and booked the room with an extra bed However when we arrive to the hotel we were informed that there is no available room with extra bed It isn t nice to meet this kind of sitiutation after very long and tiring travel By the way we have not receieved a proposal for the solution We were very tired and decided to stayed the room which has one bed and is very small for three people The other day we have able to passed the other room At the end nobody compansated our victimization , Location is very good The room is clean breakfast is good

456949,NH City Centre Amsterdam, One of our rooms wasn t ready on time we had to wait in the bar area with a complimentary drink We were given the wrong taxi for our trip back to the airport which cost us 50 more as we had been given a discount card for our return from another company , Staff were very friendly room was comfortable and very clean location for centre was very good 
456950,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Triple room had a small window facing into an inner courtyard and was very dark but for one night it wasn t really a problem The air conditioning unit in our room leaked and we had to put a waste bin under it But it happened in the morning before checking out so didn t cause us any problems Price for one night was very high but it seems all hotel rooms in Amsterdam in May were expensive , Loved the location Walkable to everywhere and we walked from Airport Bus too Near nice shopping street Triple room was spacious third bed was a real bed Beds were extremely comfortable and bathroom modern and nice 
456951,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We were not given the room we booked which was a quadruple room We were placed on a superior double which will not accomodate our family Demi one of the receptionist was very rude explaining to us that our booking was not in their system I think she should be very apologetic to us for not giving us our booked room in the first place She must be taught how to handle customers very well However the manager arranged everything and apologized for the inconvenience We were given a triple room instead and another double room to accomdate us all 5 The manager gave us 1 night free for one of the rooms Thanks to the manager When you place the clean up my room sign i noticed they just fixed the beds changed the towels but not clean the room especially the bathroom Too bad it could have been one of our favorite hotels We have been traveling a lot in different parts of the world and never had we experienced like this one Educated people should act like educated people ,No Positive

456953,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Beds were not very comfy and breakfast wasn t really up to the standard , Perfect location if you want to visit all main attractions in Amsterdam Surrounded by tons of restaurants and bars Decent rooms 
456954,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I thought the price was quite high per night for the location When advertised in Dam square it is in fact a 5 minute walk from the square How central it is described was why I paid such a premium price, The staff were very helpful friendly and polite the room was nicely kept and the hotel quiet
456955,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Cleaner did not do a very good job of bedroom and corridors but ensuite cleaned and fresh towels daily Bedding not changed in the 5 days we stayed Would have liked an extra chair in the room , Very central position we are in our mid sixties and managed to walk everywhere Comfortable bed and bedding Room updated this year so modern Good bath and shower Good blackout curtains Quiet even though in such a central position but our room was at the side so although not a good view probably quietest spot 
456956,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The staff was not courteous and were not empathetic to guests need NH needs to become like international chains where guest experience is paramount will not stay with NH,No Positive
456957,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Booked 2 superior rooms each 30m2 but instead got one 20m2 and another 18m2 and wasn t informed beforehand and was charged the same price and after a big discussion they said we don t have other rooms so take or leave it So got a refund and left so you won t get what they re advertising , Nice location 
456958,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The staff were fine but not exceptional I arrived with two kids at 2pm their official check in time is 3pm Despite my advance written request to access a room an hour early there was no wiggle room on the check in time and no rush to get our room ready Later I asked to borrow a cork screw No one would help always referring me to someone else despite there being plenty of staff and no other guests to help Any of these things can happen but the indifference to customer inconvenience was disappointing Finally when I asked to settle the bill the night before my early morning departure I felt like I was inconveniencing them Nothing went wrong The place was pretty decent The staff were all polite However the little things that surround customer comfort were not a priority , The location was second to none central lots of good restaurants nearby and close to everything The room was clean and modern 
456959,NH City Centre Amsterdam,No Negative, This hotel was in walking distance of all the attractions Tram stop nearby We had a room at the back which was quite small but very clean with a great shower room and overlooked the canal It was very quiet and peaceful The staff were all excellent very friendly and super helpful They were able to give excellent advice about which attractions to visit and how to get to them They were very helpful in sorting out a couple of small personal problems we had on our arrival with items we had forgotten to bring The bed was comfortable and there was a good range of breakfast choices A great stay Would visit again and would recommend to friends 
456960,NH City Centre Amsterdam, More tea and coffee for the rooms would be nice and not all of us like espresso so for normal coffee it was 3 50 a cup Being on the ground floor we had bars over the window, The hotel was close to most places we wanted to see the hotel staff were friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and fresh and quiet The breakfast was very nice and explained to new guests on their first morning The view was nice over the canal but had bars across the window see negatives Very pleasant stay
456961,NH City Centre Amsterdam, If we were given the rooms we booked also no milk in rooms to top it all we left our cases in hotel storage room only to discover money missing from our bags , The beds were very comfy
456962,NH City Centre Amsterdam, They could have refilled the coffee in our room on our stay There should be a safety handle bar next to the bath avoiding a slip when getting out Reception was too efficient and there was no empathy with the guest so a warm welcome fell short, The location and the breakfast coffee 
456963,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Stuff advised on website and by staff by email was not correct No ice or vending machines although signs still up and advertised on website No disabled toilet changing facilities as advised Bed placed under a wall so kids heads bashed everytime they sat up or down , Location was great
456964,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Bathroom window was huge but not frosted and no blind people could have seen you in the shower on the toilet if they were to look in , Booked 2 rooms of 4 for 8 girls and when we arrived one of these wasn t available We were disappointed we had to be split at first but were offered free breakfast for the 3 mornings we were there and it was lovely So much choice and very tasty The rooms were lovely clean and modern and the hotel was in a brilliant location in Amsterdam definitely recommended 
456965,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The air conditioning was broken the whole trip They said it would be fixed which it wasn t so we had a puddle of water on the floor by the front door every morning Staff kept opening our door early hours for random things change smoke alarm random guy opening the door saying sorry then closing it checking in was at 15 00 we got there and they had us waiting until 16 30 in the lobby Whole thing was a shambles on there behalf Will not be staying again , They cleaned the room each day

456967,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Beds were not terribly comfortable Rooms were minimalist and stark and echo y for a hotel , Great location in the Spui neighborhood a hip neighborhood with lots of restaurants pubs cafes and great access to the trams public transportation It was a pretty easy walk to Centraal train station the Jordaan neighborhood Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein Museumplain Reiksmuseum Van Gogh and de Pjip neighborhoods were a longer walk and accessible via a short tram ride Rooms and bathrooms were clean and large much larger than expected 
456968,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Total disappointing room which was for 3 people for 3 days worth 920 Euros we got a small dark room without a view of either the street or the canal only the courtyard building , Very professional approach of all employees
456969,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The beds were a little hard slightly uncomfortable Check in wasn t until 3pm which is rather late To buy anything was slightly on the expensive side , The location was ideal close enough to walk to all main attractions but far enough so the night life didn t disturb you Very clean staff were lovely and very friendly

456972,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Size of the room compared to the ammount paid for it We booked a room with a view for which we paid more and even though it had a window into the canal that would not open as the room was very small and had a strange configuration one side of our bed was literally against a wall , Very good location next to several dining alternatives and near the center Good breakfast 
456973,NH City Centre Amsterdam,No Negative, Very spacious and good structured hotel Rooms are clean and comftabel Fifth floor had a wonderful view over the roofs of Amsterdam You are directly falling out of the hotel in the heart of Amsterdam The staff was absolutely helpful and they have a wonderful breakfast in the morning Our kids felt very welcomed 
456974,NH City Centre Amsterdam, The breakfast was expensive 17 95 pp so we ate elsewhere Also when we asked for a late checkout the girl was a little rude as to the rates as we were there celebrating an occasion it was disappointing , The hotel is in an excellent location Great comfort in the rooms beds The staff friendly especially guy called Hannas Very helpful courteous

456978,NH City Centre Amsterdam, We had changed the dates of our stay through booking com and when we checked in we were told that they had no information about the change and that this was booking com s fault and not theirs and that it happened often We were offered another hotel but we had our booking com confirmation and after some insistence on our part they finally found a solution and we stayed at the hotel , Location and canal view from the room
456979,NH City Centre Amsterdam, My view from a massive window was a brick wall my hair dryer didn t work as I found out after my hair was wet grrrrrrrr the mini bar was conviniant as it was 27 degrees when we arrived and was offered no drink but it was expensive really expensive and my radiator had a leak which meant a wet floor in the morning, Staff where lovely beds where super comfy
456980,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Breakfast was very expensive I get that it is rather luxurious but 20 is extreme I would be happy paying the original amount for pre reserving but being penalised for not ordering it in advance could be the one thing that could put me off returning as that is just greedy That is my only gripe , The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful The lady who was hosting breakfast on Sunday morning was excellent Very comfy and clean

456986,NH City Centre Amsterdam, No plug facilities in bathroom for straighteners wasn t good as the only mirror in bedroom was inside the wardrobe door and the electrical socket was to far away to use the mirror Also the lighting in the room wasn t so good A mirror at the side wall beside to would be good to access socket and use straightners, Location friendly staff and clean facilities
456987,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Price per night was a bit higher than I would have liked , Staff helped me several times Breakfast buffet was extensive My room 407 had the best views 
456988,NH City Centre Amsterdam, I wish there had been a bathtub if this matters to you it s worth finding out whether rooms with tubs are available , The location was heavenly the downstairs restaurant really simple and pleasant a nice place to sit with coffee and a newspaper in the morning A stylish simple room 
456989,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Breakfast didn t have a lot of choices Housekeeping pretty much just change towels and make the bed No cleaning at all I sent a suit for ironing took off the plastic wrap to wear it and the plastic stayed on the bedroom floor for 4 days Not acceptable for a hotel from NH Hotels chain , Fantastic location confortable room great shower 
456990,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Business model at check in they withdraw more money than you are going to pay for the room when you check out Room was not ready at 3 oclock thats what happens but we had to pay 4 euro for the bad coffe from an automat we had while we waited for the room Rooms are small and wifi is slow, Location in the center and nice view on the canals

457001,NH City Centre Amsterdam, Room could have been dusted and swept better minor inconvenience that would not impact me staying there again Even though the rooms are fairly lit with natural light depending on your room it could face the inside of the building i e Looking across to another room if occupied blinds open , Good location beds were comfortable Staff was friendly and welcoming as most hotels should be no complaints Room was modern and up to date not too big or small especially for a short stay Bathroom was fair size with a shower that should please most

457003,NH City Centre Amsterdam, There was some used tissue on the floor behind the curtains when we arrived giving us the feeling of lack of cleanliness The front desk was very busy when we arrived in the afternoon and the staff not cooping causing their attitude to be irritated instead of welcoming A request for an additional duvet was never responded to an inquiry for a restaurant recommendation was treated with odd responses The quality and variety of the breakfast was in no context with the price and the staff somewhat over attentive ,No Positive
457004,NH City Centre Amsterdam, A bit too expensive for the same price you can have a much better room in a 4 hotel in Switzerland The hotel recommended a nearby restaurant it had potential and wanted to be very gourmet by didn t quite deliver Don t know if the hotel was undergoing restoration but certain details were overlooked like the elevator door with the paint all scratched up paint stains on the bathroom floor All in all a good hotel but that s it , Great location for walking around Amsterdam visiting museums and close to a lot of nice caf s and restaurants Clean rooms I slept like a baby my husband though found the bed a bit hard The staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast is served until 10 or 11 am 
457005,NH City Centre Amsterdam,No Negative, Nice and modern hotel Location fantastic 15 mins walk from central train station 10 mins walk to flower market red light district and Anne Frank museum 15 mins walk from main museum district Nice bakery and caf for breakfast just next door and lots of restaurants pubs just down the road I would go back again 
457006,NH City Centre Amsterdam, beside location there is nothing you may say you like here doesn t worth more than 20 euro a night Rooms just large enough to put the bed inside you open the door and jump straight into it An attitude of the young lady from the front desk wow avoid it And the price is a shame I felt cheated , location
