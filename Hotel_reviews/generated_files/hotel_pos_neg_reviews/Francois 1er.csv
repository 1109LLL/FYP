240192,Francois 1er, Rooms are small and the toilette sliding door doesn t close They don t give courtesy small water bottle and you have to buy it , The location is very good and close to Metro and Champs Elys es Friendly staff especially at breakfast 
240193,Francois 1er, The toilet door is sliding type and it didn t close They offered 2 small bottles of water on the first day but asked us to buy them from the second day on although the room rate is more than US 400 day , The staff especially at the breakfast were fantastic The hotel in general is good with very good location
240194,Francois 1er, The air con didnt work in our room but they said the only thing they could do was shift us to a different hotel but as we had a second room there for our kids that didnt really work for us No tea or coffee Just such a tiny space Book a room with two singles like we did for our kids and keep them together to make a king , The rooms are very nicely decorated but that doesnt get around the fact that they are very very small They dont stipulate the size of the bed you are getting It s a double We upgraded to a queen but for the money a king should be standard Location is great No parking 
240195,Francois 1er, The shower was not working well It was not too much of a problem in warm weather but would have been very annoying in winter , Cozy and charming nothing to do with the luxurious but more impersonal large hotels Small room as usual in Paris but very welcoming Breakfast is fantastic 
240196,Francois 1er, Rooms were a little cramped but you don t come to Paris to stay in your hotel room , Hotel is in an excellent location if you want to stay in the Champs Elysees area close to a couple of train stops Room was small but had been renovated had to put one suitcase on the desk to be able to move around the room Bathroom was updated and had a nice assortment of toiletries Breakfast buffet was excellent and offered a good variety of items The staff were very friendly and accommodating Had an issue on the first night with the air conditioning and Michel came to our room to investigate and apologized for the inconvenience and indicated we would have to wait until the next morning to address since there were no maintenance staff on site at the time Location is on a small side street about 2 blocks from the Champs Elysees Would not have a problem recommending this hotel 
240197,Francois 1er, the site says it has car parking It does not Public car park around the corner, Breakfast average poor coffe stale croissants but good scambled eggs
240198,Francois 1er, Cleanliness could have been better Some areas in our room where dusty the bed cover was stained and there were a few bits of rubbish on the floor , Stylish and comfortable Good breakfast 
240199,Francois 1er, Nothing , The room was beautiful and clean staff was friendly and accommodating location is perfect This is wonderfully French hotel with all modern updates Great 
240200,Francois 1er, Everything in the hotel was horrible the mep service of the hotel is very bad the water was cut while taking my bath bathroom door was locked on us, Only the location
240201,Francois 1er,No Negative, Great breakfast close to the Champs Elysees Great Restaurants in the area Staff was very helpful and communicated very well for non french speaker like me
240202,Francois 1er, The air condition is too hot and to dry The bed linen is to rough you should use sheets and head cousins in a better linen like Egyptian linen would made sleeping more confortable , This time I did not take the breakfast as I wake up to late 
240203,Francois 1er, Receptionist was as nice enough to upgrade us to a bigger room that we were very thankful for He ruined it in the end when we asked for a late check out to accommodate for the train schedule pet Very bad attitude for a simple question and he proceeded to talk about us in french with the concierge as though we didn t understand Really don t need the attitude for 200 for one night , Great location and accessibility Comfortable rooms with wonderful interior and great bathroom 
240204,Francois 1er,No Negative, The staffs are very pleasant and helpful The hotel decoration room lobbey and the bar area is really nice modern yet with character We really enjoyed the hotel 
240205,Francois 1er, Nothing to dislike, Fabulous situation just behind Av George V very friendly staff clean sparkly room very comfortable bed with lovely linen fast hot running bath good toiletries good breakfast loved everything 
240206,Francois 1er, No heater in December with temperature 4 They provide us with an electric heater After changing the room Room was not made up at 5 pm , Location
240207,Francois 1er, There was nothing that we did not like , The location was superb Very close in walking distance to everything you need to do Metro is close by as well Champs Elysee is two small blocks away You get the perks of being right at the city center without having to pay the price of the Four Seasons The staff was very friendly as well The rooms were a perfect size nice decor and the bed was very comfortable The bathroom was a pretty big size for a bathroom in Europe and the decor was perfect not too old not too new We would definitely stay here again and reccommend to others 
240208,Francois 1er, rooms are a bit tight drinking water was only provided the first night for this price water should be replenished on daily basis free of charge, the breakfast was very good superb location
240209,Francois 1er, Staff opened door while we were sleeping although do not disturb sign was put No iron in the room Fridge too small and packed with things to the degree we are unable to use it to cool our water , Bed was very comfy and big Great after a hard day s walking 
240210,Francois 1er, Everything was fantastic, Love the service love the room love the comfort and love the location Great breakfast the best sleep I had on my trip of 3 counties
240211,Francois 1er, very satisfactory on the whole I ordered a taxi before I left to take me to the Gare de Nord but the taxi driver charged me 7 euros reservation fee , The food was very good and the staff attentive 
240212,Francois 1er, The standard room was very small , The location was perfect Very close to champs elysees and 10 minutes walk to Eifel tower Staffs were very helpful and welcoming We definitely will go back there 
240213,Francois 1er, A little tight space in the room the breakfast area underground level is a bit gloomy The hotel is not a happennig place very quiet bar and lobby , Location off GeorgeV is great very comfy matress I got a new renovated room with a balcony Fresh sheets and towels and good toiletries everyday 
240214,Francois 1er, The shower head was loose ability to park in front of the hotel to load and unload luggage was limited, The breakfast and the bed was very comfortable
240215,Francois 1er, None to report, Everything at this hotel is great value service location rooms breakfast buffet even the bathroom amenities No need to spend 3 4x the rate to be a couple of blocks away 
240216,Francois 1er, We should have stayed a bit longer , The location is really good just a couple of streets back from the Champs Elysees just a couple of minutes walk The building is beautiful with extremely elegant decor filled with antiques and paintings It looked very freshly decorated The bedroom colour scheme was very stylish and quite modern with a small but beautiful ensuite bathroom The staff were very friendly and helpful without being intrusive We loved it We will definitely go back 
240217,Francois 1er, It was a bit too warm in the hotel but we prefer that rather than too cold so no problem what so ever, The warm welcome the availability of the staff the superb breakfast the silence in the hotel it s location 
240218,Francois 1er, The double Bed a little tight for a couple however mattress very comfortable , Excellent location staff very helpful smiling all the time excellent food room very clean 
240219,Francois 1er, The food was a tad expensive We didnt have the option of supper out as my 7yr old daughter wasn t well Two sole dinners 3 small fillets each and some mashed potatoes admittedly delicious but at 94 for the two they would want to be , Lovely helpful staff Great location Nice bed Very tasteful and elegant modern but traditional We will return 
240220,Francois 1er, The breakfast was expensive for what was provided with the American offerings being lukewarm eggs and pancakes It would have been good to have the option of a cheaper continental breakfast , The hotel is very attractive and welcoming and conveniently placed just off the Champs Elys e The room was spacious and spotless and the staff very helpful 
240221,Francois 1er, nothing Wanted to stay longer , some of the best service in Paris very hospitable staff newly renovated rooms very friendly check in and overall a very tastefully designed boutique hotel that retains the good old feeling of being almost like home that most chain hotels have lost 
240222,Francois 1er, The breakfast choices are a little bit limited It would be great if the facilities in the hotel can be upgraded So far they are a little old , The location is very good 
240223,Francois 1er, Room service was poor Did not refil tissues for the last 2 days did not put toilet rolls on the holder Bath tub blocked badly You can hear neighbours tap running and toilet flushing , Location and breakfast staff are very helpful and welcoming
240224,Francois 1er, I arrived at the hotel to find out that I my room would not be available for the night and I was transferred to another similar hotel which was horrible The hotel should ve informed me prior to my arrival about this mess The next day I was transferred back and was promised an upgrade which wasn t true The room was tiny compared to similarly rated hotels I ve stayed at before , The location was great 
240225,Francois 1er,No Negative, friendly GREETING HELPFUL STAFF Provision of Slippers Water Dressing gowns and chocs Tours easily and efficiently organised Nice peace bar and reading rooms 
240226,Francois 1er, The light in the bathroom literally burst when we first got there and there were tiny pieces of glass everywhere The night shift front desk man said that that could happen though he apologized he downplayed it greatly He did come to vacuum the bathroom but there were even tiny chards of glass on carpet in bedroom I was disappointed that the day manager did not mention it We loved the decoration of the room but found it really needed more attention the carpets were not well enough vacuumed and when picking up glass I picked up a lot of dust and dirt furniture also very in need of cleaning and vacuuming We love old hotels with character this one just needs a little more TLC in rooms , The breakfast and breakfast area were phenomenal The staff waiting tables at breakfast were very attentive The extra vanity items in the bathroom were lovely 
240227,Francois 1er, Nothing that I don t really except the room a bit small for that Price , I like the breakfast room and the starf treated me very comfortable although the food not much choices Very nice 
240228,Francois 1er, The only thing that was not expected was the overbought of my room on the 1st night But Kais had arranged for a relocation to a hotel near by they paid for the taxi back and forth , Overall a nice boutique hotel near the Champs d Elysees Hotel felt clean comfortable with great staff Kais the evening front manager was excellent very helpful with all of the demand Breakfast was nice Quality boutique hotel 
240229,Francois 1er,No Negative, This is a small boutique hotel in central Paris with excellent service It exudes an old style charm and leaves you with a warm and comfortable feeling during your stay 
240230,Francois 1er, The internce of the building will make you scared at the first time because it was too old and there was no enough light at that hall , It is very good experience if you like to try the old town of Annecy 
240231,Francois 1er, We had booked a room with a baby cot but it turned out that it cannot fit a baby cot We had to upgrade to a bigger room and pay a difference They said booking com misled you not us , It is a small cosy French style hotel that had good hospitality good wifi good breakfast at an excellent location
