114558,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, could have made the wifi easier to connect to, after a shaky start with getting the room type we booked wrong the gent Aranit on reception was a total diamond helping us weary travelers get the room we needed 
114559,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, We travelled with a wheelchair user There is a lift to the first floor where the accessible room is but it was tiny and an electric wheelchair would struggle to get in The breakfast room was on the same level and so could be accessed from the bedroom but the Reception was down 3 steps so would not be accessible , The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly The wheelchair accessible room was roomy with a large bathroom including a shower chair The continental breakfast had a good choice and set us up for a busy day of sightseeing 
114560,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Our view was looking onto a wall The lift is tiny can t fit more than 1 person in , The bed was so comfy and the coffee machine was amazing Best hot chocolate ever The location was fantastic too 
114561,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Plug sockets in room damaged previous guests toe nail clippings on floor Booked family suite but got given large double with no explanation Property advertises the need for lift from ground floor just past the bins for the Nando s underneath to the reception but the hotel layout means there are additional steps between that lift and any rooms Staff were curt but professional but unwelcoming Requested baby cot was given baby cot One of the rooms overlooks what seems to be a storage area and the extractor fan for the restaurant below if booking is try to avoid it All told it was not a nice experience and if I were to book again I d go with an Accor or Hilton property even at least they guarantee cleanliness , Location
114562,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Restaurant staff non communicative Reception staff helpful and friendly Room small classed as executive double Breakfast quite basic , Bed comfortably and clean Near to tube station 
114563,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Very dirty Cleaners don t clean Walls too thin you can hear people having sex like they are with you in the same bed Staff are very unhelpful, Size of room
114564,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The personnel was kind of polite but no more No assistance of any sort The room did not correspond to the description on booking com and the bathroom were not really clean The room was noisy very narrow and the carpet not clean at all The towel were over used and in a poor state not to the standard of best western The breakfast was average ,No Positive
114565,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, It was convenient for the tube station Despite being on a busy high street it was quiet The breakfast was good Staff were polite friendly and welcoming 
114566,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The hotel needs to update the windows facilities furniture The hotel was dirty and we need to contact the staff to have the towels , The location is good
114567,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Firstly the entrance to the hotel is pretty awful The lift works when it feels like it the amount of stairs in the hotel was an issue carrying cases up and down The first night we arrived the air con didn t work in our originally booked triple room The room was stifling We complained to the night receptionist who moved us to a room on the top floor which was then only a double room no single beds so my friend and I ended up sharing a bed The Breakfast was not delivered on either morning we had to ask for it each morning The staff were not at all approachable The night receptionist did not inform the day shift that we had moved rooms All in all it was pretty shambolic I will NEVER stay in a Best Western Hotel again Will I use booking com again not sure , The room we got moved to was comfortable and cool 
114568,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Air conditioning didn t work properly Seen this on other reviews and still not fixed Other than this everything was fine , Nice area staff friendly Clean rooms 
114569,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing at all This was the worst note I have stayed in It is no way near 4star not even a 2 at best Air con didn t work on on repeat of the hottest days of the year so far Windows didn t open fully to allow fresh air Room size barely fitted bed Duvet was dirty Mattress stained Bathroom unsatisfactory Just a complete shambles , nothing at all
114570,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, When we booked there was no mention of refurbishment of breakfast area We were disappointed although we did get breakfast in a box but decided to decline this on second night stay , Easy access to tube friendly staff 
114571,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room very small bathroom suitable for a caravan site sink so small you can hardly wash your teeth in drain was clogged with filth and I had to clean it breakfast out of a carton box all in all disaster from start to finish Best to re name hotel into a guest house only paying such room rates for location only nothing else , Nothing much extremely disappointed
114572,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The rooms are quite small and not that easy if you have luggage with you , Breakfast room being refurbished so continental breakfast delivered to room Complimentary so cant have any complaints really Very friendly reception desk 
114573,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Not a good hotel for people with mobility issues Lots of stairs and rather confusing to find your way around I d hoped for a bar and lounge to relax in there isn t one You can get a drink from the reception desk and sit in the breakfast room but no comfortable sociable space My television didn t work wasted a lot of time trying to re programme the channels myself then a member of staff tried the same Couldn t fix it so ended up being moved rooms all took time which I d hoped to spend relaxing after a very long day at a conference My room was at the back above a Nando s restaurant so had cooking smells coming into my room and had to listen to their staff out the back chatting until late At 5am someone went repeatedly up and down the corridor banging their way through the fire doors over and over again and they tried my door handle As a female in the room alone this was very frightening I d paid extra to book a hotel with breakfast included and was looking forward to a proper breakfast buffet with a cooked breakfast to set me up for the day ahead As the hotel is being refurbished the breakfast s were being served to go Breakfast was served to my room in a box Mine actually didn t arrive I had to chase it up half an hour after I had booked it to be delivered and whilst the contents were OK it wasn t what I would have chosen to eat I wish I d not paid for breakfast and had just gone two doors along to Waitrose and got some food and drink for a fraction of the cost The member of staff who tried to sort out the telly and then moved me to another room was very nice and helpful but overall for the few hours I spent in the hotel there were a lot of issues and it was very expensive for the size of room and the disappointing breakfast , Good location on High Street Kensington Very comfortable bed although the pillows were rather thin modern decor freshly refurbished the shower was excellent very powerful although I slipped walking into it 
114574,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Between 10pm and 12 midnight there was a very loud vibrating sound shaking the windows I suspected air conditioning units from the restaurant next door were causing this The noise did stop but I think this is a problem they should investigate The breakfast lobby was under reconstruction Breakfast was delivered to my room on Saturday Sunday I did not receive any breakfast for some reason I should have said but was in rush to pack up and leave that morning , Good Location friendly staff simple clean room 
114575,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Compact room ok for a short stay but would be a little too small for a longer stay with more luggage Restaurant being refurbished so breakfast was limited, Great value comfy bed Room had everything that you may want for a short stay Close to tube station Nice shopping street with variety of bars and restaurants close by
114576,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The bathroom was not clean Hair on the toilet and a dirty shower are the welcome we have received The bed had a very old spring mattress and in the room there was a creepy mirror wall covered by a shade Is this supposed to be a four stars hotel The hotel had no breakfast area All they do is providing the customers with a lame breakfast box in the room at a specific time Some cold stuff in it and a coffee or so And don t try to call the reception if you are in need to anticipate it because the answer is no Apparently they are doing renovations so the breakfast area is not available for who knows how long but they don t tell you this detail until you get to the reception to check in So much for the continental breakfast included This is my last stay in a best western , Not much
114577,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The air con was a bit temperamental but the hotel was under going some refurbishment so understandable, The hotel is in a fabulous location for accessing all of London The tube is a few minutes walk away The hotel was clean and comfortable the staff were extremely helpful pleasant and polite 
114578,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Having to ask for towels on 2 occasions due to none in room however quickly resolved by reception staff whom were approachable and polite Was told due to delivery issue Breakfast area currently being refurbished so breakfast had to pre booked and sent to room to eat which isn t set up to comfortably eat however this is required and hope the breakfast area looks good once finished , Very clean Great location for the Olympia centre Tube station close by Stayed 26th 29th May 2017 The reception staff both day and night were approachable and extremely polite and friendly that you felt welcome into the hotel 
114579,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room was too small called a premier room 11x9 Because of alterations we had to eat breakfast in our room this was unacceptable as it was so small The bed was a nightmare lumpy and uneven we were told there was an option of a bath but on arrival told there was no baths at all The bedroom was dark no window as such The only positive was we had a very busy itinery so we re not there for long , It was clean
114580,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Service was terrible Asked for extra towel reply got was could not get one until 11pm even after which did not get one The kitchen was closed so breakfast was a box with basically freezed food and nothing in it They should have taken with breakfast option from their booking if so , Location was central
114581,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The Bed sheets were stained and the breakfast was just horrible due to renovation works the later is perfectly understandable but in that case it is better to be made aware in advance ,No Positive
114582,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Unfortunately they were doing restorations in the hotel so we got a small breakfast in our room and not with a buffet in the dining area If we had known this in advance we would have chosen a room without breakfast so we could go out for breakfast , The hotel was easy to get to quit close to the subway Room was small but it was very clean and tidy 
114583,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There were ongoing renovations about which we were not informed As a result there were no dining facilities and breakfast was served in boxes delivered to the room The tea was not drinkable and if we had been told we would not have booked, Location
114584,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The fact that the hotel was having building works we where not told about it A few too many stairs to get to the room First up two flights then down a flight then over a bridge way , Very well located with everything around it The best India I ve had The under ground was 5mins walking distance 
114585,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, It would have been better if it was more highlighted that the hotel was undergoing building works during our stay The room was quite small Also its not pointed out that their are two hotels at other ends of the high street so be warned looking at location x, The staff were very friendly 
114586,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The whole experience from check in to check out was a disaster We arrived on out business trip to be greeted by construction at the reception area There was no one at the desk to check us in We needed to find one of the cleaning staff after 15 mins to alert reception that customers were had arrived Once the receptionist arrived he was extremely rude We were told that the dining room was closed and breakfast would be delivered to the room the next day Not a major issue there we thought When we mentioned that we were surprised by the level of construction and the effect this had on the overall quality of the hotel experience we were met with an unbelievable answer He informed us that because we had booked through booking com he mentioned it was our prerogative to inform booking com of the construction and not the hotels This is ridiculous We were told to come back later as he could not check us in at 13 00 so grudgingly we left our bags and went to work The rooms were basic enough the morning s breakfast did not arrive We checked out at 8am and three other guests were complaining that breakfast had not arrived in their room either The same arrogant attitude was present from a different member of staff All in all this was a terrible stay from start to finish We were there for only one night but I would advise everyone to seek alternative arrangements in the Kensington area Best Western is a recognised name in the UK hospitality industry this is one of the worst experiences I have had in many years of business travel Staff 0 10 Experience 0 10 Value for money at 198 per room 0 10 Do not stay here , Nothing 
114587,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, I detested the poor welcome of the receptionist on duty when we arrived When we arrived at 14 30 our room was not ready and we were told to leave our baggage and go back later and we were also informed that the breakfast was boxed No apologies for anything no upgrades or late check out offered to us It was our problem not the hotel According to him our agent Booking should have warned us about the refurbishment but I do not agree because at the time of booking and paying the repairs hadn t begun And when I complained about the boxed breakfast his answer left me dumbfounded According to him as breakfast was complimentary and we hadn t paid for it we couldn t complain He made us feel not welcome We could see none of the staff we had met before and they were far better , We have stayed at the hotel twice and we love its location the complimentary breakfast and the new bathrooms although romos are very small but now it s under refurbishment which meant some noise and no breakfast room but a boxed breakfast which was not as good as the one we got other times 
114588,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The hotel is currently undergoing renovation Having said that we paid for breakfast and although we knew at the time of booking that it was a continental breakfast we didn t mind What we had was a stale croissant the tiniest muffin I have ever seen a hard boiled egg that wasn t freshly prepared an apple and a carton of orange juice How Best Weston had the nerve to charge for this I ll never know I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and I most certainly won t be staying there again, Nothing The pictures on the website did not reflect the actual hotel
114589,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, 1 Breakfast in a box was a poor solution to refurb of dining area Contents of the breakfast box were poor cold hard croissants and boiled egg 2 Bathroom sink kept blocking 3 Lift was not working 4 Traffic noise , Clean and modern room Staff were pleasant 
114590,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The bedroom was extremely small The bathroom whilst clean with good quality fittings was tiny The radiator made access to the sink difficult I could not shave over the sink as the mirror was above the toilet The hotel is undergoing major building work as a result no restaurant We booked expecting continental breakfast We were informed on arrival that we would be provided with a breakfast box This arrived but contained food of poor quality I also had to walk through the building works to get a coffee I think that we should have been advised of the limited facilities at time of booking ,No Positive
114591,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, 1 included breakfast without additional attribute like full continental etc day1 breakfast ok day2 not since breakfast room was closed due to craftmen doing rearrangements breakfast was delivered in a box directly to the room but with few ingredients the request for compensation was rejected with the argument that they delivered some even if small breakfast 2 hotel draw money very early right after booking is unusual from mpov,No Positive
114592,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Due to renovations your breakfast was delivered to your room it was and felt poor it was like a school lunch box Could do better The bedroom was tiny felt a squeeze and I only had a small travel bag however the room was clean and fresh , Staff were very pleasant 
114593,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Only disappointment was not having onsite parking therefore I ended up spending more money than anticipated on a multi storey park which was very close to the hotel , I thought the customer service of the receptionist was excellent very helpful and accommodating Overall I had a positive experience and comfortable stay 
114594,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The size of the room could have been better but I think the value for money of the hotel was very good given the location of the property , The location of the property is excellent Close to High Kensington Street Underground close to shops restaurants and sights It is a pleasant area The hotel is undergoing some renovations which will bring a contemporary feel to the front desk Our room was actually seemed renovated and fresh and I really enjoyed the shower However it is a small room and the bed was quite small for me and my teenage son Not a big problem for a few nights but it d be more of a challenge for someone larger or a longer stay Breakfast was fine with the regular spread of toast jam boiled eggs yogurt cereals fruit 
114595,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was small and the breakfast room was small and tight the continental breakfast was ok but I must say I prefer a full English breakfast and wouldn t book this again because there wasn t the choice, The bed was very comfortable and the shower was excellent
114596,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Very small room Room No 201 and very little natural light which wasn t helped by blind on the window not working I did report this and the Manager was very apologetic Abit of a strange layout with no foyer on ground level and lack of communal space apart from the breakfast room but for a one night stay it was fine The location and helpful staff made up for it , Excellent location easy walking distance to Kensington Gardens Palace and Royal Albert Hall Easy to get to by tube or bus from Euston Great shopping very close by Room was very clean and well appointed Very helpful staff We were able to leave our case there all day after we checked out Good continental breakfast 
114597,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, A bigger sink in the bathroom would have been good , Spotlessly clean Tea and coffee making facilities plus biscuits and bottles of water in the room Proximity to tube and places like Holland Park Kensington Palace and gardens museums 
114598,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing, Bedrooms well equipped very comfy shower room was spotlessly clean easy to use Receptionist on the day we arrived was very welcoming and helpful giving us details of local restaurant which we used were impressed with Good choice of food for breakfast 
114599,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, They should have a sign to tell people NOT to smoke in the doorway near the side lift someone kept smoking in there and it made the lift stink of smoke , The young lady on reception was super lovely and tried to make everything as good as she could even when there weren t quite enough tables for breakfast 
114600,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Not to leave the laundry in big bags outside the rooms so corridors are clear to have anything gluten free and soya milk available at breakfast and to tell guests when there is a refurb going on so you can choose whether to book or not in those circumstances, Location
114601,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, On arrival the main door had a sign saying please use side door so we did and the lift was not working and there were no stairs We tried the intercom to reception it did not work we spent about 30 mins trying to contact someone no replies eventually a man another customer said try the front door again it was working a while ago which we did and it was open we trudged up two flights of stairs with luggage and found a small reception in the middle of building works We should have been told about the building works when we booked I said to the receptionist the lift and intercom from outside the side enterence is not working he said ok he then booked us in and the cheek of it we had already paid and he asked for 10 deposit I gave him a 10 note He said your room is 303 another 3 flights up I said no lift he just grimmest no offer to help with our luggage not happy The room was small and pokey the bathroom was the size of my wardrobe at home very small indeed The room temperature was extremely hot so we opened a window and the street noise was unbearable Breakfast was a joke the fresh fruit was a cereal bowl of chopped apple that had gone brown a limited supply of pastries and when some were brought out the were gone within seconds On leaving we checked out the receptionist did not give us our 10 deposit back I asked for it and he said sorry forgot about that FORGOT he was trying to pull a fast one and hope we left without asking for it We were VERY disappointed with our stay at this hote probably the worst we have ever stayed at , Nothing I wish I had never booked there 
114602,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, as above, The hotel was clean but staff were not really interested in anything at all the room was incredibly small as was the bed The location was good but if this is the format for Best Western hotels I would rather look at others and pay only a few pounds more 
114603,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The only entrance to reception is via a small hoist type lift to the 1st floor for two persons max The only staircase is a fire escape you can exit but not enter On exit you come into a side yard and walk past the rubbish bins and debris to the street There was an apology notice for work being undertaken but this did not affect the restricted entrance and exit The reception was also the bar and breakfast room The bedroom ok but not good value ,No Positive
114604,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Breakfast area far too small for the amount of guests and we could not sit down anywhere to eat breakfast , Nice friendly hotel close to Kensington and Royal Albert Hall
114605,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Where to start Rooms are SMALL As in SMALL Breakfast is the worst I have ever had croissants bread are it with no choice Day 1 we had to come back as not enough seats Day 2 we had to ask for more cups as they were all gone The room was also ridiculously warm at night probably the only place we have had to use aircon in April in the UK , The location is superb the rooms are super clean 
114606,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There are 2 best westerns on the same road Initially went to wrong one Toilet broken whe I arrived but was fixed quickly Receptionist very busy Difficult to answer phones and check in people at the same time Very present though The lift is terrifying do not use it , Location Very close to Tube When I asked about egged at breakfast the waitress sorted it quickly Very close to new Design Museum Close to Kyoto garden in Holland Park 
114607,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room was a bit hot Couldn t find how to turn temperature down Room was compact, Large television with sub titles as husband has hearing problem Bed comfortable Shower good 
114608,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, We had an executive double room which was very very small The bathroom had a 30x20cm sink which you couldn t really use because of the toilet that was blocking the way Continental breakfast was a joke , Location is very good Short distance to subway bus station Hyde park is only a 10min walk Great shops nearby 
114609,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There were no towels available in the hotel when we arrived Eventually 2 hours we had to ask the receptionist for a towel in order to shower before we went out for the evening we eventually got one hand and one bath towel for the two of us They still didn t have any at 1800 when we went out Not acceptable , Rain shower very good Breakfast adequate 
114610,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, I did not sleep well as the bed was not very comfortable to me but I have a pretty nice bed at home , Loved the availability of the breakfast this was huge and the location was perfect close to grocery parks and family The staff were very gracious and supportive 
114611,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The elevator system was cumbersome two elevators and having to hold the button The rooms were small , The rooms were well equipped and clean Very good location Staff were good 
114612,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Sadly I was not aware of the building work currently going on until I got there and had to find the small side street entrance with a tiny lift I don t feel that this hotel is good value for money whilst construction is happening , Lovely staff the room was small but comfortable 
114613,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Did not compare to other certified 4 star hotels in London Paid too much for what I got No front door just arriving from the back in a service elevator Walk into passage with rooms no lobby Miniature room Wifi barely working Person at reception told me to my face I can be glad they did not give my room away as I did not pay for it over booking com despite booking com confirming my booking Towel was a face to towel This cannot be a certified 4 star place, Nothing
114614,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The Wi fi was poor had to reconnect a few times and even then it wasn t strong , Location was good plenty of places around to eat and not far from public transport Breakfast wasn t bad either Good shower and the bed was a proper double bed and not two singles stuck together 
114615,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Someone came into my room whilst I was in the shower at 1 30am after a night out and turned off the tv and left clean towels on the bed At 1 30am when I m a female staying on my own No thank you ,No Positive
114616,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, the window is locked and the lowest temperture of heating system is still too high 19 degree hard to sleep and breath not well , the bathroom and the bed is comfortable 
114617,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The noise from Kensington high street we were on third floor but that is hardly the hotels fault Double glazing could be better to dampen the noise maybe A sink that is completely inappropriate to wash your face in as the tap is too big and prevents you from bending down to wash properly Very messy business , Friendly and helpful staff Clean and well presented room Close to the location I was visiting 
114618,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Maybe add a mini fridge in the room other than that had everything we needed , Hotel staff were really friendly Nice quiet hotel considering its in the middle of Kensington High Street Rooms are compact but had everything we needed Would definitely recommend and will be staying here again 
114619,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, this was definitely not a 4 star hotel we have stayed in a 3 star which had lot more quality the location was fine , the staff were brilliant breakfast was nice rooms ok
114620,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, Very friendly staff good service free wifi good breakfast room was cleaned daily towels were changed every day Bus and tube station nearby Would definitely come back again 
114621,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, manager asked me to email a photo of the front and the back of my credit card for fraud purposes as i had booked this hotel and paid for it as part of a xmas present for my brother and his girlfriend my brother was told he could stay in the room as he didn t have the card i had paid for the room on with him as it was my card all very confusing and worrying never heard of a policy like this before won t be staying here again also do not email your credit card details if asked to completely no right,No Positive
114622,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, The assistance from Aranit on Reception was excellent He could see I d had a long day at work carried my bag to my room I said I was starting work early on the mornings that I stayed there he had breakfast laid out for me each morning His approach was very professional 
114623,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The air was hard to control so the room was really hot after baths and the bathroom was freezing most of the time We used the window to control the air mostly The daily internet code is a little annoying but at least it was free wifi , The staff was great Breakfast was a good variety Location here is key such a good location and close to restaurants and the underground Lots of parks and good neighborhood My second time staying in this area and it is great 
114624,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Shame the heated towel rail wasn t working but they did offer to change the room The wifi was reliable but frustratingly slow , Bed and pillows comfy Everything needed was there When I left an item behind and phoned about it it was still there and kept safely until I could pick it up 
114625,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The lifts Elevators were very slow and claustrophobic Hard to find a pub in the vicinity , Upon arrival we were greeted by a very amiable man who went out of his way to make us very welcome The bathroom was very good bed was comfortable enough and the room was very quiet 
114626,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Breakfast was a bit crammed but ok Food was fine Maybe a little more space to put your tray down instead of balancing it over the croissants whilst trying to make a cup of tea, The staff were very pleasant
114627,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing, The mobile phone that was in the room on arrival was very helpful for our navigation around London the staff were very helpful and friendly room was very nice and spotless clean breakfast was lovely Overall was very impressed with the attention to detail and the care we received 
114628,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Space Tiny in all parts Breakfast is more like a 2 star property They commit money from my bank by mistake and could not solve it Bed was small and not double of course, Renovated so clean and fresh Bathroom really relaxing Location amazing
114629,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Tv was hard to understand Dining area was small and right by reception But All in all Was a good hotel, The rooms were small but very comfortable Breakfast was good would go again
114630,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room size was inadequate everytime i went toilet i banged myself on the wardrobe which was crammed in the room , I liked the room even though it was an executive it was basic but clean and nice
114631,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Got stuck in lift for 30 minutes and no one answered the alarm Eventually got through to reception by phone and receptionist was unable to open lift in emergency Eventually managed it having had to call some 3rd party No compensation or formal apology offered Poor , Comfortable rooms 
114632,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Difficult to spot on the High Street as no frontage , Great location for shopping in a lovely area Seen reports about how noisy it was in bedrooms at the front But it was a weekend and no different to any other town Staff we encountered were polite helpful Bedroom was small but spacious enough for 2 people who were only going to use it to get ready sleep in 
114633,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, If I had to find something I would say that the croissants for breakfast were not really good but put that on me being French and picky about croissants , Extremely friendly staff very welcoming and helpful Room was clean and comfy nothing to complain about Breakfast was good enough to keep us going for the day 
114634,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The reception breakfast area was small and cramped Not obvious in the details Our welcome was poor from the staff , The room we stayed in the bathroom
114635,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was quite small with only one tiny window which made it feel a bit airless and box like That said it was quiet considering the central location , The room was really clean and well maintained and the shower was fantastic 
114636,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Hotel layout was like a maze and a nightmare in a fire Lift only to 1st floor Room221 was noisy due to a fan above the roof which tripped in regularly all night, Location
114637,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room too hot The weird entrance and lift at the side , Nice room bathroom toiletries hair dryer coffee tea buscuits etc Free wi fi cable to location
114638,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Lots of small items never a 4 star hotel we wanted more milk for the room and were told that we would have to wait until the morning , Room was clean 
114639,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, 1st room tv didn t work second room tv wasn t much better but the damp and the smell was awful avoid at all costs reception wasn t too bothered either ,No Positive
114640,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, I have stayed in single rooms in London but this one was really small Traffic noise was loud but it s London and my room faced Kensington High Street Bed would have been perfect if I was 3 shorter , Convenient for Kensington High Street and getting about on the bus to Oxford Street Regent Street Westminster etc Bathroom was nice and modern Coffee tea in the room Staff were really nice Has a lift so you don t have to hump your suitcase up the stairs 
114641,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The wifi is very slow and you constantly have to log in Our room was very very small and only had a tiny window facing a wall Other people in our group had great rooms with large windows with street views and large bathrooms for the same price that we paid It didn t seem right I booked this hotel because it said it had an elevator and we were travelling with older people And yes the hotel has an elevator BUT the elevator only goes from the ground floor to the first floor and the rooms were higher up which was unfortunate , Breakfast was good much better than other hotels we ve stayed at in London The location was perfect for us There were a lot of shops and restaurants nearby Staff was friendly 
114642,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing to not like as we are fit but the lift was not working which could be difficult for some as we were on the third floor , Really good rain shower Good selection of food at breakfast Very friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff We were able to leave our bag there for the day before our room was ready Very good Thai restaurant a couple of doors away Near the tube station and only ten fifteen minutes walk from the Royal Albert Hall 
114643,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, 2 hotels in same street so went to wrong one first sign for hotel up high so made it very hard to find no fire evacuation details fire exits very poorly signposted new room but problem in room as skylight was left open and no one could shut it good job it didn t rain as above bed so would have got wet , Location
114644,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The stairs A very small room glad I was solo , Staff at front desk very kind as I arrived feeling ill Staying again next weekend as location was good for what I needed it to be 
114645,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Size of room was too small for a couple Should be just for 1 person No wifi in rooms which is a problem for business trips , Best shower I ve ever had Bathroom mirror clear 
114646,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, It s on a main road and slightly noisy We live in a cul de sac that is silent and are not used to the noise , The room was small but very well sorted Facilities were clean and in good order 
114647,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Breakfast was poor and not much room for everyone The lighting our room flickered on and off but we just turned it for at the switch , Bed was comfy location good
114648,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room was rather small only a foot or so between end of bed and wall on which tv attached Steep flight of stairs up to reception may have been a problem for some Wi Fi a bit slow Lampshades over bedside lamps torn Continental breakfast not great not much fresh produce, Location very good and helpful staff Shower nice and bathroom clean and reasonably spacious
114649,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The staff is not rude but definetely rough The breakfast room is very badly positioned and equipped It is in the reception open space no privacy Not confortable without tablecloths and food quite artificial and badly arranged , Room was clean and the location is really convenient 
114650,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Rooms smell heavily of air freshener Room was very very small so moved to differ room , Good position for anything in South Kensington Handy for Tube 
114651,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The staff is the most unaccomidating I ve ever encountered My husband and I traveled from Paris to London With no problems with wifi I asked the staff three times the first night concerning the non functioning wifi in our room The one staff member basically said there was something wrong with my phone or user error Yet the moment I went downstairs and went to the dining area there was no problem connecting They just repeated over and over nothing was wrong and no one else had been complaining That was until someone walked in headed back to their room asking if the wifi was fixed yet according to the staff no one had made a complaint Fishy However the bed bugs is what sent us running I went downstairs after scratching all day to ask staff to switch us to a different room as I had about ten bites He said this was impossible as there were no other rooms available I asked three times then to speak to a manager who was unavailable til the next morning But once my husband realized he was getting bit he went downstairs to talk to the same person All of a sudden there was a room available This member of staff was rude the whole time and said I wasn t even considering moving to another room but 20 minutes prior there was no other room to move to So after asking for a refund and being on the phone with booking com the we were only refunded for two nights However I paid for 4 They only refunded me for the two nights we stayed Not even the two nights we did not stay and had to book another hotel down the street Which was so understanding and accomidatimg probably the single best hotel we ve stayed at When we are in London next we will not hesitate to book with Hilton double tree , The only good aspect of this hotel is that it s pretty close to the tube

114661,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Despite going during a hot humid period the ice machine was switched off which made no sense It would of been useful to have instructions on the air conditioning as the first night the air conditioning was very loud , The bed wasn t too soft as often in hotels they are too soft for my back There was a good selection of drinks at breakfast time In each room there was a smart phone which you could use free of charge to either search the internet or phone abroad for free 
114662,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, No flaws Didn t get this welcome drink but nevermind , Everything was amazing Friendly staff and room was clean I liked everything about it

114666,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Uncomfy bed very tiny shower Average welcome and no explanation at all for how the room worked Twice both our cards would not work to open our door and we had to reactivate them at the reception Had to activate the internet again with a code daily , Good TV and okay shower Good location

114672,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The first impression you get when you just enter into the hotel that it cannot be a hotel the chain of Best Western is not the luxury in the world but you still expect for some standards The bed size is so called full smaller than 140 cm for sure the linen is not so fresh the reception is tiny and small room full with some suspicious people Though it s located in relative central location the metro availability is bad 2 lines available only In the bottom line never back ,No Positive
114673,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Bathroom was extremely tight Had to sit down to use sink due to it was not very wide , Great customer service Manager quickly resolved a billing issue I encountered upon registration Hotel clerk was very friendly and helpful Location was great It was close by to many eateries shops and even a Starbucks

114678,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing , My wife was recovering from an operation and was walking with the aid of a crutch The reception could not have been more helpful and gave us a room on first floor next to the lift so that we had access to and from the hotel via a side entrance without having to use the stairs It was ideal 
114679,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, No complaints , Kensington High Street is a bustling interesting place It was a great location Our room faced the street but it was quiet at night We walked to the Royal Albert Hall for our concert 
114680,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, The breakfast was lovely and an extra bonus for this price on Kensington HighStreet Room clean with facilities for tea and coffee staff pleasant and helpful Overall very good 
114681,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There were so many smells We were woken by the smell of smoke one night and then in the middle of following day there were horrid smells , The room was a nice size We were able to check in early which was great as we had flown a long way 
114682,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, View from our window was looking into a building sight so luckily we were not in the room long room 207 , Great position food was plentiful bed comfy room had all we needed 
114683,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The matress is not comfotable at all It looks very old The hotel can not be 4 star It is not more than 2 star hotel , The staff is excellent The breakfast is fine 
114684,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in Room 134 avoid like the plague seems to be situated over the stairs and you hear every sound Coupled with that there were renovations being done on the roof which started before 6am on a Sunday No notification given at time of booking and no prior warning at check in I complained but the lily liveried manager in reception refused to accept my complaint and even suggested I was lying stating that builders had told him they didn t start til after 8 We heard another couple complain get angry and even demand to speak to Best Western Manager to no avail Totally spoiled what would have been a pleasant stay in a quirky hotel Won t be back to try again that s for certain , We knew rooms would be small which they were but very well appointed and packed with amenities Lovely bathroom with huge deluge shower 
114685,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was the smallest one I have ever had in any hotel in any country My legs did not fit in the bed and there was a continuous noise from the street also during the night The breakfast was well very basic , The location is good gives nice access to Kensington High Street as well as tube and bus connections 
114686,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Noisy main road outside Traffic audible in room Decor little dated not 4 star in my opinion Breakfast set up in very small area with Lots guests competing for use at same time, Good Location with access to underground nearby Lively area plenty shops and places to dine etc Room small and basic but clean Good value for central London with breakfast included
114687,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The only thing that it was not OK was the Internet connection It was really hard to get connected mostly at the end of the day when everyone was trying to access , The hotel had a good location The rooms were clean and very comfortable Breakfast was very good with a lot of options Everything was OK during our stay at this hotel I definitely recommend it 
114688,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was extremely small not much room to even walk past the bed Would have liked a bigger room , Room and bedding were clean Breakfast was more than adequate

114690,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Family jr suite was on the small side but that s to be expected in most London hotels Limited amenities but a few bar drinks were available and continental breakfast included , room was furnished and decorated nicely and was clean The shower was very nice and modern The staff was very helpful and friendly especially the manager who seemed to never have anytime off He was there everytime I went to reception Location was good easy access to Kensington High St shops and about 10 12 mins walk to the Olympia which is why we were there 
114691,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The mattress needed upgrading as it was one that allowed one partner to be disturbed if the other moved , We were courteously greeted by a most pleasant receptionist He politely showed us to our room The room and bathroom were very clean The bed was fairly comfortable The self serve breakfast was above average Free WiFi was available 
114692,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Nothing, Very clean great location fantastic staff Quiet hotel as I was staying on business needed it to be quiet Newly refurbished Great location stayed twice as it was so nice 
114693,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Entrance and staircase not particularly inviting Breakfast room a little stark and sterile , Central and close to tube Very clean with good shower Nice continental breakfast included in room price Friendly helpful staff 
114694,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The staff were incredibly rude I was made to wait 15 minutes to check in because the only member of staff available was a trainee which was absolutely fine as she was lovely however when the manager finally arrived he did not apologise himself Instead he huffed and puffed demanded I pay immediately handed me my key and disappeared off into the back Despite arranging a late check out over my booking and at the reception desk upon arrival I was awoken the next morning to bangs on my door and numerous calls demanding to know when I was going to leave as they had to clean the room , The bedrooms and bathroom were incredibly clean and quite stylish There were complimentary water coffee and tea and toiletries in the bathroom too which was much appreciated 
114695,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The breakfast layout could be improved to allow easier access to the food coffee when there are a number of guests , Easy access to the underground train system and buses Nice area with plenty of restaurants cafes and shops Room decor was modern and fresh The room was comfortable The breakfast was good

114697,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Shower kept changing temperature which was a bit annoying but didn t bother me too much , Good location Your man who was working at reception the majority of our stay was a top guy Breakfast was ideal and for being included you can t complain unless your an ungrateful twat Room was perfect size and you get free water everyday which was appreciated massively the first night when we forgot to get juice for the room and we had had a massive nandos before so was desperate for a drink Nandos joined onto the same building what more could you want 
114698,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Payed online but had to swipe card again and pay 20 extra as deposit for just in case we took something from the room , Continental breakfast was toast bread hard boiled egg and cheese 
114699,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was extremely small The bed as well we had a problem to fit onto it properly Also our room had a window facing a vent coming from the floor below which was incredibly noisy at night It was a choise between being hot at night or being unable to sleep due to the noise , I loved the location So close to the tube on District and Circle line that takes you to the most important and seeked out locations within minutes The room was always very clean breakfasts were certainly sufficient Staff was very nice and helpful 
114700,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, I was disappointed a bout the fact I couldn t use my membership to get discount Also I was told the room was an executive room I feel the room was very small no bath tub no slippers Although there was a telephone in the room but the was no note how to use the phone , The receptionist was very nice and helpful

114706,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There was some confusion as the booking com price I had secured didn t immediately show up I had to forward the booking com confirmatoon , Rrally friendly guy on check in and free upgrade 
114707,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Room smelt musty windows streaming with water Reception staff particularly miserable and unhelpful Did not activate key or hand out wifi details so had to go back down to reception twice, Room decor was very nice bathroom facilities modern breakfast had good choices but again miserable staff 
114708,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, No windows Soap dispenser squirted at 90degree angle Plug sockets so close to tabletops that it s a battle to plug appliances in Both trivial but worth noting to assist future users We would stay again , Location Close and cheap parking after 6pm Comfy bed Good shower 
114709,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, 1 The wifi connection kept dropping continuously all through our stay making it impossible to use the internet, 1 Great Location 2 Comfortable room bathroom 3 Adequate functional breakfast
114710,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The most unhelpful staff I have ever come across in a hotel very unpleasant and very unfriendly , Good location and nice comfortable room Quiet even though it is right on High Street Ken 
114711,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, We stayed in room 207 the room was small but adequate However there was an industrial Air conditioning unit outside the window which came on every ten minutes making a terrible noise waking us on several occasions , All the staff were friendly and helpful The location for an event at Olympia was perfect Lots of choice for venues to eat and drink Located very close to the tube for easy access to central London 
114712,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, n a, Very friendly staff Great location just opposite Holland Park well worth a visit a few minutes from the tube close to good shops and the museums Small bedroom but really comfortable very clean and well appointed Thoroughly recommended Visit the nearby Whole Foods Market great experience 
114713,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, The staff were really helpful from arrival to departure The hotel was top notch Great choice of food for breakfast Within easy walking distance of Olympia for work and great choice of restaurants for after event I attended 
114714,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, A little noisy from the high street, Very clean modern room lovely rainforest shower and next door to Nando s what do you need a really big room for It s small but has everything you need including tea and coffee decent breakfast 
114715,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The hotel s public areas and the rooms were way too small even for a European hotel The staff were not overly friendly Hotel is on a very busy road so there is a lot of road noise 24 7 , Kensington location was good Near the shops restaurants and tube station 
114716,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Unfortunately the room had a dislodged toilet flush button that did work but you had to perform some kind of contortion exercise to get to it within the wall Also shockingly the plug socket at the desk ha no cover which I didn t realise until I d plugged in my laptop and a huge spark leapt out Maintenance , great location friendly staff clean and comfortable 
114717,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia,No Negative, The Room has everything you need in an efficient space that offers great value for money The location was so perfect for us not having to get the underground saves a lot of money 
114718,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, There was nothing we really didn t like and would only venture that some of the reviews which talk of compact room size perhaps don t appreciate the cost of space in London Yes the rooms are compact but well appointed and with all the facilities you can expect of this standard of hotel , The location of the hotel is fantastic in just the right place for the activities we had planned and far enough away from the late night life to be relatively quiet overnight 
114719,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, Where to start the hotel said breakfast was included hence the reason we chose this hotel to find it was only a mediocre continental breakfast then we was told there was parking for a fee what we wasn t told is it was 50 so we could have payed more to stay in a better hotel and get free parking and a fried breakfast it needs to state this on the webpage, Liked the shower and location
114720,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The room was a little too small inadequate space for 2 pieces of luggage so we had to manage the space constraint by maneuvering around Good for a short 1 2 days stay but might be challenging for 2 people over a long stay But the bed was comfortable and room was quiet the windows were adequately sound proofed My daughter and I had a good night s sleep Have booked to return for another two nights soon , The complimentary wifi simple but adequate breakfast convenient location near the tube station and shopping along Kensington High Street and most importantly the efficient and accomodating service of the Manager and staff at the Seraphine 
114721,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, just that it was on the frist floor so had to carry bags up but that s just splitting hairs For the money this is superb value for money, Helpful and friendly staff excellent cleanliness room was immaculate heating and air con all worked shower gel and soap and courtesey tray 
114722,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, The corridors and public areas were dated and a bit dirty especially the carpets The lift system for the luggage needs updating especially as there is a sloped access so while waiting for the lifts wheelie suitcases roll back out towards the main road and have to be chased , Staff were very helpful and friendly the room itself was very clean and the price included breakfast which was great value for central London 
114723,Best Western Seraphine Kensington Olympia, My booking was described as a Junior Suite I was given a room with a double and single bed in it which made space minimal I did query the term Junior Suite and was told that that was what that type of room was called , Nice decor
