398945,Hotel The Serras, Nothing, The smell as you walk in the hotel The sound isolation in the room you hear nothing The unbelievable attention to details Extraordinary friendly staff all over the place The seating area at the rooftop Every single thing in this place I ve never loved any place like I loved the Serras
398946,Hotel The Serras, Nothing you can t fault this hotel , The best hotel of our trip to Europe The location food and cleanliness are all amazing but the staff make this place perfect Right from arrival we had a very personal experience with the staff and they all felt like friends Great recommendations and excellent views service from the rooftop Thank you for such a great stay I can t recommend this hotel enough

398948,Hotel The Serras, We could hear noise transmitted through the ceiling and walls at times Not a deal breaker , Service was off the chart Nothing was too much trouble for them Hotel was in a great spot Food was excellent Rooftop bar was fantastic 
398949,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, We booked The Serras because of the excellent ratings on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed Luxuriously appointed rooms professional friendly staff and plenty of them and a convenient central location this is the perfect boutique hotel We booked a junior suite as we were traveling with a teenager and it worked out great a compact room but well thought out so we all had our own space and felt pampered We didn t dine in the restaurant but ate breakfast here every morning which was a lovely leisurely start to the day We especially enjoyed the roof terrace with its imaginatively prepared cocktails and delicious small plates I would have no hesitation in recommending The Serras 
398950,Hotel The Serras, The room was noisy due to the music on the roof terrace We felt it didn t quite match up to other 5 star hotels we have stayed in due to the size Pool very small and compact , Great location for exploring Barcelona The hotel staff were all very helpful 
398951,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, The whole experience from check in to check out was first class The staff have the ability to make you feel very relaxed which is sometimes tricky with a hotel of this standard The bed was out of this world This truly is a magical hotel 
398952,Hotel The Serras, The gym has alot to be desired Although not the focus of the visit the gym is a tiny room with no windows and it is clostrophobic in the basement only accessible by elevator , All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful The room was excellent corner with street view yet very quiet due to excellent sound insulation Excellent room service 
398953,Hotel The Serras, That we didn t have more time here, Lovely staff perfect location and really comfortable roomswoth yummy treats left bedside Awesome roof deck and plunge pool
398954,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, Diego and all the staff at the hotel The Serras are an absolute delight The level of service they delivered constantly was exceptional across the board Food and wine at the hotel was outstanding cocktails at the rooftop bar oh how we miss them I can whole heartedly recommend the hotel The Serras to any one visiting the beautiful city of Barcelona P S Check out De Antonio yachts ask in the hotel we chartered a boat with them to watch the sunset over the city sky line which was an awesome experience the perfect end to our trip 
398955,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, Rooms were clean modern and spacious Very comfortable bed Mobile phone provided for use during stay with city guides and free calls text data including to US Great attention to detail Staff was exceptional and very helpful making reservations for us on several occasions Rooftop bar was great very comfortable with nice views of the city 
398956,Hotel The Serras, The rooms are a little small when travelling with an infant but that wasn t a surprise given the location of the hotel Our pre booked hotel transfer back to the airport turned up without the specified baby seat this caused some anxiety and spoiled the very end of our stay , The staff were very friendly and the location is superb Breakfast was really good 
398957,Hotel The Serras, Nothing it was outstanding, Couldn t fault the hotel the location and facilities were great The staff were very friendly they recommended local tapas bars that were excellent however I would recommend that anyone who stays there eats at their own restaurant at least once it was outstanding and great value
398958,Hotel The Serras, The only small niggle is when we tried to pop in to Restaurant Informal for an early bite to eat but were turned away by a snooty maitre d who was just not interested in seating us in an otherwise almost empty restaurant We were slightly dressed down but as guests at the hotel we weren t expecting to be insistently directed to the rooftop bar or the level 1 snack area A disappointing blemish to an otherwise brilliant experience , A simply outstanding hotel and we loved the outstanding check in process a chilled glass of cava is always welcome Rooms beautifully detailed and luxuriously equipped Location outstanding Room serviced twice a day Service at an international 6 star standard Highly highly recommended 
398959,Hotel The Serras, I was disappointed to have a view of the wall of the building across the narrow street I came down with food poisoning on the second day and all I had eaten was a club sandwich on the rooftop terrace i tried to pay in euros but it was too late they said , The room was quite luxurious and the extra large bed was great Loved the rooftop terrace with the view over the port and the city 
398960,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, We loved the intimacy and boutique nature of the hotel with lovely roof garden along with being in the gothic district and all its wonderful architecture
398961,Hotel The Serras, Request for cocktails a bit slow but they were worth the wait , Just got back from a superb stay at The Serras with my sister We both absolutely loved it From the friendly staff superb restaurant great cocktails roof top bar with amazing views a fantastic location for exploring the marina beach Gothic quarter Already planning a trip back with my husband Best hotel in Barcelona I have ever stayed at including the infamous Majestic 
398962,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, The hotel is on the farthest south end of Gothic Quarter VERY easy to re locate after wandering all day Morever the location is on a major street with 4 lanes of traffic and our room faced the street yet we NEVER heard a sound sound proof windows were amazing Nearly all taxi drivers knew the hotel just by us saying Serras That was very nice 
398963,Hotel The Serras, Limited to 3 Nespresso capsules in a double room and 2 teabags Had to pay for more At 295 a night I thought this was very stingy , Beautiful hotel in a great location Staff were amazing 
398964,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, Excellent standard of service and I can t wait to return I loved the fact that reception contacted me prior to arrival to ask me whether there was anything they could assist with The staff were simply awesome they provided fantastic recommendations for tapas bars The restaurant is well worth a visit the desserts are amazing 
398965,Hotel The Serras, The rooms could have been a little larger , The hotel was in a great location Staff very accommodating and helpful beautiful roof top with music Friday and Saturday nights Must sit up there and have a picture of sangria and enjoy the view I rented a scooter for the 4 days I was there and was a great option Got to see everything The hotel staff is very good Always putting fresh towels and tidying up when we would leave Would definitely recommend 
398966,Hotel The Serras, The only thing I would request are more channels in English only news channels there was not allot to watch on TV Even a movie channel would be great , The staff was amazing very helpful I also liked that the hotel was small boutique Also it was on the water so it felt very open some of the hotels in the Gothic quarter just due to the nature of the streets were very closed in this one felt open and had a great view of the port 
398967,Hotel The Serras, Nothing , The staff were very welcoming and were wonderful in recognising and celebrating my husband s birthday The rooms are beautiful with extremely comfortable beds 
398968,Hotel The Serras, It s hard to fault this hotel An iron in the room might have been helpful but not essential , Our whole experience at Las Serras was perfect from beginning to end The bed was perhaps the best hotel bed I ve ever slept in the breakfast was delicious and the staff could not have been more helpful Thanks for the Cava on arrival and the amuse bouche each night before bed Lovely gesture

398972,Hotel The Serras, Nothing, So many have praised the hotel so let me get into the quirky little things I liked about the hotel The pillow menu I believe there were 6 7 types to choose from Great for people that like a particular type of pillow Push botton shower This thing should be in every hotel Towels were really soft I really liked them I can put up more but these really stand out for me Big praise to the staff from all over the hotel everyone were top notch very friendly and Professionals 
398973,Hotel The Serras,No Negative, Super friend staffs who remembered most if not all of the guests Hot water not hot enough for the first night which to me wasn t much of a problem but really irritating for my friend Glad that it was fixed next morning and we have a champagne as compensation

398976,Hotel The Serras, Nothing could really have been better Breakfast was expensive but lovely we don t eat a huge amount of food so we didn t really eat the amount we could have for the cost , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is lovely with a roof top terrace and pool and as it is January we were supplied with blankets and fire effect heaters when sitting on the terrace every evening The bed was extremely comfortable and everything in the hotel was spotlessly clean and tasteful The location is perfect for exploring Barcelona and I would highly recommend this hotel for a luxurious stay in a beautiful city 
398977,Hotel The Serras, We booked to have our car back at the hotel for 9 30pm but it didn t arrive until 10pm and we had to catch a ferry , The staff and hotel are fantastic check in was superb as was the communication before hand 
398978,Hotel The Serras, Pricey but best location in Barcelona Room was small but very comfortable Room service menu was limited They should have allowed restaurant to provide room service meals that wasn t an option , Staff was INCREDIBLE Upon arrival greeted with an awesome Cava and a toy car for our 7 year old that made his trip Do not miss the restaurant They have Sangria in glasses the size of your head on the rooftop lounge Beds were super super comfortable First class operation 
398979,Hotel The Serras, I would rate the hotel as very good four star and therefore it is overpriced terrible view to backyard swimming pool is not suitable for swimming just sauna bath, Staff is very friendly and helpful Excellent location for gothic city and harbour

398997,Hotel The Serras, Not to fault the hotel the pool is a bit small limited by the initial rooftop space The surrounding terrace and lounges make up for the pool and make for great views of the harbor , Hotel staff are all amazing and exemplify the meaning of true hospitality The hotel is modern yet comfortable and every detail well planned 
398998,Hotel The Serras, Price of food and drink was high compared to elsewhere Food was a little dull and unambitous especially on roof deck, Well furnished rooms with adequate space Top location to see Barcelona
398999,Hotel The Serras, We loved everything about it , It is a sophisticated and elegant property unbeatable location on the shorefront but backs on to the Gothic area superb rooftop facility pool area but doubles as a wonderful location for drinks and light suppers but is a boutique hotel with a great ambience

399026,Hotel The Serras, The only thing we didn t like was having to go home , Great location in front of the harbour and a short walk from the beaches the historical areas and the Ramblas for the nightlife All staff were fabulous from the moment they helped us with our luggage from the taxi and gave us a glass of ice cold bubbly as we sat at the reception desk to the moment we left Everywhere was spotlessly clean rooms equipped to highest standard from Nespresso machine to the fabulous huge walk in power shower attention to detail second to none will stay at this hotel again at the first chance we get definitely could see how being a small boutique hotel competing with better know chains of hotels made them go the extra mile
