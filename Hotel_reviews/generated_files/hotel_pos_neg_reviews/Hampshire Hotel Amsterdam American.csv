369023,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only thing we didn t like was that the nespresso machine in our room didn t work , We got a free upgrade to a room with an awesome view Furthermore the breakfast was crazy delicious 
369024,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our room was recently redone and the aesthetic choices are pretty awful , Beautiful spot gorgeous architecture breakfast offerings and hall are magnificent
369025,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, the room had unattractive decor and was lacking in comfort eg only one chair to sit on bad lighting although deluxe The hotel was surrounded by noisy and dusty roadworks I think booking com especially as you are in amsterdam should have made potential bookers aware of that the outside cafe etc were unusable and the noise started early in the morning and hindered access it was disappointing , the staff were very helpful and pleasant without road works the location would be good 
369026,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I attempted to have a car and driver pick us up on our arrival but to whom ever I communicated seemed to think I wanted some sort of airport shuttle I arranged it on my own , Room was better than described and canal view with large windows was as promised 
369027,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The noises from next doors showers and bathrooms were like a waterfall in the room whenever they were used I was about to ask for a change of room but there was quiet again during the nights , The location is excellent I love the Art Deco restaurant 
369028,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The hotel is a little outdated and could do with some refurbishing , Great location If you are fond of walking you can basically walk everywhere Check in and check out was swift and easy We took a taxi from the airport and it cost 50 euros compared to about 30 euros on the way back with Uber If you aren t keen on figuring out public transport call an Uber instead of a taxi from the airport 
369029,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We were put in a river view room with a balcony on the first floor only for there to be extensive work being done on the outside of the property which we hadn t been informed about Work noise started at 7 30am however the hotel were very accommodating when we asked to change rooms ,No Positive
369030,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bathroom area was very cramped and being an old building you did hear other guests moving around in their room above, The staff were great We asked for an upgrade and got it for a small extra fee which we were happy to pay The mini bar had a small area for personal use which was great And the complementary various coffee was great 
369031,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, This hotel has been around for about 100 years Art Deco design elements bedroom deco reminiscent of that era too but still comfortable Clean friendly helpful staff right on a tram link to the main station near a bus link to the airport near the museum quarter and next to a canal with hop on hop off boats Hotel recommended excellent local restaurants and we re very helpful about public transport options It s a big hotel so could feel a little large and impersonal for some 
369032,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Best location to choose midages wonderful resturant and bar Excellent freindly receptionist Murice although he was a traniee he listned exactly to my concenrs and made sure we were satisfied with our room staff remarkably More professional than others we deal with in other hotels all around the globe Would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone 
369033,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Road works under repair made it a little noisy in the a m Obviously not the hotels fault, Great location good size room makes a pleasant change for Europe heaps of restaurants bars within 2 blocks 
369034,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The check in and out was super slow Also we booked 2 identical rooms double classic but 1 was the 1 2 in size of the other Also the bathroom was very small and everything felt just a bit outdated , the location was excellent and it was nice to have a terras bar just at the hotel with a fountain in front There was a bath albeit small The bar Americain where breakfast was served was gorgeous and breakfast was impeccable with lots of choices fresh omelet or pancakes prepared la minute and glass of cava 
369035,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room amenities are dated especially the bathrooms and the decoration More toiletries would have been appreciated especially given the price of the rooms There was an error made by a staff member during check in which was very annoying and cause for concern , This historical building has a lot of character The staff was courteous and helpful The location was perfect Beautiful setting near the canal Several tram lines just outside made it super easy to travel to other places in Amsterdam 
369036,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The shower has two identical controls for the water Based on many showers the world over the natural assumption is that the two controls are for hot and cold water respectively In fact the right hand tap is for setting the temperature and the left one the water flow The water is very hot in the bathroom and I had really hot water burning my feet before I found the correct use of the taps There needs to be a notice explaining this The shower is over the bath The bath is very deep sided and many elderly people would struggle to get into it The chair at the desk in the bedroom is very lightly balanced Anyone leaning back in the chair could easily overbalance backwards and injure themselves Both matters brought to the attention of management Given the high standards in other areas there is every likelihood that they will be dealt with positively , Really helpful and friendly staff Hotel full of character and beautifully positioned right in the heart of the old city An imposing design topped by a historic clock tower 
369037,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Sun every day , Comfortable hotel at top location to explore A dam Breakfast in the prettiest artdeco restaurant in town Nice relaxed staff Good noiseless airco and you can open a window also 
369038,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms were dated carpets stained balcony and patio furniture old and not cleaned Overall the rooms seemed unclean but think it was really the condition of everything The carpets need to be replaced badly Given I didn t spend much time in the room these things were tolerable But if I wanted to a place to relax it wouldn t be in the rooms , The hotel staff were great They were very friendly engaging and treated us very well The location was in walking distance to great restaurants museums and tram And the bar staff was the best 
369039,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Windows weren t sound proof couldn t prevent the noise from the outside to come through Breakfast spread doesn t cater enough to people who are vegetarians On Tuesday Jul18th morning they ran out of a type of bread that my niece wanted , Excellent location Everything was within 10 15 mins 
369040,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, A good hotel with courteous and helpful staff The location is pleasant notwithstanding present street works in the immediate vicinity In addition it is within walking distance of the major museums 10 minutes on foot and the old city centre 20 minutes Though trams passed frequently we did not feel the need to use pubic transport Two streets of restaurants 200 metres away provided good mainly ethnic choice though not up market In addition however we found some some quality restaurants notably indonesian rijstafel and italian a few minutes walk away and reasonably priced in relation to the quality Did not eat at the hotel We would stay again 
369041,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing could have been better , We were offered an upgrade while checking in for a nominal fee which we gladly accepted We loved everything from Maurice at reception to the bartenders in the bar We can t wait to go back 
369042,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Pillows too thick for my neck issues even though I ordered two more pillow choices Motion detector in room turns on bright light when we made excursions to bath during the night I had to cover it with paper to stop it City light through window was adequate , Great concierge Fantastic location Transportation around Amsterdam outstanding Short walk to world class museums dining shopping and people watching 
369043,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There were only two very minor things I did not like but I wouldn t hold them against the hotel per se I only add there here as some others may dislike them The first was the duvet for the bed Our bed was massive and extremely conformable but the duvet was split into two parts It was as if they were intended for twin beds which is what it ended up feeling like The second is regarding the shower gel The hotel provides a dispenser on the wall in the shower rather than as a separate single use bottle I have only ever seen this been done in the Ibis hotels so it came across as cheap and not what I would have expected from a 4 star hotel I do however see the argument that this method of dispensing the shower gel is more environmental which is why I would not complain about it I just know for some this might be a bigger issue , The hotel exceeded all our expectations Its location is superb The staff are very friendly The rooms are large and the decor is uniquely beautiful The staff accommodated all our needs and we were given a room with a fantastic view overlooking the canal Despite construction on the bridge nearby we found the hotel room to be very quiet and the bed extremely comfy We were well rested following our stay The exterior of the building is also unique and beautiful with a nice fountain in front of the restaurant The tram is less than 2 minutes walk away which will take you pretty much anywhere you need to go at a reasonable rate The major museums and parks are also within a 5 10 minute walk from the hotel 
369044,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, check in and check out too slow rooms with balcony cannot be properly considered double rooms as they are too small and thr bed is too small so they are fine for single occupancy not for double I would have expected a better reception in a four star hotel, wonderful location fascinating historic building nice view from the room with balcony
369045,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I never seen so small room the hotel is nice only form the outside inside its like 30 years without refurbishment, only location and maybe breakfast it was good
369046,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was a little dark and hanging space for clothes very limited Lighting in the room was bad especially where you were supposed to put your clothes It lacked character in the rooms , Staff were very friendly Breakfast was excellent Good location 
369047,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Staff was extremely impolite since the moment we arrived at the check in till the moment we left Breakfast we had to ask all the time for coffee and nobody paid attention to it Our room was located in the part of hotel were works were conducting such as painting and refurbishment At 9 00 am works started with no rest Painters asked us if could be possible to leave door open to pain a part of the door don t think this was ok and we said no Definitely not a 4 stars hotel Extremely overpriced , Location only
369048,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms are not sound proof you can hear the foot steps a in the adjacent rooms and the street noise were very disturbing The rooms is very dark while closing the curtains , The staff were helpful and very friendly Hotel s location was good as well 
369049,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, i have requested to remove mini bar in room multiple times but they don t response Also the room ground is made from wood and when you walk in room you hear some sound from wooden ground The breakfast restaurant close early about 10 30 am and this let us miss breakfast Left is small for child trolly , I really enjoyed food quality provided in room very delicious and well made But the menu is short and you have few choices specially for vegetarians Staff were friendly concierge Very friendly 
369050,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, I just can t fault this hotel The location the room can t account for any others obviously the staff every single one of them the bar and the restaurant the legacy The restaurant makes one feel like a superstar I left and re entered the hotel with a smug grin on my face pleased that I was staying here Helpful and friendly staff eager to assist and do their bit to make your visit the best it can be Thank you to everyone I met at Amsterdam American Hotel especially to Mathilda who gave me a balcony room and who was so kind and welcoming throughout my stay Such a cool hotel in an amazing location with a simple walk to any part of this incredible city 
369051,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Checkout was not asked how my stay was or did We enjoy the Hotel or City , Everything Location to Paradiso was a big factor Fantastic local music bar The Waterhole and we also eat some REAL Dutch food We will come back 
369052,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Staff took 100 for the room on booking in stating it would be returned in cash in booking out Making the mistake of relying on this cash when we booked out amazingly it couldn t be returned due to staff error and I would have to wait up to 5 weeks for my card to be reembursed Not acceptable at all especially due to the matter of fact manner of the staff Also a 45 city tax taken off me which had never been mentioned anytime by anyone Soured the experience totally for me , Location
369053,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Unfriendly waitstaff and cost of room was excessive for not very much luxury Room was large but tiny little bathroom and risky tub for showder , Free breakfast was a requirement It was good but the waitstaff was elusive Staff was ok but not friendly or helpful 
369054,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bathroom was a little small personally I prefer a spacious shower instead of climbing in a bathtub The minibar is heavily overpriced but this is the same everywhere so not really a complaint , I needed to stay only one night in the city for a birthday party and booked the Americain because of its location and previous satisfactory visits As I was travelling alone I booked a room for one person and at arrival was given a 3 person hotel room which was absolutely lovely The beds are great they give you the option to choose your favourite pillow big plus the view was very entertaining Leidse square and the breakfast options are plenty The staff is friendly and helpful The room was clean The location was perfect for my plans The interior is very beautiful 
369055,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I had to be cautious getting out the shower tub it s a big step down But that s really a minor nitpick Everything else was great , The hotel is in a great location there s a tram stop right outside The hotel seemed tidy and clean Our room was very spacious and clean the bed was comfortable It was pretty quiet I didn t hear anyone in the hallway The bar in the lobby is nice they had some fun gin and tonics and the bar itself is really nice 
369056,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, A rather noisy location but to be expected in such a bustling city , Staff very friendly Perfect hotel for a citybreak Next to both a tram stop and the canal boat stop 
369057,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Small gym Few equipment Bathroom was small Beds are too soft It s just a foam like mattress on top of a divan For a four star hotel is not acceptable Water pressure for shower was low Breakfast spread was acceptable but not great , Excellent location Close to restaurants and shops and the museums and tram stop nearby Yet away from the main city centre Bus from airport stops right across the road 5 bus fare Canal cruise starts at the hotel doorstep Very nice steakhouses nearby Lovely restaurant for breakfast Room was big and aircon was good Very clean bathrooms
369058,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No complaints , Room was clean and large for Amsterdam standards Nice bathroom Everything was very comfortable overall Staff at the reception desk were very friendly and helpful They were great to work with Location was terrific Quiet but close to everything I would request a room with a view next time as the canal in front of the hotel was lovely I would definitely stay here again 
369059,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It s a shame that there are major roadworks going on outside the hotel at the moment There was very loud drilling and sawing going on until extremely late at night and started by 8am in the morning I therefore had a poor nights sleep , I travelled with my 16 year old daughter so it was a good location for shopping and restaurants We felt safe walking around this area Easy for picking up public transport to and from the airport The room was ok for 1 night stay Bathroom was compact The single beds were wide and comfortable The reception staff were very helpful and kind We hadn t booked breakfast there so cannot comment on this 
369060,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, For room service breakfast a mere basket of pastries was 20 Euro and at checkout I learned it s service charge for room service was an additional whopping 25 euro after tipping the server , The staff was eager to please 
369061,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, nothing, Extremely friendly and helpful staff Beautifully decorated the restaurant bar had good facilities Right in the middle of all the action of the city Close to bars and restaurants
369062,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Internet was slow Value for money , Maybe the best breakfast of the city excellent value for money great variety fantastic atmosphere The baristas of the hotel s bar are fantastic really great serive the menu of the drinks is quite good also 
369063,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Because it s an older hotel the floor in our room and the one above us was creaky Would be nice if that could be addressed at some point , Our room was a good size Hotel is conveniently located to several of the tram lines The stain glass in the hallways and restaurant was stunning Breakfast although it was extra was well worth the money 
369064,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a bit of road work outside but it did not interfere with hotel operations and accessibility , Great location historical building and very nicely renovated rooms Would definitely come back 
369065,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Construction was in front of the door we were not able to reach hotel by car and the taxi drop us 100 Mtr away Bed was not Comfort at all , nice hotel with Two Access Excellent Location Friendly Staff Nice Wifi nice Bar And Restaurant Love the Decoration 
369066,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Honestly I really enjoyed my vacation in the hotel , Location close to many restaurants and shopping stores Also it s away from red light district where the x show and coffeeshops 
369067,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, House keeping knocked the door at 8 am 2 days in a row which was too early But other than that absolutely nothing , Everything was Great The location was central and close to everything It was 20 to 30 min walk to central station which was great for exploring The hotel was clean and comfortable Would definitely recommend it for future stays 
369068,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location for us close to a large park where we went walking and not to far to walk to all the main attractions food location and shops we wanted to visit 
369069,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Initially they gave us a horrible almost windowless interior room I had to change it immediately it s quite an expensive hotel for what you get and I chose it largely because it was attractive so to be offered a very ugly room was really depressing I couldn t have spent 1 night in there let alone 3 That said the minute I protested I was given another room But I would have preferred not to have started my holiday like that Not very soundproof I was woken by my neighbour s telephone alarm Location is convenient for museums and boats but it s a big noisy square full of tourists drinkers and right now roadworks Next time I would stay in the museum quarter itself or in Jordaan , I chose it for the art deco architecture and proximity to museums It s a fun building beautiful deco cafe room and lovely window in our room Very comfortable bed important after aLOT of walking quiet aircon and total blackout curtains Nice young staff
369070,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was very tired and dark although perfectly clean and comfortable , The staff were very efficient and extremely friendly The concierge was particularly helpful making thoroughly excellent suggestions for no tourist restaurants to go to at night and suggestions of nice routes to walk 
369071,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, This hotel has several rooms that look like they might have been storage rooms many years ago but which are now fitted as guest rooms and that s where we were put Our room was painted black with a red accent wall and another white wall with black flooring black draperies and bed linens and was so dark that you couldn t easily find things if you dropped something on the floor There were several shelves just inside the door also painted black and adding to the dreary atmosphere but they were great for our things The lighting was not very good exacerbated by too much black and windows that were so not tall but very high up on the wall so you really couldn t see out What light they let in was impeded by the black draperies and heavy sheers on the windows There was an overhead light and each side of the bed had a gooseneck LED but it was not really sufficient for reading The room has a bar fridge full of all sorts of things but it s hooked up to a sensor so if you move anything in the fridge you will be automatically charged There was a small 6 square section that would could put a couple of cans of something but it wasn t tall enough to put a bottle of water Since dark little room we were in was fairly expensive this kind of fridge strikes me as being nothing more than a cash grab The unit is of little practical use The TV was okay but only for the person on that side of the bed because it was small and didn t really extend far enough that the other person could see it We weren t there to watch TV but if it s in the room I d like it to be usable There was a lot of construction in the front of the hotel but no signage to tell you where to go to get into it The construction isn t the hotel s fault the lack of signage is , The hotel is right on one of the canals and there are several major tram lines running in the area You can pick up a canal cruise right outside the front door of the hotel There also are many bars restaurants cafes etc nearby so you have lots of options I wasn t there to shop so can t comment In the room the bed was comfortable and they had a kettle which is nice The room also had air conditioning a help in 35 degree weather 
369072,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There is road construction going on now but it should be finished soon , The staff were very friendly and nice The restaurant bar is a beautiful historic gem It is located within walking distance 5 minutes of museum district and flower market Be sure to take a canal ride it is located literally across the street 
369073,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, 1 Main hotel Doors are closed at late night you need to have short chat to come on 2 Bathroom was so small however it s practical for me since, 1 Location is markable it s near by everything i e restaurants bars and transportation 2 front desk team are great super easy processes for checking in and out 3 price value
369074,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Crazy storage for our clothes Just small shelves behind each side of the bed which meant we still had to use our suitcases Plenty of space in the room for some drawers ,No Positive
369075,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, WiFi was intermittent , Quiet comfortable room with no view It was an interior room and because of this it was quiet Staff were friendly and accommodating and hotel was conveniently located to transit shops and restaurants 
369076,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, D cor starting to look a little tired for a 4 star hotel I Was disappointed to see staff brushing breadcrumbs of breakfast tables an onto the wooden floor this does not show the sort of pride you would expect from an upmarket hotel , Comfortable beds large rooms pleasant and helpful staff Situated in the Leidersplein area which has the best bars and restaurants in Amsterdam 
369077,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Construction on going at the hotel , near everything cancel shopping trolley restaurants sightseeing Beautiful hotel and staff were very accommodating 
369078,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was old and outdated The mattress was thin and soft , The staff could not have been more accommodating Very professional and personable The location was excellent 
369079,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Road works outside the hotel prevented easy access by taxi , We visited Amsterdam for a family event on the city outskirts but my wife and I decided to stay an extra night in the centre The hotel is not completely central but so close as makes no difference due to the existence of the tram line A cheap one hour ticket gets you into the very centre in just a few minutes And it is right next to a hop on hop off canal boat service Internally the hotel is very clean and well maintained The staff are very friendly and helpful and the room was a good size very clean and the bed was exceptionally comfortable We will definitely look it up when next in Amsterdam 
369080,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a break down in communication between the property and booking com so on arrival our room had been taken by someone else But the hotel did a very good job of rectifying the situation and put us up in an alternative 5 property for the night , Location near the lively night spots
369081,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, wish we d stayed longer, Very quiet even though we are in a busy area hotel was beautiful and the d cor sublime Room was very large and the beds very comfortable with dream inducing pillows
369082,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was too small i mean me and my luggage did not fit and i changed to a bigger room paying extra Hotel was expensive booked it for location Full of steps and staff not so helpful so build some muscles carrying your luggage, Good location hotel looks really amazing from outside
369083,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Unbelievable small rooms , The location was perfect and the personal too Good breakfast After we moved to another room we got view to the city instead of inside the hotel 
369084,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Finding the hotel location was a little difficult upon arrival as it is behind the theatre and not next to it But with asking people we found it , We had a spectacle at the DelaMar theatre and for this the location is excellent for this The hotel is nice and the rooms space with enough space 
369085,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very expensive breakfast skipped it city tax it should be calculated in the price of the room Expensive mini bar including water Still water should be free , fantastic location super comfortable bed choice of pillows high ceilings large balcony beautiful interior of common spaces very professional and friendly staff 
369086,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Reception was very full and not really friendly Also it took so much time They had to fill out a lot of paper work Not like in other hotels Rooms were quite old Especially the bathroom shower , Location is very fine and the building as such Also the staff in the Restaurant Breakfast
369087,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, It is an impressive building originally built in the 1800 s Rooms very Art Deco Superb restaurant and terras Great breakfast buffet Stone throw away from Leidseplein Nespresso coffee in room
369088,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, They offer bed boards I suggest you get one The tub was hard to get into for the showers not accessible The minibar wouldn t open but who needs it anyway Lighting was dim besides the bathroom , The staff was always helpful The location is right on three main tram lines from the central station so travel was easy Some rooms look out onto the canal others are quiet and look out onto a courtyard The electric hot water heater was nice to have in the room with the instant coffee cocoa tea There was also an ironing board and iron There was plenty of space and the A C worked well I didn t use the sauna or exercise room but the hotel was equipped and there s apples and water there 
369089,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Pillow choice was just the icing on the cake Very unexpectedly upgraded to a junior suite Stayed here many times and this hotel never fails to make me feel at home The highest praise Well done 
369090,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Construction outside hotel, Location was brilliant Within walking distance to everything Hotel was so nice and the bed was unbelievably comfortable Had the best weekend ever 
369091,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not the hotels fault but there is a full building project going on by the canal in front of the hotel and early morning construction work very loud but only on weekdays , Great location for museums and the heart of Amsterdam Staff were wonderful and helpful especially the concierge who was superb at organising a very special trip on the canals and a top class Tesla taxi back to the airport Top marks for customer service 
369092,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Street was being repaired and access to the hotel was obstructed due to the same Was a little noisy despite the windows being shut due to the convenient location , Room was very clean and nice Well located Staff was very helpful Especially the concierge desk were all very courteous and helpful 
369093,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Fabulously roomy perfectly clean sensational location Have stayed here twice now and if we ever go to Amsterdam again would be happy to stay a 3rd time 
369094,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was cramped with insufficient space for luggage Duvet was too small for the size of the bed Air con appeared to switch itself off overnight , Great staff helpful professional Modern decour Range of available pillows Good location 
369095,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The building is absolutely beautiful and an amazing space but the interiors are a little dated and tired The sound insulation could be a bit better but other than that a lovely comfortable place and I d definitely stay there again , The location of the hotel is perfect right on the outskirts of the city but far enough away from the hussle and bussle to get a good nights sleep The staff were very friendly and helpful 
369096,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was construction at the front entrance If we new in advance of this we would not have booked here Booking com messed up , The room was comfortable 
369097,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I realise that everyone is different and someone else could find a fault with the hotel if they looked hard enough but we couldn t find anything to complain about and that wasn t to our liking I can only say that you would have to be very picky and hard to please if you don t like this hotel , The staff were super friendly and always dealt with us and every guest with courtesy and patience They switched from Dutch to English and other languages with perfect ease and without missing a beat Hats off to the cleaning staff who managed our room so well Champagne for breakfast too what a treat We could enjoy the wonderful art deco dining room whilst looking out onto Leidersplein and watching the world go by The location is perfect a few minute s walk from the tram stop public transport is fantastic and cheap in Amsterdam and right next to a canal stop We caught the airport shuttle bus fabulous value at 5 euros each and the stop is less than 5 minute s walk away from the hotel you can see the American Hotel just on the other side of the canal as you get off The hotel even gets a mention on the tour buses and boats as they go by because of it s history and significance Wifi is fast free and reliable and there are two PC s and a printer for public use We could not fault our choice of hotel for our stay which was based on Booking com s members reviews so one again we experienced the value of starting any hotel destination research here on booking com 
369098,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The floors in the rooms were very creaky and noisy when walking , The location was great Tram and canal boats were very close Staff was outstanding Very friendly knowledgeable and helpful 
369099,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, house keeping continuously misses replenishing water bottles the coffee tea bar in the room and even the soap box in the bathroom The construction happening around the hotel was bothersome but that was beyond the hotel s control , the location the breakfast buffet was quite good
369100,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, A hotel stuck in the 1970 s nothing has happened since then Very poor wi fi connection My room 117 at 230 night was a drab brown awful room raking of old cigarette smell Bathroom like a 3 star small city hotel somewhere in East Europe The hotel was filled with tracksuit flip flop hoards of people from Arab countries mixed with busloads of retired people totally lost looking for their luggage Breakfast average but you could have meatballs and greasy potatis if you like how would traveling in business , Nothing to like except the location 
369101,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Couldn t get the temperature of the room right Although the bathroom was extra clean the bath had a few bits in and could have done with another going over, The balcony outside was a pleasant surprise The Sauna is open until ten which is good for a hotel
369102,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Wifi was very slow the room was large but very narrow so quite awkward It was also an internal room looking out onto a central utility space so not attractive The restaurant service was terrible I was seated and in 40 minutes was not served so I left , Location was great room comfortable and clean
369103,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The shower tub in room 315 was challenging to use and dangerous unless one is an acrobat My friends unit was not the same and was easy to use 410 Lighting is minimal so the room at night tended to be dark , The bed and pillows were great The tub shower was very difficult to use Specific to my room the air was musty smelling but I used the A C periodically to freshen the air I loved the big windows and balcony 
369104,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We hate it when hotels joins two beds together and call it a Queen sized bed It s not it s a twin And for the money this hotel costs we would have expected to get what we asked for , Superb location right next to leidseplein close to the park museums etc The staff was super nice and helpful Wifi included and working fine
369105,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The very loud noise of pneumatic drill street pavement renovation works around the theatre in the roadway immediately below the bedroom window The room overlooked these messy noisy street works and the view was unpleasant The beds had memory foam mattresses which we found uncomfortable The bathroom was small and dated Overpriced accommodation , The excellent breakfast was served in Cafe American which was a beautiful Art Deco room The location was very convenient for public transport and right beside the canal for boat trips Was within walking distance of theatre major museums and parks Staff were pleasant and helpful 
369106,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The Hampshire Hotel was absolutely perfectly located and the room was amazing It was spacious enough that we were comfortable relaxing in the room the bathroom was clean and beautiful and the beds were great I would definitely stay there on my next trip to Amsterdam 
369107,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Two tiny things marred our stay this time We were given a room with a balcony that was blocked off on all sides basically like an open shed We walked in and out of that claustrophobic room and they offered to change it to a great one albeit the next day as the hotel was pretty booked This one is a recurring issue with the Americain The shower flow is abysmal Given that its an old heritage property one does make some concessions to modern plumbing but wiping yourself down with fluffy white towels after a narrow drip shower flow does ruin the luxurious feel of an otherwise great stay , This hotel is a special to us so everytime we go to Amsterdam we stay at the Americain It still has its old world charm the great hospitality and luxurious bed with float in the cloud pillows It has a fantastic location being in the centre of everything but also with multiple tram and bus connections from where you can get to almost all parts of the off the beaten track Amsterdam We are not exactly tourists in Amsterdam anymore so when we ask for restaurant recommendations and reservations we get the quintessential Amsterdam tiny restaurants which are hidden secrets and superb Mathilda was a lovely lady at the Reception this time and she had great insights on fantastic places to eat 
369108,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No complaints, Wonderful location beautiful art d cor breakfast smoked fish delicious bread the best coffee in Amsterdam dinner before Concertebeow spelling was superb the staff gracious fun on the last day the fountain came on magical

369110,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We got an really awful room when we arrived at the hotel it felt like it was in the cellar the room was below ground level The windows was facing a very small and dark courtyard which made the room very dark and it was also very cold in the room When we wanted to change room we were asked to pay 30 euro extra per night for the upgrade even though the description of the room on booking com said that all rooms of this type should have views of the canal or the square , The location of the hotel 
369111,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We had an internal room which was very dark it was hard to see even with all lights on We were working virtually in the dark to make tea and coffee and the window to our room was very small It gave the wrong impression because it was really a pleasant room just so gloomy , The room was a good size the staff very helpful concierge very knowledgeable The hotel is so central very good location Lovely and clean 
369112,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No parking parking close by but very expensive The rooms were a reasonable size but were very poorly lit We stayed in room number 7 which had limited natural light but the lighting within the room from lamps was very poor , Staff were excellent Good bar on site of the hotel Location was very good too very close to restaurants bars and shopping 
369113,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The location was absolutely perfect So close to museum district Easy to walk to Heineken Experience and plenty of shopping and big variety of restaurants very close Room was fairly small but was comfortable and had everything I needed including nice bathroom amenities All of the staff was kind and helpful Would definitely stay here again

369116,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Rooms and furnishing are old and not modern bathroom aswell Radiators are making strange sounds so I could not sleep at night They billed us A LOT of drinks and stuff from the minibar that we did not drink or eat Standards do not match the price we paid , Located very good close to everything Nice bar and restaurant Bus to Shipol stops right next to the hotel 
369117,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Shame they had to turn the fountain off because of Kings day though I could appreciate why It looked so pretty at night , The bed was excellent comfortable room Reception staff were really helpful when we had to change our flight home due to family illness Could not have done more for us 
369118,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing, The staff were extremely helpful when we had an issue over transport on King s day We were not bothered and left to explore the beautiful city of Amsterdam knowing that if we required help it was there at our hotel The room was lovely beautifully decorated and always cleaned promptly An excellent hotel

369121,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I was disappointed to find that the fountains in front of the hotel were been refurbished In previous visits to Amsterdam I remember them being quite impressive , My granddaughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night visit in March 2017 The location for us is superb in that it is quite close to the dining and public transportation amenities of the Leidseplein neighborhood We found this elegant hotel not only delightful but quite comfortable as well The staff were uniformly efficient knowledgeable and friendly We look to forward to staying here again 
369122,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The view of the courtyard wasn t great but in the hotel s defence not every room can have a magnificent view of the canals Be sure to ask for a view when you book , Beautiful rooms extremely comfortable beds and you even have the option to ask for a specific type of pillow The reception staff as well as the concierge were extremely helpful and friendly Overall a lovely hotel that deserves a stay whenever in Amsterdam 
369123,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, A bit pricey but all accommodations in Amsterdam are on the higher side , Great access to everything The concierge David was so very helpful with many things i was traveling with a teenager and he was very thoughtful about suggestions for her as well All staff were wonderful 
369124,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing really If I absolutely had to mention something here I would say that table service at breakfast and in the restaurant could be a bit faster and more efficient but staff were friendly and professional so no major complaints there at all , Great location close to everything public transport shops museums bars restaurants cinemas theatre concert venues park etc good service great restaurant comfortable rooms There were roadworks in front of the hotel during the weekend I stayed there and the hotel management and staff dealt with the issue in what I thought was a very professional and classy way I look forward to going back there very soon 
369125,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I went to the other Hampshire hotel first then I found out that there is another one so I went to the other location and I spent more than 2 hours in the same location looking for it and no one knows where is it cause its called the american hotel and not Hampshire When I finally found out that I was standing next to the hotel for 2 hours and got in and asked the stuff why u dont have a sign with it they said that they recently changed it thats why no one knows and also that s why the still have the old name American hotel I wasted like 5 hours to get to the hotel since the driver knows only one Hampshire hotel and doesnt know that there is another one and also no one knows the other one even by following the gps , The stuff was really nice and helpful the location is wonderful 
369126,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Slightly slow internet and some rooms looking at the tram are a little bit noisy but still a great great place to be , Very good location and Very friendly staff Rooms are also fairly larger than other hotels in Amsterdam I m definitely booking again when i am back Breakfast was also very nice with a wide variety Highly recommended 
369127,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Food and drink was very expensive Wifi was slow at times , We were given a free upgrade the bed and the balcony was amazing and comfy That extra touch made our whole stay better 
369128,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Expensive breakfast a lack of different cheeses in the land of cheese and not that exiting breakfast compared to the price We have afsked for a room to the street just one out of two rooms however we had two rooms with windows to a closed alley, Friendly and helpfull staff
369129,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Upon arrival we were told that our room was going to be beside road works but we would be offered a free meal as a token We opted to go for the 3 course dinner and this was also offered to our friends who were staying in another room The road works did not cause us too much disturbance and we were grateful for the meal but we felt we should have been informed of this before our arrival Although the food was delicious while we were eating we noticed a mouse in the dining area This wasn t an issue for three of us but one girl did need to leave the table and could not finish her meal , The beds were very comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel was well situated and within walking distance of the main city attractions which suited us as we were interested in seeing the sights around Amsterdam There was no problem leaving our bags in the hotel after check out time The food was beautiful and there is a very relaxed atmosphere in the hotel 
369130,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, the room was quite noisy because of the building work outside but we received a complementary breakfast and sandwich lunch in recognition of this which I thought was excellent service at breakfast I would prefer being able to pour my own coffee rather than wait for waiting staff I need more than one cup , the room and twin beds for me and my daughter 11 visiting to see the Anne Frank house were excellent as were the staff at reception 
369131,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room 103 was terrible There is very noisy pipe and every time someone use toalet you hear it I had to sleep with ear plugs but despite of it woke me up many times , Helpful staff

369134,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It is a tired hotel which was expensive compared to others we have stayed in very dark quite depressing interiors with terrible bedroom lighting and not many pictures etc to make a very large room comfortable My daughters bedroom was so small she could barely put her suitcase anywhere we didnt feel that we wanted to hang around there so spent as little time as possible which is a shame because it was expensive, the position in Amsterdam is excellent
369135,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Very nice and cosy hotel which is situated next to the main attractions Breakfast was awesome very tasty croissants great selection of food perfect coffee and very attentive staff Delux room was very quiet and clean Many thanks to the staff all of them were very polite and helpful 
369136,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Small room with small bathroom with a brick wall as a view , Nothing was mentioned by your company about renovations going on at the hotel so in order to accommodate my request for a quiet room we were in room 514 with a view of a brick wall and also opposite the room was the maids store 197 euros seemed pretty steep for this However the staff at this hotel are delightful Polite friendly and caring It s a nice hotel in a great location despite all the obvious building work around it 
369137,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Restaurant dinner service is very poor Waited one hour for an order while 90 percent of restaurant was empty Staff indifferent and sloppy Hotel room doors need oiling and new closing mechanisms Very noisy and annoying , Reception and bar staff were excellent
369138,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Only a minor negative We didn t have a mirror in the bedroom only the bathroom The hairdryer was fixed in the bathroom but it was tricky if you wanted to use straighteners with no mirror There is some work going on outside improvement to the walkways and roads it wasn t too much of a problem we weren t affected by any noise but some pathways were temporarily closed It will look lovely when completed , Fantastic location to explore all parts of the city with a canal just to the front Really easy to get to from the airport 5 euros each on a 197 bus which takes you to about 75 metres from the door The staff were outstanding from the moment we arrived we had a very friendly and helpful welcome easy check in and the concierge was extremely helpful with ideas of things to do We d forgotten travel plugs and we were able to borrow a couple free of charge at reception The computers weren t working in the business centre so they let us check in our flights and print boarding passes at reception Just nothing seemed too much trouble We had good WiFi connection and plenty of sockets to charge phones etc I d definitely stay again

369140,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The room was very spacious and the bed was so comfortable Our terrace was always amazing to sit outside and enjoy the sunny weather What really set this hotel apart was the concierge really so kind and would always go above and beyond 
369141,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It is expensive not a good value for money The rooms are quite small and old Bathrooms need to be reshaped they are quite old not compatible with the hotel price and stars Their are double glassing but we could hear some level of noise from the street , Extremely well located Personal was wonderful The hotel is in a beautiful and charming old building 
369142,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing, The location off the hotel was excellent close to all we needed if not just jump on a tram Staff are very helpful wish were there for longer
369143,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a lot of construction around the hotel so looked very messy The bath was a strange shape very narrow near the taps No toilet brushes in the bathroom The check in time was quite late 3pm The breakfast was expensive so we didn t eat there No USB plugs so we had 1 adapter which made it hard to charge multiple gadgets , The beds were very comfy and the room was nice and had a good view Location is good near lots of bars restaurants bike shop vondel park tram stop Staff at hotel were very friendly and helpful 
369144,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Currently a lot of construction work at the front of the hotel so we were pleased to have a room on the top floor overlooking the canal , Lovely period hotel with Art Deco restaurant Large room with separate sitting area Close to opera house and Gewandhaus also museums Excellent fish restaurant nearby
369145,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Was quite expensive with no breakfast, Lovely hotel we were given a welcome drink nice warm cosy room Great room and facilities kettle iron really great
369146,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I was horrified to learn that I had pay over 60 euro city task which was not made clear on my booking I also had to pay a sum of 150 euro deposit on checking into hotel together with the full amount of my stay It would have worked out cheaper for us to pay a little bit more to stay around the DAM square area in the long run Also there are building works at the hotel that we weren t informed of , The staff were lovely in the hotel and it was very clean The location was fine if you wanted to stay near Leidesplein but it cost approximately 7 euro per day per person to travel up to DAM square as there is a flat fee for the trams per person 
369147,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, the only thing I didn t like was the bed it was uncomfortable , the cleanliness and location of the hotel nothing a bother for the staff either great Hotel 
369148,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, 2 single beds instead of a double bed 3 single beds actually Very little natural light in the room No extractor fan in the bathroom First morning cleaners knocked on door at 8am , Location was excellent lots of bars cafes restaurants nearby and also very close to lotf of the museums and sights Staff were friendly 
369149,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was somewhat smallish and awkward the lights in the room were so dim it always felt dark There were no outlets near the mirrors and no proper lights near the mirror in the room The bathtub did not look very clean The single beds were exceptionally narrow The hotel itself except for the dining hall looked somewhat tired , The staff was nice and ready to help with anything we needed The breakfast was varied and of good quality the coffee was good too proper clean machine Amazingly beautiful art deco dining room 
369150,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Building work made getting in and out of the surrounding area a little bit awkward No breakfast included for the price , We were upgraded to a bigger room with a little alcove overlooking the canal which was really nice The room itself was very spacious and comfortable I loved having a Nespresso machine in the room with loads of choice of hot chocolate coffees tea etc and even though the fridge was an automatic minibar I m not a fan they still had a little section to put your own food drinks which was a nice touch Also good for storing gouda if you re bringing it back as a souvenir The location was great close to the museums and not too far from everything going on in the centre There was even a choice of different kinds of pillows 
369151,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The stuff was friendly but somehow did not know their business They tried to charge us 2 3 times for the same things which we paid already and had very poor cooperation between each other Restaurant service very poor The size of the room completely different from what is shown on the web while booking it And they mixed up our reservations , Good location
369152,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We had a noisy guest in the next room making loud phone calls in the early hours of the morning the first night which led to a terrible night s sleep While it s not the hotel s fault if they have inconsiderate guests we did feel the walls between rooms were very thin in the room it was separated from he next room by a locked door and it sounded like the neighbour was pretty almost in the same room and we could hear every word spoken Staff were helpful when we asked to move to another room however and subsequent nights sleep were fine , Helpful staff good location between busy and quieter areas great rooms impressive building issue with room move request was solved quickly and without fuss 
369153,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only thing we would have liked is the cocktail bar to open earlier , The room fantastic huge bed large bath loads of room to relax The cocktail bar also fantastic Sara and the team really know how to serve customers The bar itself is an oasis for the entertainment industry the walls are covered with photos of historic band members The restaurant is just a special place to enjoy a meal the decor is pleasure to be around Having needed to conduct business the business lounge is really special a real joy unlike any hotel we have worked out of in Europe The hotels taxi 
369154,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bed a bit soft compared to home Pillows square shape so tricky to keep in one place, Great for tram stop museums restaurants and canal trips Room temp perfect and windows open for fresh air
369155,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Comfortable well sized rooms especially the rooms with a canal side balcony and friendly staff And a great cocktail bar downstairs You will have to go a long way to get a better vodka martini 
369156,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The restaurant was closed from 8 pm because it was being used to televise election programme However there are many good restaurants in the surrounding area, The staff were excellent The location was excellent A very comfortable hotel 
369157,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, This my second trip to Hampshire hotel I should say the staff is number one in my rating and at this trip I would rate the reception desk as A and I would recommend the person who gives me my room to the award of excellency but unfortunately I forgot his name 
369158,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a mouse in the bar , I liked everything room was lovely view was brilliant Lovely birthday surprise too from the hotel The place was spotless too 
369159,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast was very expensive in the hotel 50 for a cooked breakfast for 2 adults I wasn t willing to pay that so we went elsewhere in the morning No fridge facility apart from the minibar which has censors in it so you couldn t put your own bottled water in there, The location is excellent and the staff are very friendly and helpful Lovely views of the city Very close to the museum quarter and canal tours available right outside the main entrance 
369160,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Soulless reception area very bland Dreadful polyester duvet cheap Scratchy sheets and pillows like stones Not possible to sleep with them Whole bed situation too uncomfortable to sleep , Lovely staff especially David the concierge There was a little board in reception of recommendations of where to go from past guests Nice touch 
369161,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, a little street noise however offset by great location , great location clean and comfortable staff was very nice canal boat trips just across the street 
369162,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room a bit small but we can live with that as everthing else was brilliant , Excellent location Fantastic hotel Excellent reception and consierge help The bed was so comfortable Staff couldn t be more helpful 
369163,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Partner believes the hairdriers could be a more modern design Didn t realise until checkout that the room daily rate is variable Knowing this stays could arranged to take advantage of the less expensive days , The Art Deco surroundings and stained glass were amazing plus the hotel has a tremendous and interesting history I would recommend this hotel to everyone Overall a visit to remember made even better by the hotel and staff we intend to visit the hotel again 
369164,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Housekeeping was not good The restaurant for evening could do better at making single travelers feel less singled out I don t want to be seated in the middle of the room or to the side when there is clearly an empty table by the window they did clean off the table but then I was not provided a wine list as the tables with couples were etc etc clearly they didn t feel I should have the same service as a couple does Too bad because I think more and more people will travel alone, Breakfast bar was awesome Concierge was terrific Good recommendations for restaurants and best way to get to 
369165,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, In the sixties I was living in Laren and then blaricum with a pop group called caz and recording in Hilversum for Philips and most days we would go to the American hotel for coffee it was a brilliant hotel then and even better now it was a absolute joy to stay there will definately be going back, The hotel and room was brilliant and the bed really comfortable and staff every one so friendly
369166,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It s a shame the Cafe bar didn t open until 5pm in the evening , The jazz brunch on Sunday 1st Sunday of each month was lovely but service very slow Reception staff were very helpful and polite Check in and out was very quick and easy 
369167,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bed was really uncomfortable If someone sat down on one side of the bed the other side of the mattress would come up off the base It was like sleeping on a water bed really wobbly and every time one of us moved it shook the other person , The staff were really friendly and helpful Really loved the balcony on the room 
369168,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Road works that look like they are going on for months outside that started at 5am Hotel should have informed us as even with the window shut it still woke you up , Very central to things
369169,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Difficult to sleep at night due to the noise from outside Such a shame as well because the beds we re ridiculously comfy and is the only fault about this hotel , Great location In Amsterdam Gorgeous Hotel Trendy Bar Near the Tram Attentive friendly staff Comfy bed enjoyable stay at a modern hotel 
369170,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The view was a bit disappointing we had a view to a building but it s not a big deal, Excellent location everything is in walking distance public transportation is very near And the bed was awesome 
369171,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Don t be fooled by the nice pictures we booked a classic double we got put into a family room which was really dark and old fashioned nothing like the pictures we asked to be upgraded 50 extra per night and still the room looked nothing like the pictures Both rooms we stayed in where dark with only lamps as lights one small radiator infront of the window which meant the room was cold , The beds where comfy good coffee machine nice location easy to access all areas 
369172,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was nothing we didn t like maybe a swimming pool would be good , The hotel was in a great location the room staff and food were all amazing I would recommend this hotel 
369173,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bed wasn t that comfy booked a double room with double bed and we got 2 single beds very irritating A lot of noise come through the windows but didn t really bother us that much because we had been drinking most nights Bed cover was stained Rooms were a little dark I think you pay for the location more than the actual hotel room itself as it s slightly overpriced , Ok size room lots of bars clubs restaurants 2 min walk from hotel 
369174,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Cleanliness and overall condition of the accommodation especially conspicuous in the bathroom where there were plenty of spots with dust and smudges Housekeeping staff seem to be focused more on speed than thoroughness In addition the creaky uneven floors and scuffed walls could use modernizing refurbishing We could hear the creaking on our ceiling from the guests above us If the rooms and corridors were updated and brightened this would be a superb hotel The building itself along with the Lobby restaurant bar is simply beautiful , The Staff were lovely especially upon check out They were all pleasant and created a high class atmosphere The location is among the best in town and the building is gorgeous and quite imposing especially after dark With some improvements this could easily be one of the finest hotels in the city 
369175,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The staff were more than helpful very friendly and always willing to to answer any questions Location was great There was building work outside but was not disturbed at all
369176,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, They were going to take more deposit than was advertised They told us our room would be ready in an hour and then told us to come back 5 hours later after we were waiting Staff were not very helpful and our room had a small terrace which was attached to a fire escape there was a man possibly security guy that kept coming out and looking into our bedroom it was quite offensive intrusive creepy and scary which made me not even sleep properly , Location
369177,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Cons Old dark rooms with extremely worn carpets Small rooms I d definitely recommend looking elsewhere if you can t confirm your room has a window out onto the street or canal Ours was looking into this tiny courtyard area which besides limiting privacy since other rooms were across the way provided zero natural light As a result our small room was constantly dark and uncomfortable , Pros Fantastic location Easy to get to and from the airport via the Airport Express Bus which stops about half a block away Reliable wi fi Very attractive cafe
369178,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bed was a bit too soft for our likeness and we missed proper light the ones we had in our room didnt provide enough light Apart from that everything was beautiful, Staff very pleasant and helpful very good location
369179,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Great location in Leidesplien within the main areas of Amsterdam and walkable to the museum areas Helpful staff made our stay very good and we upgraded to a room balcony with a balcony which was fun

369185,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The lighting in our room was terrible It was very difficult to read as the lights were so dim , The location is excellent very close to the Rijksmuseum and Concertgenouw on several tram lines and near the bus stop for Schiphol 
369186,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Think we were possibly in the borrowers bedroom tiny space not great for a tall couple Foul drain smell when using hot water tap in bathroom sink Breakfast 19 50 per person This trip was a gift so wouldn t normally of paid the fortune we did for the borrowers bedroom wouldn t pay that much again , Staff lovely hotel itself beautiful easy to get to places and hotel bar very nice
369187,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, V dark around wardrobe safe coffee making area Rest of room could have done with at least one good light Mini bar did not open No mirrors in room Dated drawers dressing table or desk unsuitable for both because of lighting and mirror issues This all sounds negative but I would stay here again and a few minor tweaks would improve ratings greatly, excellent staff throughout hotel
369188,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was ok but didn t meet the expectations of the pictures shown on booking com Some of the staff at breakfast wasn t friendly We waited a long time to order some coffee and when I called a waiter to make our order he didn t even say anything I wasn t even sure if he heard us The coffee arrived a few minutes later though Breakfast was supposed to be until 10 30 but at 9 45 most of the bakery wasn t available anymore and at 10 25 they started taking the food away already The following days we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel anymore , Friendly staff in general The breakfast room looked nice and the choice was quite diverse A bit too expensive though 
369189,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Lovely Art Deco property with original fittings Our room looked onto a semi frozen Singelgeracht Has the Cafe Theatre and the iconic Cafe Americain onsite and situated on the Leidsplein so near to the museums and the famous brown bars 
369190,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Expensive for what was on offer Small room freezing cold draught under the balcony door cheap type duvet For a hotel of this price the tea and coffee provided as well as the toiletries were minimal , The staff were very pleasant and helpful
369191,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It says on Booking that it has a car park It doesn t Parked in local car park Cost me 70 to park for one night Ended up an expensive trip after all , Nice room bit small Comfy bed Good location 
369192,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hampshire do invest in this exceptional hotel and the great people working there Reception desk computers are 20 years old so called business table is not working Printing of boarding passes an ordeal Breakfast is overpriced to an extreme 4 people family should set 100 euro aside for buffet Furniture is getting shabby Been using the hotel for the last 15 years but saw no change or upgrade I understand cost cutting but this is pennywise foolish , Great staff special compliments for David the concierge Amazing location 
369193,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very creaky floors quite dark very little late room service selection especially for a 4 star hotel normal rooms are quite small , The front desk was quite helpful when we wanted to change rooms and even offered a discounted upgrade Location is excellent 
369194,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a case while I was out on my meeting in Hague they asked my wife and Daughter to leave the rooms on 25th January and they didn t accept any explanation or discussion even I had extended my stay up 27th until they realized later they were making a mistake and let them go back to the room this case was reported to duty manger in the evening but it seems nobody cares in addtion rooms are too small not as expected wooden floor were very noisy they need to renew , the location and resturant
369195,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast could have more variety , The hotel is ideal for daily trips to the different cultural museums etc as its at a square where a lot of trams converge making it very easy to tram hop The hotel rooms are very comfortable 
369196,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hotel lovely but pillows uncomfortable Our room was next to lift shaft so first night sleep was disrupted and poor However the staff very helpful and we were moved to another area of hotel for remainder , Hotel in perfect location Easily accessible to all quarters Staff excellent 
369197,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The noise of other people walking around was unbelievable We heard EVERY step above us and next door due to the creaking floorboards seriously difficult getting to sleep They should really look into noise control as guests will be suffering on each floor as people can t help moving around They also charge 4 50 euros for a small bottle of water Annoying as we had to keep going out to get bottled water to avoid paying crazy prices For the price I would have expected small sachets of milk in the room not powdered creamer and toilet roll that wasn t like sand paper Staff were lovely and hotel comfortable perfect location They just need to look at there floorboards ,No Positive

369200,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing , Brought my hubby here for this birthday as it s somewhere we always wanted to visit Location was amazing with everything within walking distance Lovely staff and lovely facilities 
369201,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very cold room on arrival But don t worry the heating is effective , Prof friendly easy going staff Wonderful room Recieved an unexpected upgrade Thanks for your hosptality 
369202,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Low water pressure in the shower squeaky floors The sauna at the basement was quite depressing really , Great location although there were some construction going on near by Great breakfast although quite expensive Very comfortable bed 
369203,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Had a hotel staff follow me and question me like I was not suppose to be there Almost was yelling with him as he didn t believe I was staying there till I pulled out my key Is this how they treat all their guests ,No Positive
369204,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our room was big and nice but could not be heated properly There are radiators but they are hidden behind the curtains and the air conditioning unit does not help I wonder if it is not making it worse Bath tub and glazed swing shower separation are very bad choices one cannot stand at the shower end of the tub since it significant narrows down and there is not enough space to put two feet proper We wanted to have a quick dinner at the restaurant and cannot think of any slower service in a huge room with just a few customers Steak on a bed of mixed cold vegetables is a patently bad idea I had the best looking but coldest steak ever I assume my steak was ready early on and waited for the risotto of my partner I believe I had high expectations including a period defining elaborate decor but I was in a plain er space than anticipated The restaurant showed some sign of the design of the building but the rest was only on the exterior , Very convenient location The Leidseplein stop is being refurbished and cannot used for the AMS Central direction however still the Prinzegracht station is a minute walk away We were given a redecorated room that was spacious with a real big bathroom Always feared that I would be given one of the old rooms if I ever stayed there Luckily that did not happen very happy for it 
369205,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bed wasn t comfortable interior decoration is so old dirty carpets dirty shower, The location the historical building and architecture wifi
369206,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The website says 50 Euro deposit however it was 100 euros on arrival which was disappointing, Beautiful room with lots of space ideal loacation for travelling around with lots of restaurants and bars and easy to get to team stops 
369207,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was a bit tight specially the area where the bed is I m a small statured person but I am thinking for big statured people they might find it small and layout a bit cramped , Our room is quite small but the bathroom was big so that s good and the interiors are up to date Wi fi is fast And though the room is small somehow they were able to lay it out well and put in everything essential and even have good cabinet facilities Location was superb Shopping eating and sites to see are all walking distance 
369208,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing, Great location staff were very helpful Rooms was so clean and the bed was extra comfy Will definitely be returning get and would highly recommend the bloody Mary s in the hotel bar 
369209,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, These was nothing to fault really If i really had to pick just the bath was a bit out of date that was it otherwise very good , The beds where so comfy really good beds Room was very clean Staff where so friendly always helpful Just 10 out of 10
369210,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We woke up without electricity one morning but found out the entire city was in the dark Not the hotel s fault When the power was restored part of our room was still without power Once we notified the front desk they quickly checked into the problem and had someone correct the issue , The staff was awesome We couldn t have had a better location Getting to and from the airport and the Centraal Station was very easy by taxi We chose to travel by taxi since we had large bags that may have been difficult to lug around on other means of public transportation The restaurant food was wonderful The waitress in the American Bar laughed with us and brought us water with ice without us having to ask It was a real treat I would definitely stay there again 
369211,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not much I think it could provide more interesting bar snacks for those evenings when you don t want a full restaurant style meal This would suit solo business travellers for example , This is a quality hotel with interesting architecture and considerable charm
369212,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not a lot of clothing storage space Room was a little dark and not great mirrors to get ready with, Great location and area nothing more than a 30 minute walk Canal stop outside the hotel Comfortable bed Very dark great blackout curtains 
369213,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Big gripe at this visit was the check out process It took over 25 minutes waiting I travel to this hotel a lot so this is not a one off The computer admin system came out of the ark so despite the best efforts of the very friendly reception staff to pacify a long line of grumpy travellers you are still going to have to wait a long time Allegedly some of the rooms have been refurbished but I have never been given one and the old rooms tired and are very dark poorly lit , Fantastic location with relatively good sized rooms Restaurant has a beautiful dinning room though not matched by the food 
369214,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We orderd two rooms the in the same price but we got one very small room and one large room whit balcony and a lot of space The cleaning staff throw a bag with some of the things that we got but they just didnt do anything about that after we told them The valu of the bag was neer 100 euro , Very nice viwe Great location nice big bath 
369215,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Poor staff at reception and restaurant Poor decoration Old noisy room and old bathroom , Beautifull building at the outside Great location It was clean 
369216,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The hotel has lost its former grandeur and is showing signs of age Barely room to breathe much less move in the Bathroom Concierge staff tend to be somewhat haughty This was my second stay at this hotel which sadly still ihas a discriminating practice of allocating solo travellers the smallest rooms regard less of the size type of room they have already prepaid This time I stood my ground and insisted on another room , Excellent location reception check in staff friendly and willing to assist Room comfortable enough
369217,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The bed was lovely and comfortable All the staff were approachable and friendly It was my partners birthday and the hotel gave us two complimentary glasses of Prosecco We were allowed to keep our luggage with the hotel when we had to check out as we had an evening flight to catch so we could continue to explore Amsterdam without having to take our luggage about with us and this was free of charge 
369218,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The restaurant cafe Americain We were unlucky with our meals did not like the prawns on ice as a starter warm underbaked halfraw prawns in their baking oily skin on a pile of ice resulted in a lukewarm watery mix of undistinct brown colour no fingerbowl The restaurant is pricy and we had been looking forward to a good dinner in a great historic place Disappointing , Hotel is great at superb location Room very comfortable beds lovely clean and soft bathroom clean Very helpful and friendly staff both at the reception and in the restaurant Value for money 
369219,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The bed was huge and really comfortable and the hotel is in a convenient location near tramlines buses and caf s restaurants and bars Staff are really friendly 
369220,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I have stayed in this hotel twice and this room was nicer but faced the street The street noise was very loud It was a Friday night and I could hear loud music and happy bar goers into the wee hours of the morning My girls however slept soundly through it all , The location of the hotel is perfect for walking to many restaurants sights and shopping in Amsterdam The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable The staff is very helpful and friendly 
369221,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The receptionist who were checking us in told us there is no booking under our name and he didn t bother to check the booking com id number as even if the name spelling or any other thing usually its identified by the booking id as any other hotel He mentioned your booking has been canceled though we booked 4 months back and just received a welcoming email from booking com for the hotel confirmation and our visit to Amsterdam the process took us more than 30 minutes just as he kept trying with different names to search his records though we asked to search with the id anyway the stay was great though Everything else and all other staff were very friendly helpful and quick , I like the hotel as a heritage piece of art the rooms are spacious beds are comfortable and location is just perfect 
369222,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The way we were treated I can t believe how rude the staff were It spoilt the holiday Oyr booking was lost so were put in the only room left in the hotel which took them over an hour which wrote of first night and spoilt new years Eve I booked the hotel non refundable in October for a double standard room I kept all the emails and reservations When they finally found us a room it was a twin when we had booked a double the receptionist then proceeded to argue with us that it was the same room Only when they looked and the reservation on my phone stating double did they change their minds however for that night they had non available we were offered free breakfast as compensation the next morning that was it we booked this in October for a 4 star hotel I felt it was shocking service the staff were rude I ve had far more enjoyable experiences in a hostel We were moved the following day however that morning we had to return pack all our luggage to move rooms Totally disappointed with the treatment I received at this hotel , The location great view from the balcony 
369223,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The hotel was in simply the best location for visiting Amsterdam and the staff was excellent and accommodating The restaurant where there is an elegant FEAST of a breakfast buffet 19 Euros includes unlimited mimosas is one of the grandest rooms in Amsterdam You feel like you re in a Russian novel but all of this is for the price of a budget hotel Honestly one of my favorite places that I ve ever stayed in Europe 
369224,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The hotel rooms are old with very creaky floors could not get a comfortable sleep rooms are not noise insulated , The location is excellent and staff is courteous
369225,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Had internal courtyard room which was lacking in light quite depressing Fittings and furniture dated and in need of a refresh , Beautiful building in great location by Leidseplein easy to get to and to explore from 
369226,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Whats not to like , The Art Deco theme in the bedrooms and subtly evident throughout echoing the magnificent Cafe American The wonderful breakfasts the kind and hospitable staff and the best shower outside the USA The Cafe also provided a wonderful Christmas evening dinner and entertainment 
369227,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The elevator was way to slow The construction was a pain but overall it did not ruin my time , The staff was extremely helpful Made my experience great 
369228,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, bathroom was relatively small, Great location very convenient to trams museums boat trips and there are plenty of shops bars and restaurants nearby Lovely spacious room with a balcony incredibly comfortable bed Friendly and helpful staff
369229,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, City tax was not included in the overall price so we wer suprised to pay an extra hundred or so when we arrived our fault for not reading properly , The bed was amazing Great location and walking distance to everything
369230,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Staff weren t as friendly as we expected in American Resturant in particular, Very cozy room and bed great location super clean and have everything you may need
369231,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Everything was wonderful Would have liked a clock but that is my only suggestion , Friendly but not over the top staff Clean comfortable nicely designed room Great breakfast Loved the sea biscuits and the info given Stylish festive decorations topped off a fabulous Christmas stay 
369232,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Needs refurbishment paint missing and corners of walls battered by suitcases rooms a bit sparse dated and lacking facilities for example no milk , Location for transport was great great little bar and a great restaurant The square has a lot of bars and restaurants and lots of shops as you head off to the centre down the leidsestraat 
369233,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The cleaners managed to rob my underwear when changing the sheets I was too embarrassed to ask for them back No one owned up to this this is stupidity The pillows were way too big in England the pillows are smaller No spa no swimming pool interrupted during intimate moments , The hotel is aesthetically beautiful and the room had excellent facilities the staff were friendly and professional 
369234,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No milk or sugar available to make hot drinks maybe a few more tea bags and chocolate drinks The drinks bar did not allow moving things around to make space for our own items such as milk etc Restaurant prices were rather high compared to outside prices we ate out for the whole of our stay , Bedroom was excellent loved the large bed and choice of pillows extremely comfortable Free WiFi allowed us to use the internet for information on the various attractions and also to use WhatsApp to contact friends and family back home for free Lovely building both inside and out and would love to visit again in the summer when all the flowers are out Staff were excellent and we were able to leave our luggage in the hotel luggage room on our last day whilst we looked around the city 
369235,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was very warm even when the radiator was turned off Road tram works were annoying but our room was on the canal side and this helped , The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very well presented Location was out of the city centre but still had enough going on to be interesting Tram access and plenty shops close by as well as bars and restaurants 
369236,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, accommodation is poor place needs to be renovated breakfast was disappointing setup strange with half of stuff in different room and that restaurant is warn out and not 100 clean , location is great
369237,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was dark and the window overlooked a roof and another room thus we never saw the outside , The staff was amazing Very helpful cheerful and overall nice people 
369238,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Roadworks outside hotel were a slight nuisance but nothing the hotel could do the hotel done everything to keep noise to a minimum , Friendly and helpful staff always had a smile on their faces and were very happy to help any need we had Would visit again 100 
369239,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Restaurant service was so slow we had to cancel our drink as half an hour was not long enough to get a drink before our flight , Tha concierge was super helpful and he had a great sense of humour 
369240,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Characterful up scale art deco hotel in a decent part of town Extremely high standards throughout Stylish adjoining cafe restaurant No complaints whatsoever 
369241,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, One bus ride from the airport A walking distance to almost all the tourists attractions Lots of restaurants around Right in the middle of Amsterdam s night life and bars 
369242,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Arrived after travelling since 4am Was told I couldn t check in till 3pm Had to wander around Amsterdam exhausted Staff made no effort to arrange for the room to be made up quicker Loud noise from nearby nightclub or bar till late most nights the windows were vibrating with the sound Expensive Room service for a single meal was almost 40 euros , Good Location Clean Excellent transport links nearby Room was warm and had a balcony 
369243,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Only problem was that the room we were given didn t look like any of the pictures shown It must of been a room that hasn t been updated yet It was very dated, The bed was really comfy Rooms were big 
369244,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, the rooms with a canal view were an extra 30 euros a night we got a free upgrade for the last night of stay , liked everything great location staff very helpful very comfortable warm and such a beautiful building the canal boat even stops just outside the hotel not to far away from the train station either 
369245,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was large but decor was very dark deep browns etc which made the room appear dull dark uninviting , Location bright clean sparkling hotel reception very friendly staff and location 
369246,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There is nothing I don t like about this place , I have stayed here twice now for just one night each I have loved it both times the staff are extra attentive and friendly and I love the hotel The stained glass windows are perfect 
369247,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a lot of building work going on with the tram lines surrounding the hotel so it was loud The quality of the facilities don t really reflect the rather high price, Very comfortable room bed and good location
369248,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very tiny and tall bath you literally had to jump inside and out of it Our room was good size but still we were placed in the entresol mezzanine level and we had to hear noises at night of people going out the nearby clubs The whole plaza surrounding the hotel is under construction so there were trucks and noises during the day , The location is really good close to every must see attraction in the city A very nice building indeed and a comfortable bar 
369249,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The tram works outside the hotel spoiled the outlook of the hotel but I assume that will be a temporary disruption Getting to and from the hotel was an ordeal due to the tram works and cyclists and motor cyclists not sticking to cycle tracks or signalling where they want to go You had to have your wits about you crossing roads and cycle tracks , Room was quiet and comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly There was a good selection of breakfast food available in the beautiful historic Cafe American We paid 20 euros each per day for breakfast on top of the room rate Would suggest warm clothing for breakfast during winter months as the large cafe is draughty The hotel was near the canals and museum district 
369250,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not entirely clear at time of booking that we would be charged 5 city tax per room Each room charged a further 15 euros we hadn t budgeted for , Location wonderful 
369251,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The coffee in the otherwise excellent breakfast room was always lukewarm I like mine steaming hot And when I used the free laptop to check in online for the flight home I couldn t print my boarding card as the printer wasn t working Reporting it to the front desk took some time as there was only one person on duty and he was very busy However the problem was then very quickly resolved , The staff were superb really friendly and helpful The location is great an easy walk to the Rijksmuseum and there are lots of bars and resaturants with a wide variety of local and international cuisines around the Leidseplein One tip to get to the hotel we took the train from Schiphol Airport to Centraal Station and then a tram to Leidseplein It s much quicker and cheaper to take the 197 Airport Express bus to and from the airport as it stops pretty much opposite the hotel 
369252,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I think the bathroom is not big and I don t like the toilets Inside There were also works in the street late during the night because we heard noise until 1 00 am , I like the environment I really thank you for the room because we asked you to have a room with art deco design and you did your best because it was the case It was so lovely 
369253,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I didn t like the fact that I had to keep calling to get either a toothbrush or slippers etc these things should already be available in the room Elevators are tiny Room service menu doesn t have options of burgers or club sandwiches they offer lobster and steak and so on , I liked the location of the hotel I liked the view from the hotel 
369254,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The breakfast was lovely a great selection however a little pricey in my opinion , The room was a great size The bed was so comfy and we had a bath instead of just a shower 
369255,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I come here 3 4 times a year My last visit was a bit dissapointing I always ask for and get the same type of room This time they wanted to charge me 60 extra for the same type of room the deposit went up for no reason This was all very dissapointing especially because I come here often If this happens again I might have to find a different hotel ,No Positive
369256,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The toilets are lacking toilet brush They blame it on the hygiene but I find it odd not to be able to clean toilet after using it They need to reconsider this decision and bring them back since it is quite uncomfortable to leave the toilet dirty after using it when sharing a room with another person This was by far the most expensive and least attractive hotel throughout the whole trip in Netherlands we had for about 9 nights I cannot say it was poor fair nor just good It was between good and very good but not up to a standard of other hotels with same category we have visited there Of course the management can always use the benefit of having a hotel centrally located in such a strong destination as Amsterdam is , Superb location you are literary 10 15 minutes from all major sights in Amsterdam Room was good but there was a lack of space when you are staying for couple of days Although there were serious construction outside we got an inside room so we couldn t hear anything and were able to sleep as much as we want 
369257,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hairdryer very poor biscuits with coffee would be great construction noise but that will shortly be history Could there be less inter room noise , Breakfast the hotel style 
369258,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Lighting in room was very dim the hotel could not provide a brighter reading lamp room heating only just adequate would have liked a less expensive eating option than the restaurant , Staff were very plesant and helpful 10 out of 10 for reception ladies 
369259,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We first having been given a room practically blocked with a wall no light no air But when we warned the staff they were very accommodating and changed the room with a canal view with no extra charge , I had stayed at the hotel around 8 years ago so ours was a deliberate choice Even though the hotel got a little older in time the location was very center almost across the Rijksmuseum Lots of cafe and restaurants around Hotel s breakfast room was truly magnificent And the breakfast was really good too 
369260,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast too expensive 40 The d cor is in need of a renovation I know it s a historic hotel but the forniture needs a renovation , Good staff excellent location comfortable room 
369261,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, City was doing works around the hotel in late October 2016 which meant a hike to get to where trams were running Also no more poffertjes at buffet breakfast , Comfortable bed Convenient location near restaurants and five useful tram lines Surprisingly quiet Friendly staff If you book ahead breakfast buffet is reasonably priced 
369262,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was extra too small There was only a small sun window at roof and only possible to see the sky Room was not breezy , Great breakfast Very friendly stuff 
369263,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing that the hotel could resolve major construction out front on the new tracks, The staff was really gracious The concierge was quite helpful The bartenders at the bar were very friendly and funny Our dinner meal at the hotel was delicious and the breakfast buffet was very substantial scrambled eggs were unexpectedly soft and fluffy The location was also really nice Walking distance to the museums park even walked to the Jordann district Close to many bars restaurants and shops Architecture and decor was also unique 
369264,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Next time I would like a room with a view My only problem was lack of light both from window and lamps in order to read comfortably , Beds comfiest I ever slept in The staff were really pleasant to deal with and so professional at their job 
369265,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bathroom could do with a slight update, Brilliant location all staff were friendly polite and very helpful If we travel to Amsterdam again will 100 be returning 
369266,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The staff in the restaurant bar were very poor and l had to interrupt them talking to each other in order to be served There is also a lot of building work right outside the front of the hotel , The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the reception staff were helpful and polite 
369267,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The friendly staff always ready to assist the breakfast has a good selection save some money and book it on the night before the large rooms more than the 4 stars standard in Amsterdam and of course the location 
369268,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I stayed on the first floor Noisy neighbors with a loud crying baby kept me awake two nights as did the late night showering of an upstairs guest 1x at 2 am the next time at 6 am seems the water pipes go right past me inside the walls ,No Positive
369269,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The area around the Hotel is a huge construction area therefore it was extremely noisy at night Not mistake from Hotel anyway not very pleasent Bathroom had the best time ahead , Very friendly and helpful staff Nice Location for Sightseeing Everything in walk distance 
369270,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Lack of rooms with shower instead of bath and there was a lot of black in the room decor making the room rather dark Also all the construction work on the tram lines being carried outside the hotel making it very difficult to get around , Very comfortable bed Friendly staff
369271,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Big canal bridge rail construction project immediately in front of the hotel is very inconvenient Hard to cross the street it is muddy when it rains a bit noisy Small room , Beautiful hotel with history Written up in DK travel book as a sight Affordable luxury although the good price might be due to the construction Pretty close to the museums and near many restaurants 
369272,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bedroom was dark and very dated Breakfast was not included in our package but we did eat breakfast on the last morning which was really nothing special and at 20 per head it was not worth it , Staff were amazing could not be more friendly or helpful Location is central with lots of restaurants bars and cafes nearby and with the tram line just outside it is very easy to get around 
369273,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I was in room 429 the rooms above were very noisy and each morning it sounded like a removal group had arrived stomping banging scraping, The young staff member Timo reception who went out of his way to help me solve the problem created by booking com I wanted 5 days they gave me 2 he managed another night and organised accommodation at another hotel for the rest of my stay The staff member the cafe Carlos who made my morning breakfasts something to remember
369274,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast is very good but for the price of the room should be included , The location is the best The hotel is starting to get a little bit worn out but the price reflects it and for Amsterdam that s very highpriced for me it s still the best choice 
369275,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, As everywhere in Amsterdam breakfast was too expensive, Comfy bed lovely balcony overlooking the canal ideal location within a lively square friendly staff at the bar and restaurant in an iconic 20s style
369276,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast wasn t included so that would have made it perfect had it have been , Bed was soooo comfy the bar staff were very friendly The hotel was in a great location and looked amazing inside and out 
369277,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Smallest room I ever stayed in and decor in the room especially is stuck in the 70 80 s, Great location shame about the building work in the surrounding area
369278,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bad location Noisy hotel neighbours upstairs can be clearly heard Really needs an upgrade Looks old The whole area is in works so difficult to access Can get much nicer hotels at similar prices in Amsterdam, Nice people at reception
369279,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bed had a 4 topper on top of a foam mattress of some kind which was laid on top of a box spring The mattresses were not secure so they slid around a bit Also the bathroom fan ran all night long even when the light was off Right now there is major construction of a new tramline underway and the hotel is right next to the line Construction seems to happens 24x7 and it s difficult to get around the area , Staff was friendly and changed our room when the first one was unacceptable Avoid rooms on the mezzanine floor called endemol 
369280,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Didn t like 2 single beds pushed together Would have preferred a double bed , Location Friendly staff Lovely hotel Lovely room Canal just facing hotel 
369281,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not the hotel s fault at all but the area in front is a huge long term construction site They re replacing the tram line turning the square into pedestrian only The usual trams there are not in service Construction goes 24 hrs day I was on the top floor so the noise didn t bother me but it might be an issue for lower floor rooms especially that face the front , Great location near museums and theaters I walked everywhere I wanted to go Staff was genuinely helpful Bed was comfy Dining room gorgeous Breakfast buffet was fine eggs cooked to order available 
369282,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The major tram works were a major noise problem particularly when drilling and diggers continued throughout the night rendering sleep impossible Why was this not mentioned on your website nor by the Reception on our arrival at the hotel This was unacceptable , Everything It s a great location and a great hotel 
369283,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The road works They started in the daytime and went on until around 6am so all through the night They are going on in the square right outside the hotel and are incredibly loud Really annoyed we had paid for two nights as would have changed hotels The staff did move us to a quieter room for the second night but if you happen to be in one of the rooms with a window facing out then you will not sleep and for the money we paid around 200 a night it was a real let down , Friendly welcome from staff on arrival nice bar and in centre of town so close to the night life 
369284,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Please be aware that there is major road construction going on right outside the hotel No one warned me about this when I booked the room and it is a major nuisance One night they worked all the way through the night That s right LOUD road construction going in at 2 3 4 in the morning If you are looking for sleep I wouldn t take the chance with this hotel especially for what you are paying to stay here until the construction is finished , Nice hotel with good customer service Location is good easily walkable to museums and central Amsterdam Bed was comfortable 
369285,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The one downside to this place is the restaurant The menu is not extensive and massively over priced considering the poor service It needs to decide whether to be a high end restaurant or an American style diner As I believe the confusion around this really let s it down , The room itself was fantastic clean and modern nothing extravagant but perfect for the amount of time spent in the room and the bed was comfy Reception staff were friendly and helpful and the location of this place is perfect for shopping and museums 
369286,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There are quite extensive road works going on around the hotel this is not the hotels fault but it is noisy we were told they started work at 9am and finished at 11pm not a problem for us as we would be out however someone forgot to tell the workmen as they started at 6am a couple of times check with the hotel when they are planned to be completed we were offered 2 internal rooms but both were a bit too dark so the noise was the better option If you do choose a quiet internal room then ask for one of the recently refurbished ones they look much better , There was a wide range of choice for breakfast from cooked to continental and lots in between The location is great close enough to most attractions either by a short walk or by the several trams that stop nearby the 1 2 and 5 from central station stop withing metres of the hotel 2 euros 90 cents for a single trip The staff though are superb i had advice from two concierges the reception staff are very helpful as are the staff in the great little bar fantastic for having a drink and people watching in relaxed comfort This is a lovely hotel just a shame about the roadworks see the negative comments it is looking a little tired in parts but dont let that put you off it has character and great staff i prefer a firm bed these felt quite soft so i was surprised to find them really comfy and despite the efforts of the road workers outside i did sleep well 
369287,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room and bathroom were a bit small I think breakfast should have been included for the price , The location However there are major roadworks at the square outside the hotel which go on to 10 30pm and start early in the morning 
369288,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No information about major road works carried out in front of the hotel and under the windows loud works went on on Friday night until past 10 pm No reaction to a request sent when making a reservation concerning the floor and beds , Localisation perfect for exploring Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum Cleanness
369289,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The beds were uncomfortable because there seems to be a plastic mattress cover which then makes one perspire didn t have a good nights sleep on any of the nights, Breakfast excellent worth booking
369290,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There is street construction currently and it was causing a lot of noise which is something we should have been notified of prior to proceeding with our reservation, The location is really super
369291,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very overpriced poor service a bar that closed on a Saturday night at 11pm and directed to the cafe bar that had a thumping night club beat playing loudly Basic breakfast and slow service , A heritage property that is worth a visit to see the art deco interior Visit don t stay 
369292,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, there were two builders just out side of our window they were repairing some parts of roof during the day noise disturbed us a little bit , Staff is very welcoming Great location Very close lots of amenities and attractions 
369293,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, we only realised after we had checked out that there was a sauna facility , Bathroom was huge was lovely having a little balcony Location was spot on walk out the hotel and theres 2 canal boat companies with boats coming every few minutes 2 minute walk from all the shops and restaurants 15 20 minute walk from red light Staff were lovely even had a computer to use to print our boarding passes off Such a nice stay

369295,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No shampoo or shower cap provided The soap dispenser on the wall of the shower said hair and body It was not shampoo It left my hair feeling very rough like wire wool One day our room was not made up until after 4pm There were major roadworks right outside the hotel so our view at breakfast was of a building sight It also meant that the tram stop had been moved so we had a long walk to the tram , Attractive building Room dark even with all the lights on No view 
369296,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Had a double room had one with two beds pushed together It meant there was a lot more bed soace but did have a dip in the middle which was unusual , Location in Amsterdam and value for money were really ideal 
369297,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There is some work on the tramlines nearby but that is a minor inconvenience and only temporary , Awesome location right in the theater district but close to museums and easy access to the city A well looked after old building and great value for money 
369298,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Found the room rate expensive for the type of room I got under the roof windows high so no view and breakfast excluded, Great location and staff friendliness good breakfast selection
369299,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I do dislike the entrance a lot Horrible what the redocoration did with the big hall White tiles all over Also the rooms have had an update But not the right one They had done a better job when they restored the old furniture and just got new bathrooms and new carpets Its is a shame to distroy the old rare interior with chaep Ikea like wooden shelfs and wardropes , I liked the old interior of the restaurant The lamps are beatiful Its all art deco style So is the exterior And the breakfast is also very good 
369300,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room we had was very tiny which is a bit of a let down for the price of 265 per night BUT that is Amsterdam and every hotel is fairly pricy , There was A LOT of staff and they were all very very helpful attentative and friendly 
369301,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, lots of roadworks outside the hotel and some of the facilities are a little old fashioned seemed slightly expensive for the level of product, location excellent and room quality is good
369302,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The noise from the elevator cause my room was next to it otherwise everything was fine, Great location I believe its the best location in Amsterdam And the staff were very professional and helpful
369303,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Wi fi was awful In my room it was working 20 of time at extremely low speed I had to go to the corridor to send and receive emails Then I started walking through the hotel in a search for a better wi fi speed including the lobby area didn t find anywhere Measured it with speedtest net on multiple devices and didn t see anything better than 1 1 Mbps down Couldn t use skype for long calls Staff was sympathetic but couldn t help much Offered me their corporate wi fi password but it appeared to be as lousy as the main one It was a disappointment , Location is perfect Staff is helpful and responsive 
369304,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Heating didn t work We were immediately provided with a backup heating radiator Breakfast price Our room window was facing the interior of the hotel Room was small, Friendly and helpful staff Super location Comfortable bed Clean
369305,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room not spacious relative to cost Breakfast should be included in the room rate No fault of the hotel but the area around it has a massive construction project in force that restricts access to the hotel to some extent, Very helpful staff Clean room with comfortable bed Nice bar 
369306,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hotel is nice and classic style whcich is nice but needs to be updated for example the rugs and the door in our room allowed light from outside , Location was great unfortunately they re working on the tram rails so too noisy 
369307,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing, Beautiful historic property the rooms are large and very clean welll decorated hotel staff exceptionally friendly and helpful very nice and large restaurant with lovely outside view booking breakfast save you about 25 less location right on the canal good for hop off tour by boat restaurants caffes supermarkets shoppings are just few steps from the hotel Holland casino trams stop right infront of the hotel 
369308,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Through Hotels com I requested a late check out and they said this was communicated to the Hotel They did not indicate there was any additional charge for this However on check in the reception had no record of this and said it would cost I think 25 euros an hour for late checkout This is poor communication I complained to your management and was granted a late check out with no charge As a client who has used your hotel for very many years I do appreciate this Breakfast is rather expensive , Great you now provide good FREE wifi in the rooms this is important Wonderful location clean and very helpful staff 
369309,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bathroom tiny very difficult to get into shower which was in the bath behind fixed glass shower curtain The American cafe was closed to residents due to a private party This is not good enough after paying almost 600 euros for 2 nights All facilities advertised should be available especially in 4star hotel , Location was good
369310,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms are dark wish for more lighting a double room will be 2 twin beds pushed together my room had dirty carpet and wallpaper peeling , Located right on the canal you can step outside and catch the Hop on Hop off canal tour boat It was 20Eur for 24 and you can see every inch on the city The rooms have great views and Cafe American is attached with a phenomenal breakfast buffet 
369311,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The hotel had old carpets that had their peculiar smells and the pillows smelled to humidity fongus , The location was great near all the best museums canal rides transportation facilities and away from all the fuzz of downtown Amsterdam The staff was very attentive to our needs The common areas were nice 
369312,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Only major complaint was that our room was listed as non smoking but had noticeable stale smoke odor They had no other rooms available that were similar Very disappointing We were there two nights and were paying for two additional rooms for family for two nights each Gave us two free breakfasts as compensation Thought the two breakfasts were minimal compensation for the money we spent at their hotel , Location and staff Breakfast not included was excellent 
369313,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast buffet was the opposite of the hotel This was very unacceptable There was no option other than the full buffet for 20 Euros Could not just get a coffee and cereal or toast So much out of keeping with the accommodation shown by the hotel itself To compensate there are many local places to have breakfast at a much better value and selection , Perfect location especially the accessibility to public transportation Great personnel and very very helpful and pleasant Rooms are clean well maintained and the deluxe rooms are very spacious and comfortable for lounging Definitely will come back here next trip to Amsterdam 
369314,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I had a serious health issue while staying at the hotel kindey stone which needed an ambulance to take me to the hospital non of the staff were cooperating with my wife at the reception to call an ambulance or even check on me one of the staff told my wife to wait until she s done with serving a guest Then one staff member was helpful enough to call a taxi My wife had to assist me on her own to walk from my room to the taxi ,No Positive

369321,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Found used condom in our room On floor in front of chest Also someone was in our chest of drawers where underwear was stored Told management response was as if it were a common occurrence What is creepier The occurrence or the unresponsiveness of management , Room size of junior suite was generous and location was fabulous 
369322,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room although comfortable and clean was vey dull and dark shower was old and bath was quite high to get in and out of shower Had to pay an additional city tax of 14 euros every night , Lovely hotel clean good food and helpful staff Comfortable bed and lovely soft fresh towels
369323,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, View from the room was disappointing actually there was no view to speak of our balcony was closely packed with the buildings next door Gym was rather small If you rent a bike overnight there s no provision for parking outside the hotel which is an inconvenience plus you might discover that the police confiscated your bikes if you park them in the wrong spot it happened to us luckily we had bought insurance , Bed was nice comfortable Mattress as well Quiet location Breakfast was of good quality and rather rich but rather expensive it wasn t included in our package so we paid 16 euros person per day Wi Fi worked without a problem Hotel staff was helpful

369328,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only fault is the dining room for breakfast The only option is to pay 20 Euros for a full continental buffet This was absurd and we refused to patronize the restaurant at all due to this It seems unreasonable not to provide for some simple alle carte options Though there are plenty of good places to eat close by , The rooms were clean and spacious the staff was exceptionally friendly professional and helpful This is a great well maintained historic hotel located in a fantastic location Easy access to the trams and taxis A lot going on but away from the touristy honky tonk areas 
369329,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms on the ground floor need to be updated even tho they are classed as classic rooms they need to be renovated especially the bathrooms, We booked two rooms the first on the 3rd floor was great spacious Art Deco but the second room on the ground was very small and dated would not class that room as a 4 star hotel room
369330,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Business center could be a little better There were two computers but one didn t work The printer did not work either However that being said I was able to email what I needed to print to the reception desk and the staff printed it for me , The hotel location was fantastic Prior to arrival we had purchased the Canal Bus Hop On Hop Off tickets Turns out there was a canal bus stop right in front of the hotel The city tram and bus stop were nearby Other places we wanted to visit see were within walking distance Hotel staff was very friendly and very helpful Great place to stay 
369331,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Breakfast was not worth the price Not much of a buffet Had to seek out waiters to either get a coffee or cappucino every day Even though there was a platter labeled pancakes only one day of our four day stay did they have any available other day is was croissants on the platter , Location
369332,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The first room I had was very dark and quite a lot of street noise , The location the staff were extremely helpful especially Dann and Mandy on reception 
369333,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Only one drawback was that our room had waste pipes boxed in running through it so regularly heard flush shower etc from above At one point during the night it woke me up as it sounded like torrential rain But we were too tired really to be bothered , Location really good on the fringes of the city Centre Close to some attractions and a walk to others but what hotel isn t The room was very clean and modern and also the bed was extremely comfortable Staff were very friendly and helpful also allowed us to leave luggage before check in and after checking out so that we could get away and enjoy the city without baggage We actually went on a canal cruise right outside hotel to use some time before check in 
369334,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Gym needs a big improvement Breakfast is very expansive we did not take one , Excellent Location for this part of town Leidesplan Staff where always so nice and helpful specially the concierge people Room was bug and very comftable 423 try to get a room facing the fountain it is lovely
369335,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Air conditioning turned off by itself at night leaving room rather stuffy 20 for breakfast rather expensive a second cheaper option for those who only want coffee and croissants would be an idea we have experienced this option in other hotels , The location was excellent with a very attractive outdoor fountain and seating area around the Caf American Central but quiet also very attractive Staff couldn t have been more friendly and helpful Didn t bother with breakfast as we do consider 20 a little steep Bedroom was comfy only negative being that the air conditioning seemed to turn off by itself at night making it a little stuffy on a warm night in September don t like to think of hotter weather Caf American was lovely we got to enjoy the Sunday brunch with the jazz session most enjoyable Very happy overall 
369336,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing , I can not say enough about this Hotel its fantastic location perfect staff very helpful spotless we were on the 6th floor our room was very spacious overlooking the rooftops and canal The interior of the hotel is stunning I would recommend this hotel to everyone

369338,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not a dislike for certain but we asked for a quiet room which was perfect about from being very dark having only one small high window had to use our mobile phone light to enter the number on the safe a light at that end of the room would make a big difference A small price to pay for a large quiet room though , The staff were super efficient and friendly David the Concierge was asked to store our cases as we arrived at 10am Without asking he gave us a map pointed out the best places to visit and was so polite The map proved invaluable Both my daughter and me said the beds and pillows were the most comfortable we ve ever slept in The hotel has a lot of history and is very Gothic in style lovely interior Needless to say everybody speaks really good English We did not opt to have breakfast a little expensive but there are lots of alternatives on the doorstep ranging from pancake kitchens to McDonalds We ll definately be back So much to see and do you d need several trips Already looking at flights to book again 
369339,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Some rooms needs to be updated, My first hotel review Really enjoyed my stay Location is great and staff are very friendly The only thing is I got not so good room for the first 2 nights but I asked for a room change and was moved to a nicer room with a view whichwas much better

369344,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, First we had one of the older rooms very loud very dark The ones that are not in the pictures at the beginning After asking for another room twice at first the concierge said that every room in the house is loud the new room was nicer but not very clean The hotel has got very thin walls so you can hear nearly every noise especially the cleaning women starting their work before eight every day We were really diasappointed I thought that with this high price the Hotel would offer much more comfort , The location was very nice
369345,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was a little dark but it is an old building We could have asked to move but it was such a small thing and didn t affect our break , The location was fantastic Easy to get to from the airport and access to the city Staff were very friendly and helpful

369348,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hampshire HQ management need to invest in the restaurant looking tired and not a patch on my last visit 20 years ago With care and attention the spectacular Art Deco interior could be made great once more complimenting the strengths of the staff on customer service and a fantastic location at the heart of the city, Staff attentive and very helpful throughout nothing too much trouble

369357,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Maybe a little pricey extra 30 euros for a decent canal view room , The location was excellent convenient to trams right on a canal at a stop museums central square etc The staff were very helpful and the canal view room was roomy and comfortable 
369358,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The poorest conversion of an historic building I have ever seen We stayed in 2 rooms The first they insisted was a canal view but you had to peer over the wall to see the water 6th floor irregular shaped room with white cheap mdf unit for tea and coffee etc Cheap Nescaf nasty cheap toiletries from a wall dispenser We were offered a 3rd which looked like a sleezy 80s nightclub Black carpets and walls with a 10ft high picture of Prince I think I know what they were trying to achieve themed trendy but it was the most uncool aesthetic my teenage daughters laughed their heads off Other British tourists agreed you could be staying anywhere No sense of history I ve stayed in better Premier Inn rooms Very poor breakfast Beware extra charges inc tax that aren t included in the booking com rate An extra 84 was deducted from my bank 2 weeks before my stay despite the hotel saying the additional charges for a canal view would be payable directly to the hotel I really don t understand all the other positive reviews Maybe the other rooms are better Either way the hotel needs to be more explicit about what you are paying for , Comfort of the bed Friendly staff

369379,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, When checking in I was told I had to pay a 150 00 deposit even though on my booking confirmation it said 50 00 I complained about this the next morning after checking my confirmation and got it back but with no access to the minibar and couldn t add anything to my room even though they had my card details Also the bathroom floor was dirty the dirt could be wiped off of it Needed a good mop Awful view another building right next to the window no light goes into the room so quite dull and the lights themselves weren t bright Would definitely upgrade Breakfast way too expensive Did not stay for it at all the pancake house nearby is a much better bet and cheaper , Woman checking us in wasn t helpful but all others were great helped with trams train taxi etc Great location next to tram stop They run a lot Very comfy bed Good tv channels Map of amsterdam on arrival was handy

369383,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room furniture was kind of old and the bathtub had stains and looked a bit old as well The worst was however the light in the room With all the lights on it was still very dark Construction under the windows and the the tram running early in the morning it was loud even with closed windows Overall a bit overpriced Staff at the restaurant was not good , The best was the location and the staff at check in Within walking distance to the hop on and hop off bus and boat tour as well as many restaurants A little far to the train station though The best was the kingsize bed which was extremely comfortable Nice was also the balcony The aircondition was very good and helpful on a very hot day in Amsterdam

369385,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We had to ask for the coffee and creamers to be replenished in the room It was quite noisy on one of the nights when youngsters on motorbikes were shouting outside in the early hours , Lovely big and soft bed slept really well The restaurant was top class and even though a little pricey was well worth it for one evening Plenty of choice of other excellent restaurants nearby too The bar was quirky and enjoyable Pity there was some building work going on opposite but we still had a good view of the canal 
369386,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, When we asked for two single beds we were given a double bed with two single mattresses not what we wanted I had to really insist and they managed to find a room with two separated barely single beds These beds were soooooooo narrow that I rolled out twice Seriously I should also add that we are a single couple one with his arm in a cast and they gave us a room as far from the elevators as possible We did not sleep well for 5 nights , Room was perfectly clean and attractive Several staff members except for the one who checked us in were warm and friendly

369389,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We were in a renovated room facing the plaza 5th floor which was very small not what we thought we were getting The new closet they built cut up the room and reduced the potential room space One wall painted black made it feel very dark should rethink some of the elements in the renovation Would recommend a lower floor or a river view should have asked to see the room offered which I would highly recommend , An elegant old building Most of the staff was great

369443,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bathroom was a little on the small side but had everything I needed Could not get a check out extension my fault I should have requested this at booking time I suppose Could have done with more soundproofing especially as there are major works taking place on the tram lines in Leidseplein , The room was spacious I received a complementary upgrade to a junior suite and very clean Super comfortable bed The in room Nespresso machine was very welcome The quality of the breakfast buffet was excellent

369446,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, That the only bar available after 10pm was the one at the front of the hotel which lacked any atmosphere or charm Our room was a bit gloomy and again lacked charm Shame the art deco interior has been lost apart from the dining room , We came to stay for our 25th wedding anniversary and were given a room upgrade and some fizz which was a lovely welcome The art deco dining room is wonderful and the location is good The staff were very helpful and friendly and the meal we ate in the dining room was very good

369452,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The entrance and the corridors seem old fashioned which spoils a bit the first impression But this is quickly forgotten once you enter the room Of course parking is extremely expensive in that neighborhood but fortunately the man at the entry pointed out a more reasonable parking place a few blocks away , We had a wonderful room view on the Leidse Plein and New York is not the only city that never sleeps But no disturbance of the noise or whatsoever Just a lovely view morning and at night time Also very comfortable and unlike many other hotels a good room temperature without having to fight with the airco system All personnel was very helpful and friendly 
369453,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, My bedroom was dark there were very low wattage bulbs and the interior was dark paper The minibar was expensive the bathroom very small and draughty a cool breeze below the sink the shower was over the bath and was awkward to jump into The bedroom felt cold as well , I liked the Restaurant and its menu and staff Great price and value and the wow factor of the dining room Excellent oysters and good selection of beers Good free wifi

369458,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I think the rate is a bit too high the balcony was an extra charge of 120 EURO and plus the hotel added city tax of 40 EUROS which is a lot Had I known this will be added I wouldn t have booked as it turned out to be very expansive after all Also breakfast was not included which is a shame The walls are very thin we could hear everything and it was a bit noisy but not too much , Great staff always willing to help with anything clean and spacious room balcony tea pot in the room with free coffee and tea all the time the location was fantastic in the middle of the Leidisplain area near all the coffee shops restaurants and pubs close to the tram and buses

369463,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing, Lovely room on the 4th floor overlooking the fountain with canal on the right and Leidesplein on the left Atmospheric bar and restaurant lovely staff and Prosecco on the house on my husband s birthday what a nice touch 
369464,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The dingy colour of the carpeting plus although there were five sidelights in the room they were all on the same wall so the room felt rather dark , Great location next to tram stops and also bus 197 to from Schiphol Breakfast very good 
369465,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, facility is quite old and price performance was poor Charged me citytax for everyday we stayed breakfast was pretty average for price and service was soo poor wait for cofee and omlet for so long, Best Location Ever

369468,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The hotel itself inspite of the permanent renovation is quite out of date Rooms and facilities are of the years 80s But no serious problem just a little bit low value for money The 40 extra for daily parking was a negative surprise, Excellent location The impressive building itself The fantastic restaurant where the breakfasts are served The excellent breakfast The very very helpful and always smiling staff All in all by amsterdam standrads it is comfortable hotel close to everything
369469,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We first got a room in an area that was being renovated which meant morning drilling in the room right next to us We were then moved to a room that was extremely cold because the window didn t shut properly We received a radiator to make up for it However the bathrooms had no heating and were extremely cold I found some random socks in the room that didn t belong to me nor my partner I also saw one bug in the bathtub and another one next to the window The furniture is old and outdated Overall this was a very bad experience and wouldn t recommend it to anyone ,No Positive
369470,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only downside was outside noise at night but that is to be expected in a busy city , The hotel was spotlessly clean the staff went out of their way to help and were very welcoming and pleasant Very comfortable rooms and beds Decorating and furnishing first class

369474,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, For the size of the room the bathroom was pretty small in comparison They were also doing renovations whilst the noise didnt bother us the hallway was a little messy with extra carpets etc not a big deal though and did not affect our stay , Bed was huge and so comfy Even had a pillow menu Excellent view of the canal Helpful friendly staff great location 
369475,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, When we arrived the staff provided us with a very small shoebox room this rome should be made obsolete as its not somewhere you would like to stay it should never have been given When i complained about the room we were facilitated with a canal view room much more like what you would expect for the money paid , I liked the location of this Hotel on the Canal and surrounded by a busy shopping street with plenty of bars and restauraunts Close to all amenities museumes and attractions once you like walking 
369476,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, having separate mattresses in a couples room meant that some one was falling in the middle from time to time the equipment at the SPA should be updated , wonderful location having breakfast at the hotel was a wonderful idea for us it saved us time and allowed us to eat early in a wonderful setting and to start our day fresh 
369477,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only thing that would be nice is to have free bottles of water in the room , From the moment we stepped out of the taxi there was a very helpful concierge waiting for us who provided us with lots of information and places to visit The room was very spacious clean tidy and had a very comfortable bed best sleep I have had in a long time All of the staff were very friendly and polite and were also happy to help if we needed anything 
369478,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The staff were not particularly friendly and welcoming Uncomfortable stay due to drilling in the early ours outside of our room , Very modern decor in rooms and bar
369479,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very poor considering I ve been to Amsterdam over 60 times and have always wanted to stay here Very disappointing indeed and certainly wont bother again The front of the building looks very grand and would lead you to expect a huge art deco entrance lobby Front door is around the corner , The reception area was quite nice but from getting in the lift onwards it was like a building site 
369480,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, You can hear others closing doors all the time due to thin walls A review I had previously read recommended the beef sirloin which I tried and would not recommend , Location was fantastic I caught the Airport express bus to and from the airport which was perfect as the 13th stop is directly opposite the Hotel 
369481,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The main Lamp in the room was missing if your staying with a friend girls there should be a an alternative mirror in the hall way or elsewhere in the room The heating was a little bit low by check in but after 1 day the room started heating up At the breakfast the Pancakes where finished 1 hour before the buffet closed , Big room we couldn t hear a noise from the window even though we were so close to center and the main square Bed where very comfortable Staff was very helpful and always happy Location the hotel is very central a 15 minute walk and your at the central station airport bus station just across the street public transport Tram just 1 minute walking away Shops around the corner a really good location and exquisite Hotel really recommendable defnetly coming here again
369482,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, That we had to go home, Our 4th trip to Amsterdam and this is the best hotel we have stayed in The beds were unreal So comfy that we didn t want to leave The room was so spacious and the food and drinks in the outstanding Art Deco cafe Americain was 2nd to none 
369483,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was fine but not up to the standard of the public areas although the ensuite bathroom was good and clean We did not have breakfast as it was quite expensive , All the staff were very genuine kind and helpful We felt very welcome and were well looked after The reception staff were especially thoughtful and obliging The hotel was in an excellent location for the centre of Amsterdam and also the museum district Beautiful dining room with good food and live music 
369484,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bedroom dated but comfy Room with a view of the hotels air conditioning A little disappointed at the evening meal to say it was expensive but the taste was not worth the price Well presented however I had the lobster starter but it didn t wow, Location is key superb building and staff very helpful great service checking in and waiters more than friendly at meal times 
369485,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The room was beautiful the staff were incredibly friends and the location was perfect Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and hope to go back again in a few months time 
369486,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, 1 Few staffs were very friendly but some are super impolite 2 I have strong opinion about the broken promise offered by the hotel the requirement of two single beds was mentioned clearly on couple weeks ago it is seemed invisible On the other hand the staffs deal with this without any apologies Shameful 3 Letting the customers to live in the harmful smell room newly renovated what do you want really ridiculous The worst services I have ever seen in Europe ,No Positive
369487,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Originally put in a double where the beds had been two singles pushed together They were happy to switch us to a double but it meant we had a view of a heating vent instead of the canal as in the twin when I d booked a double with a canal view, Lovely room sauna excellent location and staff
369488,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, 1 Few staffs were very friendly but some are super impolite 2 I have strong opinion about the broken promise offered by the hotel the requirement of two single beds was mentioned clearly on couple weeks ago before the checking in time but seemed invisible to the hotel On the other hand without any apologises was totally reasonable after making this mistake 3 Letting the customers to live in the harmful smell room newly renovated what do you want really ridiculous The most suck services i have ever seen in Europe ,No Positive

369491,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Same hotel but depends on the booking sometime you will have small room The light in the room is too dark for business people Maybe it is romantic for couples but still difficult when prepare your baggage , This time room was quite big 
369492,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bathroom in room 109 is tiny And lighting in the room is a little dull especially near the tea making are which is really dark This might be picky but the hotel is of a very high standard and that should be set across the whole hotel Also they take 150euro when you check in as a deposit for damages and mini bar use and this isnt advertised anywhere Didnt have breakfast as its 20e extra and you must book it the day before , Comfort of our bed Best i have ever slept in And the location is very convienent to trams buses Hotel is very clean 
369493,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The bed was ok but a bit old , Everything was great the staff the location the hotel itself the room and the service They cleaned our room every day and provided assistance on all issues requested 
369494,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Reported that our safe was broken and nothing was done Luckily we had two rooms and used the other rooms safe , Staff location and general vibe of the hotel
369495,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, IMHO this is the best hotel in terms of location to explore Amsterdam Getting from Schipol airport just take bus 197 and it will stop 50 meters from hotel entrance The hotel itself is very impressive breakfasts are great as well 
369496,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The staff were poorly trained and had terrible customer service skills After being seated in the hotel s cafe we had to wait over 20 minutes for a waiter to take our drinks order The reception staff were friendly but were not very efficient either The breakfast was also very expensive even though there was not much choice , The rooms were spacious and we had a lovely view of the canal The bed was super comfortable and there was no loud noise from outside The location was really good only a 10 15 minute walk to the centre and there was plenty of bars and restaurants close by 
369497,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Outdated room nothing like what s on the pictures Trip back to the 80s Disappointed , Convenient location in the centre Impressive looking building from the outside Beautiful breakfast room
369498,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Although the room was spacious the lighting was poor and very dark , The hotel is of very good standard the Cafe American was our favourite place for drinks food
369499,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The reception area could do with modernising The TV volume did not work but the hotel quickly replaced the TV Could have provided more international TV channels such as CNN News Euronews etc , Excellent location Good breakfast even though this was extra on the bill
369500,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No , Hotel location is quite good About 8 mins walk to museum area and 15 mins to central station Hotel staff are very nice and trying to help Didn t notice the gym which was at the basement floor until the last day i was leaving Room is quite basic 
369501,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was a bit cold needs attention from management , Staff are great Location is amazing middle of everything and especially the must see museums quarter Hotel style is nice The bar and restaurant are just wonderful 
369502,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We could not find any faults in personnel or facilities Everything was excellent throughout , Everything was excellent from the time we checked in till the time we checked out The room service staff and the room make up staff were very helpful and always obliging We liked everything about this Hotel the staff the facilities the location and the value 
369503,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Cleaning of rooms very late One day after 4 30 pm wuich was inconvenient By then I was back in the room and did not want to be disturbed This happened twice, Reception and concierge staff superb
369504,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our room was cold on arrival and took quite a long time to warm up It is due for renovation so maybe that will be dealt with The bathroom is very small but the building is over 100 years old so any reconstruction is difficult I would prefer a walk in shower to a shower over the bath as this would free up space in the bathroom but that s not everyone s preference The decor of the rooms unfortunately does not match the Art Deco style of the building and restaurant , Excellent location very helpful staff One of the best beds I have ever slept in However the room facilities did not match those described on Booking com which was a bit of a disappointment so we took this up with the hotel management after our stay They replied quickly and efficiently The mistake has now been corrected and it shows they take guest comments seriously Full marks for their genuine concern and response 
369505,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We gave stayed at the Hampshire before and had a lovely stay we have always booked the suite but on this occasion we had a terrible time with the people in the next room on the first night we had to call the night porter 5 times between 2 00am and 5 30am due to the noise coming from the room next door continually banging doors and partying with another couple then the party progressed to the couples arguing and fighting the night porters tried to quieten them down without success I just felt that the management could have done a bit more on the next night to help us, The staff at the hotel was lovely and in a great location
369506,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, lack of facilities in the property swimming pool sauna wellness considering the price you pay the hotel was no smoking but yet you could smell smoke through out the corridor I was on Now I personally don t have an issue with this but I think if your are going to put warnings in every room in regards to smoking and drug use you should police this a lot more vigilantly The main thing for our group was the lack of in hotel facilities for a 4 star property it is something that should be looked at for future development , great location not too far from centre lovely old style hotel Magnificent building staff were brilliant comfortable beds
369507,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms are a bit outdated but clean , Location is just perfect Staff was very helpful and friendly Historical building with a good restaurant and bar 2 steps and tram and bus stops pubs steakhouses bars clubs everything is so close 
369508,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our only disappointment was that the famous Cafe Americain was closed for the duration of our stay That wasn t stated at the time of booking , The hotel has great character We loved the Art Nouveau style The breakfast buffet was excellent and good value for money specially if you book it on arrival It s very close to the major museums and a twenty minute walk to Dam Square 
369509,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, paid more on booking com for small room than what was offered at the hotel at rack rates for executive rooms with canal view a little disappointed in this to say the least, location transportation
369510,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, This hotel is in the heart of Amsterdam and in a very good location for everything Staff are very helpful and friendly The dining area is beautiful with all the stain glass windows are a must see 
369511,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our first night the room that was given to us was very old and the furniture was stained and we were sinking in bed The next we were moved to another room we were very happy with , The location is perfect The staff were very friendly and accommodating The rooms have a very nice view on canal
369512,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Went into the informal bar for a drink which we had also done the previous evening We met an absolute gem of a lady called Sarah who was working there A bright bubbly character with a warm infectious personality However on the Tuesday evening we sat down and my wife moved some dirty glasses over to another table Immediately we heard a loud shout from the bar an older male barman shouted leave them leave them The whole bar went quiet Very embarrassing when only trying to help I did ask for a polite word with him in the reception where he continued to shout at me in front of the reception staff then flew back into the bar Very unpleasant definitely wasted our evening We are fair people and realise we can all have a bad day but there was no apology , Hotel beautiful outside and inside with many period features being retained Staff were in general exceptionally good We ate in the main restaurant on the last evening the food was very good indeed again the staff were first class 
369513,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I paid for a DE lux room when I make the order it s the second time for me in this hotel so I know the room it s the same room I saw in booking When we got to the hotel thay gave us a really bed room just the second day I got the room that I ordered , Best location if u pay for a upgrade room it s a good hotel The standard rooms not good 
369514,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We had an issue with our safe it just refused opening and took time to fix Thankfully we had some cash on us and left the room for the hotel staff to attend to By the time we were back all was good , The rooms are good size in comparison to other hotels in Amsterdam The staff are friendly and helpful and the place is CLEAN Not to mention the best location ever Oh the hotel has one of the best restaurants in town too 
369515,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, My only negative is that poor lighting in the bedroom made the room very dark so it was hard to get ready and find things , Reception staff are so lovely Great location 
369516,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Lighting in the room needs drastic improvement It was winter time with damp cold weather and with the sun barely visible it meant practically no daylight and the in room lighting left a lot to be desired Also the house keeping staff needs to ensure rooms are cleaned on time Three out of five days we came back at 3 PM and found the rooms just the way we had left them , Superb Location Next to the tram and bus stops The deluxe room we had booked could easily accommodate 2 adults and 2 children with one extra bed We got a room with the canal view which was a bonus 
369517,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, About eight steps up to the entrance doors which no one else has mentioned not easy to heave the luggage up there Fully stocked mini bar is electronic do not move anything or you ll be automatically charged , Very good well run comfortable warm well located hotel The fountains outside the restaurant are a good landmark when returning on foot The entrance is however round the side facing a canal Friendly staff who all speak English Good sleep quality Lots of towels and hot water Kettle in room with mugs and packets of instant coffee chocolate Bring your own tea bags and ask the bar for milk 
369518,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Was a little worried when got to the hotel in the early hours to find the doors closed however just press the buzzer and the staff will let you in , Fantastic luxurious hotel right in the centre of Leidseplein where you can walk or get a tram from central station The hotel just looks stunning from the moment you arrive The staff are friendly and the beds are really comfortable Perfect stay for our engagement 
369519,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The feeling is that the management is desperately trying to save money and you feel it during your stay The furniture is run down the toilet paper is of the type you find in public bathrooms in train stations there are no complimentary water bottles just a minibar where bottle of regular water costs 5 euros and these are just some small but irritating examples You get the feeling that they are trying to attract visitors with a low price but than overcharge you on small items and services to make up for it This is ok if the price is attractive enough but don t expect a real 4 star hotel , The Hotel is situated in a beautiful historic building in a convenient spot in Amsterdam tourist center
369520,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, All staff were so helpful friendly and attentive Gave us lots of recommendations of where to go outside of th main tourist hotspots Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in Great buffet breakfast highly recommend Comes with a glass of bubbly too 
369521,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Being less mobile I could not enter the hotel on my own but was obliged to ask for help which was offerted gladly but still I prefer to be independent Same for the elevator to the restaurant down was no problem but to go up one was obliged to ask for help , Location and the history of the building
369522,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only part I did not like about the hotel is the tendency of the staff at reception changing price re the city tax The rate is not the same as the cost listed on their website and each new member of staff gives you a different price I find this unethical Also had a problem with my bill at check in my bill was fully paid and on check out it was not Naturally I was not happy but it was eventually resolved and they blamed Booking com for this My suggestion is email the hotel before check in and hold the hotel to this price , I loved the location It s perfect with easy access to airport trams canal cruises shops movies museums and a range of restaurants catering to all levels of pocket The hotel is beautiful and at Christmas even more so Restaurant is stunning food is delicious and I will return 
369523,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Mini bar was expensive there were some hairs in the bath and on the floor , Location is perfect staff very friendly bed was comfortable the room had a little safe which was convenient and a very well stacked mini bar clean toilet 
369524,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I was a little put off by my room heating not warm enough, although I did not use them the facilities for guests seemed vey good the staff were also very helpful and understanding about simple problems like buying tram tickets etc a smile can work wonders especially for older slightly confused guests such as I 
369525,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The receptionist at the day of my arrival the evening of December 9th was v rude and gave me the worst room I ve ever stayed in room was too small not comfortable phone as so many problems mini bar had a v loud sound lamp was not working I was obliged to pay a v high rate for an extra night eve though the hotel was quite empty and not taking into consideration we were 4 rooms for almost 5 nights , The location and food 
369526,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The location was perfect The rooms are beautiful and very artistic I mentioned it was my husbands birthday and they put a little bottle of bubbles in the room for us 
369527,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing to say , The staff are very accommodating andfriendly the breakfast was superb and it s a good location would definitely come back again x
369528,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Very expensive rooms breakfast was another 20 EUR per person Bar and restaurant too expensive Rooms were shabby and small but the worst was seeing the cleaning lady wash glasses and cups in the bathroom sink I didn t think that could happen in Europe 2015 Gross One of the days the room was only cleaned just before 4pm That s too late , OK location Easy access to trams and buses Short walk to city center 
369529,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The location of our suite was above the bar on the first floor Unfortunately there was a lot of noise from outside which resulted in a terrible night s sleep as I am a fairly light sleeper Not the hotel s fault and if I booked again I would ask for a quieter room , This is a great hotel it looks impressive it is in a great location close to the museums stores restaurants and bars The tram is right outside the hotel and you can take the bus directly to the airport for 5 euros The hotel is immaculate staff were friendly friendly and very engaging and gave us the history of Amsterdam We were upgraded to a suite which had great views a double bath our own fire and sitting area and the bed was unbelievably comfortable 
369530,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Eating in the hotel was a poor experience Service both at breakfast and dinner was below standard After all it is not cheap Shame for such a lovely environment , hotel reception staff were excellent very helpful and friendly Hotel beautifully decorated even Christmas decorations as well Ideally situated for the museums and canal trips
369531,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, staff were polite discreet but available for support if required welcoming Standards were very high housekeeping excellent again discreet but also friendly Prices very reasonable esp for Amsterdam Beautiful building and decor Given free upgrade to a beautiful suite as deluxe room although nice didn t match photos expectations resolved very quickly with no issue at all I appreciated this so much Loved my stay didn t want to leave 
369532,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, This seems to me to be one of those classic business situations where the owners operators do not appreciate the healthiest and most sustainable profits come through pleasing customers through good service and good facilities The Caf American in particular is very tired dirty and understaffed with some very stressed people , Location 
369533,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was small and decor was a little tired Left my passport in the safe and had to wait till midday before anyone would look for it which was a bit frustrating Parking not great , Location was excellent Staff were very nice 
369534,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, My room was very dark It was in the center of the building so if you looked out you were looking into other rooms So you really had to keep the drapes closed The walls were very dark and the lighting was not very bright It felt closed in,No Positive
369535,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was a little cold even though we put the radiator on and we didn t know about the tax on the room per night which we had to pay extra , Brilliant location friendly helpful staff especially the concierge David The rooms were very clean 
369536,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The hotel was absolutely lovely in a perfect location The room was very spacious and we were upgraded which was a fantastic surprise The hotel is right next to a square with various shops and bars pubs restaurants all within 2 min walking distance Overall a great hotel and will be back again 
369537,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, TV DVD did not work properly remote was a general replacement so functions not available and not able to connect to DVD player No warm towel rail to dry towels so had to be replaced daily , Great Location Had a very roomy Suite with corner views and a lovely bathroom Pillow menu was good Large bed 
369538,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The reception felt cheap and not like it was part of the rest of the hotel it could make a world of difference to make it look a little more exclusive The bathroom had a very strong smell of sewage A single duvet for an adult is not acceptable , Staff location
369539,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There was a bit of a wait with check in which was stressful, It was very central The staff were friendly and helpful We were given an upgrade and loved the size of the room with a view of the canal Food was good in the restaurant
369540,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Great location not in centre but close enough to walk to walking around Amsterdam is great Squares bars restaurants etc all nearby and nicer than the centre 
369541,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, For the price the breakfast should be included, Everything Large and comfortable room great location wonderful breakfast although payable separately The hotel restaurant is very good too 
369542,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Tragic if not vandalistic destruction of original architecture in the lobby area in particular in what appears to have been a misguided attempt to modernise its appearance The owners of the property would be well advised to invest in recreating the original features of the appearance of the hotel to differentiate itself from chain hotel e g Hilton standard appearance , Location and historical provenance 
369543,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No bad experiences but in a hotel of this standard one would have expected bath robes and a welcoming bottle of water Free wifi was very slow Breakfast was expensive so we made alternative arrangements , Within easy walking distance of the 3 main museums Good public transport infrastructute trams into old town canal stop and bus to Airport stop outside hotel Relaxed cafe restaurant serving good food drink Good restaurants near by Hotel location in a square lessens the impact noise of traffic 
369544,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Our bedroom was disappointing somewhat cramped and a musty smell Three of the four nights our sleep was disturbed by outside noise from trams and rowdy revellers , The wonderful windows in and the ambience of the restaurant Breakfast was good as were the two evening meals we had The bath was comfortable and the bathroom was nice 
369545,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No complaints this is a really good hotel , The hotel has the most comfortable beds is spotlessly clean and has very helpful friendly staff Highly recommended 
369546,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room was not of 4 star standard Bathroom was grubby and small The bath could use some bleach The carpets in the room were grubby also The noise was ridiculous sometimes Drilling holes in walls at 8 am and cleaning ladies knocking at 8 am also not to mention tram outside the window I emailed the hotel prior to arrival and requested that I be placed in a nice room as seen on their website as it was a very special occasion and they said this was possible however this was not the case , Location was perfect Lovely area surrounding hotel and was within walking distance of Dam square and Rembrandt square Boat trip stopped outside also 
369547,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Rooms are a little dark without curtains open Next to a major tourist district so be prepared for inebriated singing at 3 00am , Location is fantastic serviced by key tram routes and a 5 airport shuttle bus Short walk away from National Museum and Van Gogh Museum Baths in rooms are awesome after a long day of walking around on foot 
369548,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room was dark and dingy the lighting was almost non existent For the cost of this room I would have expected more the room was very small We left the room early one morning and returned at 3 30pm and our room was still not made up very poor service , The location to the trams the bed was comfortable
369549,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, At the amount I paid I think breakfast should have been included in the room rate , Courteous and responsive staff in a hotel with an excellent location 
369550,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room 130 which we were assigned to was so hot at night couldn t sleep due to it Room was also very dark with one window around the back Awful room Staff were not friendly in the dining area and a waitress came over to us twice with orders that we did not order , Hotel was located near Van Gogh and Rijk Museum 
369551,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Noise above our room and when we complained staff made it sound like zguests above us were making noise but we found out later that they were renovating room above us and never told us that So for 2 nights we could not sleep at all This hotel is definetly not a 4star hotel , Restaurant was great 
369552,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Room a bit small for 2 people very little space for lugagge , Comfortable bed you could even choose your pillow Balcony overlooking the fountain Clean and good closet space Perfect location close to a tram stop and the bus stop Museums are just a few blocks away You can walk averywhere from here Lots of restaurants and shops nearby 
369553,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The room although spacious was very dark only had one small window overlooking the air conditioning units, The location of the hotel near museums transportation and canal The Cafe American attached to the hotel
369554,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Nothing really , Location was close the museums and good bars and restaurants If you wanted to get to more the team stop and canal cruises were outside The rooms were more than adequate and were warm and comfortable 
369555,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It was quiet noisy even at 5am , Great location and handy for transport links including airport shuttle and for access to Central Station Close to all attractions including Vondelpark and museums 
369556,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We have paid for deluxe room but the room shown on booking com was not the one we got It was long time outdated definitely not worth of 4star hotel , Location was the best Desk front personnel was kind and helpful 
369557,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The location was a little noisy and overcrowded at night I think it was a little overpriced for the outdated decor and services , Staff were fantastic Friendly helpful Location was good for transport 
369558,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, This hotel is basically ok but a bit tired and 4 star corporate Rooms are rather underwhelming and stuck in a 70 s 80 s time warp from point of view of a not very good TV fiddly tea coffee facilities creaking floors and beds decor etc Automatic minibars Shower over bath with those weird double curtains Room a bit dark Long corridors smelling mildly of disinfectant with unappealing carpets Whole place needs a bit more zing to continue to hold market share moving forward , The bar is cool 
369559,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Having stayed before I was disappointed to be allocated a very small room in a noisier location for wuute a high price However staff sorted this swiftly and with good humour, Location convenient for conference at Vondelpark3 Hotel situated in beautiful location with direct bus service nearby to and from airport Helpful staff
369560,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, It very noisy and you can hear other room when they are walking every thing in the room with price even the water, It is near near to the city center and you can reach the other city part through transportation
369561,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Only downfall was lack of view as we looked into rooms opposite At least windows opened so you could tell what the weather was like , Location is within easy walking distance of Vondelpark and museums Faces canal There are plenty of restaurants and pubs near by Close to shops flower market and easy tram ride to anywhere Airport shuttle outside hotel for 5 euros which takes 45 minutes and is a pretty drive Staff is very accommodating Loved the towel warmer 
369562,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We had dinner in the restaurant the first night Although the restaurant was half empty we were made to wait 45 minutes The fish dish slow cooked cod was barely warm and was VERY underdone Although we complained there was no offer to bring another selection or reduce the price , Very nice room and updated decor in this hotel Location excellent near museums public transit Very comfortable 
369563,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Incompetent staff at reception i have paid 1491 euros for stay they block 2500 additionally in my credit card and no justification, Very good location clean and comfortable rooms however staff in the reception poorly qualified
369564,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The light in the room is appalling impossible to read or see into the wardrobe The reception staff were helpful The best staff in the restaurant was the one woman the men were slow and not responsive to clients needs , The room we were allocated was awful on the main tram route and very dark The one we were then offered was very nice overlooking the canal and spacious but see the next box 
369565,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, The location is perfect A 5 minute walk to the 3 famous art museums 2 of 3 river cruise routes stop in front of hotel on the edge of restaurants cafes shops district Bus 197 to Schiphol airport beside hotel takes about 40 mins for 5 euros can t beat it for ease 
369566,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, I paid extra for a junior suite whilst it was a lovely room it wasn t worth the extra money The bathroom was tiny and there was no balcony It was just a longer version of the standard room i would definitely stay in this hotel again but it would be in a standard room , The friendly staff couldn t do enough for you The hotel room was spotless and the hotel was in a great location for buses trams nightlife 
369567,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, I got a cheap offer through booking com but I was upgraded to a fantastic room with a balcony on the fourth floor this was truly a present thank you Hotel Americain I will come back to you upon my next trip to Amsterdam B De Coninck
369568,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We didn t have a bad experience at all It would have been nice to have breakfast included in our room fee though as we have in other hotels , The staff went out of their way to help us both when we had an issue with making a U S curling iron work or where to find a new European one and in the Concierge s help with advice and getting transportation for us The room was very nice and spacious and the bed was very comfortable 
369569,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The rooms are comfortable but a little plain , The location was ideal for both exploring the canals and visiting the museums The concierge helped us navigate getting tickets to the play of Anne Frank A must do if it is still on For these reasons alone we will be back 
369570,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Not good value for money Incredibly slow internet so slow that I couldn t work in the hotel TV didn t work bathroom only moderately clean Asked for a double bed but got a twin instead All of the above would be acceptable in a 3 star hotel However this hotel charges 200 a night For that amount of money I expect impeccable service ,No Positive
369571,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The fact that we only stayed three nights next time we are staying a little longer, 1 Central to a lot of the attractions we were interested in 2 The staff were polite and very helpful 3 Very nice buffet breakfast Comparable in price to getting a cooked breakfast in nearby cafes but much more healthier with a wider range 4 Clean rooms with nice decor
369572,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, This hotel seems to trade on a glorious past The room I was first allocated on 6th floor was like an attic room with NO view I was moved to larger 5th floor room but again NO view The decor of the rooms and corridors whilst clean were very very dated and well below the standard of a 4 hotel The American Bar was a HUGE disappointment Also do not expect a welcoming lobby with nice seating areas perhaps like the photographs of many years ago they like to show Breakfast was fairly good but there seemed to be very little system in place so you either waited ages for staff or 3 came in quick succession , Location front of house staff cleanlinless building from outside and cafe 
369573,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, There were roadworks outside our window all night We were not told of this when we checked in No warning explanation or apology at all Not good PR on the hotel s part Poor , Location 
369574,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, WiFi was hopeless one of the most complicated access methods ever experienced The famous restaurant overpriced for the standard and variety offered Did not respond to my email response to their survey to convert their survey to English, Reasonable view over a canal
369575,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Old furniture tiny rooms I asked for connected room they didn t give me my request for the first day and I accepted because I prefere early check in but they refuse to give me connected room on the second day and also no view Tell now I don t understand how they calculated the fees and they didn t know also how to explain it to me I changed the hotel second day to another one 5 stars in the dam square with almost same price , Location
369576,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, No desk mirror no full length dressing mirror Horrible room lightning Old TV Bought my own soap vs a slice of Neutragena which was provided , Concierge David was spectacular Bar staff great Location great Coffee in room 
369577,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, a little bit pricy , the location of the hotel the spacious room and very comfortable beds the breakfast the restaurant and the very trendy renovation of the old building 
369578,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The level of lighting in rooms is extremely low and it was difficult to see in semi darkness Realise this falls into place with an older style hotel Also creaking floorboards and doors so hear upstairs neighbours during night , Comfortable Hotel in centre of town and good access to local transport Close to museums and family living close by Also good restaurant with good breakfast choices 
369579,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, We have no negative comments about the hotel except perhaps breakfast was a bit pricey at 19 Euros so we ate out , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is beautifully decorated in art deco style On our first night we followed the trail of cool 1920s art and furniture up six flights of stairs to our room instead of taking the lift I kept expecting to see Leonardo di Caprio The hotel is next to the lovely Vondel Park and is conveniently situated for all facilities Sam Smith stayed there last November 
369580,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Reception staff were iffy I was told off for not pre ordering breakfast and asking for the discounted rate in the day so make sure you pre order breakfast the day before The hotel is very over priced for the facilities and services provided We were told we were upgraded and we re happy we didn t see the room we were upgraded from , The location was great and the dining room was beautiful Service and selection in the bar was good 
369581,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American,No Negative, Everything The hotel was perfect staff and facilites excellent The food drink and atmosphere in the cafe bars and restaurants was excellent The location of the Hotel and surroundings was perfect 
369582,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, A little noisy because of tram , Perfect location Walking distance to nearly everything Easy 10 minute walk to Rijks Museum Van Gogh Museum and Vondel Park Or hop on canal boat right next to hotel Airport bus 197 stops in front of hotel only 5 euro 
369583,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Hotel is expensive for what is included Wifi is horrible unless you want to pay for faster wifi Bathroom extremely small for a junior suite The volume on the TV randomly would turn off , Comfortably bed great location 
369584,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Although free wifi is advertised this was slow and intermittent You could pay for a faster service The attached cafe where breakfast was served was SO expensive , Location was perfect Nowhere was too far to walk Huge selection of cafes restaurants and bars nearby SO easy to arrive from airport by bus 197 stops just outside the hotel Welcoming hotel knowledgable front desk staff HUGE wide bed 
369585,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, The only downside was out view which wasn t the stunning fountain or the canal but the side of the building with rooms facing us but it only encouraged us to go out and explore So I can t complain, The staff were incredibly welcoming and even let us check in hours early free of charge The room was beautiful the location was beautiful and the pillows changed my life 
369586,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Poor advertising meant we received a room without view but paid for the same We were in a non smoking room but the hallway wreaked of cigarette smoke For a 4 star there were limited facilities and average service , Great location and beautiful heritage listed building 
369587,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, POOR WAITER SERVICE IN THE CAFE AMERICAN IN THE EVENINGS ON BOTH OCCASIONS MY ROOM SHOULD HAVE A WINDOW FITTED IT HAD A FRENCH DOOR ONLY , THE LOCATION AND THE DECOR IN THE CAFE AMERICAN
369588,Hampshire Hotel Amsterdam American, Bathroom was kind of small comparing to the room , Location is the best in Amsterdam close to everywhere I stayed by myself so when I got he room they gave me a room with a double bed which I didn t prefer When I asked them if they have a room with a king bed they approved my request right away Roger from front desk was very nice and helpful The room was cozy with a nice view of the canal Price was very good for the room
