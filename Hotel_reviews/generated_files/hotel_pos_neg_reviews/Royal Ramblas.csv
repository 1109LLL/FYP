367456,Royal Ramblas, The fact that the Visa card I paid with over booking com was asked to be changed and the money has not been refunded from the other card , Everything was great 
367457,Royal Ramblas, the room was very small and the first night the Air condition was not working and we were switting however by 3 a m in the morning they changed our room for a better bigger room and also we forgot two pairs of new sandals in the room that we bought and when we went back to claim in the lost and found they told us that they couldnt find it , Staff were good
367458,Royal Ramblas, Privacy in the room while staying with family is bad The showering and toilet areas is not completely invisible from the bed room there are obvious gaps in the glass door separating the bedroom and bathroom The odour from the toilet propagates a little into the bedroom since it is not insulated properly and gaps in the door , Location breakfast staff 
367459,Royal Ramblas, Really slow wifi connectivity Breakfast should be included given the higher price , Fantastic position though you pay for it No breakfast included when the rate charged should include breakfast Modern and clean 
367460,Royal Ramblas, A children s tv channel is needed They had nothing to watch , The porter was most king and helpful with storing our luggage for us Grace made sure our special requests were seen to regarding our rooms Overall very good service 
367461,Royal Ramblas, Rooms were not quit Noise from corridor and next rooms can be heared clearly Bad smell coming from the bathroom and was not fixed throughout our entire stay for 4 days We arrived at 10 am but could not enter our rooms before 2 30pm inspite genius priority and prevoius email communications There check in time is written 2 pm ,No Positive
367462,Royal Ramblas, No separate bathroom sink was in the room only separate toilet and shower Understandable to save space but would have preferred a separate bathroom, Fantastic location 2 minute walk to Placa Catalunya and all the tourist and transport buses
367463,Royal Ramblas, The shower rose squirted everywhere need repair the chambermaid let another person into our room to use the toilet We arrived back she was cleaning room an unknown to us female person appeared We were compensated with s bottle of wine ,No Positive
367464,Royal Ramblas, The staff were rude We hadn t noticed until we retired to bed that the room turnaround hadn t included the usual towels or water When we called the night concierge they didn t accept we were right so made us look around the room like we hadn t done that for them No response or acknowledgement when they did finally deliver the towel and water later that night Made to feel like it was our fault Awful Decided after a long working day to order room service drinks can be ordered by the provided Room Service number but when you try to order food they give you a separate number to call the restaurant when you hang up Considering this is branded as Room Service throughout the room Why not take my order there and then like all other hotels Be aware the walls are PAPER THIN Literally good luck if you also have kids running around the hallway at 01 00 am You can hear everything in the halls and in the rooms next to you , Location was ok but not as recommended by booking com as best for 2 day s in Barcelona it certainly wasn t 
367465,Royal Ramblas, A swimming pool would have been amazing, The room was very clean location ideal Such a busy street yet a very quiet room Staff were available whenever we needed them Bedding was comfy clean sheets and nice extras in the bathroom Breakfast was excellent Overall everything went smooth It s so nice to have a hussle free break Would definitely stay again 
367466,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Great hotel and great location you can t go wrong with this one In the heat of the la ramble 5 meters away from carefour supermarket Few meters away from place de Catalonia All great Nice staff Great breakfast
367467,Royal Ramblas, The bathroom seems to be a little bit small as well as the room itself However it was ok and understable for a busy european city , Very well located You have access to practically everything Most of the attractions in the city are so close or with easy access by using the metro Safe zone you can walk around freely 
367468,Royal Ramblas, A very minor point couldn t get the TV to switch on On a privacy point the toilet didn t afford much privacy even though travelling with partner , Great central location Clean comfortable room Good shower Tea and coffee making facilities provided as well as a mini fridge Staff friendly and attentive when necessary 
367469,Royal Ramblas, the rate and the fact that whilst booking there was an offer of an included breakfast However as soon as the booking was confirmed the free breakfast was gone , The hotel is located on a perfect location Le Rambla The price of the hotel is overrated but that is with the majority of the hotels in Barcelona 
367470,Royal Ramblas, Walls of the hotel room were very thin Conversations in adjoining room could be clearly heard , The location on Los Ramblas is fantastic close to restaurants tour buses market and shops 
367471,Royal Ramblas, Nothing it s the only place I ll stay in Barcelona , Very helpful and friendly staff I cannot fault them they were happy to accommodate every request 
367472,Royal Ramblas, The view from our bedroom was not bad but then we were rarely in there so it didn t matter The views from the lounge and dining room was magic as they overlooked the Ramblas , Just everything The staff were all so helpful at all times Very friendly without prying My husband is disabled and has difficulty walking any distance He has his own mobility scooter and as our taxi pulled up the manager was there to help get the scooter out of the taxi and they were just amazing The air condition in our room was superb which we appreciated as the weather was so very hot Beds changed every day fresh towels etc every day Breakfast was superb and the restaurant with the 10 discount was worth a revisit 
367473,Royal Ramblas, They didn t change the sheets after the previous guests Found someone else s hair all over the sheets and pillows when we were going to bed the first night Breakfast was ok but not very good Way too expensive for what you get Sometimes the front door didn t open supposed to be an automatically opening door , Very close to metro stop Good location if you like the Ramblas area Easy to find the hotel 
367474,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The bed was comfortable and the view of La Rambla was great Short walk to numerous restaurants and attractions Short walk 4 mins to metro station We stayed the night after a cruise We got there early but they were able to get us in our room by 10 30am Would stay there again for sure 
367475,Royal Ramblas, The only thing I didn t like was that they had the sink separate from the toilet n shower But that s a personal preference , Loved the room Loved the location the most 
367476,Royal Ramblas, Standard single room was very small Had to change rooms because toilet in first room wouldn t stop flushing even after someone came to fix it first night Let staff know morning of second day on my way out to see sights but nothing had been done by time of my return so I was bumped up In second room there were a number of minor issues knob to door lock fell out bathroom ceiling had large patch of peeling paint had to take quick showers because the drain didn t work shower door and shower window didn t close properly television only displayed static WiFi was spotty throughout etc None of these were major issues but at 700 Euros for 4 nights I expected much more Also no need to have such a central location in the city and to call the staff fluent in English would be a bit of an overstatement You still need to go to a tourist information kiosk for any real guidance , Nice modern decor with friendly staff 
367477,Royal Ramblas, Beds are a little firm , Sergi the porter was very helpful as was all staff we encountered Location is perfect close to Metro and Aeribus Air conditioning really works well 
367478,Royal Ramblas, The only thing was the lift was very small , We loved the location it was so close to everything The staff were wonderful they even put a birthday cake and message in our room for my partners birthday The coffee and breakfast was excellent 
367479,Royal Ramblas, 1 We booked Royal room but in fact it was more servant room Underground metro sound all night and whole room is shaking Impossible to get rest 2 Staff was very impolite and unprofessional to solve the problem right City has a great client streem and they dont care about services quality or customer expectations 3 No bathtub and bidet in the Royal room, Hotel in the centre
367480,Royal Ramblas, Sadly there was a horrible smell in the corridor outside my room and inside my room it was somewhat musty I found the hotel really dated I think for a 4 star hotel I was expecting more facilities , The location was excellent 
367481,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Had to book at last minute after receiving notice the reservation I had for months was cancelled due to mixup and we were arriving in Barcelona in 2 days I had stayed here 3 prior times so was familiar with hotel location Our room had a handicap shower there was no shelf to put shampoo soap etc on A handicapped person would ve also found this helpful The garden view was a very ugly backside of other buildings Other than that the room was nice very clean and comfortable The breakfast and staff were top notch along with the location
367482,Royal Ramblas, Needed wooden hangers plus the spring loaded shower rod fell down Needs better rod , Great location and great team Breakfast is great and served on the sunny second floor overlooking the Ramblas which made for a pleasant start to the day Food store right next door for wine liquor food and treats Numerous restaurants within one block 
367483,Royal Ramblas, Room very basic even tissue paper not available in the room We have to buy shampoo and shower soap in the supermarket next door as what were provided were of poor quality and minuscule Considering the price we paid we could get a far better hotel just a stone throw away from Ramblas Staff not helpful and friendly , Location
367484,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The location was in the perfect place to walk to many places The concierge was excellent Most of all the pillows were the most comfortable I ve laid on in Europe 
367485,Royal Ramblas, Room was overlooking an ugly yard I did ask for some view there is no chair in the single room so really nowhere to sit except on the bed There was a bench but this of course is where i put the suitcase Also tv channels were very limited and no movies at all except if you are spanish , Location could not be better Property is clean modern and well maintained with a great breakfast offering overlooking the Rambla I stayed in a single room that was very small but it was well planned so all in all comfy 
367486,Royal Ramblas, There is no service They could or would not even recommend a restaurant make a reservation or book a taxi in advance When we asked about tours they gave us brochures to read , The property was clean and in a great location 
367487,Royal Ramblas, Property is a bit dated and needs refurbishing Corridors had a strange plastic odor Shuttle from airport is advertised no such service exists Time wasted at airport looking for shuttle Queen bed not comfortable sunken in the middle Inside facing rooms a bit dingy , Superior Double Room size was adequate With location potential to be a great boutique hotel Currently nowhere near 4 stars 
367488,Royal Ramblas, Room is small but that s normal in Europe but everything you need is there, Near everything A great location A 2min walk to square where all the tours meet So easy 10 min walk to waterfront Just the best location in Barcelona 3 doors from the hotel is a big grocery type store with food wine etc to buy at good prices Restaurant has breakfast daily buffet for 10 euro and it is a good for that price A busy area but room soundproof so not bothered by traffic noise Would definitely stay there again 
367489,Royal Ramblas, Nothing really all was excellent for the time we spent in our room Spent most time in the city and returned only for changing and back out again Switched on TV while waiting for wife to get ready and apart from the news no other English channels , Hotel was very clean staff accommodating and ease of use for the location and surrounding amenities If I needed to be picky it was just on the TV and no channels for adults or kids apart from sky news Breakfast was very nice and serviced all nationalities Just walk outside the hotel as per the web site on the La Ramblas 
367490,Royal Ramblas, The hotel is a bit worn Due to that it is hard to keep it tide and sharp in the rooms Room service however was good attentive to the kids especially 8 and 11 Hospitality of staff overall given the limits is truly good , Location Staff
367491,Royal Ramblas, The electric kettle was not there and we had to call for it After that too it took a while to arrive, The view of the La Ramblas from the room was great The staff were really friendly and helpful They kept our luggage for us on the day of check out and were helpful at all times 
367492,Royal Ramblas, The price was a bit high, One staff member in particular a very nice woman with dark hair and pony tail I forgot her name She comes to work by train She was AMAZING and made our stay at the hotel very pleasurable 
367493,Royal Ramblas, Our room was looking out to a back building with an awfull view We realized we missed a pilow and sheet for the sofa and asked for it at 10 pm The person in the reception did not understand due to his poor English You would expect better English at all times in a four star hotel even in Spain The rooms are modern but small not highly recommended for families , Best location if you like to be in the hearth of the activity Right on Rambla street near to many restaurants shops and tourist attractions 
367494,Royal Ramblas, Breakfast was average and not worth the full price ask at reception to see if they have offers on Was fine for the price we paid , Lots of space for the 3 of us 2 adults 5 yr old in our room 
367495,Royal Ramblas, Cleanless of the room Staff ignored me always when we adk for something The room having a problem in toilet and they changed it to me after 2 nights Request the iron many times and they keep ignoring until i came down for them Water only 1 bottle will give as free for my 6 night stay The price for 4 stars doesn t deserved compared with 4 star hotels in Dunai you will get every thing in same price , Only the location Nothing else
367496,Royal Ramblas, Nothing, The staff were very professional and customer focused The accommodation was both comfortable and in good condition Most importantly though we were made to feel welcome and valued as guests 
367497,Royal Ramblas, Rooms weren t ready upon check in end one of the rooms we had was a dAmp musky smell coming from it , Very central for seeing all the sites barcelona
367498,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Clean rooms friendly staff and close to several public transport options The hotel is also in walking distance of many of the city s best known attractions such as the Gaudi Cathedral Gothic quarter beach port food market amongst others 3 days wasn t enough time to discover this beautiful city and its culture 
367499,Royal Ramblas, The noise from outside the room and the size of the room, Good hotel for short stay room was very small and you can hear the noise from outside Staff were friendly and location is perfect 
367500,Royal Ramblas, All, Very poor in house keeping no cleanliness late housekeeping till 4pm So many dust in room No amenities fill in the boxes Room service menu wine list and availability is different Small pillows discomfort bed
367501,Royal Ramblas, The room door locker was not working fine and They not fix it till our last day The WIFI signal poor in our room In the first days there are a smoke smell ,No Positive
367502,Royal Ramblas, I wish our room was a little bigger We had some difficulty with stashing our suitcases But we would go there again , The breakfast was fine It was a busy week and the staff had difficulty keeping up with the food and clean dishes It is an older hotel but right in the middle of all the activity and close to everything The staff was wonderful Some had difficulty speaking English but we were able to get out thoughts across The rooms are tiny but we were only there to sleep 
367503,Royal Ramblas, For the money and what you get facility and amenity wise there s much better options There is no bar and although there s a reading room it is unstaffed so you have to ring a bell for attention and no one comes we waited 15 mins and nothing There is no other facilities at the hotel and the staff are pretty unfriendly We may as well have booked an apartment somewhere as we literally had a room to use and that was it We used it as a base so it was great for that due to location but for less money there are better options out there , Great location and we had a family room huge king size bed and a sofa bed which had an additional pull out mattress 
367504,Royal Ramblas, Shower curtain and TV channels , Best location with the Ramblas directly on your doorstep Pity there wasn t a rooftop bar or terrace to enjoy in the evening Also the shower curtains were a pain and the TV channel selection was awful On the plus side the breakfast was good and the rooms were very good I m sure we would stay again the next time we re in town 
367505,Royal Ramblas, There is no channel to watch movie or any news couldn t find it There s only Radio Channel The toilet is very small I try to dial the reception for Room Service and followed the instruction from the brochure but never worked Short stay, Nice welcome for the staff Hotel Location is great right in La Rambla The room is very nice bed is good Overall my stay was great Staff is very nice and helpful 
367506,Royal Ramblas, Dining room was disorganised at times and staff could have been more helpful even a smile I could see they were under pressure however this should not impact on others Room was great but for one night it was noisy and a clunky noise from the pipes possibly an air lock, Front door staff very organised and welcoming Location absolutely brilliant and very culturally welcoming 
367507,Royal Ramblas, I would say value of money other than that no negative comments, In the heart of la Rambla 2 minutes walk to catalunya Plaza Friendly stuff I will go there for my next trip to BCN
367508,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, It was an excellent location walking distance to all the shops and restaurants The staff were so helpful and friendly they assisted us with a cab back to the hotel The hotel was modern perfect size for a couple Loved it 
367509,Royal Ramblas, Bed was a bit hard , Excellent location right in the middle of everything The room was very clean and neat The front desk staff very nice and helpful gave a great recommendation for dinner Fluffy towels and cool retro style bathroom 
367510,Royal Ramblas, the breakfast was average from the food to the staff not kind at all not too many things offered scrambled eggs not tasty no fresh croissants pastries or cheese variety Hot drinks should at least be served at the table The housekeeping personnel makes too much noise lack of respect for the guests speaking loudly in the hallways early in morning The fridge in the room was barely cooling anything Soap and shampoo were not given on a daily basis We had to call reception to ask for them The hairdryers should definitely be changed Very poor choice of TV Channels and last but not least everything happening in the rooms around could be heard horrible soundproofing , The hotel is very well located its close to everything you need and is at the heart of the attraction plaza catalunya rambles gothic quarter boqueria shops Spacious closet Working safe Water power comfortable room Great heating 
367511,Royal Ramblas, The hotel should have put up notices about fellow residents being noisy and disorderly not being allowed to wake up people who sleep The receptionist should be more assertive regarding noise in the hotel especialy in the night, The location polite staff and excellent access 
367512,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, It s perfect location for restaurants and Bars Although your on the main strip you can t hear anything at night Great location 100m away from hotel Perfect access to the metro which is cheap and easy to use for going to all tourist locations including Camp Nou Its an extremely comfy bed We will defo be returning
367513,Royal Ramblas, Breakfast should be serve since 6 30 The starting of breakfast time is too late at 7 30 , Good bedding and good design of switch location to control the lighting in room 
367514,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Fantastic staff Very friendly kind and efficient The bell boy was our favourite Always asking if we needed help in excellent English Even weighed our bags for us upon departure Definitely going back here 
367515,Royal Ramblas, Room size bed size old bathroom curtains No propa bedding No slippers no dressing gown Too noisy from next room , Recommend staff to learn english 
367516,Royal Ramblas, You could hear and feel the metro in front lower rooms Would have ideally had a bath and shower Shower only , Ideal location very comfortable room helpful staff and great breakfast selection 
367517,Royal Ramblas, Nothing , The Location of the hotel was very convenient it was located on the famous La Rambla and 60 metres away 30 sec walk from Placa de Catalunya where El corte Ingles is The supermarket Carrefour is almost next to the Hotel Hotel is near the subway lines It s a15min walk to L aquarium 5min walk to Passeige the Gracia So in short very very convenient for everyone especially people with small children The room is clean Bed is comfortable 
367518,Royal Ramblas, There was nothing I didn t like , The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about great restaurants in the area Breakfast Breakfast was very tasty and replenished often We were offered the breakfast promotion which was less than what was quoted online Bathroom The bathroom was clean and the towels were plush There are no washcloths USA so bring your own Location Nice room and located right in the heart of Barcelona 30 minute ride from the airport 35 The hotel is very modern 
367519,Royal Ramblas, Bathroom set up is not that comfortable but it was ok, Location staff across the hotel are amazing clean room breakfast was so good view from the room and restaurant just loved everything about this hotel
367520,Royal Ramblas, Check in was not so great The other guest next to me got all the information included discounted breakfast which was not offered to me Didn t feel valued Room was tiny It doesn t have a proper bathroom Basically the price you pay is for location , Location was the best Close to everything 
367521,Royal Ramblas, WiFi is not that great video voice communication via Skype was not possible only typing , Quiet spacious room good breakfast and nice personnel 
367522,Royal Ramblas, don t eat tapas on the la rambla so so expensive hotel not having a functional real bar just a never open lounge bar so many beggers prostitutes after 1am on la rambla it s unbelievable , La rambla is very good but it gets better if you just get of the main drag both sides to many squares bars restaurant clubs to mention was really impressed port down the road was nice aswell would definitely go back 
367523,Royal Ramblas, No proper evening bar found in most hotels , Staff friendly and very helpful Location the best right on La Rambla in the centre Excellent breakfast selection 
367524,Royal Ramblas, Cannot find a fault , Since it was my first time to Barcelona the staff were so helpful and friendly They organised transport to pick me up from the airport which was really good since I arrived in the evening The location of the hotel is ideal as it is accessible to so many stores landmarks etc which is within walking distance The tourist information office was five minutes away as well as the hop on and hop off buses The amenities and the breakfast was excellent I would highly recommend this hotel 
367525,Royal Ramblas, The rules of the hotel dictate that all amount cost is payable in advance just upon arrival at the hotel Unacceptable , The location is excellent Close to all central attractions plazas and shops 
367526,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Location is great for walking Las Ramblas and checking out the sites of the Gothic Quarter Staff was friendly room was comfortable I wish I could have stayed longer Definitely would stay Royal Ramblas again 
367527,Royal Ramblas, The only thing that could have been slightly better is the breakfast but for the price we paid I am not going to complain The breakfast was good but as I said could be better Overall very good hotel , The location was perfect We stayed there for 2 days and wanted to see as much during our stay which we did The hotel is very close to all the main attractions and of course all the shops The staff is lovely and very helpful everything was very clean and the room was super nice I would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone that is going to stay in Barcelona 
367528,Royal Ramblas, Although it looks fancy from the outside building corridors reception the room 220 we had was small and dirty at times it smelt like sewage We stayed there for 3 nights the bed sheets were stained shower floor looked rusty and the staff were not very welcoming Does not seem like a 4 star hotel Transferred to another hotel NH which was clean good location and friendly staff similar price , Great location Close to the markets food stalls shopping and metro bus 
367529,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Front Desk Staff was very nice and helpfull Breakfast was great The Hotel is genuesly situated just on the Rambla close to Catalunya Sq Rooms are nice spacy and wellfunctioned 
367530,Royal Ramblas, The guess opened the door on us couple of times, I staied for 4 nights the breakfast value is expensive make sure u pay in advance And the glass and the plates are very dirty 
367531,Royal Ramblas, Wifi was a bit unstable at times as pretty much every hotel in Barcelona , BREAKFAST Amazing one of the best ever Really great selection catalan cream for breakfast Awesome Plus there was even candy for the kid The bed The room itself Location Sound isolation Free wifi Great view from the breakfast room Serviceminded 
367532,Royal Ramblas, There was a fold away bed under the window that kept falling out bit annoying but meh for the location is was negligible , Breakfast was amazing and the location can not be beaten 
367533,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The location is very convenient rooms are wide and comfortable however standard rooms do not have main street view they have rear view I didn t know this and wasn t willing to pay an extra 15Euro night for the upgrade 
367534,Royal Ramblas, First of all as we arrived to the hotel the receptionist the young gentlemen was not a welcoming fellow he was in a way rude during our check in the hotel had a strange smell all over the place as soon as you check in you smell the odor At the website we requested to remove the extra bed since our child is young and can t sleep alone in her own bed We requested to remove all the alcohol from the fridge which surprisingly the kept an extra welcoming drinks at the table the WC was having a big disadvantage that the child can lock her self in the WC with no way to open the door from the outside , Location of the property was great just at the right place the hotel was in the real center of Barcelona were all the tourist activities near by and walking distance to the port During check out the elder gentlemen was a great guy who was very helpful and respected all the clients and was very kind 
367535,Royal Ramblas, As listed above, Your site listed a shuttle from the airport They do not have a shuttle You wasted an hour of my time I walk with a cane and your mistake caused me pain 
367536,Royal Ramblas, Breakfast could have started a little earlier either 630 or 7 We had to miss breakfast on the last morning as we had an 750am tour and breakfast didn t start until 730 very, Breakfast had a great selection Staff were very helpful Room was very clean and comfortable 
367537,Royal Ramblas, The hotel specifically advertises Royal Bar which turns out to be a fridge with cans of beer There was an unpleasant odour in the corridor and on awaking felt like I d spent the night in a smokey atmosphere even though it is non smoking throuhout The Room 315 was very dim even on a bright sunny day the wallcovering was peeling away in places After taking a shower the water in the bath took 20 mins to drain away I took a peep into the adjoining room whilst it was being serviced same size as mine and it looked more modernised and cleaner Sorry but at over 200 per night I expected just that little more , the location and view from the breakfast room over La Rambla
367538,Royal Ramblas, My clothing that fell to the bottom of the closet was filled with dust bunnies , I like that the hotel seems to be new and smelled fresh The staff was also very helpful 
367539,Royal Ramblas, Confused reception staff bathroom in need of refurbishment slow WiFi, Excellent location great breakfast experience view from the room modern facilities good soundproofing
367540,Royal Ramblas, Front desk staff rude at all times , False advertisement They advertise free wifi we were there in business and needed the free wifi they advertised the wifi was non existent which was disastrous when your on business and need to be connected 
367541,Royal Ramblas, Room design is very bad view was overlooking a wall and when I told reception I have a problem with closed views the guy was rude saying this is what you have booked online and a better room would cost you extra 30 euros per night P s I paid 168 euros per night excluding breakfast which is not a cheap room , Location is good and convenient
367542,Royal Ramblas, N a, Truly we can t tell you a little more as our 2 nights were terrific the staff fabulous with assisting us with activities We have loved are loving Barcelona
367543,Royal Ramblas, The room doors banged shut so you could hear people going in and out of the rooms in the morning , Excellent location with very friendly and helpful staff Rooms had blackout blinds and double glazed windows to block out sound from outside 
367544,Royal Ramblas, What was not to like , The reception staff The restaurant staff All other staff The room with a big balcony 26 the view from there and from the alfresco bar was beautiful and extensive The breakfast was fabulous The atmosphere and everything was just perfect Thank you 
367545,Royal Ramblas, I didn t like they took extra money for rdmbla view room, Crrosecnt need mor le crispy and buttery flavour Need to add more item such as noddles rice and chicken
367546,Royal Ramblas, The fridge was not working properly and when we asked them to change the room they told us that all rooms like this So we had to put the medicine we have in the reception fridge Also there was bad smell in the corridor and the room in which the people in the next room agreed with us the staff said there is no bad smell and this is the regular smell There is no good isolation and we can hear the people in corridor clearly , The location is perfect at the beginning of La Rambla and within easy access to shops and taxis The rooms are clean 
367547,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, This hotel is situated in the heart of La Rambla the main tourist street in Barcelona It is in walking distance of the port area and almost next door to Place de Catalunya The rooms are of good quality good comfortable beds Bathroom is spacious and very clean Reception staff are very helpful and provide information about tourist spots to visit Breakfast is 15 euros per person but if you book for breakfast for the duration of your stay when you arrive you can get a reduced price There is a very good selection for breakfast 
367548,Royal Ramblas, It s very noisy between the rooms sometimes I could not sleep properly The beds are not comfortable , The location is great at the beginning of La Ramplas Clean hotel and good staff 
367549,Royal Ramblas, The heat It was only about 27 degrees but felt like 40 I will time it better next time and come a month earlier It is a shame that most of the shops close on Sundays, The Hotel location tops all The staff were friendly and ready and willing to answer our questions We found plenty to do and see and saw everything connected to Gaudi What a genius The Cathedral is a must I could have spent a whole day in there I plan to return 
367550,Royal Ramblas, The attached restaurant which gave 10 discount to residents of the hotel I m afraid to say was not good at all We only had one meal there which was dreadful and therefore did not eat there again , Breakfast was excellent Extremely good choice which covered all nationalities Also the position of the hotel on Ramblas was so convenient we were really pleased that we had booked that particular hotel 
367551,Royal Ramblas, The staff barely managed to acknowledge or speak to us Apart from the porter who was friendly We have also tried to contact the hotel via email twice and they ve not even bothered to reply to us We ve stayed at other hotels in Barcelona who were much friendlier and higher standard of hotel , The location is fantastic Right on la ramblas
367552,Royal Ramblas, There could have been a Bar in there for a late night cap after a busy day sight seeing , Fabulous location great selection of Breakfast items Comfy bed and very helpful staff 
367553,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, location is amazing if you want to stay in the heart of barcelona you have to choose this hotel the room is size is perfect and everything was amazing
367554,Royal Ramblas, Room size to be bigger Room to include couches to sit on Single beds to be far from each other instead of being closely connected More variety for breakfast, The location was perfect 
367555,Royal Ramblas, They have some rooms with less facilities no drawer But they changed that room , The location is excellent in the heart of city center So for tourism this is excellent location Nice stuff very friendly 
367556,Royal Ramblas, Nothing comes to mind , The staff were professional and supportive They exceeded our expectations of service by doing little things like Booked a shuttle van without fuss Offered to print out train tickets Provided extra towels for our children who were showering and preparing to fly back home whilst we remained Stored a large volume of luggage for us This hotel is also in a great location an easy central spot We would definately go back again 
367557,Royal Ramblas, The Hotel had heavy works going on the floor above me early in the morning and I wasn t notified of that upon my arrival otherwise I would have requested a room change It was impossible to sleep The next day same thing heavy works above and a cleaner was washing the floor outside of my room with a very noisy machine early in the morning , The location was perfect The interior was nice and modern 
367558,Royal Ramblas, Very loud until late evening even with a room with windows to the back Not very helpfull people at the reception the rest from the hotel stuff was very nice , Nice Breakfast but not before 07 30am Central located for shopping 
367559,Royal Ramblas, the bathroom in a standard room is too small a for an adult the wall between the shower and toilet should be demolished for more space , the hotel location and room mood and feel is really modern and nice front office team really friendly and helpful 
367560,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The location was great the hotel policy is clearly careful with their pennies no bottled water and no tissues in the room bearing in mind this is a 4 star hotel 
367561,Royal Ramblas, My confirmed booking is changed several time even one day before arrival the breakfast collection is poor The room facilities are damaged such as toilet door safety box , The location The staff are friendly 
367562,Royal Ramblas, Out of the five hotels I ve stayed in during this trip I d rate this hotel s staff to be the least helpful Nothing really bad though , The room is very comfortable and spacey It also has great shower and full sized bath tube The location is right in the middle of Ramblas 
367563,Royal Ramblas, At night time it could sometimes be a little nosy but it was ok , We were absolutely delighted with this hotel The location was perfect So central to lots of the major attractions The staff were very friendly and helpful we will definetly stay here again when we come back to Barcelona 
367564,Royal Ramblas, i paid 1 163 61 instead of 1 107 61 which booking com sent me I paid 56 more than i booked he asked me whether i want to pay in dollars or euros i said dollars that s what happened I don t understand why they charged more this kind of things never happened to me before I usually pay hotel charges before i got there this is a bad idea I feel bad ,No Positive
367565,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The staff was very plesent and helpfull with every thing we needed Very good location nice rooms felt new and fresh The hotel has a modern design we deffinatly enjoyed our stay 
367566,Royal Ramblas, The fact that going via booking com website cost 50 euros a night more than if I rocked up to the hotel on the day and paid No facilities such as pool gym Rooms smelt like bleach, Great location
367567,Royal Ramblas, not very comfortable bed and there was quite a lot of noise from other rooms and the wifi was rubbish, Location and friendliness of some of the staff and parking
367568,Royal Ramblas, no little bottles of bath wash shampoo etc just one liquid for everything concierage service not great, room spacious and very clean location directly on Las Ramblas great for exploring and walking to buses for sightseeing and the airport tickets for 2 to airport about 5
367569,Royal Ramblas, Rooms are adequate but could be larger , Excellent location booked two interconnecting rooms for us and kids Breakfast included and was nice Staff friendly Rooms clean
367570,Royal Ramblas, Beds too small and I m only 5ft9in Airconditioner wasn t working No international plug points Wifi was very slow Check in took forever Build quality of everything was poor The walls are paper thin The hotel smells musty , I d never stay there again 
367571,Royal Ramblas, There was not bar or restaurant We were woken very early in the morning by other guests returning tothere rooms The floors are notinsulated and so you can hear all of the foot steps , The location is exceptional if you want to be amongst it all in Barcelona This hotel also has its own parking which was important for us 
367572,Royal Ramblas, I didnt like that its a very modern hotel and that after booking and going i found that the price went down on booking dot com to 50 , I loved the location mainly and the breakfast room
367573,Royal Ramblas, The breakfast was poor the lobby was small no where to set and rest also we had to remaind them to change the bed cover , The location of the Hotel
367574,Royal Ramblas, Speed of the service , Location location and double glass door Right in the center of the action of Las Rambla Perfect for family who wants to explore the city
367575,Royal Ramblas, Didn t realise it was such a small hotel understandable considering the location but would have enjoyed a swimming pool No complaints otherwise, Location was excellent Staff very helpful Lovely spacious rooms very clean 
367576,Royal Ramblas, It is a bit overrated this is because about the location no security at the door where anyone can enter and is not staying in the hotel , I liked the location so much it is quite nice hotel but with no facilities Breakfast is ok
367577,Royal Ramblas, I asked for a double room with two separate beds yet when we arrived to the room it was one double bed I went to ask a reception and they kindly moved our stuff to another room for when we arrived back When we arrived to the new room it was one double bed and a sofa Secondly there were faulty plug sockets next to the mirror which were falling apart and could be considered as a hazard Additionally only certain lights in the room were working , The location of this hotel is great it is perfect for those who want to stay central Very clean throughout the hotel 
367578,Royal Ramblas, The Hotel charged my credit card in USD even though I was quoted in Euros Also I found out that breakfast was 10 Euro per person even though booking com charged me 18 00 Euro per person Not good , Excellent location Modern hotel
367579,Royal Ramblas, You can find cheaper and similar otel but you shouldn t do your reservation last minute like us , Location is wonderfull it s in the centre of Barcelona Staff was very helpfull It was very clean Breakfast includes also very different food 
367580,Royal Ramblas, Short stay Strange smell in the hallway Wifi slow But hardly much negative , Location location location Very very nice staff very helpful Clean room Good breakfast and nice seating area Will come back hopefully 
367581,Royal Ramblas, generally Ramblas area is not child friendly at night Too many prostitutes, great location friendly and helpful staff shopping areas all around us Big supermarket just beside te hotel
367582,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Clean comfortable air conditioned and sound proof rooms which we felt it was a necessity staying in The Royal Ramblas Great location great service and very polite understanding and friendly staff Would stay there again 
367583,Royal Ramblas, Nothing it was perfect , Brilliant location Beautiful hotel very very clean Staff were extremely friendly I loved this little hotel and cant wait to return We also stayed at the W Hotel but i much prefered Royal Ramblas The Breakfast was very good We had a small double and although it was cosy it was perfectly formed and super clean in fact i think it was brand new everything smelled so clean and new Well definatley return 
367584,Royal Ramblas, Apart from the lady who checked us in we found the front desk staff were rather short and abrupt not what we would describe as friendly However the ladies who cleaned the rooms were very helpful , The location was excellent and the breakfast was great
367585,Royal Ramblas, We had stayed there before this times the rooms we got were quite a bit smaller than the ones we had in the past so that was disappointing The English television options were not good it was News or nothing Its true that we weren t there to watch TV but when you re winding down its a nice option to have , The breakfast was great Simple but lots of options The location was phenomenal You just had to walk out the front door and you were in the thick of things Frankly you could have walked in any direction and you d find yourself in an oasis of shops and cafes 
367586,Royal Ramblas, Nothing really Few amenities like face tissue would be great but are bound to be amiss at a four star Highly recommend the hotel, Great people at the reception Rooms have all the basic things and a fantastic coffee machine We had Ramblas facing rooms which were sound proof can t count on nights with fire crackers and events but still pretty great Good location close to the square and gothic quarters and bars and some shopping Eixempia with slightly better food options and gaudi s architecture is not far if you enjoy some walking Also great for shopping Crazy amounts of people just under the hotel and yet the new age comforts of the hotel are a welcoming change off the road As is the Bubbly and other goodies for breakfast
367587,Royal Ramblas, Very expensive but had an excellent location , Room was small but had good sound proofing from the street below Fresh fruit was left in the room for us which was very nice Room was clean and good air conditioning Metro access just outside and airport bus service 5 minutes walk away 
367588,Royal Ramblas, Toilet tad too tiny , Excellent location right in the heart of Ramblas Good to shop then go back to the room to rest and continue shopping after being refreshed 
367589,Royal Ramblas, Service at dining area could have been better glasses and silver ware were empty at times and some breakfast items were empty , Bed was comfortable and the room was quiet 
367590,Royal Ramblas, I booked a room to stay for 6 hours untill the time of my flight since we have a kid with us Unfortunetly We were not allowed to check in early so we had to walk around for 3 hours with a kid and come back again The elevators are tiny and the bill boys are women I felt bad letting them carry my lauggage , The room was spacious and clean the location is perfect The staff were friendly and nice and booked us a taxi aat the exact time we needed 
367591,Royal Ramblas, Your ads on booking sites state you provide airport shuttle service at a cost which was why I reserved my room with you However the taxi service in BCN is very good so it did not matter in th en , The breakfast is excellent and reading lounge a great spot to people watch The location cannot be better 
367592,Royal Ramblas, the breakfast variety was very poor and the cleanliness of the beds Both my husband and I were bitten by bed bugs unfortunately and they were not comfortable The conceirge service was hardly there , the location was very central
367593,Royal Ramblas, We paid extra for a royal room which was directly over the adjoining restaurant so woken at 6 00am every morning by staff dragging chairs and tables about Also general toilets are on the same floor so constantly disturbed by inconsiderate guests talking and doors closing late at night Whoever designed the layout wants shooting Not withstanding this we would stay in this hotel again but on a higher floor , Breakfast was great very helpful staff particularly Santiago on site parking 
367594,Royal Ramblas, There aren t a little space for the gym and the room Keys didn t work very well and wifi very slow for upload the image on social the network and send email , The employed very friendly the room very clean ad price for the breakfast very good I ll come back very soon in this hotel
367595,Royal Ramblas, The drink ordering service to the lounge area was non existent which was a great pity because the first floor area looks out over Las Ramblas and would have been ideal to relax in but you couldn t get anyone to turn up and serve you At times queuing in the reception was excessive The overall experience suggested that they were short staffed but nonetheless those on duty always had a smile and were helpful The hotel owners should invest in delivering a better level of staffing so that reality meets with the expectation of guests, Contemporary decor centrally located fabulous breakfast bar and great staff
367596,Royal Ramblas, The guests being really noisy and disruptive when they came in very late at night Shower pressure very poor Certainly not value for money, The closeness to La Rambla
367597,Royal Ramblas, Room Services was noisy and they open the door even if there is DND and this happen to me at least 3 times during my stay Iron board you cant keep it you have to use it and immediately return it back , Only Location
367598,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The staff were overly nice and did their best to help all of the time and we used their help several times a day The breakfast is very good very generous and there is a wide selection The location is awesome right next to Catalunya square our window was on the ramblas but we heard little of the commotion 
367599,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The staff were exceptional They were extremely helpful The location is right in the middle of the action but room was completely soundproof Wonderful in every way 
367600,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location for visiting all the main attractions in the centre It is also a minute walk to the nearest Metro station The hotel has a great bar restaurant if you feel too exhausted after a busy day to find a local restaurant to eat in 
367601,Royal Ramblas, The room we had didn t have a view it was just overlooking some walls But for what we paid for the room we didn t mind , Fantastic hotel in a perfect location 
367602,Royal Ramblas, Sound proofing inside the hotel could have been better No shower gel which should be standard in a four star hotel , The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of storage space Good air conditioning Good bathroom with plenty of hot water good shower and towels changed every day 
367603,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Again the front Desk that is most helpfull and kind and I could say the entire team supporting the management in order to keep this excellent place full of delight and wellness 
367604,Royal Ramblas, We had asked for a double bed but when we got to the room we had twins They did give us a different room We were taking a siesta and we had a maid come in to our room We immediatley called the front desk We were not happy,No Positive

367607,Royal Ramblas, Thin walls could hear everything Breakfast only from 7 30am No bathroom separate toilet and shower cubicles , The staff in particular the male receptionist on duty late evening on 14th April went out of his way to enable me to see the last few minutes of the LFC vs Dortmund game I will be forever grateful 
367608,Royal Ramblas, Very noisy and extremely small bathroom we get two separate beds while asking for one not good coffee express poor breakfast , Very good localisation and friendly staff
367609,Royal Ramblas, That my stay wasn t long enough, The front desk was first class always greeting us daily and swiftly assisting with check in The upgrade even though we paid for it was well respected that we got offered it Cleaning staff were polite and werent intrusive when cleaning the room The view on to Las Ramblas was amazing from our room and with the window shut you couldn t here anything especially with the 2 Windows it provides for you Definitely will go back again
367610,Royal Ramblas, It was supposed to be a double room but had the dimensions of a single room with a double bed squeezed in No table no chair no bathroom shower and toilet cubicles with wash basin in room Why do non smoking hotels never advertise the fact on the web site I would not have booked had I known , Coffee making facilities in the room disposable slippers clean good shower
367611,Royal Ramblas, Breakfast pretty average Drinking water should be available each night in the bedrooms Rather expensive for the facilities on offer, Excellent location and helpful staff

367614,Royal Ramblas, There was such a strong smell of air freshener in the lobby and the elevator So strong that it gave me a head ache , Great location on the Ramblas Close to the Gothic Quarter and not too far from the beach I never saw a bar to visit there and it was an effort to ask for ice Staff was pleasant 
367615,Royal Ramblas, Stayed in a superior room view rambla and it is very small All the hotel areas are small including the breakfast area and lounges the one on the first floor is shared with a public Italian restaurant and they fill it with tables if necessary Relaxing at the lounge drinking a coup of tea with a view rapidly transforms in drinking a tea with a view and noisy people eating next to you Definitely a place in a strategic location just for sleep with relative comfort but too expensive for what it offers Poor Quality price , location
367616,Royal Ramblas, Rooms not isolated where you can hear the noise from next room and the carry doors No free water in the room accept for the first day arrival , Location and smiley staff

367628,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, I liked the location of the hotel however it was not up to standard The bedding was old and tingy smelling the blankets wer outdated and the towels There was no iron provided which I found absurd as it was due to health and safely apparently I would not recommend this hotel as it provides basic facilities for a 4 hotel
367629,Royal Ramblas, House keeping was often slow to assign the room to be cleaned One occasion I had to ask reception for special assistance as room had been left for six hours without being cleaned A great job by the maids everyday however , Great location in the heart of Barcelona Extremely friendly and helpful staff Wonderful large room overlooking La Rambla Not noisy though as front glass was thick and double glazed Just a great place to stay in a wonderful city 
367630,Royal Ramblas, An iron would have been handy and while not a deal breaker i do like a bath However the shower was good , Excellent location The room was well equipped There was a good selection at the breakfast buffet and the dining room was large with a good view of las Ramblas 
367631,Royal Ramblas, I had to call the room service in order to ask the cleaning lady to clean the toilet at our arrival since she didn t do it properly Poor internet connection , Location Location Location Stuf was very helpful and always supporting 
367632,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Excellent double glazing meant we had a great view of the ramblas but no noise Huge breakfast choice and my favourite tea vanilla rooibos tea and coffee in the room was a nice surprise which wasn t mentioned in my booking info 
367633,Royal Ramblas, it was all perfect, the bed and pillows were a bit to firm everything was perfectly clean food at breakfast was 5 star quality and assortment the staff was informed and friendly not a single complaint here we plan to stay at Royal Rambla on our next visit and plan to stay for several days longer Wonderful location too
367634,Royal Ramblas, The walls are very thin and I could easily hear everyone else opening and closing doors all night , Spotlessly clean and good sized rooms neither of which are common in Barcelona 
367635,Royal Ramblas, The beds, Bed was two twins put together as a couple we couldn t get too close or the beds start rolling away kinda funny Other than that no complaints if you want to experience las ramblas this is it Right in the middle of everything hotel service on point the restaurant on location has excellent salads and pizza 4 5 out of 5 
367636,Royal Ramblas, To have my room not made at 16 00 h when I had left it at 9a m They were correct though they offered me a tea while I was waiting to have it made , The friendly personnel 
367637,Royal Ramblas, No concierge slow front desk lack of adequate number of staff poor quality standard rooms unless you ask for a normal room Hardly 4 star , Breakfast is good but not the best Location is perfect Obviously there are many other options in the same area 
367638,Royal Ramblas, had to ask for room to be cleaned may have been an over site by cleaning staff but still a shame , the comfort of room was second to none and the view from our supperior room of la ramblas was fantastic

367642,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, The room was quiet and spacious right on the Ramblas I m a regular visitor to Barcelona and this is one of the best value for money places I have stayed at 
367643,Royal Ramblas, The Royal Rooms were not as advertised and seemed to be small and a little pokey It was claimed there was a sitting space and showed an integrated sofa and minibar However a single chair and a minibar ticked in a cupboard that could not be opened were not up to scratch Also the hotel is directly above the train lines and in the morning the hotel did shake with the trains passing underground Really make the upper floor the premium rooms and maybe plan out the rooms a little better , The location was ideal and the desk seemed to be always manned and supported 
367644,Royal Ramblas, A bar had a late flight and stored suitcases for the day but would have been nice to have a drink at hotel before leaving also I like to go to the bar whilst wife is getting ready to go out of an evening, Great location and no complaints with anything in hotel
367645,Royal Ramblas, Very bad technical mistake they have the duct of toilets inside the room So u can hear every single person flushing his toilet so it s a bit not nice I think it would be difficult to change duct place cause it requires total change of toilets but they can do noise insulation for these ducts , Location is more then perfect Stuff r nice Breakfast is perfect and fresh And some poeple will understand this They have a BD D
367646,Royal Ramblas, Staff polite but not particularly friendly Breakfast is not worth the money but great views for too easy to go to a local cafe and enjoy fresh churros for breakfast, Straight on the better end of ramblas next to the metro and second away from placa de catalunya it s the ideal location Amazing shower and clean all round

367654,Royal Ramblas, The breakfast in the hotel was overpriced at 15 euros Room a little noisy as overlooking Main Street , The location was excellent and near to the tourist bus starter point plenty of interesting sites within walking distance 
367655,Royal Ramblas, We were booked in for a double bed but the first night had two singles This was put right for the other nights but no apology for the error was made, Great location friendly and helpful staff excellent breakfasts 
367656,Royal Ramblas, carry a multi pin adapter if you are an international tourist hotel seems to not keep any to assist the guests , dead center of the tourist area good connectivity to the metro and tour pickups friendly staff good atmosphere
367657,Royal Ramblas, Wish we had been informed that building work was on going at this hotel Hammering and drilling every day until 6pm Also our room was supposed to be soundproofed We could hear people in the rooms on either side of ours using the bathroom and conversations on the telephone We were offered another room on the first floor opposite the public toilets and with more noise from the Metro Wish we had chosen another hotel Very disappointed , Location and staff were excellent 
367658,Royal Ramblas,No Negative, Easy accessible to the main attractions on the Las Ramblas and public transport The local cafe s bars and small businesses were in the adjacent streets making walking around very secure I ll go there again anytime

367676,Royal Ramblas, the reception is far from being friendly I think they ignore the fact that they are serving customers they know they have a good location and they don t care if the customers are happy or not There is always someone new who will select the hotel for its location very poor welcome service not even saying welcome or smiling once after calling 3 times that there is no toilet paper in the room instead of apologizing the answer from the receptionist is we usually have toilet paper in the rooms complaining about the blocked sink old towels everyday but not getting an apology during check out no thank you or any means of conversation which makes you leave with good feelings We felt like we were not customers but we owe them 1000 and we had to live with long faces and bad service because we haven t paid our debt on time breakfast is expensive no real cofffee but still better than any alternative on La Rambla breakfast places all in all not 4 star service not even hostel level but good location , location is very practical for accessing all touristic attractions

367681,Royal Ramblas, The room is very small and facility is old The corridor on my floor had very strong chemical smell Would be good if the staffs reminded me that there is a EUR 7 surcharge by the taxi driver if call for a taxi , The location is excellent easy walk to everywhere close to shops restaurants and Metro The staffs are very friendly The breakfast is fairly nice and with sufficient varieties 
367682,Royal Ramblas, Housekeeping needs more attention from management as the room organizing not always the best Breakfast needs more diversity, Location Hospitality of Staff
367683,Royal Ramblas, Nothing is bad here but the signature room didnt have a bathtub the delux room had a tiny one you barely can squeez in I wish they had an in house kitchen for room service and a sofa or a comfy seat in the room rather than the plastic one , Location on the La Rmblas near to Pla a De Catalunya the shopping areas and cafes and restaurants A couple of Kms to the Marina area or a short taxi ride for about 7 8 It s quite in the room although you re facing the busiest street in Barcelona Also Thanks to the friendly staff Rogers at the reception who was so helpful during my stay

367687,Royal Ramblas, Air conditioning in room wasn t working Had a rather poor night sleep and both my girlfriend and I were badly bitten by mosquitos in the room overnight , Very good location Great watching the world going by on Barcelona s greatest street The Royal Lounge is a relaxing space

367697,Royal Ramblas, For a 4 Hotel you would expect walls to be a little thicker Being situated in a room on a low floor and right near the lift we found the room noisy We also had what I pressume was a maintenance guy open our door walk STRAIGHT in WITHOUT KNOCKING Obviously making a mistake quickly shut the door but I found this EXTREMELY distressing all evening thinking someone else may walk in at any point All in all though Royal Ramblas is far off a bad hotel there are much better hotels situated close on Las Ramblas with better facilities and thicker walls for the same price and therefore better value for your money We know because we moved after the first night less money same star but with a roof top pool , Great location thats it 
367698,Royal Ramblas, Wish it came with free breakfast , Loved the location as it is right in the middle of la rambla It is situated close to metro stations and plenty of restaurants to choose from The hotel itself was really modern and up to date Lovely staff who always happy to help

367704,Royal Ramblas, Nothing , Management and staff were excellent position perfect and close to all the action They also offer use of a personal WiFi for 6 Euro a day which made life easier and to be able to use Google Maps to find places 
367705,Royal Ramblas, The room as there is no privacy for the bath room The breakfast menue is exteremly poor and it is not clean at all Flys around the food all the times Equipments are very dirty as I need to wash them with hot water every time I need to eat WI Fi signal is very weak in the room and we need to go in the lobby every time we need strong signal Wi Fi, Good locaiton at the beginning of the Ramlas road
