168516,H tel L Echiquier Op ra Paris MGallery by Sofitel, No complaints , We were traveling with our 2 kids 10 and 12 and booked the room with 2 full bathrooms It was perfect The bathrooms are large by hotel standards and the hotel was recently renovated so everything still was relatively new The price reflects the slightly off the beaten path location but you can reach great places in a 10 15 minute walk Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends
