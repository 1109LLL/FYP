498819,Hotel Vilamar , Rooms with windows facing the quad are horrible One needs to keep the curtains closed to keep he gazes from guests exiting the elevators out but with the curtains closed the room is so dark one does not even know what time of the day it is Other rooms are probably much better , Location
498820,Hotel Vilamar , A pair of my earrings went missing from my room which I had left on the desk The Hotel Manager would not do anything in terms of helping and didnt speak to the staff properly She promised me a new pair which she then changed her mind about She said different things to me everyday Apparently the cleaning lady was new and even though it might have been an accident that she threw them away anything the guest leaves on the table should not be touched There was also NO safe in the room The fridge didnt work either and the sink in the bathroom kept getting blocked The floor was dusty as well We pointed this out to the Manager but again nothing was being done I paid a lot of money for this Hotel and I lost a pair of nice earrings , The Restuarant staff and the Reception staff were all very very friendly Breakfast was good as well The location was very good and close to shops public transport and restuarants 
498821,Hotel Vilamar , The Mattress is not comfortable at all It makes backache There is no safe deposit box in the room small thing but makes a big difference but downstairs by the reception which is annoying to keep going there Old TV with Spanish channels only, The location is great Very friendly stuff Very clean room Good air condition I would have given 9 if they fix the issues with the mattress and safe deposit box
498822,Hotel Vilamar , the only thing we thought was funny my daughter and i laughed was that there was a glass door to the bathroom and also a glass door to the shower so just hope you are close knit family when you stay the walls seemed thin we could hear water in the pipes randomly BUT we still slept great and didn t really bother us hardly any noise from other guests or voices so maybe just water pipes , my 9 y ol daughter and i stayed for one night between train trips 10 euro max taxi ride from train and to get a quick view of barcelona its nicely located the night we arrived we took the glass elevator up the Arena of Barcelona and had amazing 360 degrees views which was all literally 1 5 blocks from the hotel next to the Placa espana perfect the room was super nice clean stylish fun my daughter thought it was gorgeous we shared a full we did noted we heard running water from showers above us but that was no biggie My child also loved the smell of the hotel when we walked in each tiime maybe a vanilla essence breakfast was super nice as well so many options the check in and check out staff were both super kind efficient and helpful thank you Hotel Vilamari
498823,Hotel Vilamar , The internal rooms mean you have to close curtains for privacy Lose all idea of the time of day Restaurant has a basic menu , Good location a short walk to hop and off bus and excellent food shops in the Arena once a bull fighting arena Staff very helpful Very good breakfast menu 
498824,Hotel Vilamar , To improve the rooms the hotel could add a small trash can under the desk and implement reading lights that don t get hot so quickly , The hotel is in an excellent location near to two Metro Stations Epanya and Rocafort Las Arenas shopping mall restaurants and quite a few 24 hour grocery stores Also nearby are the amazing MNAC art museum Magic Fountains and Poble Espanyol Room was on the smallish side but clean and adequate and all staff Joao Paula and others at the front desk were very friendly helpful and spoke English The rooms do not have coffee or teapots but they provided me with one for my entire stay and assisted with directions and reservations to attractions Room service breakfast was prompt and generous 
498825,Hotel Vilamar , Very small rooms The reception was really unhelpful The location is far from the action area and night activities Strange payments Have to pay a deposit for the safe box key Have to pay a deposit for an electricity converter when we arrived we were told that no available rooms and suddenly 2 rooms got free they lied didn t like the attitude of most of the reception team there are a lot of other places which are much better in Barcelona , Modern rooms
498826,Hotel Vilamar , Room up in price think this is widespread in Barcelona Very slow to clean and make up our room on the last day not so bad other days Not too easy to control room temperature in a heat wave , Friendly helpful staff We could check in and go to the room early A couple of extra things we required were provided quickly and cheerfully Lovely fresh breakfast as usual with super efficient guy looking after everything Good selection of newspapers to read Comfortable room though not huge and good bathroom excellent shower Ideal location 
498827,Hotel Vilamar , In my room window faced the atrium I had to keep curtains all the time due to glass walls in the corridors Bathroom is not organized well I had to skip over the toilet to enter the bathtub , Good connections to the airport and the city vicinity of the city center The staff is very helpful and friendly I liked the breakfast buffet 
498828,Hotel Vilamar , Shower was hard to get in and out of and flooded the floor but I m just being picky to be honest , Great location and the staff were excellent very friendly and helpful Room very clean and breakfast was lovely Outside area also nice to sit in with a beer 
498829,Hotel Vilamar , Doors slammed quite loudly and we were woken at 5am by people having loud conversations in the corridor , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
498830,Hotel Vilamar , Avoid room 110 there must have been a main pipe going through our room as I was awoken each morning around 5am by the sound of water rushing through the room day one I thought there was a leak in the room But presumably it was the sound of people showering , Staff were really helpful 24 hour reception Location was brilliant a 2 minute walk to the metro station and only 10 minutes through to Las Rambles 
498831,Hotel Vilamar , Mattresses were uncomfortable as a two star hotel I booked a economy twin bedroom I got a room which was so small with a 140 cm bed for two person I do not have any sleeping problem even in bad situation but at hotel Vilamari with expectation of a four star hotel I did not sleep at first night Staffs changed the room day after and we got to sleep in another room with two beds but the same quality The first room was also noisy Cleaning staffs did not clean the floor during our stay Towels were also old Bathroom room is probably nice but not comfortable It is not a valuable deal , Staffs were available and friendly It is easy to get to the hotel by public transport There are many shops and good bakeries near the hotel You can find some good fish and chips bar in 300 meter 
498832,Hotel Vilamar , I was utterly disappointed at the lack of staffing I sat for over an hour in the sunny garden terrace and couldn t find a single member of staff at the bar at any stage to buy a drink I was in town on business with periods of time between meetings and I picked this hotel for it s convenient location and nice outdoors area thinking I could relax here In the end I gave up waiting for anyone to materialise and went to my room to order room service thinking this would be quicker The waitress who delivered my food was lovely but my meal came wrong By this time I was so hungry I accepted it The lack of staff happened again the next day , The hotel is smart and the room was perfect for a business trip 
498833,Hotel Vilamar , The bar was closed in the evening, All the staff was extremely friendly and helpful too We were given a kettle for our room after we asked for one as we like a cuppa early in the morning and this did not stop us from enjoying our afternoon tea downstairs by the bar which has very reasonable prices We ll be back for sure as the hotel is very central near metro Placa Espanya 
498834,Hotel Vilamar , Would have liked a safe in the room rather than at reception , Great location minutes walk from P Espanya where Metro was for quickness down to centre and beaches Beautiful buildings 
498835,Hotel Vilamar , I would say the bar on the ground floor needed an extra member of staff or one staying at the bar as took a while to be served That my only advise to a great stay at this hotel, Staff very helpful and the rooms were clean and tidy everyday The way the staff treated us was amazing and will highly recommend to anyone visiting Barcelona
498836,Hotel Vilamar , When you have window on the street you may hear the noise from the outside even when the window is closed , The hotel is well located in neighborhood of Placa Espagna You can access easily metro lines on Placa Espagna as well the aerobus which goes directly to airport Within 20 minutes walking distance you can be in the Parallel area which is famous of the resturants and tapas bars Within 30 minutes walk you can be on Placa Catalunya which is the center of Barcelona Room was clean and staff really helpful 
498837,Hotel Vilamar , Staff was rude the girl was not very pleasant talking with me No polite at all speaking Spanish and saying rude things about my manner Just because we are coming from a different country no one should just presum that we can be spoke to like that because we don t speak their own language And to her surprise I do speak the language and am very disappointed to see that if I wasn t speaking the language she would go on like that The other girl that looked after us after we spoke with that staff member was very good understanding and appologied ,No Positive
498838,Hotel Vilamar , No closeup mirror for makeup application Only 2 outlets available for charging cellphones , Great location near the Placa Espanya minutes from Line 1 and Line 3 metro stations Tucked away on a quiet street Arena Mall only 5 minutes walk with shops and restaurants Hotel staff great at orienting us to the area and town Very good breakfast 
498839,Hotel Vilamar , No drinks making facility in room kettle tea and coffee etc Limited tv channels , Friendly staff clean and smart easy access to city mini fridge free wifi 
498840,Hotel Vilamar , quite standard hotel you can find same kind of hotel everywhere around Europe cities so not so particular or spanish , slendid beakfast everything we need even fresh fruit collection Very good coffee 
498841,Hotel Vilamar , Non smoking room smelled like smoke coming from other rooms TV in our room did not work Hot water in shower wasn t always working, Friendly staff
498842,Hotel Vilamar , Nothing to complain about really , The room was clean and had everything we needed it was especially handy to have free bottled water each day The breakfast was nice with a good selection all nice and fresh 
498843,Hotel Vilamar , we heard everything that has happened in the next room every word shower snoring it was quite uncomfortable and if you are a light sleeper it might be a problem , Nice and clean hotel Very close to metro station 
498844,Hotel Vilamar , Door doesn t close properly so bathroom is almost open onto bedroom big gap glass door The bedroom and bathroom are all poorly isolated so it can be noisy if neighbours are loud , Good value decent location for going out in Poble Sec area or using public transport 15min walk from train station 
498845,Hotel Vilamar , The room has no aminities no iron in the room you have to go behind the reception to iron There are no variety for Breakfast And no concierge, Location only
498846,Hotel Vilamar , It was OK but I expected more from a 4 star hotel Our window was facing an interior concrete wall so we had no view at night a machine was noisy outside the room was quite small and the bathroom door was seethrough and not sealed plus the wardrobe shelves were dusty , The breakfast was very very good and the staff was very friendly and helpful Modern bathroom excellent location it was nice that we were able to store our luggage in the lobby after check out Overall it was a good experience 
498847,Hotel Vilamar , There was no electric socket next to the bed You can only charge your electronic device by turning on the main light in the room Somehow the electric sockets are working in parallel In order to charge your electronic device you have to keep the lights turned on for a few hours Door card won t help If you turn off the lights you won t be able to charge your phone, Location is great and quiet for a traveller with business like focus Internet is working smooth fast without any flaw Close to the Subway nearby cabs Staff is extremely helpfull nice they helped me solve any questions that I had in mind
498848,Hotel Vilamar , Reception staff could be a little more friendly The staff did not want to be interactive with you it does nt work in the hospitality sector Asked for Tickets for Metro could not tell us where we could get it from Did not inform us about the Barcelona Day Card Room was small and the bed even smaller Went to their Restaurant to have dinner Very Bland Food Chef forgot to put salt in the Soup etc etc No smile on anybody s faces right from the time of check in till check out with the exception of the breakfast lady , Location that was the only likeable point Also the lady in charge for the breakfast very friendly unlike many other people working in the Hotel 
498849,Hotel Vilamar , sonorisation between rooms not brilliant The room was smaller than we were expecting and there are no balconies although at least we could open the window We were generally pleased but think that the 4 stars are a little deceptive , Very close to metro bus stop aerobus stop bathroom freebies include toothbrush toothpaste comb razor shaving cream and the usual 
498850,Hotel Vilamar , The beds were too small and no extra blankets The towels were very old and well worn but were clean Very few electric plugs for charging appliances Need more info in room about surrounding area but guess that there is plenty of info in reception Breakfast was until 12 Wow but we arrived at 10 00am and food was used up and not replaced so be aware The nicer bread ran out and the eggs too and it would have been good to have been offered low fat fresh milk , We arrived very early from our cruise ship but this was not a problem and we were given our room straight away The staff at reception were wonderful and very helpful The rooms were modern but the bathroom whilst looked good wasn t very practical clear sink The door to the bathroom wasn t sound proof and the fan in the bathroom didn t work so steamy mirror but shower was lovely and powerful
498851,Hotel Vilamar , The bed was ok but not the best i slept on personally i do not like spring mattress This was the only disappoint but not really effecting on the global value , Excellent location near Plaza de Espana old fira de Barcelona and arena mall with access to metro red line at 2 stops from new fira Gran Via The hotel is very nice and you can even find the Gazzetta dello Sport best Italian sport newspaper in the hall Pay TV sport games can be watched free on the hall to socialize Good breakfast with plenty of good jamon and on pocket meal demand Staff extremely kind and smiley 
498852,Hotel Vilamar , The room was very small We could not open the window in the room You have to climb over the toilet to get into the shower The bed was very uncomfortable , Very friendly accommodating staff 
498853,Hotel Vilamar , The walls were thin We could hear people outside very clearly The internet connection wasn t always consistent , Helpful staff Lively location and very close to the Magic Fountain show 
498854,Hotel Vilamar , Only one channel on the TV worked and the remote didn t work but we weren t bothered so didn t ask for it to be fixed Also no safe in the rooms which we found odd , Staff were friendly and helpful room was comfortable stylish and a decent size Great location quiet neighbourhood just 5 minutes walk from pl Espanya metro station so very easy to get around the city and 10 minutes walk from Parc de Montjuic s stunning views 
498855,Hotel Vilamar ,No Negative, Good lighting for reading Comfortable bed pillows Good breakfast Inside and outside areas for breakfast Front desk was helpful By Spanish square and easy to walk to restaurants and shopping 
498856,Hotel Vilamar , Didn t like the fact that we couldn t open our windows and curtains Not much cupboard space, We would definitely request a room with an outside view should we visit this hotel again Our room was very small and our window faced the tiny courtyard which looked straight into the lift area so we could not open the curtains The bathroom was also tiny but at least they did squeeze in a bath which is great The location of this hotel is close to the Plaza De Espana which includes the Arena shopping centre and within walking distance of the train station and airport bus Staff were very helpful There was no safe in the room but a lockup safe provided with own access near the reception The price was very reasonable compared to other hotels we stayed in 
498857,Hotel Vilamar , There was just one electrical socket available in the room and one in the bathroom That is totally insufficient nowadays when most people travel with phones cameras laptops tablets etc The window didn t isolate very well the noise of the street in front of the hotel The room was not very spacious and it could use a bit of repair It was inevitable to splash some water when taking a shower and since there was no drain on the bathroom floor that water would remain there until the next day when the cleaning lady came , The room was clean and the hotel offered an excellent breakfast The location was good just a few minutes walk to Plaza de Espana The staff were both professional and friendly 
498858,Hotel Vilamar , For ironing you have to go to the reception no room service , Nice hotel with easy and quick check in decent breakfast with fresh juices every morning and very good aircon system 
498859,Hotel Vilamar , There were 2 girls at reception maybe they are new I would like to suggest that should be more friendly and attentive , The breakfast was excellent The room was clean without odors Towels white and clean Easy access Good wifi 
498860,Hotel Vilamar ,No Negative, The staff was very helpful when we got there early Very accommodating It is small hotel but well appointed We spent one night on our way back home Perfect for that Dont think I would use for a long term vacation The neighborhood is okay but it is a short taxi ride to many sights 
498861,Hotel Vilamar , The price for breakfast went up to 14 euros And it used to be 8 Its almost 80 more expensive now I dont think the inflation rate is so high in Spain I suggest to have breakfast outside of the hotel I wish there would be an iron in the room , nice hotel I liked the location close to plaza de espana which is not so crowded like other places in the city and close to the monjuic park I have no complains about the hotel During check in I had a very nice und helpfull lady in the reception 
498862,Hotel Vilamar , some dirty towels from the woman that clean the room was found when we enter the room , very helpful reception staff good wifi nice rooms very good location 
498863,Hotel Vilamar , Room especially the bathroom was tiny found it very difficult to move around or simply just get out of the shower , The reception staff was extremely helpful we really appreciated all they ve done for us 
498864,Hotel Vilamar , The gym was tiny and the room was smaller than expected according to the pictures , When we entered to the lobby it had a very nice smell very good first impression Lovation is excellent We could walk from the hotel to every destination we wanted Sorroundings were very nice with good restaurant amazing patisseries and 8 10mins walk with the luggages to the bus stop that took us to the airport within 20mins 
498865,Hotel Vilamar ,No Negative, Loved the wonderful breakfast The huge buffet choice was magnificent Location was very handy to local sites The receptionist was very helpful suggesting site seeing 
498866,Hotel Vilamar , Its about a 20 30 minute walk to las ramblas , Very nice hotel Good facilities Good value for money Although not close to las ramblas its still in a very nice neighbourhood and with easy access to the metro Would definitely reccomend 
498867,Hotel Vilamar , Noise in the evening if you live in the room next to the street It s not a REAL 4 stars hotel Facilities like a 2 stars Do do t raise your expectation too much , Good location
498868,Hotel Vilamar , Furniture is old but ok what I really didnt like was bed creaking soft mattress , We got a room earlier came at 1pm without any problems friendly stuff a liitle bit small room but nice clean 
498869,Hotel Vilamar , The bed was not comfortable Could feel the mattress springs Could be improved with a pillow top , Staff was exceptionally helpful more than willing to assIst with booking tours giving advice and recommendations when asked Great location walking distance to La Rambla and 1 block from Pl Espanya 
498870,Hotel Vilamar , The shower was extremely difficult to get into because the toilet was located in such an unconventional location The shower splashed onto the floor because there was only a partial shower door TV room 103 Was not able to change channels by selecting the channel number on the number pad You could only go up or down one channel at a time with the arrow keys I asked the desk and they said it would be corrected but it wasn t , Breakfast really nice Bedroom excellent 
498871,Hotel Vilamar , The room bed was bit small and mattress was less comfortable Breakfast could have been better, Location was great The staff was extremely helpful and generous to help us with activities and printing out our bookings
498872,Hotel Vilamar ,No Negative, Great location with moderate strolling 20 minutes from Sants Train Station 5 minutes Plaza Espana 20 minutes Olympic Stadium Excellent breakfast worth booking 
498873,Hotel Vilamar , Wish there was a safe in the room , Staff was very nice and helpful We actually left our large suitcase there for one week while we travelled by train around Spain Absolutely no problems with drop off or pick up really appreciated that Plus the location is great to catch the Aerobus to the airport 
498874,Hotel Vilamar , 1 It is unclear why had they asked to provide the arrival time beforehand since they refused to check us in before 3pm anyway 2 They gave us a room with two separate beds although a room with one large bed had been booked When we asked to change it they gave us another one which had the right bed but was cheaper than the one we had paid for no exterior view 3 Weird bathroom door no lock made of glass and with wide slits around the perimeter If you are going for a romantic trip be ready to see hear and smell your sweetheart sitting on the toilet , 1 Great location few minutes from Pla a d Espanya 2 The room was clean 3 Free bottled water 
498875,Hotel Vilamar , Restaurant staff not very knowledgeable Overcharged for a common drink and could not make it correctly even when given specific directions , Clean and modern Close to two metro stations 
498876,Hotel Vilamar , Noise from either side NO tea or coffee facilities in the room Small fridge with 4 bottles of water only , Great location Room comfy Blackout curtains excellent 
498877,Hotel Vilamar , Ridiculous price for one night without breakfast for this hotel but no option due to business meetings location For the price I was expecting a suite with a great view but instead my only window view was of an internal concrete wall ,No Positive
498878,Hotel Vilamar , Breakfast wasn t too exciting Local restaurants were expensive Ask drink prices before entering Could smell something a little dodgy on landing not hotels fault , Room was quiet and clean Shower was excellent Beds and towels changed daily Very helpful reception staff Very close to metro and Magic Fountain 
498879,Hotel Vilamar , Taxi from airport has a minimum 30 charge Once you know bus routes it s much cheaper and easier, Great location handy to catch local transport and tour buses Love Barca
498880,Hotel Vilamar , There wasn t a lot to dislike but we didn t use the restaurant it didn t look at all inviting and when we did go down to see what was there which we did a couple of times there was never any staff no one to welcome us or to tell us what was available how to order etc so we always ate out but it would have been nice to have had the odd coffee or lunch etc Also I felt the price we paid was a little high for the size of room , All in all it was a very nice hotel the two lady staff were very welcoming and friendly the rooms were small clean and perfect with everything we needed for a short stay we stayed for 3 nights There was a tiny gym which my husband used which was really handy and a sauna which we could have used for free oh yes the see through glass sink in the bathroom was really beautiful The location of this hotel was great 3 mins to nearest metro station and main shopping area also great for the airport bus This is the third hotel in this area we have stayed in all have been really great but this was the smallest room and the most expensive We would stay again at a drop of a hat but maybe wait for a good deal on the price next time Thank you for a lovely stay 
498881,Hotel Vilamar , Didn t like having to take my ironing down to reception to get ironed Could have done with an ironing board in the room Also room was VERY warm when window was closed air conditioning didn t seem effective although may have been because it was unseasonably wamr , Location off the Plaza Espana was great only downside was there was a lot of noise when the window was open but closed was fine Right by the metro and FDG to the Fira Europa 25 minute walk to the Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas Staff helpful and room service and breakfast good Room and bed comfortable and lots of hot water in the shower 
498882,Hotel Vilamar , Very uncomfortable bed could feel the springs Linen felt very starchy Too far out of centre for my liking , Staff were friendly and make a great G T 
498883,Hotel Vilamar , Rooms are not too large but ok my shower head was missing a rubber o ring and squirting water all over the place , Great location in Eixample right next to Plaza Espa a stylish design modern rooms decent breakfast bicycles for rent

498885,Hotel Vilamar , Terrible WI FI in the room Very hot in the room and AC not working properly Receptionist told me that it is impossible to do anything Despite this after conversation about canceling booking AC was fixed next day Car parking is extremly expensive Uncorfortable and not stable single beds on wheels Glass door to the bathroom zero insulation , Good location nice selection for breakfast 
498886,Hotel Vilamar , 1 They gave us a room in the smokers floor we were with a Baby and in the morning we could smell cigarette smoke in the room 2 the room was really tiny for a cot bed and a queen size bed 3 it was difficult to find a shower gel if you have 2 shower in a day it s not enough and when I asked the cleaner she gave me only 1 not enough for 4 days 4 staff not particularly friendly 5 restaurant and bar closed already at 11PM , the position was great bar area really nice internet perfect
498887,Hotel Vilamar , My husband is quite tall and so the bed was a bit too small for him Also there was a closet in the room but it was too shallow to hang up our clothes Therefore we had to leave everything in our suitcase or on the table next to the bed Because the room wasn t very big this made the room look even more smaller , It s near the metro station Plaza de Espa a that gives a good connection to other parts of the city and the sights There a many good restaurants in the neighbourhood so you don t have to go down town Barcelona 
498888,Hotel Vilamar , The room was very clean but was very small Wardrobes not sure why as was about 6 inches deep and I could not unpack cases as nowhere to put anything No safe in room but you could book one in reception , The hotel is clean and the breakfast very good Staff always friendly and polite 
498889,Hotel Vilamar , The wifi in the room was almost unusable and the room and bathrooms were a little small , Location Placa d Espanya and Las Arenas are just around the corner 
498890,Hotel Vilamar , Wi fi signal too low in some rooms we could hear some good noise from the street at night even with the windows closed, Staff was very nice and helpful the hotel has a great location next to metro and bus stations that take you anywhere in the city very good breakfast
498891,Hotel Vilamar , The cleanliness was very poor Too much dust in the room The cleaning service quite unprofessional trowing away my private tooth brush The breakfast services quite slow , The location was good Part of the restaurant team was professional enough 
498892,Hotel Vilamar , Although the breakfast at the hotel was very good there should be a cheaper price for children, Location was very good within walking distance to Montjuic and Plaza Espana Two interconnecting family rooms were very comfortable Free water in fridge each day was a nice touch and very welcome in mid July when temperatures were so high 
498893,Hotel Vilamar , breakfast is not international standard both in offer and service and therefore much too expansive the use of sauna needs to inform reception 15mn ahead but when calling the operator about the service she will not tell you and you discover it once you are in front of the door already in bath suit , location and private parking
