114932,Portobello House, Better facilities for refreshments in the room A kettle selection of tea coffee would have sufficed , The bed bedding were perfect Staff super helpful informative 
114933,Portobello House, Keep in mind The building is located over its own restaurant You will hear people until 1 or 2 am when it s crowded , The location entrance was adorable You get up tiny stairs and arrive in a surprisingly charming building part All was newly renovated and furnished The building was very clean The room was luxurious and cozy at once The breakfast is served in the morning downstairs in the building s own restaurant Newspapers fresh croissants and hot brewed coffee a European breakfast with possibility to eat on the terrasse Very close to the Portobello market and in the wonderful neighbourhood of Notting Hill 2 minutes by foot from a metro station 5 minutes by foot from delicious little restaurants and pubs 
114934,Portobello House, Excellent location great service immaculate rooms great a shower Breakfast was poor microwaved porridge and undercooked eggs and when I asked for ice they said they had no access to the ice machine but your in London so go out for breakfast I assume the hotel is separate from the restaurant so whilst it s be good of they get a key these little niggles weren t a big deal It s a great spot for the price ,No Positive
114935,Portobello House, Nothing, Room and bathroom was exceptionally clean Staff were extremely helpful and accommodating of our needs and the whole premises was tastefully decorated We also ate in the bar while we stayed and the food was of a very high standard The whole place had a relaxed atmosphere 
114936,Portobello House, Unfortunately we had what they called the cozy room which in plain terms meant an extremely small room Having said that it was very attractively decorated with a lovely modern bathroom and a comfy bed There was a Nespresso machine in the room which made great coffee and an extended continental breakfast was served in the restaurant every morning , The building itself was as pictured very charming The restaurant and bar on the main floor was terrific the food and drinks were excellent A very comfortable environment we enjoyed hanging out in 
114937,Portobello House, Tea making facicities in the room, The room was very comfortable with all our requirements met only gripe was the lack of tea making in the room which was quickly sorted on request but the hot water system was not adequate for tea making to cold but everything else was perfect the staff and managers etc
114938,Portobello House,No Negative, It was really nice and relaxing One of the best places in London I have ever stayed in The atmosphere was great and the staff was so friendly I found my place when I am in London The breakfast in the pub with all the newspapers and excellent coffee just made it 
114939,Portobello House, Our first room was too small for us but we were able to change the day after we arrived , It was a bonus to have breakfast included The staff is very accommodating On Friday night the bar restaurant was packed Another testimony to Portobello House in the community Our lovely room was directly above We thought that might be a problem and were pleasantly surprised the music was much quieter after 10 30 When we returned to the restaurant in the morning it was hard to believe it was the same place Beautiful classical music and clean They also have a fun 50 s American movie actors theme throughout the hotel 
114940,Portobello House, Range of cereals at breakfast and limited choice of fruit No unflavoured yoghourt Could not find any ordinary black tea bags they might have been there but finding them among the fruit and other infusions defeated me Note trivial negatives arising from personal preferences the breakfast facilities were perfectly adequate and better than expected , Beds comfortable room clean and well presented bathroom clean shower good size with powerful water supply WiFi easy to access adequate storage hanging space Facility of access after 23 00 and the general security of the premises and room Surprisingly quiet Friendly personnel Clean bar area used for serving breakfast was impressed that the area had been cleaned so well after noting that it was a well used fashionable bar until late the night before 
114941,Portobello House, The location is good but it s not so central , The decor is amazing everything is new and cool The bedroom is enormous and very comfy The staff was really kind 
114942,Portobello House, More space stairs less steeper , Bistrot downstair for lunch and breakfast was very nice and we could get nice food The room was small but everything we needed was available I appreciated the NEspresso coffee machine with capsules available 
114943,Portobello House, lovely breakfast little choice if you are gluten free , The room was very comfortable especially the bed coffee machine in the room a tea maker would have been nice but is available in the restaurant Excellent service and politeness 
114944,Portobello House, The staff were rude and unhelpful We will not stay again and will tell everyone we know how bad the staff were The management need to look at the attitude of the staff, Room and location
114945,Portobello House, On arrival it felt like we were staying at a bar with some rooms rather than a boutique hotel There is no lift at the hotel and the entrance would be tricky if you arrived with large suitcases or if you are infirm , The rooms are very modern and tastefully decorated The bed in our room was very comfortable and large We chose the location for it s proximity to Portobello road and market and we were pleased with our choice 
114946,Portobello House,No Negative, THE LOCATION NEAR PORTOBELLO ROAD NEAR METRO AND DIRECT TO BAKER STREET THE STAFF THE BED IS VERY CONFORTABLE BREAKFAST ENOUGH LUNCH FOOD OK
114947,Portobello House, hotel was cold room was cold and restaurant was cold when down for breakfast wifi was ok carpet dirty bed could be replaced and was very soft i asked the staff about the temperature to make sure i was controlling as best as i could, Seemed like popular place for drinks food quaint location ok
114948,Portobello House, Having to ask for extra coffee pods for the expresso machine there was only one each no kettle and despite it being clear we could ask for more being told they were not available , Comfortable room great location good breakfast
114949,Portobello House, Breakfast was basic , Room was large and spotless Staff were friendly helpful and polite Good value for money Excellent location for the Portobello Road area 
114950,Portobello House, Felt breakfast could have been better Not over fussed on continental Would have been nice to have had a choice of scrambled egg or something, Very comfy bed and lovely cotton sheets 
114951,Portobello House, Small room reception desk almost empty , The bed pillow blanket was excellent The coffee machin in room helps Location for us to visit family great
114952,Portobello House, The room was cold despite the heating and we were unable to use the bar or restaurant as there was a private party we were not informed of this prior to our stay, The location was good for where we had to go
114953,Portobello House, The room was extremely cold when we arrived but warmed up once the heating was switched on , Excellent breakfast Very comfortable bed Nice fluffy white towels In room coffee gorgeous 
114954,Portobello House,No Negative, The continental breakfast was a lovely surprise as was the Nespresso machine in the room Lovely cosy double room with beautiful decor and a nice clean bathroom 
114955,Portobello House, On the downside 2 single duvets for a king size bed The sink was clogged and requested to be sorted but nothing was done, Clean Although the room was facing the main road it was very quiet during the nite 
114956,Portobello House, Room cosy room had bad traffic noise windows are not double glazed even though they are facing a main road It meant I wasn t able to get any sleep with buses hurtling past all night ,No Positive
114957,Portobello House, room a bit small but it was fine for what we needed, Lauren the receptionist was lovely very welcoming and helpful all of the staff that we were in contact with were excellent Location was great and hotel was really sweet
114958,Portobello House, We were asked for ID on arrival but had already paid for the room breakfast was sparse and we had a club king room which was tiny there was just enough room to walk round the bed , The bed was very comfortable
114959,Portobello House, Located just above the bar Thumping music until midnight lots of loud people noise The room so tiny no space for a table or small chair Had to store work items in bathroom Terrible food Not well staffed Only one person at desk and often not even there So no service or help with bags , The quality of bed linens 
114960,Portobello House, Nothing, Location was excellent Rooms very tastefully decorated and warm beds comfortable Towels very luxurious They threw in a freebie breakfast as an added treat
114961,Portobello House,No Negative, It is a small friendly hotel located above an engaging local bistro Easy access to transportation for the city with nearby access for Portobello Road Would definitely stay again
114962,Portobello House, Perhaps bed could have had a single large duvet rather than two together , Extremely friendly welcoming reception Beautiful decor Comfortable room Great location Close to public transport Safe 
114963,Portobello House, Wifi never worked while there staff unsure of the surroundings or how to call a taxi when we the could not use wifi to call Uber Location far from central took 45 min in cab to get anywhere Staff rude and unhelpful with booking error Could have stayed much more conveniently in central London for less ,No Positive
114964,Portobello House, Don t be fooled by the marketing You can get a much better value more central with staff who can actually help suggest things to do offer directions call you a cab etc wifi didn t work the entire time we were there making any work or activity planning nearly impossible Lots of stairs staff not helpful with billing issues ,No Positive
114965,Portobello House, I really liked the hotel and selected it specifically for the location because we were attending the carnival and for the facilities including complimentary breakfast and restaurant which were showing as available on booking com when the reservation was made About a week before Notting Hill carnival we were emailed and told there would be a party with loud music held at the bar restaurant below and because of the the breakfast facilities would not be the usual standard This seemed unfair when the rate had already been inflated due to the carnival taking place and guests were later told they would not receive the normal level of service By this time many hotels were sold out or their prices were rising The music was ridiculously loud and unbearable The rooms should have only be offered to people attending the party who would not be disturbed by the music Breakfast on the Sunday was a food parcel which was less than adequate This was not a comfortable stay or experience When I mentioned it to the staff management the next morning they were totally unapologetic and claimed it finished 2 hours earlier than it actually did , Nice decor and good location
114966,Portobello House, room on the main street absolute need of a proper double glazed windows or bring your earplugs if you want to sleep they took a scan of the card for the deposit slow checkout process, room space and bathroom size polite staff manager
114967,Portobello House, It can get a little noisy due to the bar restaurant downstairs , Super cute and cozy spot in Notting Hill We loved our room especially the comfy bed wallpaper large wardrobe and modern shower It s an easy walk to lots of restaurants and shops 
114968,Portobello House, Only thing was my bill stated we had booked bed and breakfast but I thought it was only the room so missed the breakfast, stayed over as we went to Carnival and attended after party in the bar downstairs Very handy and staff were friendly Room was comfy with an amazing view of Carnival 
114969,Portobello House, Everything was perfect , It is the perfect location 2 minutes from Ladbroke tube Best value for money Staff were excellent Room clean and very very quiet contrary to some of the review complaints I saw There is also a facility to leave luggage after check out which is very handy Fantastic stay 
114970,Portobello House, if anything breakfast could have been somewhat more interesting missed the cheese fx , I loved the area The little roofgarden and we slept like babies in the bed 
114971,Portobello House, Complicated check in process involving taking photocopies of ID and credit card , Very comfortable beds and given complimentary drinks or cocktail vouchers for the very nice pub below Terrace was a nice addition for the smokers in the party All in all a comfortable stay in a decent location 
114972,Portobello House, Nothing , This London hotel was fairly quiet at night Bus stop outside hotel and tube station 5 6 minutes walk away for good links into centre of London Complimentary continental breakfast was a welcome bonus 
114973,Portobello House, Nothing , The staff were helpful My flight arrived early in the morning and although the check in time was not until 3 00pm the staff ensured my room was cleaned first and I was able to check in at 12 00pm There are lovely little cafes within a 2 3 minute walk 
114974,Portobello House, Had to stand in the rain in the middle of the night to wait for someone to get up and let us in No help with parking what so ever At breakfast they had run out if everything at 9 30 and said well most people have already been here No cheese ham or nothing to put onto your sandwich Very poor,No Positive
114975,Portobello House, We would have liked the bathroom window to open The room was a little small but nice decor comfortable bed and very clean , The Pub was great with a good breakfast which was included The owner and staff were the best and ready to assist us in anyway This place is close to the subway buses and walking distance to several good restaurants 
114976,Portobello House, The only issue I would comment on is my room was on the Ladbroke Grove side the traffic could often be noisey first thing in the morning This is not the hotels fault but it could be an issue if you are a light sleeper , The hotel is close to Portobello Road and is also close to good public transport to get you to most areas and to Paddington for the express to Heathrow As a solo traveller I felt safe at Portobello House the room was clean modern and room service from the bar downstairs was very convenient 
114977,Portobello House, Windows are not soundproof shouldn t be advertized and the road is very noisy trucks at 4am Very small room which should be a single room and certainly not a top level club double advertized as better and more expensive than superior and comfort double rooms No handheld showerhead makes it impossible for short people to have a proper shower , Very nice and friendly stuff Newly and nicely decorated Very clean Comfi bed Complementary breakfast In spite of the above drawbacks we did have an overall pleasant experience 
114978,Portobello House, Rooms are small and there are quite a few stairs to get up to get to the rooms Need to check on bathroom supplies as we had no hand soap , Staff are really good and very helpful they are polite and take care to check what you need Location is great and we used buses which stop right outside the door Rooms clean and beds are comfortable 
114979,Portobello House, Poor ventilation in the bathroom and the room No good condition for allergy because I suffer of asthma and allergy , The staff were very helpfull and nice Nice and cozy rooms with very comfortable beds A small hotell with a lot of good atmosphere Quiet aera 
114980,Portobello House, For two out of three nights I stayed in this hotel on the second floor there was noise coming from the top of the bathroom for every two to three hours The noise sounded like some machinery running A colleague of mine whose room was exactly below mine also heard the similar noise in one of the nights of the stay , Apart from the noise the hotel was pretty nice Friendly staff simple but nice breakfast 
114981,Portobello House, Nothing could have been better, Wonderful place wonderful people I was looked after so well They have got it completely right And the food wow 
114982,Portobello House, The staff Woman in the reception was not helpful rude and not welcoming at all But was also other guy in half of the time that was kind and helpful , The location 
114983,Portobello House, The room was cold on arrival and didn t really warm up Advertised as an apart hotel but no fridge just an expresso machine No kettle either, Good location
114984,Portobello House, Would have preferred a room away from the noise of the Street Possibly some information on happenings in the area guides or maps to help navigate the Tube and see the sites but it didn t stop us from getting the most of our visit , Pleasant and accommodating staff relaxing bistro bar tasteful electic decor well situated for shopping the fabulous Portobello market catching the Tube Very comfortable atmosphere Glad we picked this place for our first experience in London Would definitely return and highly recommend if you want to stay away from the crowds 
114985,Portobello House, This is not a criticism and it was partly my fault but I found the breakfast arrangement a little confusing As I didn t have much time I probably did not ask the appropriate questions Don t get me wrong it was an excellent spread and had I wanted I could have had more , The hotel is very well placed close to Ladbroke Grove underground station and a short walk to Portobello Road which is why I chose it and I was not disappointed It was ideally placed as I was meeting my sister who had come over from Toronto and had relatives living close to Portobello Road Clean and comfortable room and bed with a good size en suite and an excellent shower Shame about the view but you can t have everything 
114986,Portobello House, nothing , I loved Portobello House it was beautifully decorated very clean the bar restaurant downstairs were really smart the menu looked delicious the bed was fab breakfast was great with eggs exactly to order the staff could not have been more attentive they were polite professional at all times we were at the front of the hotel on a Saturday night there was no discernible noise from inside or out of the hotel it was exactly what I had hoped for a more I would be happy to go back again again 
114987,Portobello House, The breakfast was a bit poor for a quality hotel but as it was included in the room price it was great value for money , Nice small and friendly hotel in wonderful Notting Hill We didn t mind the quite small room everything we needed was there and the beds were very comfortable Very friendly staff Nice bar downstairs 
114988,Portobello House, I had no bad experience as it was what I expected but the breakfast was not very impressive at least one should be able to choose an egg that is other than boiled and a croissant might have added value I do believe that the price tag was quite high , Friendly staff good unpretentious atmosphere clean room and bathroom and well situated if you want to be north of Hyde Park and near Notting Hill
114989,Portobello House, Lousy breakfast but easy walk to Portobello Road and fantastic breakfast coffee spots Shame they don t make more out of the outdoor terrace area lost opportunity , Super bed and linen Slept like a baby first night however expect outdoor noise Saturday night Prepare for sleep with a few in the bar which has a great vibe and staff 
114990,Portobello House, A little street noise in front rooms but expected in busy London , Great location near Portobello Street Market Close to tube station Very helpful and friendly staff Clean rooms with comfortable beds Good food in the restaurant bar on the pemises
