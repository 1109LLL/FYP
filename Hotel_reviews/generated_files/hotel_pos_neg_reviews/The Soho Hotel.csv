176748,The Soho Hotel, Could have some draft beer in the bar , Modern chic but cosy Staff are terrific Rooms impressive Been on the road for two months and this is the best hotel I ve stayed in 
176749,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, We received special treatment for my wife s birthday Substantial room upgrade and complimentary champagne and chocolate gifts A very enjoyable stay as always 
176750,The Soho Hotel, Nothing, Beautiful hotel well designed so clean and no details missed The gym was the best hotel gym I have used The front desk upgraded us to a lovely room with a balcony overlooking London and surprised us with champagne and sweets as it was the last night of our honeymoon It was a great experience my husband and I absolutely loved our stay and would stay at the Soho hotel next time we are in London 
176751,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, EVERYTHING My room was absolutely incredible Loved the outdoor terrace the heavenly bed and the incredible bathroom with TV in tub Also the breakfast was so delicious and the bar makes the most divine cocktails Can t wait to come back to London just so I can stay here again 
176752,The Soho Hotel, No dislikes at all, The service was exactly as expected for a 5 Star hotel it was outstanding we have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this is definitely at the top of the list the staff were courteous and wonderful the room was so quiet and the bed out of this world 
176753,The Soho Hotel, Breakfast options whilst good quality were rather expensive compared to other options within a short walk All breakfast is a la carte with a very small continental buffet , The staff were excellent offering us an early checking in around 9am after a long haul flight from Australia The room was great quality and quite large by London standards The location in Soho is great for walking to a lot of the main sites and it is a really interesting area with lots of different restaurants shops etc 
176754,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, We loved the location many restaurants cafes and shops in the area Even if the hotel is in a hip happening area the Hotel property sits on a quiet interior street The hotel is wonderful with beautiful interiors lovely decorated room with very comfortable bed pillows and beddings Very nice bathrooms with fluffy towels lots of cabinet space for 2 people The staff is excellent very friendly and helpful They offer a very good breakfast buffet with an additional option of a cooked item for a little bit more We would definitely stay here again 
176755,The Soho Hotel, The best ever mini bar in the room but no tea coffee facility Found out at checkout we could have asked for one to be sent up , due to early theatre show we arrived early couldn t check in yet but has a lovely coffee and told the bag would be in our room waiting when we got back WOW when we arrived back we had been given a roof top terrace up graded room Out side balcony with table and chairs a a fabulous view of London Booked afternoon tea all waiting when we arrived for it Staff wonderful friendly and helpful 
176756,The Soho Hotel, There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room , The staff were amazing so friendly attentive and nothing seemed like too much trouble Our room was awesome and the food was delicious 
176757,The Soho Hotel, The water in the shower we couldn t do it hot just warm, Very good location stylish interior and comfortable rooms very nice breakfast place with good choice and quality of food great service
176758,The Soho Hotel, The location is very good in the midst of SOHO But it comes with the downside of noise at night If you want to open a window you need to have a tide sleep , Extremely nice people and interieur Truly a 5 star hotel And a great bar too 
176759,The Soho Hotel, As can be expected the group is not cheap , The Firmdale group to which the hotel belongs really understands comfort AND style Very few hotels understand or cater to both categories they are either painfully trendy but you can t see your hand in front of your face in the room or they are traditionally comfortable excellent bathrooms lighting beds but bland boring Since their first hotel opened in London must be 20 years ago I ve never been tempted to try any other hotel and I travel widely throughout the world Their pot of English breakfast tea is one of the best I ve ever tasted 
176760,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, From sign in to check out our stay was perfect All helped by a free double up grade To experience the vibrancy and diverse culture of Soho The Soho Hotel is a must 
176761,The Soho Hotel, The guy at the desk kept asking us if we really stay in this hotel and really have keys What should one wear to look like a guest of The Soho Hotel and not being stopped at doors , Almost everything is perfect in this one of the best hotels in London 
176762,The Soho Hotel, To be able to cook your own cup of tea or coffee in the room without involving roomservice and pay a fortune for it should be an option in this high rated hotel , Super chic expensive modern and friendly 5 star hotel well located in swinging Soho
176763,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Everything about the Soho Hotel is great The staff was so accommodating and attentive The decor is beautiful the rooms are clean and the food is great Plus you are within walking distance of so many great shows restaurants and bars 
176764,The Soho Hotel, No complimentary water in the room when we arrived View of a brick wall from the window Lovely of course but not quite 400 per night good , Candle brought to the room great bathroom lovely room comfortable bed well stocked minibar At 300ish per night would have felt perfect 
176765,The Soho Hotel, Our view out the window was of a wall having said that we were out 99 of the time we were awake so it didn t really matter , Almost everything was perfect Amazing location right in the middle of Soho The staff are lovely especially the doorman who welcomes you like you have just arrived home The hotel has the feel of an independent property we didn t feel we were in the Soho one of the group It smells delightful and they gave us a bottle of the delightful smell Everything was beautifully clean The bar area is comfortable lively and relaxed and the cocktail menu was good not a hint of a whacky air of spruce or similar to be seen Lots of very happy ladies were having what looked like a very good afternoon tea in fact just in the process of organising for my own ladies and I to go 
176766,The Soho Hotel, Everything was spot on , Absolutely fantastic hotel great staff who couldn t do enough lots of nice little treats and we were upgraded which was a lovely surprise Thank you everyone at the Soho Hotel for making our stay perfect 
176767,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Fabulous breakfasts with all the latest super foods to chose from chia pots avocado etc warm and genuine staff beautiful suite and one of the best locations in London in our view
176768,The Soho Hotel, Nothing, We had our 20th wedding anniversary and the hotel surprised us with champaign strawberries and chocolates Service was outstanding from all the staff and the food at Refuel restaurant was excellent We had room service breakfast top class with excellent coffee 
176769,The Soho Hotel, Lack of space to sit and read in the public rooms On one afternoon there was nowhere to sit except the bar , Excellent breakfast Comfortable quiet room 
176770,The Soho Hotel, It s perfect nothing could be better, Quiet rooms comfy bed quality toiletries fantastic shower wonderful staff This is a pricey hotel but it s worth it you leave feeling rested and happy Breakfast is delicious and huge with loads of options I love this hotel the location the smell the rooms the staff everything A fabulous touch is how good the staff are with children with a little gift for the younger ones and chocolates for the bigger ones Milk and cookies before bed too 
176771,The Soho Hotel, There is nothing to complain , Spirit in this hotel is outstanding Location is stunny People in that place just the right crowd Although the bar is packed excellent service Very quiet rooms Place to be 
176772,The Soho Hotel, Hotel s restaurant was very expensive and both breakfast and dinner were not good at all It was also very noisy making meals even worse , A grate hotel in the heart of London Very clean Exceptional good and professional personnel 
176773,The Soho Hotel, The pillows were a bit too soft for my taste , Impeccable service Extremely cosy interior design Amazing breakfast Fantastic room top of the line quality bathroom Brilliant location Very helpful concierge 
176774,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, I was very lucky to get upgraded to the Penthouse suite Amazed by the spacious room and the lovely decorations The balcony is also incredibly large with a great view All in all a very memorable experience 
176775,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Booked a night while in town for our anniversary Possibly because they weren t too busy we were given a fantastic upgrade to a penthouse suite beautiful styling great balcony views over rooftops which really made our stay Friendly staff bustling restaurant and bar incredibly central for West End nightlife but still a peaceful and relaxing retreat 
176776,The Soho Hotel, A bit more of a intro to the hotel would of been good It was a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for i suppose , Service was very good standard of the hotel was exceptional Overall a fantastic stay 
176777,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, The location is excellent for food culture transport The staff couldn t do enough for you and all so genuinely happy and helpful Great restaurant recommendations Great breakfast Great ambience and beautifully decorated If you can treat yourself to stay here than do so 
176778,The Soho Hotel, Utter honest Nothing, ignoring the beautiful interior design of lobbies corridors functions and guest rooms the hotel focus on the little things that matters by connecting on a personal level with the guest We had a wonderful time and were treated like royalty 
176779,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Very welcoming reception able to accommodate early arrival managed to check us into our room well before the official check in date Also very helpful with the possibility to change before check in and after check out Very comfortable and spacious room and bathroom 
176780,The Soho Hotel, There was a bit of confusion as to whether our breakfast which we ate after 11am was included in the price of our hotel room We has been charged the breakfast separately although we had double checked with the staff whether we would could order breakfast after 11am and not pay extra money for it The answer was that breakfast after 11am was included in the initial price We clarified it with a receptionist when checking out but it would be useful to make these details clear beforehand just to avoid the confusion when paying the bill at the end , I loved the design I felt very cosy in the restaurant the lounge my room Kit Kemp did a great job Breakfast was excellent I especially enjoyed the rich variety of fruits which were super fresh and delicious Having lived in Africa for the past two years I especially appreciate the customer service in your hotel and the speed at which our breakfast was delivered That was impressive 
176781,The Soho Hotel, Not enough bottled water supplied in the room but I m clutching at straws to find something to fill this box , The service is impeccable and hotel divine 
176782,The Soho Hotel, They actually have two cinemas in the hotel we weren t told about them, It gives you the feel like home coziness yet providing the services intact with a five star hotel Comfortable bed Attentive staff
176783,The Soho Hotel, The hotel located at a very small road not very convenient for taking taxi , The suite is huge and very modern decoration The location is close to Chinatown theaters bars resturants walk distance to piccadily circus half hour walk to harrods and Hyde park 
176784,The Soho Hotel, My husband and i were carring only a carry on bag so we didnt see the need of the bellman taking it so the guy didnt like this and just left us at the elevator and didnt take us to the room When we got to the room he had a little trouble with the lights because there were so many light switches And just because of the price of the room i was expecting someone to take us there and kind of explain everything Other than that the staff was very nice, Beautiful hotel the decoration was so unique and gorgeous the room was big and confortable Great location
176785,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Great location smack inside Soho but quiet Love the breakfast with plenty of healthy options Extra points to the concierge very helpful and knowledgeable 
176786,The Soho Hotel, WiFi connectivity was good for surfing the net and social media but couldn t redirect email so I found it very frustrating and ended up turning off WiFi, Staff room service high tea bar restaurant were all great All was great and we will be back 
176787,The Soho Hotel, Nothing , Excellent hotel all spotlessly clean and very comfortable Staff were all very professional but also friendly We were given an upgrade and champagne due to celebrating my husband s birthday which was a lovely extra touch 
176788,The Soho Hotel, not sure about the taste of the breakfast tea The breakfast buffet needs to have a wider selection such as cold meets, Comfortable and quiet bedroom Pleasant and helpful staff cleanliness Good location facilities unstuffy
176789,The Soho Hotel, As we stayed for 2 nights would of been nice for the mini bar to of been re stocked I enjoyed my apple juice and wine the first night but wasn t replaced my second night Everything else perfect thank you, Everything was fine a very friendly welcome and nothing to much trouble lovely beds and bed linen everything done with lots of thought and care 
176790,The Soho Hotel, The view from the Bedroom could have been better however what can you expect from a central London Hotel , The staff were super efficient helpful and knowledgeable from the moment we arrived till we booked out We weer upgraded and our room was excellent 
176791,The Soho Hotel, The price is a little expensive but worth the investment , The rooms are soo beautifully decorated the amenities are lovely the bed exceptionally comfortable 
176792,The Soho Hotel, Extra charges for room service breakfast items despite having booked a bed breakfast room rate notwithstanding tray charge Beware there is a GBP limit on breakfast food delivered to the room First room located right next to hotel building works which we were not given any prior notice about either on booking or at check in Very noisy and disturbing on a Saturday morning but did get transferred to a quieter room , Very attentive staff Ordered room service on multiple occasions which was speedily delivered by helpful and friendly staff Deluxe Room was spacious clean and comfortable but seemed overpriced 
176793,The Soho Hotel, There are many reasons to visit this hotel but I list below a few minor issues that management could perhaps respond to Please do not let the comments below dissuade you from booking they re all fixable a The restaurant was quite noisy it would be better to make more of the other two sections for diners who would prefer a more formal setting b The staff were very willing and but they could have had better barista training Apart from whomever was on duty in the drawing room at around 3 on Saturday he was great c The breakfast was very tasty but the high breakfast was a little cold difficult to avoid as it is spread on a stand however Might be wise to rethink the size of the stand perhaps so that it retains heat more effectively If it were my restaurant I would take it off the menu so that the food was not compromised by being cold it did taste good just not very warm d It would be nice to have tea facilities in the room these were delivered and were fantastic quality lovely to have fresh coffee cafetiere but there was a charge , Overall the stay was very positive staff were attentive and very professional Largely a fantastic experience I would stay again The bed was extremely comfortable and the room bathroom clean and well presented The restaurant food bar menu and evening was good quality although it might have been better to warn diners about the need to order extra vegetables with the mains Thank you for a great weekend I have noted points for improvement but only to be constructive it would not prevent further visits 
176794,The Soho Hotel, English breakfast was disappointing Clearly some items had been kept in or on a heated tray for perhaps a little too long and not as I would have expected from this hotel Customer response questionnaire also asks did your room have a stunning view and the answer is definitely not , Everything otherwise was excellent
176795,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, Free upgrade and complimentary champagne for our anniversary Huge beds tv in the beautiful bathroom amazing mini bar spectacular decor throughout Friendly helpful staff We were made to feel super special throughout our stay Love loved this hotel 
176796,The Soho Hotel, Leaving , This is without any doubt our new favourite hotel in London How can we stay anywhere else in the future I just hope that when we visit with the children we are able to get the right configuration of rooms It s a Fanstatic place to stay 
176797,The Soho Hotel, Nothing We had the best stay in a hotel ever , The staff were fabulously attentive The decor was gorgeous The food tasted amazing and nothing was too much trouble And they upgraded us 
176798,The Soho Hotel, No kettle in the room As a solo traveller the dining room and bar were too busy for me to want to spend time there The rest of the hotel though was very tranquil , The eye to detail All the decor in the hotel is beautifully designed the room was spacious service was impeccable friendly without being either starchy or in your face The library and drawing room are quiet spaces away from the hustle and bustle of the eating drinking areas 
176799,The Soho Hotel, On Friday evening we decided to go to the hotel bar for a pre dinner drink and were told there was no room as we hadnt booked On check in nobody informed us it would be a good idea to book a place at the hotel bar , Very nice location and decor Room was very comfortable 
176800,The Soho Hotel, Our room was on the first floor and we could hear music from a party in the basement in our room until midnight on our first night it was so loud we knew which songs were playing so I would recommend rooms on the 2nd floor or above , The room was great really well decorated and really comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful Food was great so much choice at breakfast 
176801,The Soho Hotel, Being disturbed in the early evening by a women selling and giving away goods I should not have to leave the do not disturb sign on the door all the time to be left in peace and quiet ,No Positive
176802,The Soho Hotel, no view from hotel room , very accommodating to last minute reservation request when my flight was cancelled room rates were matched to previous nights stay 
176803,The Soho Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was located down a small alley like street in the heart of Soho It had a private feel and you felt like you were in your living room when hanging out downstairs The service was strong and the bar buzzy 
176804,The Soho Hotel, Didn t like the fact that breakfast wasn t included in the price , Staff were very friendly and helpful I mentioned we were staying there for my girlfriends birthday and they made the effort of giving her champagne and chocolates

176807,The Soho Hotel, My only criticism would be that when we ordered room service cheese plate one Port and a pot of coffee for two we got an empty plate an empty pot and the coffee Made us laugh though , It s our second visit here we absolutely love this hotel and would definitely come back The rooms are a lovely size really clean and facilities perfect 
176808,The Soho Hotel, Had to wait an hour for the room to be ready not ready until 3pm which was difficult with young kids who had just travelled 3 hours in a car , Great location and a unique design style Staff were friendly and the breakfast was lovely 
176809,The Soho Hotel, the room was the very drab and dated Nothing like what you see on their website The room on all websites look modern and alive with colour I hated my room as it was dark green and tan very depressing room to sleep in , The location
176810,The Soho Hotel, Unsurprisingly you pay for such a wonderful experience for a special occasion though it is worth it and we loved it , It was our wedding night so the hotel kindly upgraded us to a beautiful suite The bathroom is enormous and beautiful and the whole experience was luxurious
