446580,Hotel de France Wien, The shallow steps down to the lobby area were a little tricky , The ambience of the hotel The good hygiene The ever helpful stall especially the front of house people at the reception The housekeepers were very efficient and cheerful as they went about the essential work that they do 
446581,Hotel de France Wien, Don t believe these nice pictures of the rooms the rooms do need cosmetic repair Too old windows our shower hose had several leaking holes also the showering protecting water glass was useless we had to put towels to keep our bathroom floor dry Our room was said to be a non smoking room but the smell in it proved that sometimes some earlier guests before us had smoked there and therefor the air refreshing spray and the walls and curtains full with cigarette smoke now was a terribly smelly combination Also every day we found several long dark hair on the floor in our room and bathroom For such a high price the room comfort was 3 10 , Internet connection normal breakfast good location excellent 
446582,Hotel de France Wien, I would have expected more from a 5 star hotel especially at the price I paid The room was significantly small appliances were generally outdated I hadn t seen a CRT TV since quite some time The furniture finishing looked very strange and in general didn t seem to match the room style I don t know about the other rooms but mine had a window in the hotel s facade All I got to see is a bank on the other side of the road I d have closed an eye on this but Breakfast although varied only offered a mostly international selection of foods I couldn t spot anything Austrian Viennese All in all I m quite critical because I ve had better service in the past with cheaper 4 star hotels This one hotel didn t make it up to or exceed my expectations which is the point of a 5 star hotel , The hotel is in a good location like many others around it Multilingual and friendly staff is well appreciated WiFi connectivity was quite fast and almost without interruption

446584,Hotel de France Wien, The bar in the main lounge was closed for July and August , The location made it easy to explore the city on foot We were given a room upgrade because the hotel was fully booked Most of the staff were very friendly They gave me a delicious cake on my birthday The breakfast was very good with a wide selection of foods to choose from

446590,Hotel de France Wien, Before 8am on my first morning at the hotel a male cleaner simply walked into my room without knocking I am female and had just finished getting dressed I asked the desk politely to ensure that he knocked in future Before 10am on my second morning the male cleaner simply walked into my room without knocking This time I was not so polite And according to the desk any problem was really all my fault as apparently I should have put a do not disturb sign on my door I don t usually do this before 10am in hotels In the event I was totally uncomfortable at that hotel I told the desk I would leave the sign on my door permanently as I did not want the cleaner coming into my room again at all So he did rather well he got away with not cleaning my room for 3 days and I made my own bed Hardly what one expects in an allegedly five star hotel Also the fridge didn t work so there was no hope of enjoying a nice cold bottle of water I didn t mention this to the desk until I left because I felt so unwelcome after their response to my experience with the cleaner One final point the minute you walk into the hotel they charge you for the full stay This is fairly unusual , Large room excellent breakfast 
446591,Hotel de France Wien, Pillows were almost flat even with an extra pillow there wasn t much height Floorboards creaked when you got in and out of bed Animals were allowed into breakfast room It would have been great for someone to show us around the premises and what was available on arrival , Room was spacious everything worked separate toilet attentive staff breakfast room and breakfast itself were the best we experienced Very handy to train tram buses and restaurants etc
446592,Hotel de France Wien, It would have been nice to have tea bags in our room though I acknowledge that that is a British taste rather than a European one , The breakfasts were out of this world You could have everything from a full English or a continental breakfast to sparkling wine and croissants Without exception the staff at the Hotel de France were cheerful welcoming and professional

446604,Hotel de France Wien, The facilities are quite old and I would not expect these facilities to be in a five star hotel It is like a four star hotel in early of 20th century Breakfast was exactly the same everyday and I think there should be more variety , The location was very good with 10 mins walking distance to the Hofburg Palace and 3 mins walking distance to the parliament building You can easily find the tram to every main attractions just outside the hotel Room was very spacious 
446605,Hotel de France Wien, As I am Coeliac the choices for dinner to say the least was very poor therefore only dined in just one evening I expected this standard of hotel to be much better geared to people with Coeliac Disease , The location of the hotel is excellent which ment we could walk to many of the nearby attractions The Breakfast was excellent plenty of choice and was catered for very well as I am Coeliac

446635,Hotel de France Wien, Very very old and outdated hotel and needs to be totally renovated especially the rooms very very low quality and not deserve more than two stars in the best rating Very old rusting and dirty bath room and my wife refused to touch anything or to get shower in this outdated shower Bed was horrible separated mattress with very cheap quality and single size blanket not covering all your body and very old disgusting pillows The tea set is very dirty and the mugs and spoon have remaining coffee on it which let my wife vomit TV may be thirty years old and no two star hotel accept to use it overall the rooms need total renovation and the best idea is to keep this historical building as a museum about early twenty century style Breakfast area is very smelly and very crowded , only the location

446659,Hotel de France Wien, It s not an issue with the hotel but needs to be mentioned for future guests We watched a lot of rudeness from guests to staff guests to guests Especially in the breakfast rush people were taking others guests tables then refusing to move even though they were siting with that persons mobile phones bag and even breakfast Old ladies were snarling at each other we saw a pushing incident It was disappointing to see and made breakfast really awkward Maybe eat breakfast out , The staff were very helpful and accomodating the hotel is very beautiful The location is perfect You have everything you need

446671,Hotel de France Wien, A little dated in my opinion to be considered 5 star hotel , Good location Staff are efficient and cordial Room was clean sheets and towels were spotless Bed is comfortable and there was no noise so easy to sleep well 
446672,Hotel de France Wien, Ridiculous furniture the rooms are old to say the least The hotel is trying to keep a renaissance style everywhere While they do a great job for the common areas it is clear that they never renewed the rooms interiors The furniture are old and close to disgusting the wallpaper is gross and the television was a CRT Additionally the room had two twin beds one next to the other instead of a double bed clearly requested during the reservation Good thing my partner couldn t join me in the end They served scrambled eggs with sugar yikes , Extremely friendly staff Great location Common areas well kept Very spacious room Decent breakfast

446679,Hotel de France Wien, Next to the subway and tram a little bit noisy at night but not so bad, Great location right next to the subway and tram Close to some fantastic inner city attractions A highly recommended Chinese restaurant Kuchen 18 is within 5 min walk up north
446680,Hotel de France Wien, A double room is two single beds pushed together with two single duvets rather than a double bed not great for a romantic break sleeping over the gap between the beds isn t very comfy The rooms are also quite dated and need modernising thought are very clean , It s in a great location

446703,Hotel de France Wien, the electricity went down for about an hour in our two rooms and we stayed with no electricity until someone come to fix it it was causee by a problem in their heater plug in one of the rooms that was bad and i had to claim the problem 2 times by phone and no one came until i went down to find the guy saying that he will come to fix the issue finally they fixed it after 1 hour we asked for a late checkout the receptionist was not helpfull and refused to give us a late checkout even when we mentioned the electicity issue i expected a better action they have to work more on their hotel reputation , the overall hotel is not bad and looks like the 1970th hotels

446711,Hotel de France Wien, Money for hotel was pre purchased from my card But during checkout girl in reception tells me that the only way is to purchase money once more and then cancel the old pre purchase transaction which can take up to 2 weeks So my card should be charged twice for 2 weeks After we argued with her 5 minutes her colleague came and did everything correctly just accepts pre purchase during several minutes , Location was really good Hotel was always clean

446714,Hotel de France Wien, based on the price we didn t expect a 5 hotel It feels more like a modest 4 one I d still recommend for the management not to claim 5 being so far away from standards of a 5 hotel though it is quite typical for Vienna hotels to be a bit worn out I d recommend to keep an eye that this noble ageing does not tend to become a ruin some things need to be refreshed upgraded etc please do not use rattan furniture in the rooms this is something for the garden please invest more efforts in room cleaning window curtains and windows once white were clearly gray and full of dust Such dust can be collected over more than 1 year of poor cleaning it would be nice if slippers are placed already in the room upon arrival making extra effort to get them from hotel staff does not add you any points , Very nice location Rooms have that traditional Vienna style big enough with over 3m ceiling height Though our room faced the main street noise level was relatively low we had 3d floor breakfast was good enough though adding salmon and fresh orange juice would make it perfect all in all this was a good value for money in Vienna we booked this hotel with secret deal option

446792,Hotel de France Wien, We got a room at the roof Very old and simple No wifi More like 3 star hotel Only after we complained we were moved to a better room , Location is good Not in the center but 10 min walk 1 min from U stations Very nice staff Breakfast was very good
446793,Hotel de France Wien, Limited gluten free options at breakfast , Great selection at breakfast Friendly staff Clean room and comfortable beds Location is excellent because the metro station is literally a stone s throw away and the hotel is pretty much walking distance to the main tourist attractions Value for money for a luxurious stay in Vienna we booked many months in advance Only point of discomfort is that our room is very noisy because it s along the main road so we had to keep our windows shut during the hot summer days the air conditioning works perfectly though To be fair to the hotel we ended up with the room we did because we asked for a room with a view if possible and the hotel specially arranged for us to have a view of the Bank of Austria along the main road the hotel staff must have quite a sense of humour 
446794,Hotel de France Wien, bedding and pillows were challenging but more were bought up when requested No aircon and room very warm , Lovely bathroom and bath large spacious room great location near tube station and attractions 
446795,Hotel de France Wien, When we arrived I noticed that there was construction going on right in front of the hotel As it turns out the attendant put us in 106 I don t like being on the first floor and asked for another room He then said I do have another room on the third floor How about looking at both and choosing So we looked at 106 which had a view and an EAR to the on going construction I said no to the third floor as the view was to the back of another building and the room was very small So the front desk man told me in order to get a better room I d have to upsell upgrade which would be an extra 20 Euros a night I agreed because I felt like I had no choice It was room 308 and was a decent room As it turns out the AC worked horribly I was sweating the whole night I did let them know the next morning that the AC wasn t cooling the room at all They said they d look at it When we came back later that evening no one said a word about the status of the AC I assumed it was fixed Sure enough the AC was NOT fixed We were miserable again The upside They did refund me the 40 in Euros that I was asked to pay to upgrade Overall the hotel seems pricey for what you get , The location was great The front desk staff were nice people 
446796,Hotel de France Wien, I had to leave , Very nice and friendly staff very clean hotel everywhere excellent location I had dinner there many nights staff is awesome in the dining room and food is very good really enjoyed the beef dinner with the apple horseradish condiment I would stay there again highly recommended

446798,Hotel de France Wien, We were shocked to find upon arrival that the reservation was cancelled by the hotel NOT by Booking with no reasonable explanation To our luck the room was still available so no harm was done but it could be a lot worse No explanation was given to the cancellation Be aware and check with the hotel before arrival Room decoration is old fashioned but very clean and well maintained , Nice staff good breakfast Great location

446800,Hotel de France Wien, The shop was disappointing , It was very central and people were very friendly and helpful at the hotel Nothing was a problem The breakfasts were terrific and I loved the smoke salmon and the waza crackers as its low in carbs and they catered for everyone s dietary needs

446805,Hotel de France Wien, Gym fitness substandard In general the staff were average My luggage took forever to be brought up to the room after I d called down to the front office and when they arrived I was almost rudely asked the question Are these yours as if I was causing a problem despite having the claim ticket Nobody seemed concerned Got this sense throughout the hotel Or perhaps throughout this beautiful city maybe the hotel staff isn t alone , Location central 
446806,Hotel de France Wien, I requested to have late check out and they wanted to charge me for every 1 or 3 hours extra I have staid there many times but Found them non responsive or helpful in this area Kind of cold, Staff are helpful rooms are a little dated but clean and good

446809,Hotel de France Wien, It was very hot in the room we went to reception to ask if somebody could check the airconditioning because it didn t seem to work We heard that the airconditioning was not functional yet because it could still freeze this time of the year When I booked this room it said it had airconditioning it s misleading Our room was at the streetsite so it was not an option to open the window at night because of the noice We both slept very poorly for 4 nights because the room was to hot and bad matrasses I would not recommend this hotel if it comes to comfort , Good location for sightseeing Vienna
446810,Hotel de France Wien, One small criticism on final night we booked a meal in the restaurant at a specific time at a particular table on arrival table had been given to another group We were moved into a draughty part of dining room Took two hours to get a two course meal When the apple strudel arrived it had obviously been microwaved and was inedible What a shame , Central location ease of transport from virtually outside the door Pleasant and helpful staff Well appointed rooms All in a all a very pleasing experience

446852,Hotel de France Wien, Not that it was a huge problem but the television in the room was one of the old type square and block shaped and very small also I didn t think they existed anymore Looked very out of place in the room , Well the breakfast at this hotel is second to none it was excellent with hardworking pleasant staff and more choice than you can imagine The bathroom was excellent also huge with nice toiletries supplied The location is also very good with the U2 station and bus station close by 
446853,Hotel de France Wien, Business center was closed and I was unable to print boarding pass Better choose rooms facing back street Maria Theresia Str and not the rooms facing Ring could be noisy sometimes , The room was spacious bed was wide and nice Bathroom was clean and new Breakfast and staff were very good

446867,Hotel de France Wien, See above , Good location Clean Great breakfast was included in our rate The pillows were well below par we asked for additional ones but it was still insufficient making for uncomfortable sleep otherwise the beds were fine TV was from 1980 Not of much use Wifi codes needed to be renewed daily with lengthy alpha numeric codes which was annoying but it was free so that offset the pain As rooms and food go in Vienna we got value for what we paid 
446868,Hotel de France Wien, This is not the 5 star Hotel it purports to be It is very tired and badly in need of an update Our room had the smallest bathroom and loo we have ever seen At least the shower worked and was hot The TV was an antique and should have been taken out of the room 15 years ago The bar was quite nice but expensive and the meal we had on the first night was not good and wines were very limited in choice and the one we chose would make a 2 euro vin de pays seem good which at 38 euros was a steal from us Had we booked a 3 star Hotel I would have been happy but 5 star No way , Location 
446869,Hotel de France Wien, the rooms on the front of the building are noisy from the traffic outside As previous comments it isn t a five star property but probably a four star, The hotel is in an excellent location Breakfast excellent The staff are helpful we changed rooms a couple of times and they couldn t have been more helpful

446881,Hotel de France Wien, Our room number was 334 and this was a horrible dark room with small size small double bed tacky furniture white tiled old fashined dirty bathroom and only one window We have asked for a change but reception people asked for extra money They have not changed our room till the last day of our stay which we can not appreciate since hotel was the worst memory we had in Vienna Room service did not change our bedding for 6 days , Location and breakfast were great During the six days stay we only have one good experience with the hotel staff Heba who has changed our room with a suit on the 6th day 
446882,Hotel de France Wien, Low water pressure in the shower couldn t keep the water temp constant Needed to renew the Wifi codes every 24 hrs , Clean and really nice room friendly staff good location near the subway and city center great breakfast though noisy because there were many guests at the same time but the food and service were great

446885,Hotel de France Wien, I booked a superior single room but I got a room with two separate beds which puzzled me a bit And there were no slippers in my room although they were mentioned in the room details Also I think the price for the breakfast is unreasonably high but the service and staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and efficient so I have nothing to complain about in that respect , The location is perfect it is very easy to get to the major attractions on foot Just a couple of minutes from the University of Vienna which was my destination for this trip

446889,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, This was our first visit to Vienna and we found a junior suite at the Hotel de France for the same price as a standard double in similar hotels My wife has got mobility issues and the hotel arranged the hire of a wheelchair for the duration of our stay and we had access to the whole hotel The staff were brilliant and ensured we were always content We recommend this hotel to all our friends and family The owner should be rightly proud of all his staff from his driver who picked us up from the airport to front of house staff to the cleaners Outstanding service thank you 
446890,Hotel de France Wien, Very warm in the rooms and a dated not very good tv , Excellent location Really liked the style of hotel not too modern Fantastic breakfast Comfy bar lounge area

446892,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, Breakfast and the thickness of the walls Exterior walls are probably 1 m thick and interior walls must have been pretty thick too It was relevant for us as our baby cried during the night and we believe nobody heard at least we did not hear other people speak flush toilets turn TV etc Our windows were facing the interior closed courtyard it was super quiet Breakfast was beyond excellent so much choice chef cooking eggs different types of fish fruits bubbles 
446893,Hotel de France Wien, It is only location that qualify for 5 stars the rest of hotel is between 3 4 There are a lot of basics that not is in place for a 5 start hotel and for us very strange how they can keep this rating Breakfast very basic crowded and noisy dining hall It s a nice hotel but and could see myself going there again but not to pay for 5 stars and only get 3 4 , Location is great Hotel also have a nice atmosphere even though or maybe because its old 
446894,Hotel de France Wien, The room was a little dingy as the windows were frosted glass with no view, The location breakfast and dinner are all to a high standard and good value for money
446895,Hotel de France Wien, 1 The heat in the bedroom 2 The tiny portions of food in the restaurant which were expensive 3 The restaurant was freezing cold , The fact that it was so central for sightseeing 
446896,Hotel de France Wien, Aircon did not work and heating was overwhelming as a consequence we had to open the windows to cool the room Restaurant did not have in our view sufficient choice at dinner that said there are plenty of restaurants around , Very conveniently situated and the staff were particularly helpful Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice rooms were spacious 
446897,Hotel de France Wien, Booked 2 similar rooms but received 2 different rooms as surface Asked for a room change and was denied due availability After they told me that I got upgraded for one room but they were not convincing As there was no way to sort it out and didn t want to litigate I accepted the situation It was one night only Even if it would have been true their statement the way they msnaged the issue was not convincing and I left with the impression I was actualy downgraded on one room and not upgraded Regardless of this incident hotel is nice A bit dated but nice , Location is great and easy access to public transport 
446898,Hotel de France Wien, 2 single beds pushed together to make a larger bed is not really appropriate for a 4 star hotel, The location and staff were excellent as was the breakfast

446900,Hotel de France Wien, The hotel is in need of a renovation It was not shabby but clearly was not what it used to be We were forced to wait in a line for breakfast for more than 10 minutes as they were so busy Multiple groups were seated at the same tables due to lack of space It was more surprising than off putting but worth mentioning here , Good location steps from the old town and a major public transport hub Good variety for the hotel breakfast 
446901,Hotel de France Wien, Slow service in the bar, Thank you to the hotel for our upgraded room from deluxe double to a junior suite Excellent location within walking distance of many museums sights
446902,Hotel de France Wien, Only concern was from a safety aspect the windows of our room open wide and no restriction to opening as in other hotels we have stayed at The potential for a fall as the room was on the 5th floor especially if young children were using the room , The location of hotel to underground station The size of our room and the selection for breakfast was vast 
446903,Hotel de France Wien, There is a little annoyance hazard of climbing into the bath tub if you are a senior citizen I traveled with older parents and cousins and they had hard time in the shower , Location Location Location And breakfast 
446904,Hotel de France Wien, We came our hotel at 11 o clock at night there was a terrible noise of ventilation in the room We asked and they changed it with another room but before reseptionist Joyce asked us that we use the room in 5 minutes or not The changed room is quite small and the bed is combining with two separate single beds in the room We asked again about changing to Joyce She was so rude We didn t feel like guests She wasn t willing to solve the problem on the contrary she made the problem so that I had a back surgery and I informed her about that After the sleppless night we spoke with manager Ms Zahra and she solved our problem immediately she changed our room with a room in the upper segment and she showed the necessity sensitivity We thank Ms Zahra for everything , Location and breakfast are wonderful

446910,Hotel de France Wien, You will hear the noise from your neighbor bathroom when they use it Room floor covered with carpet when you move in the room you will hear the noise of your steps come from everywhere like you are moving on steel TV is the oldest that you will ever see , Location is excellent at the metro station close to everywhere Staff was always supportive Breakfast fully meet any expectations 
446911,Hotel de France Wien, Gym might be better equipped and a pool would be ok in a 5 stars hotel but that is not a big deal , We picked it because of a promo It s definitely no super luxurious thing but overall very good spot Clean and large rooms great breakfest right in the downtown 
446912,Hotel de France Wien, it is one of the worst 5 star hotels I have ever visited in Vienna In fact me and my wife were shocked for such an overpriced hotel the service was extremely poor horrible smell in every corridor we walked in to It smelled horrible , The location is an excellent location that s it 
446913,Hotel de France Wien, In the morning there was lots of hot water to bathe but in an evening it took a long time for the water to come hot , The location of the property near all forms of transport was excellent

446917,Hotel de France Wien, The bedroom was far too HOT And it could not be cooled down as the air conditioning had been turned off for the winter It seems to me that the Management do not put the comfort of the customers first We were told that several other customers had also complained about the heat in the bedrooms even although the radiators were turned off , Breakfast was very good
446918,Hotel de France Wien, Only able to control the room temperature by opening the window as airconditioning temoerature control not available in the winter The outside noise was too unbearable so we were too hot most of the time, Very smart hotel close to the tourist areas Excellent breakfast 
446919,Hotel de France Wien, Make sure you double check arrangements of transfer taxis with the hotel , Staff very helpful and friendly Elegant hotel but decor could do with an update We had a fantastic room though Breakfast amazing Underground links metres away To eat you must visit Leupolds minutes around the corner Ask the hotel staff for directions Good traditional food and beers reasonably priced St Stephans 15 mins interesting walk You can take in Hofburg Palace on the way and many other landmarks 
446920,Hotel de France Wien, Because it was November the air conditioning was off and the room was hot we had to open the windows and that made it very noisy at night, The cleaner was in our room when we arrived back from breakfast and he checked the room key in the door to ensure it was our room before we entered that was very good
446921,Hotel de France Wien, Too old hotel in need of big renewal e g TV in old style hold beds with spoiled frame Be careful my card was charged for something I did not take from the minibar , Nothing It s a trap Booking should avoid to present this hotel in its archive 
446922,Hotel de France Wien, Didn t like having breakfast downstairs due to main dining area full which meant we had to go up and down stairs carrying hot cups of coffee tea then go back up and down a few times to get the food fresh fruit cereal then back up for hot selection then back up if you wished toast pastries etc by which time coffee was cold and to be honest couldn t be bothered Bedroom was tired looking ESP for a superior room thought it quite small no mirror in bedroom husband had to wait until I had showered hair dried and make up on in bathroom before he could shower Temperature in room uncomfortable too soft pillows personal comment , The staff we came across were so nice At check in the girl was really helpful with information she gave us The main public areas were really nice and spotless Breakfast selection very good
446923,Hotel de France Wien, Whilst the reception staff were very efficient assistance with arrangements did not quite meet our expectations , An excellent breakfast with choices to suit all needs and tastes Restaurant staff porters and cleaners all helpful and friendly Well placed for access to the centre 
446924,Hotel de France Wien, Breakfast was good but some food that should have been hot was rather cold , Location hotel next to metro Lovely hotel lovely staff Breakfast great choice of food Close to Xmas market 
446925,Hotel de France Wien, The mattresses were a bit uncomfortable a little old , The personnel were extremely courteous and helpful The hotel itself is lovely with beautiful lobby and restaurant The location is ideal within walking distance of everything but not too noisy 
446926,Hotel de France Wien, There were no normal teabags and milk in the room Only coffee is provided Just a minor thing really , Very friendly and helpful staff We booked an early morning trip so we were too early for breakfast however one of the staff brought us coffee and croissants in the comfy chairs in the foyer instead The location was ideal for walking into the centre and the weather was lovely Comfortable bed and large room Would definitely recommend this hotel 
446927,Hotel de France Wien, The room was far too hot no climatisation the heating was well covered but the button for closing the heating down was well hidden We had to open the window but it was very noisy outside No selection of room temoerature This is bad for a 4 star hotel , Good location excellent breakfast

446931,Hotel de France Wien, I was in a short visit to Viena due to a medical issue I was with my daughter 8 years old The personel at the reception was nice at check in Nothing special When entered in my room the Tv a very old one by the way was on My daughter started to look for a Disney Channel Hard to believe but on channels 23 or something there were porno scenes It is correct that there was a pay channel and there was some interogation menu on screen but it was absolutely transparent I was absolutely shocked about they ignorance It was 16 00 in the afternoon In Romania audio visual law it is very strict It seems that at Hotel de France kids are able to acces such channel in a split of a second Crazy ignorance I was asking for a wake up call at 7 45 Unfortunately an old interphone system does not allow you to call direct to the reception I asked later and they told me that I have to call like a regular call I asked for a wake up call At 8 10 I was in the room preparing for breakfast There was no call And now the funny part When I checked out they asked me about the minibar The answer was negative But before I was preparing to leave the reception they said Oh mister you have to pay 0 60 euro for your call You called in town They maybe wanted to say You called us because the stupid system does not allow an internal call you call us for a wake up call we forgot to give you the wake up signal but you stil have to pay I am not a professional in the hotels rating but I would give a 3 stars The main advantage is location in Viena and bonus you can get some porn too , Very close to city center 
446932,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, The authentic look and feel of the hotel ie when in Vienna feel like you are experiencing a bit of Vienna The breakfast choices were exceptional 
446933,Hotel de France Wien, Our room was a bit old style in some details but worst of all was the view from the window grey walls all around not even a small corner of the sky even if at 4th floor , Personal was very kind and friendly Breakfast was a bit crowdy but really excellent in variety and good quality 
446934,Hotel de France Wien, Close proximity of tube also meant you could hear trains at night as a low rumble , Location on Ringstrasse made it very easy to travel on foot or by tram underground 
446935,Hotel de France Wien, The room was very warm as the heating was on all the time and the building s insulation is very good we had to have the windows open as much as we could Only a very minor point though didn t affect our stay at all , Bed was very comfortable breakfast buffet was excellent so much variety U bahn station literally a stone s throw away most attractions within walking distance 
446936,Hotel de France Wien, Room was way too small Stayed 3 nights had no place to store clothes, Best location near all the important Sights Loved the breakfasts Very varied top quality Help at hotel was so informative 
446937,Hotel de France Wien, We had to have a taxi that took a credit card but when he came he only took cash This was stressful at 4 15 am It was our last day of a 3 week vacation and we were barely able to scrape together the fee Stressful We could have gotten more cash the night before if we had known , The desk staff was wonderful So helpful with all our needs postage for postcards maps to the city Doorman Christopher helped my sister and I return our car to Avis after his shift was over Took us to the gas station a block away then took us to the parking garage 1 2 block away to return the car to Avis We never would have been able to find these things on our own That is really going beyond the call of duty He even arranged our wake up call and the taxi to the airport for 4 15 am I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
446938,Hotel de France Wien, Pillows in room were too soft only a minor detail though otherwise excellent Drink at bar was very expensive , Lovely hotel pleasant helpful staff great location very good breakfast if booking a taxi back too airport hotel provided a Mercedes Very pleasant drive Great value for money

446940,Hotel de France Wien, Noisy room first night poor television very old and few channels room cleaned superficially mini bar never refilled during our 5 days stay Hotel restaurant very modest comparing to the most Viena restaurants, Very good location staff s disponibility for changing room windows on the main road so very noisy Very compl te and tasty breakfast
446941,Hotel de France Wien, lack of seating area in room and the inability to keep the room as cool as we would like , the breakfasts were excellent the staff helpful and friendly and the bed comfortable
446942,Hotel de France Wien, We booked a concert through the hotel but they didn t know much of where we had to go to get tickets , This hotel is very central very close to the tram and subway easy access for all of Vienna The staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was amazing loved the apple strudel

446945,Hotel de France Wien, Staff could ve smiled more been more welcoming, Beautiful great food very clean staff helpful polite but not really warm friendly great location
446946,Hotel de France Wien, I think this hotel is for the business traveler it is location right on the ringstrasse away from main attractions it is about 10 15 minute walk to the opera house there are other attractions in the area , 4 5 start hotel
446947,Hotel de France Wien, Double bed was two single mattresses so some one was always falling down the gap , Location seperate toilet to bathroom was a nice change from standard hotel bath rooms power points by bedsides
446948,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, Everything was great Location right next to tram stop and metro station breakfast cleanliness The staff were all very kind and helpful Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Vienna 
446949,Hotel de France Wien, We spent 4 nights there without air conditioning because it was broken in our room Although the building is quite beautiful only 50 of the lights were turned on on the 4th floor and some of them had 5 out of 6 bulbs burnt out We suspect that the property owners are not concerned with the upkeep which leaves the staff to continually apologize for the inconvenience We would stay there again because everyone deserves a second chance , The breakfast selections were the absolute best The front desk manager Zarah went above and beyond to take care of us The location truly is wonderful inches away from the subway which makes getting around the city a piece of cake 
446950,Hotel de France Wien, The pianist Stephan was a pest Forced his CD to the few diners Management must stop him , the staff behavior and courtesy was superb the location was great and so also the grand breakfast overall a very good experience

446952,Hotel de France Wien, Nothing, Ideal location within walking distance of most places of interest Tram station only steps away Staff very pleasant and helpful WiFi good Breakfast was excellent quality and varied 
446953,Hotel de France Wien, Would have liked it if Fitness Center were open 24 7 actual hours 8 AM to 10 PM and if it had a recumbent bicycle but just a minor issue , Location was really great within 1 km of Stephenplatz and U bahn station was a few 100m There was a reasonable fitness center 
446954,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, We very much appreciated our lovely upgraded room with its view of the Ringstrasse The location of the hotel is perfect Just an easy walk from all the places we wanted to visit
446955,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, Only an overnight with an early morning call But we were afforded an early check in and the facilities and appointments were first class And the cocktail pianist playing even as we had a late nightcap topped of our experience
446956,Hotel de France Wien, I was expecting a bit more luxury as it was rated as a 5 hotel , Over all was good room look a bit run down other wise was good I would t rate it as a 5 
446957,Hotel de France Wien, No vending machine but it is OK because I could buy anything from convenient stores near the hotel , Very good because it is located at Shottentor subway stations and trails Very convenient to move anywhere 
446958,Hotel de France Wien, Room would benefit from upgrade of TV with wider choice of stations for international visitors, Central Location was excellent for visiting sights Proximity to public transport system Helpful staff Quality and Choice of breakfasts 
446959,Hotel de France Wien, Wifi set up was unusual and rather awkward to have to use a different password every 24 hours The wifi arrangement was not explained at check in we overheard how to use it from another guest s discussion and figured it out ourselves Not only that but several of the passwords timed out before the time specified when we signed in which was just annoying Other than that we were happy with the hotel and would stay there again ,No Positive
446960,Hotel de France Wien, Not a bad experience but expensive Parking an eye watering 28 per day , The location within easy walking distance of the centre and public transport right outside for exploring further Spacious rooms huge firm and comfy bed generous breakfast 
446961,Hotel de France Wien, Lighting in room too bright including reading lights Trash found behind curtains TV old and too small for the size of the room Toilet in separate room from sinks and shower Parking very expensive, Rooms were very spacious and breakfast plentiful Public spaces comfortable 
446962,Hotel de France Wien, Toilet room was slightly claustrophobic but nothing that would stop me staying again or recommending this hotel, Hotel was stunning and room was very cute and very spacious with magnificent windows Room facilities were good and comfort was ideal Staff were wonderful very welcoming friendly and helpful at all times 
446963,Hotel de France Wien, Worn dirty carpets furniture Horrible beds, The friendly staff rich common areas great breakfast buffet could not begin to compensate for the dingy stained worn guest room The beds were lumpy boards the pillows worn out

446966,Hotel de France Wien, Hotel was probably built in the 90 and a little refreshing would not do any damage The elevator needs to be replaced , The location is the biggest asset Very easy to get to the center 
446967,Hotel de France Wien, Always logging into the Internet for wifi , Happy over all except internet wasn t easy to use however we were up graded and we never asked to be but because of the Internet they offered an upgrade with better reception 
446968,Hotel de France Wien, The staff did not take guests requst very seriously It took us 1 and half hours to get our car driven from the parking lot because the staff could not find our key and did not bother to double check They said repeatedly the doorman was on the way to pick up our car But in fact they didn t find our key registrated to my friends room It was until 1 and half hour s later they began to realize what s going on ,No Positive
446969,Hotel de France Wien,No Negative, The hotel was magnificent Upon our arrival the airline lost our luggage and I was very upset We had no cloth and we had no idea were to go shopping A staff member suggested for us to go to a large mall in Vienna about a half hour away by subway She gave us instructions and my husband and I went shopping It was a large mall where we were able to find all I needs The last thing I wanted to do was shop for cloth on my trip to Vienna But it was necessary We received our luggage after three days Everyone was so sympathetic and helpful The location is just perfect close to all transportation Walking distance to the main attractions close to parliament building and the university In the center of Vienna I would stay there again 
446970,Hotel de France Wien, I found the room interier very poor no esthetic didnt have for the first night house slippers which are must have for me Air condition was broken couldnt switch it off for the night and were frizzing with little child The house is NON smoking had in my junior suite 4 balconies and couldnt go out for a cigarette at night Wifi u have to get a new code every day to log in Very uncomfortable , The bed was just amazing we were with my little son and it was very comfortable on this huge bed as we used to sleep together Breakfast is also great we used to be in 5 every time we are in Vienna but here the breakfast buffet was better than everywhere else 
446971,Hotel de France Wien, Room window was inside the building so no view just walls Wifi credentials were per device and for 24 hours then you need to go to reception and take new ones Very small CRT TV Safe is small you cannot put a notebook there , Room size is big exellent location and variety of food on breakfast you could even find sparkling wine there 
446972,Hotel de France Wien, Bath rooms are basic hot water has some problem at night Little expensive for facilities, Location central good looking building huge bar area good breakfast staff very polite and helpful Central Vienna a walking distance all restaurants close by and most of the attractions in Vienna 
446973,Hotel de France Wien, We arrived to Vienna on a Friday and it was soo hot unfortunately the maintenance of the air condition is not top priority at this hotel so we couldn t sleep the first two nights It s outrageous for a 5 stars hotel not to be able to offer a well airconditioned room but the appliances are so old so even if they work they don t function as they should I suggest that the management needs to change the air condition appliances if they want this hotel to be considered a 5 stars , It s very important to us to be welcomed and this hotel could do that very well the lady receptionist even called me by my second name which doesn t happen often in a reception The location was excellent the breakfast was superb Very good service all in all 
446974,Hotel de France Wien, being woken up by the cleaning staff wanting to clean our room at 7 30 am breakfast room very crowded This accommodation is NOT 5 star as advertised , Location for central Vienna very good good choice for breakfast
446975,Hotel de France Wien, Wifi was poor had to sit in a certain place for it to connect Having to log in everyday was a nuisance too , The breakfasts were excellent lots of choice The staff throughout our stay were great too Friendly efficient and helpful 
446976,Hotel de France Wien, 3 stars at most Hotel badly needs a renovation Everything is old and thus difficult to keep clean Bathrooms have mould on the walls Even the staff looks ragged and tired Don t go there there are so many options in Vienna , Very good location walking distance from almost everything touristic 
446977,Hotel de France Wien, The hotel must have been a de luxe structure back when Franz Joseph was still the Emperor It is old and in need of thorough refurbishment I was upgraded to a Junior Suite but i should have to be upgraded to another hotel Rooms are dark with old furniture old not antique good for a fireplace Moreover being waken up at 8am by housekeeping is not the optimum , The only area which could somehow give the impression yiu are in 5 hotel us the bar lounge e mat be the lobby
446978,Hotel de France Wien, The way the reception responded to my problem and how they acting but the manager the next day was just class , The location of this hotel is amazing and the old fashion style it got is not bad at all
446979,Hotel de France Wien, wrong behavior of the reception personel Despite my son is under 9 I ve been asked to pay extra 39 Euros per dau for breakfast and extra bad In the bathroom was an anthill ants Furniture is 35 years old minimum and last investments were done 25 years ago This is not a 5 hotel I ve been in many hotel in different countries but De France Hotel is not what they post on internet I was bad surprised how the room was looking for a doble superior room , Location is the only asset they have

446983,Hotel de France Wien, We did like Bedding not firm enough We asked for a double bed and got twin beds Air conditioning clearly old system that is not appropriate for summer temperatures in Vienna Wifi you have to enter codes that are only valid for 24 hours A code per device The hotel in general is not what we expected of a 5 stars hotel This hotel should have 3 stars maximum and not 5 Furniture is outdated including TV sets and needs to be refreshed Amenities like a pool or a real fitness area are not provided in this hotel , We mainly liked the hotel s location on the ring close to Innere Stadt Museums Quarter the Hofburg and convenient to get to the Belvedere and Schonbrun breakfast very large choice of food and good quality we were upgraded to a bigger room This room was spacious and comfortable 
446984,Hotel de France Wien, Location Not too close to the city center as mentioned in the reviews Staff Very rude and not helpful Cleanliness We found ants in the room Ranking The hotel is way beyond a five star hotel i ranked as a 3 star hotel I will never recommend this hotel to anyone Value for money The hotel is very expensive compared to what it offers, Room Spacious
446985,Hotel de France Wien, We were unable to get the same room we booked They upgrade us but the room was in the last floor facing the roof They pre authorised my visa card immediately upon arrival without my permission for the total amount which I don t like it I would rate this hotel as 4 star, The hotel very close to the metro station About two minutes walk Good breakfast
446986,Hotel de France Wien, Wifi is slow Staff Attitude Parking is difficult And We waited our car for about one and half hour but no one told us the staff did not drive our car to the hotel So we wait another half hour Although they apologized still very angry Facility We booked a deluxe room but air conditioner did not work at all , Location is good 10 minutes walk to the central
