314820,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, Rooms were good size and clean Fridge in room not a minibar bathroom facilities clean Breakfast was pretty good and overall was happy with the hotel Location was where we wanted to be but a good 30min walk to more central attractions in the heart of the city 
314821,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Cleanness of the hotel should be improved dust on the walls dust on the floor Bathroom cleanness was really bad Elevators was really dirty and I believe nobody was cleaning those for long time Staff has strange understanding about client service upon my arrival the reception lady asked me to wait and left for few minutes and she was discussing something with other reception guy I was asking her to serve me first and only then continue internal discussions with colleagues All in all the location is good hotel should be maintained better and then this is good place where to stay , Location is really good few minutes from beach 
314822,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The pillow was not in my size Could have ben some hooks to hanging clothes It was a bad smell in cups and glasses at the breakfast , The hotel is close to beach and close to many restaurants It was a fridge and a water boiler at the room Many shelves for clothes and bags Close to Metro and buses 
314823,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, i was only there for a few hours unfortunatel but the staff was very friendly and helpful the hotel clean and super good location for what I was looking forward to doing in Barcelona 
314824,Hotel 4 Barcelona, there was one of the employees at breakfast who was not as nice, they put me on a higher floor i asked for it and really appreciated that they considered my request
314825,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Nothing, The staff were very helpful I had a problem trying to download some documents for a forthcoming cruise and the staff at the front desk helped me The hotel very clean and very good value for money Our cruise was delayed very last minute and once again the staff were very helpful and allowed us to stay for an extra two nights when Barcelona was very full and the cruise were trying to find accommodation for 1000 rooms 
314826,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, We were given room on 7 floor so we had pretty nice view that was realy cool Also was nice that walking distance to nearest subway about 5 minute The same distance to the beach 
314827,Hotel 4 Barcelona, When we first arrived we were told to come back as we were too early to check in and that our rooms would be ready in an hour which is fair enough Came back an hour later and waited another 50 minutes to check in, The rooms were really nice and the beds were comfortable We were fortunate to have rooms at the back of the hotel so had a nice view of the city and the beach The location was very quiet and only a 5 minute walk to the beach We were a little concerned about how far away we were from everything but the most we walked was for an hour all the way from Mount Tibidabo If we wanted to order a taxi most of the reception staff were more than happy to order one for you Breakfast was good too their tea in particular was lovely Typical Brit missing good tea you won t miss it at breakfast The rooms and bathroom were very spacious with all the usual amenities Very happy 
314828,Hotel 4 Barcelona, No drawers and very small place with 5 hangars to place your clothes The room was not clean properly, Clean when we vit there the other 5 days was not needed to Ask for body soap toilettes paper the y gave you only two kleenex in a plastic bag if you asked 
314829,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Awful experience in the restaurant Staff member was rude and didn t seem to want to serve us Also food was not worth the money My pasta tasted like salt Mentioned this on check out and staff on reception said it is not run by the hotel I would advice not to go , Good size room and location was good 
314830,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Breakfast was hit miss Food items not topped up staff indifferent to requests for assistance , Located in a quiet district with some nice little bars nearby 
314831,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Used paper coffee cups were taken away from room and not replaced Milk sachets in room not replaced , In room tea and coffee facilities Snack bar available until 23 30 serving cocktails 
314832,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The area is not very close to the center and restaurant options are not as wide as they are closer to the center , Staff was very friendly and able to help hailing a cab when needed 
314833,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, we upgraded to superior 20 a night I originally paid 193 for 3 nights Your mini bar topped up daily and great view pLus free access to gym sauna etc The hotel was so nice and clean and staff were lovely It s a nice walk to beach where there s a lot of food places and stuff Rooms cleaned daily Excellent hotel
314834,Hotel 4 Barcelona, There was no alternative at the breakfast buffetfor those that don t eat pork some turkey or chicken would be nice And the cut fruit was too dry , Overall it was really nice and the reception staff was really helpful 
314835,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, Everything was spot on with this hotel My friend and myself was so pleased with the convenience of getting to the hotel the hotel facilities and the friendliness of the staff Do not hesitate to book this hotel
314836,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Generally a quiet area so any noise was exaggerated , The situation so close to the sea was excellent Walked for miles and not too busy although lots of cyclists and joggers Weather beautiful Summer might be different Easy to get Metro to town and I watched the football at the Camp Nou Plenty of good eating places
314837,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Scrambled eggs looked strange maybe artificial from egg powder Would prefereed a balcony but hotel is constructed without any balcony for rooms , Hotel is very well located close to the beach 5 min walk metro 5 min Barcelonetta 20 30 min The are is very nice even if there is a cemetery close Excellent restaurants on Rambla de PobleNou Rooms very clean and bed confortable We got an upgrade for our room we got a room at 7th floor overlooking Sagrada Familia and Central Barcelona Breakfast very tasty and large choice 
314838,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Breakfast could have been way better Bread was dry and milk was room temperature Food got cold after few minutes on the breakfast table Not much breakfast options , Place was nice close to metro and rooms were good and spacey 
314839,Hotel 4 Barcelona, This hotel has no option as a duvet and only a blanket Thermostat does not work properly at all The view was into the grave yard what was quite creepy Housekeepers tend not to clean the rooms at all only make the bed and change the towels and leave dirty cups or not replace with clean ones at all The room offers only paper cups but no tea coffee cups whatsoever and after us using them they are are never replaced Also no matching towels and all of them were teared apart or grey And the most important receptionists were ignorant and rude people in the restaurant were rude as well and rushing away after breakfast or moaning if you are using extra plate We didn t feel very much welcomed in the hotel at all , Breakfast was probably the only thing that we have enjoyed in this hotel Not far from the nightclubs that are alongside to the beach 6 minutes walk to nearest metro if we wanted to go into town 
314840,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Coffee from vending machine during breakfast not good barely had some diversified breakfast but quite low quality greasy and heavy Pillows quite strange really long ones , Hotel is clean and staff is nice Bed was comfy
314841,Hotel 4 Barcelona, room not cleaned properly shower slide bar broken and fixed with tape useless breakfast room overloaded waiting time absolutely not the right value for money would not recommend and also not use this hotel anymore, location
314842,Hotel 4 Barcelona, We booked a taxi when we checked in for the next morning to take us to the Airport There was a storm in the morning and we asked about the taxi for the airport and the man at the desk said it probably will not come even though we had it booked We asked how do we get to the airport and he really didn t care the people when we checked in though were very nice and helpful but he certainly was not , Nice clean and comfortable hotel location good 
314843,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Rooms are a bit small but fine as it is very clean and new , Nice new hotel with a top location near the beaches harbor and boulevard City centre not too far away 
314844,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Not really a 4 star hotel based on thin fraying towels marks on the walls leaky shower doors and no coffee in the room unless you pay extra In a working class neighbourhood not on a tourist street , Modern and clean 3 easy blocks from the Metro the beach and the local Ramble Breakfast was good Overall good value
314845,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Beds could have been comfier Mattress toppers needed Showers were dangerous Cold then scalding Breakfast room needed to be bigger, The view from room 708 was splendid Breakfast good considering it was included in price 
314846,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Dirty towels with stains pillows not very comfy, Close to the beach nice view Friendly staff possibility to store luggage and take a shower even after check out
314847,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Beds weren t very comfortable safe in the room didn t work and staff consistently ignore the Do Not Disturb on my door , Location was fantastic 
314848,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, We stayed for 3 nights during our tour of Europe The Upgraded rooms were spacious and had great views of the sea or the city Near to Icaria beach 5 mins walk the metro 5 mins walk and the hop on hop off bus 2 mins walk Ideal for a few days and on a budget Breakfast basic but fine Tea and coffe in upgraded rooms I would stay more centrally if visiting without the kids Secure parking 
314849,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, Was a great clean hote away from the main part of Barcelona but that suited us fine 2min walk to the beautiful beach and port area then around a 45 60min walk to the main strip the rambles Would book again Views from window where great you could see the city 
314850,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Strange to see that the hotel still use blankets on their beds Isolation for the noise from the traffic was not very good , Good location for beach and town 
314851,Hotel 4 Barcelona, A lot of water is coming out of the shower to the floor as there is no barrier No balcony Gym is not free of charge Breakfast is very basic It s a lottery will you get small or normal room, Not far away from the sea The staff was friendly and we were able to change our very small room to bigger one 
314852,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The service is bad and it takes forever just to get a table at the breakfast The fridge was not working and one personal said it was a pay thing while everybody else got it working and the next personal fixed it , Its close to the beach
314853,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Unbelievably expensive for what you get A couple of the staff quite grumpy and unhelpful Quality of the hotel definitely way below the public description they give of themselves It s on a par with a poor Travel Lodge ,No Positive
314854,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Next to cemetery may not be to everyones liking The area is a little run down bit felt safe We were given a disabled room then offered a room with twin beds then given a room overlooking the cemetery Although we had specifically asked not to be Finally given a room that we had expected from the onset Issues with water draining from sinks in all bedrooms Bathrooms get incredibly wet due to undersized shower screens , Location was reasonable with good access to subway local cafes bars etc and the beach Front desk staff very good The rooms are of a good standard 
314855,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The waitresses at the breakfast not very polite they should smile more instead they are a little rude, Receptionsts and cleaners were very kind and helpful
314856,Hotel 4 Barcelona, There is no room service When I asked for taxi they asked my to come down before they order me a taxi I asked for iron they told me come down and collect the iron The stuff not that friendly at all and they don t know who to deal with customers I was speaking with the receptionist and in the middle of our talking she picked up the phone while I m talking ,No Positive
314857,Hotel 4 Barcelona,No Negative, Everything were AWESOME but the AC was really bad I HOPE I CAN COME AGAIN TO BARCELONA AND EVERYTHING CHANGED TO THE BEST Thanq alot for everything Regard Abdullah Alzadjali
314858,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Noise from the streets Neighboring cemetery Far from the centre Walls window covers and bathroom was dirty because everything was old , I didn t like anything The value for the money was really poor 
314859,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Ironing facilities very basic Air conditioning not easy to set Earlier opening hours of Gym it only opens at 6 45 for some reason Like to see some weights in Gym it only has cardio machines and a Dated Multi gym English channels on TV only has mainly German ones , Comfortable Room Ambient Music in Hallways Helpful staff at check in Close to beach Good Breakfast food and breakfast room Good Wifi 
314860,Hotel 4 Barcelona, location is okay if you stay in the area if you are on a sightseeing trip you may stay closer to the centre bumpy wifi and temp regulation in room,No Positive
314861,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Perhaps breakfast could be a bit more various , Staff were really helpful Provided all the information they could No pay for early arrivial Pretty cosy and clean room Good wi fi 
314862,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Bathroom is good looking but NOT cosy no bidet disappointing control handles on the shower slippery shower water gets everywhere wet bath carpet disappeared the second day so I had to use a towel on the floor would have liked a coffee and tea maker in the room but I knew it was not provided few more minor issues , Kindness Room was on a higher floor 7th as I asked Not too noisy Nice breakfast Acceptable Fair bed 
314863,Hotel 4 Barcelona, After the flight the clothes in the suitcase rumpled Unfortunately there is no iron in the room to iron clothes As the hotel has 4 stars I think that the iron needs unto rooms thank you ,No Positive
314864,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The neightbourhood around the hotel is really shady There s a penitentiary for women just a stone throw away To get to the metro station you need to walk along a suspicious street with ppl looking at you like you were to do sth bad If you head straight to the beach and walk along it it s ok The queue for the breakfast was enormous There isn t enough seats in the dining room for a hotel that big When I was finally seated I went to get some food and in the meantime my table was given to somebody else and I was asked to join somebody There were no amenities in the room No pen no paper not to mention lack of iron or tea coffee which are quite standard in 4 star hotels The room was very basic like 2 star basic standard rather than 4 It was clean though The remote for the TV didn t work but I didn t even bother getting a new one I definitely won t choose this hotel if I go to Barcelona again in the spring , I was welcomed by a very friendly person and the check in process was quite smooth but that s actually the only good thing Apart from the fact that Barcelona is a marvellous city 
314865,Hotel 4 Barcelona, The hotel is not really close to anything else other than the beach It s only a few blocks from the train station though so can t complain too much , Walking distance to the beach The upgrades for the sauna and the view from the room was pretty spectacular 
314866,Hotel 4 Barcelona, I am really not peaky but in this case not sure where the 4 comes form but definitely not from quality not enough space in a dining room you will have to wait until others will finish their breakfast also stuff very arrogant in dining room breakfast very limited choice and rather poor quality bedding it was more a table cloth rather than bedding LOCATION long distance from most of the places you will visit , The receptionists were really nice and helpful 
314867,Hotel 4 Barcelona, We stayed in this hotel for a last minute decision to extend our stay in Barcleona The hotel is not 4 stars The first room they gave us was smelly and the hairdryer was not working I asked to change room and the next one was still not good Facilities are very poor rooms are dirty bathrooms have mould in the shower and towels were dirty brown and black marks We asked reception to get new towels and we got new ones but the following day we got again dirty ones The area is not nice old and smelly Not recommended ,No Positive
314868,Hotel 4 Barcelona, ocean view means also cemetery view but they were very nice and moved us to another room the towels were ripped the third bed is not comfortable at all it s a sofa bed some minor concerns with the cleanliness some hair here and there but it was not too bad , The hotel has a beautiful view our room was facing the city the staff is very nice and helpful it s nicely located near the Olympic part of the city nearby the beach 
314869,Hotel 4 Barcelona, For some reason a lot of the hotels in Spain do not provide drink making facilities such as a kettle which would be ideal for making a hot drink when you arrive late at your hotel Not overstruck on the area , Staff were very helpful 
314870,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Room needed a little maintenance No tea and coffee in standard room Corridors very hot Did not get the double room we booked No English TV channels apart from the usual news , Good location despite the area round it appearing run down Nice little bar Reasonable value Most of the staff friendly and helpful 
314871,Hotel 4 Barcelona, No fridge in the room This is more then strange from a star hotel Besides that the applies indeed , Excellent location 10 minutes from the Bogatell Beach 10 minutes from Llac na metro station thus all together 20 minutes from the City Excellent bathroom nice furniture very good wifi helpful and well mannered staff I can definately recommend it 
314872,Hotel 4 Barcelona, Rooms should be cleaned a bit better and it s not acceptable to leave new towel with stains As well bathroom sink was clogged and they were not able to fix it Hotel restaurant could be a bit better I didn t like that they wanted to charge me 5EUR day for renting a kettle and it was not possible to have a late check out However overall it was a great hotel , Location close to the beach McDonald s Metro station and lots of restaurants Staff was really helpful and nice 
314873,Hotel 4 Barcelona, 1 Not all rooms are equiped with a minibar fridge 2 Vending machines are not refilled regularly ran out of mineral water , 1 Easy walk to Bogatell beach definitely not as touristy as Barceloneta which is a PLUS 2 Restaurant El Raco recommended by hotel reception is just 5mins walk up the same road from hotel Arrived checked in late at the hotel 11 30pm due to flight delay But this restaurant was still open attended to our hunger Delilcious 3 Metro station Llanuca Line 4 is just 7mins walk up the same road from hotel There are 2 convenience stores at close proximity to the station entrance
