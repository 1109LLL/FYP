485160,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, The drive from the train station to our accommodation was not far would have been a good hour s drive if we had travelled from the airport Nice smallish hotel in a reasonable location We walked to the Milan cathedral from our hotel and it didn t take that long approximately 30 minutes Staff at the hotel helped with directions which was very much appreciated The hotel didn t have a restaurant so we dined out couple of recommendations from staff again Ate in an absolutely fabulous gourmet pizza place 5 minutes walk from our accommodation The best and I mean very best pizza we have ever eaten We have eaten pizza all over the world and definitely couldn t beat this one Room clean not big but after a bit of rearranging we could accommodate our 2 suitcases and move around still Breakfast reasonable but there is a charge of 10 00 euro s per person The hotel staff helped us with route decisions when we doing the Hop On Off bus this saved us a lot of time If you are in Milan and a bit of a foodie you should go to Peck an up market food place which is a bit like your Harrod s David Jones food courts Not far from the cathedral about a 5 minute walk All in all our short stay in Milan was lovely 
485161,Hotel Vittoria, The hotel was nice the staff was great but the rooms and hallways were so cramped i felt like in a UK hotel And the hotel it self tried so hard to be lavish and four star y that it was cringeworthy at times from the emotional shower in the bathroom to the dozens of vanity fair magazines spread on tables in the cramped corridor Not a major minus but still , Breakfast was pretty good Facilities were above average for the price we paid Staff was very nice and quick to help 
485162,Hotel Vittoria, The hotel advertised that the rooms had air conditioning We were in 2 different rooms on 2 stays at the hotel 10 days apart and in neither room did the air conditioning cool the very small room The second night in fact it was so unbearable that after complaining they gave us a separate which helped a little bit ,No Positive
485163,Hotel Vittoria, Well I am not crazy about the heavy use of floral patterns but that is just personal taste , Well kept hotel and rooms Great breakfast Very helpful person attending the hotel All was surprisingly excellent given the reasonably low cost 
485164,Hotel Vittoria, style of the rooms are for old fashion lovers small rooms small bathroom, hotel near Milan center kindly staff on receiption propose for us free parking on hotel places 10 minutes to center by walk
485165,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, We were very happy to stay at the hotel The staff was very friendly especially Alex and Mansur We had our daughter with us and we felt very welcome as a family Great transport possebilities and a nice area to walk around and feel the atmosphere 
485166,Hotel Vittoria, The bathroom was so small with toilet shower and sink all together about 4 x5 It was a hike 20 25 minute hike to Duomo so you d be better to take a bus or train Milan is filled with graffiti and was like NYC but without broadway , Beautiful hotel in a fancy style The staff was very welcoming and helpful 
485167,Hotel Vittoria, If I m really picky the room was on the small side but all I needed was a bedroom so it was no problem , Comfortable rooms with air con en suite facilities plenty of storage space and a comfy bed Friendly staff with a reception that seems to be manned 24 hrs Close proximity to the centre of town and easy reach to Milan Linate airport 
485168,Hotel Vittoria, The only issue I had was that the air conditioning wouldn t go to it highest fan speed and it would have been good if the temperature could have been a bit lower , The staff were really helpful and made good recommendations for local restaurants The breakfast was of good quality and there was a decent variety of options available Finally it was close to most of the major attractions in the city 
485169,Hotel Vittoria, For 160 eur per night you get 10 sqm room with bathroom where practically you cant turn around or use wc because lavandry is overlapping with it, Breakfast was ok
485170,Hotel Vittoria, unfortunately no international tv, I liked the kindness and the cooperativeness of the staff Very nice breakfast good situated hotel centrally located 
485171,Hotel Vittoria, Straight off the bat this review is based on a single occupancy room Its size was extremely small more for a child than an adult The bed was tiny and caused many a restless night as i found myself hanging out of it Mouldy food was in the fridge on arrival management were informed but wasnt removed The tv did not work and so a spot of sensless telly couldnt be enjoyed in the evening This was primarily down to the sky box and tv requiring two plug sockets but only had been installed The logic unfortunately was also lost upon location of the key card holder for the lights which meant you couldnt open the door without taking it out The sink was blocked and the floor felt and looked unclean keep those shoes on people There was no safe which was quite irritating as i didnt feel at ease to leave my passport in the room Being situated on the ground floor and next to reception also heightened the feeling of insecurity The interactive control for the ac and dnb was extremely temperamental , The staff were friendly breakfast was ok at 10 and if you like walking then its not a problem to get into the centre of the city within 40min 
485172,Hotel Vittoria, staff the fact we could leave our bags easily on checkout day the location was made better by the supermarket next to it and the mcdonalds on the corner, not a lot the decour is extreme to say the least we didn t getbreakfast due to bad recommendations and staff were moody like most people in Milan The day we checked in the guy on the desk took a phone call and made us wait all through a long conversation without even apologising rude and up itself
485173,Hotel Vittoria, Very bad poorly equiped bathroom the employee who is responsible for maintainance was not professional and also was impolite The land carbet is old and dirty and need to be change, Good location Housekeeping employee perfect
485174,Hotel Vittoria, Room could have been a little bigger and there was a door between two adjacent rooms which made it little noisy at night But this wasn t a major issue , The staff were excellent and helpful I was travelling with an injury and they helped me as much as they could to ease things for me The room and facilities are good and the location is excellent with nice restaurants and shopping centres The place is definitely worth the price 
485175,Hotel Vittoria, The room which I was apparently upgraded too was tiny and not big enough to open both suitcases at the same time The AC didn t cool enough and we had to get up 3 4 times at night to keep checking the cooling The breakfast was basic at best overall a very average experience,No Positive
485176,Hotel Vittoria, Air con didn t appear to work No mixers in the bar missed my late night G T , Decor was excellent very stylish interior Good facilities and friendly staff Sky Sports in the bedrooms as well 
485177,Hotel Vittoria, The room was very small and super hot The air conditioning didn t work and also the wifi was not working, Some of the people at the reception were very nice and helpful The room was clea
485178,Hotel Vittoria, Small room and bathroom impossible to move around Overly decorated and furnished definitely overrated not a 4 star hotel except for breakfast, Excellent breakfast and welcoming staff
485179,Hotel Vittoria, Due to the position of the hotel close to a main street it was rather noisy at nights but this fact was compensated by a larger size of our room in comparison to their standard room size There are no such 4 star facilities as slippers and glass cups in the room but the staff is always ready to help and provide necessary things , We liked the stay The interior is fabulous the staff is very friendly and ready to help the breakfast is fine and includes hot dishes scrambled eggs etc Great position close to the centre and 50 meters away from a good supermarket 
485180,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, The hotel location staff and the general atmosphere were just great The staff was extremely helpful trying to meet all the expectations of the clients No complaints at all A great place to stay 
485181,Hotel Vittoria, When ordering I made a mistake in the date I immediately ordered a new term and asked for cancellation of the original date but the response from the hotel was negative In my opinion it is not correct behavior to customers All decisions have their reasons but also the effect ,No Positive
485182,Hotel Vittoria, During check in I was waiting 40 minutes near the desk for registration issues to be solved without any welcoming drink although I asked a glass of water The square of room and hotel was not appropriate , Location Wi Fi Mr Massimo was very polite 
485183,Hotel Vittoria, There was noise at night from airconditioner, Hotel team is great ready to help and assist with different requests Breakfast is lavish and restaurant itself is amazing 
485184,Hotel Vittoria, Parking charge was 25 per night which is outrageous and makes this hotel expensive if you have a car If you don t then it s reasonable value for money The bed spread weighed a tonne We probably should ve asked for a blanket instead , As all other reviews say the room was very small but not an issue as hopefully you don t spend too much time there Bathroom equally small An ok hotel with lovely staff Great restaurant within 10 minutes called Il Pomodorino on Via Friuli was fabulous and great value 
485185,Hotel Vittoria, They have an agreement with the parking garage at front the hotel that cost 25 per night As they described that s a free parking Please be noticed ,No Positive
485186,Hotel Vittoria, The rooms were tiny and very stuffy Unfortunately the air conditioning was broken so staff advised us to open windows That was fine for those sleeping at the back of the building but impossible to maintain at the front because of street noise On top of this the walls were very thin so we could hear our neighbours personal and intimate goings on Not good There were no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and no tissues provided The TV screen was very small and there were no channels in languages other than Italian and yet the hotel caters for a language diverse client group The hotel was partly chosen because it has facilities for those with disability However there was a small flight of steps inside the hotel before you reached the elevator The bathrooms were also tiny So much so that you almost had to stand on the WC before you could close the door and when entering or leaving the shower you had to step over the WC Again not good for those who might be unsteady on their feet vision impaired etc , The staff were without question fantastic friendly helpful and polite They made the place The breakfast offerings were extensive and tasty The location is great and there are a number of really good restaurants nearby Try Le Specialita and Il Nodo for example 
485187,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, the rooms are small but amazing decoration and you have all yoo need all made with love also very friendly and helpful staff especially gabriele at the front desk 
485188,Hotel Vittoria, The room we stayed in was very small but for a one night stay this wasn t a problem , We have stayed only one night so we looked for a hotel close to the city center and from this point of view the hotel suited us well 
485189,Hotel Vittoria, Had some trouble making the AC system work properly and it was at least 30 C outside , Location and price were deciding factors when making the booking A short walk into the center suited us very well The room was small but comfortable and the bathroom big and excellent facilities The beds were very good and we slept well even if it was a bit hot Staff was friendly and helpful 
485190,Hotel Vittoria, The room was very high tech but nothing in it would work while you were away because your room key had to be inserted by the door That means we weren t able to charge our laptops or keep the room cool so we wouldn t be sweating when we got back in the evening to go to sleep Also the fridge only works to keep already cool beverages cool It will not cool a room temperature beverage , The location was ideal as it was just outside city centre which could be easily reached by foot or else the tram which was just up the block The bed was gorgeous the room spacious and the bathroom and shower were high tech The AC was nice for the hot summer nights of our stay And there was an amazing restaurant across the street for an authentic Italian meal close by as well as a grocery for drinks and snacks 
485191,Hotel Vittoria, The decoration wasn t to my taste and the room was small BUT I booked for the price and would have taken a smaller room if it had been cheaper I was happy and would return , The price good shower and excellent staff
485192,Hotel Vittoria, To start the there was only one soft pillow and 3 very hard ones after suffering the first night we asked for some other ones again the staff were very accommodating and provided us with soft pillows ask we asked , The hotel was a little gem The staff were very helpful and accommodating which made the stay even better the hotel was in a good location for the price and our room was spectacular Would definitely recommend and stay again 
485193,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, A rare exquisite balance between Belle poque tasteful decoration and hyper modernistic bathroom The small internal garden offers to the busiest traveller a harbour of peace and relaxation right in the middle of the most dynamic city in Europe 
485194,Hotel Vittoria, Breakfast was a bit disappointing Would have preferred table service or to have been greeted and offered a cooked breakfast , Good location within walking distance of Duomo Lovely friendly and helpful staff 
485195,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, The location is great and the hotel itself a very nice place Good breakfast and excellent coffee If you order a Spriz the bar don t forget to say you what kind you fancy Otherwise you get Campari o
485196,Hotel Vittoria, Old and dirty with uncomfortable beds and sheets rooms are impossibly small to expensive for what it gives, Friendly staff forgot some valuebles everything was stored and returned
485197,Hotel Vittoria,No Negative, We needed special arrangement for the Jewish Sabbath for which the hotel staff were very accommodating They knew what to do and what we couldn t do This contributed to making our stay very pleasant 
485198,Hotel Vittoria, The Internet passwords must change and ask everytime you come back to your room and no coffee maker in the room, Public transport and restorant are walking distance Food store and fast food just beside the hotel The shopping area the whole Street of porta vittoria To duomo city centre 15 min walking
