270475,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The place could use some spiffing up cosmetic not structural maintenance For example the court yard could use a major clean up hallways could use a paint job walls of our room had no decor , Great bathroom Excellent breakfast in a pleasant court yard Helpful front desk staff Spacious room with functioning air conditioner important in hot weather Attractive parlor with 24 7 coffee tea and snacks Excellent Italian restaurant Sole a few steps from the hotel Easy walking distance to many tourist attractions restaurants entertainment venues opera concerts etc Given central location in a capital city very good value for the money 
270476,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The personell serving the breakfast were almost rude Not a smile or a goodmorning Not a good start on the day Parking near the hotel is almost impossible We were told to park below the Opera were we would only be charged 20 per day After three days we ended paying 120 So watch out There is a small garden yard at the hotel but unfortunately it is not very cosy It could have been a great little garden yard but it is not The hotel is also lacking a bar or just a nice place to sit in the lobby after a long day in town The hotel was not too expensive so I guess you get what you pay for Big improvements could be made with small funds , The hotel is situated 400 meters from the Opera just at the beginning of the long pedestrian street The breakfast was good The room was nice and clean There was free coffee next to the reception which was nice The personell at the reception were nice and helpful We ended up walking whereever we wanted to go Didn t use the subway at all

270481,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The air cond Seemed not working during my last night stay Few times when I switched on the air cond and it automatically switched off , The location and ambience Very relaxed 
270482,Hotel Mailberger Hof, As windows are facing the courtyard it can be a little bit noisy in the evening or early morning but it depends how loud the guests are The only annoying thing was that guests were allowed to smoke in the courtyard and all the smell went to the room also it s not nice to eat breakfast when someone smokes nearby , Location was great and staff was helpful It has a nice courtyard where you can enjoy the breakfast Rooms are ok have everything that you need 
270483,Hotel Mailberger Hof, I have never encountered any bad situation during my stay at the hotel , Very close to the city main shopping street and many tourists attraction like the Hafburg palace Albertina and the Vienna opera Very helpful friendly and always smiling staff Very clean restaurant the breakfast is also excellent with a variety of dishes

270486,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Basically it s just a three star hotel somehow misrated very good though and very cosy , The hotel is located in the very centre of Vienna and serves marvellous breakfast 
270487,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Happy with facilities and close proximity to Opera house No complaints , The choice for breakfast was excellent and the new season strawberries delicious The provision of afternoon tea was thoughtful and appreciated
270488,Hotel Mailberger Hof, People smoking somewhere downstairs filled my room with cigarette smoke from early morning to late at night this was pretty awful The staff were fine but a little reluctant to help and there were no mirrors near the power plugs so I couldn t easily do my hair , Very pretty little apartment nice view open windows and very quiet breakfast was luscious and very beautifully put together 
270489,Hotel Mailberger Hof, No serving other than breakfast Courtyard could be really cozy if cleaned up Basically a good place to sleep and explore the city but not a place to remember, Good value for money great location 
270490,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Decor of corridors is not of highest quality but this is partly due to this being an older property , This location couldn t be bettered Very central within a 10 minute walk of the main central sites and public trasport but on a quiet charcaterful historic street The hotel itself is an historic building with a lovely quiet central courtyard and the rooms facing onto it are very secluded 
270491,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Bed was extremely small keeping me awake two nights Horrible approach to the room No lift goes there and you have to carry your luggage in narrow spiral stairs up and down Terrible room and really bad value for money despite the location advantage Will never stay there They charged so much for a 3 feet wide bed Literally Had never seen such a small bed during my entire travelling experience No dustbin in the bathroom Single pillow No adaptor to accomodate three pin UK gadgets , Breakfast was really good Location was good and that why I booked it being close to the city centre and the public transportation Staff was really nice and helpful 
270492,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Old bed a c not working at all didn t really need but you cant have the window open all the time and room cleaning apparently is just to tidy up the bed 5 days requires more than just doing the bed and replacing used towels , Friendly staff good breakfast with nice variety the lobby is great with free drinks and some food all the time couldn t ask for better location central and quite 
270493,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The hotel is a family business and guests are perhaps sometimes treated a little too much like family members, The bed and the room was very good and the location quiet

270501,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Pillows weren t great and I kept forgetting to ask for another until I got into bed at night , Great location within the Ringstrasse close to restaurants museums churches activities shops Nice having a guest lounge to use and free tea and coffee wifi good too Also Italian restaurant Sole across the street was beautiful food
270502,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Our room was on the last floor and the elevator was so tiny that only two people can fit in Often we had to wait for it to come to us empty , the breakfast was very good the location can not be better It is close to the opera to the Albertini galerie to the center attractions 
270503,Hotel Mailberger Hof,No Negative, Breakfast superb coffee available with snacks cake and nuts all day and evening in the lounge lovely friendly and helpful staff Room really quiet and dark at night more than my home Super bathroom with full sized bath situated in a quiet pedestrian way Annagasse 5 minutes walk from the Staat Oper where I went each evening 
270504,Hotel Mailberger Hof, There was a lift but had to use a spiral staircase to get to the fourth floor , A good hotel close to facilities Friendly helpful staff Good breakfast Appreciated guest lounge with free tea and coffee facilities 
270505,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The decor style is a little dated but we could certainly live with it , The room was large the staff helpful breakfast was good and the location was great Although the room was warm and there was no control we were able to open a window 
270506,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The breakfast can be better with more selections The rooms are big and clean but a bit old I assume they can go for a renovation , Location was wonderful we can not expect better just steps away from St Stephans church Near by there is Burger king and Wienerwald The staff was kind helpful For parking lot they offer 50 discount which I used The free coffee and soft drink bar was good 
270507,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Bed wasn t the greatest there were two single beds joined they didn t quite sync and were somewhat uneven , The location is fantastic and the room we had an apartment was really spacious The hotel is on a nice side street and there are good restaurants bars within a short walk The breakfast was excellent and included as well so good value for the New Year time where other hotels were way overpriced 
270508,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The decor in the bedrooms bathrooms Seemed rather tired No separate shower in bathroom and as a bathroom it looked rather dated But very clean , The location is excellent Great just to stroll up the street be in the centre of things Staff very friendly nothing too much trouble for them Breakfast superb great value when included in price No need for lunch when you have smoked salmon scrambled eggs to start the day 
270509,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The hotel is very old and already need a renovation, The location is great breakfast was very very very good The people who works in the reception are very nice Special thanks to Yaroslav for his help 
270510,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Parking is very expensive in this area upto 40 day You should ask at the hotel for the cheapest possibility , very nice staff especially the gentleman at the reception coffee and tea for free at the reception area No noise at all in the room although right in the city center Very good breakfast 
270511,Hotel Mailberger Hof, I liked everything, The hotel has a great location 5 min walk from karsplatz and 10 min from the stephansplatz I actually walked to all of the museums by foot as well Really nice staff and breakfast room was even bigger than on the pictures
270512,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Although I booked a refundable room the hotel blocked the price 3 weeks prior to the trip They made me pay again meanwhile I got a new card connected to the same account The card number was different which I didn t realize until later I immediately notified the hotel we exchanged a few letters but Euro 128 79 is still not on my account Paying two times for the same room is rather upsetting ,No Positive
270513,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Hotel does not offer evening meals although there are plenty of suitable restaurants nearby so not a real problem , The location is ideal to explore the old town of Vienna Easy walking to Stephens Cathedral Hofburg and Spanish Riding School Museum Quarter is also an easy walk away Our double room was large and traditionally furnished 
270514,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The hotel felt tired and uninspired Breakfast was only average and chaotic 2 out of the 3 mornings My pillow was horrible my husband s not bad It could all have been so much better with an injection of style and enthusiasm because there is plenty of potential in the building , The location is ideal walking distance from a lot of attractions 
270515,Hotel Mailberger Hof, I live here for 2 night when i checked out my package was stolen in the live room just 3 meters agaist the reception the staff didn t do any help and obvioursly didn t want to call the police she asked us to go to the police station but there s not much time left for us to the airport and we were forienger in Wien it is difficult for us to find a police station the staff did nothing about that so in my opinion this hotel totally didn t want to take any responsbility about the safety of the guest I will never promote this hotel to anyone never ,No Positive
270516,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The worst thing of all during the horrible Christmas season was the hopelessly drecky American jazzed up so called music in the breakfast room It is the kind of music that even musicians apologize for since they do it only for money , Although the breakfasts were generally excellent the coffee was a bit thin and mediocre 
270517,Hotel Mailberger Hof,No Negative, I ve never seen so with absolutly arrogance The hotel had me direct connectiion and never bothered to tell me that he has a problem That s probably the classic Austro Hungarian Empire Hungarians Slovaks Czechs are second class citizens 
270518,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The staff specially the restaurant were quite unfriendly even rude No smiling at all no effort to understand the requests and several times turned their back in the middle of a request Opposite they were rather nice to locals who were staying in Also the concierge lady didn t even said goodbye when we left kept on looking at the computer screen These are a few points to improve Also some minor tweaks necessary in the rooms such as the blackout curtains , The hotel is quite nice confortable and appropriate really very good value for money The male concierge was friendly and nice Breakfast is ok location is a big plus 
270519,Hotel Mailberger Hof, We expected a welcome drink and instead we were greeted with a heavy cigarette smell Having travelled all night we asked for a quiet room We were told the room would be quiet but the room were were given was separated from the next room with a thin wooden door We had to listen to the conversations next door and if we had known Chinese we would have known what they were talking about There was a lot of noise in the corridor too It turned out to be the cleaning staff joking around loudly The bathroom was disappointing Towels were old and grayish The shower curtain too was old and grayish The toilet seat was worn out on the outside and underneath The heavy cigarette smell was all around It was on the third floor in the hall and along the stairs We noticed some rooms had a non smoking room sign on the door and asked at the reception what that meant We were told that they were old signs All rooms were non smoking and the hotel was smoke free We said that could not be true given the heavy smell The staff member dismissed our concern and said we will check as though the smell was not all around us When we insisted she blamed a woman who had just smoked outside as the source of smell The fact was that the heavy smell in the lobby was coming from the staff room behind the reception We left for a walk but came back in a minute to pick up our umbrella The door behind the reception was shut confirming our suspicion , Good breakfast Nothing else 
270520,Hotel Mailberger Hof, No one was at the desk to check us in when we arrived We had to wait over 15 minutes and were rushing to get to the Christmas markets before they closed When we returned no one was there to give us our key Our TV didn t work either The breakfast was only fair No one was available to get us coffee , The location was very convenient to the major sites 
270521,Hotel Mailberger Hof, It would have been nice to have more television channels to choose from eg English ones, The superior room was spacious and comfortable The breakfast was really excellent with a very pleasant setting Coffee is available all day again in a pleasant setting

270523,Hotel Mailberger Hof,No Negative, I ve been staying at the hotel since the mid 1960 s when it was a family enterprise It is now commercial but so are a lot of hotels worldwide and new construction in Vienna This review is colored by memories 50 years ago when I first stayed at the Mailberger Hof it was a scrumptious little place in the Inner City hidden a bit from the mainstream foot traffic or in the old days auto traffic as well We also remember staying there in the early 1980s when we were making one of our personal pilgrimages to one of the most classically beautiful cities in the world At that time there was one apartment at the top level of the hotel now more gracious and large and we and our children now early 40s stayed there for a month Based on currency the hotel has aged a lot along with its furnishings and fun has transformed into functional It is definitely that and easy to recommend as price worthy and location terrific if you want to be in the First District 
270524,Hotel Mailberger Hof, A few hours after booking my international flights changed so only able to stay 6 nights No refund or Sorry even though I said they could sell my room Pretty ordinary for the price but good location Breakfast staff were like robots don t think they enjoyed their job ,No Positive
270525,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Nothing Would definitely stay there again , Quiet area a little ways from Old Town but cute area overall Great staff cute little place I love their elevator it s small but don t go in there after too many glasses of wine 
270526,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Room was maybe a bit small elevator is slow breakfast didn t have many options for pastries sweet stuff I didn t like the coffee , City center location nice surroundings personnel is kind nice building Very short stay so I can t say anything about facilities Continental breakfast for sandwiches and the like was plenty and good 
270527,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Would have liked the same room not on the street , Morning breakfast was good the location excellent the Baroque room a decent size and front desk very helpful 
270528,Hotel Mailberger Hof, nothing, the location of this hotel was perfect for us in a quiet street just off the main shopping areas the breakfast was the best we have ever have had in a hotel the ingredients were top quality

270530,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Rooms are outdated and need refurbish air con making big noise not all rooms are 4 stars some of them are max 3 stars also lots of noise from outside makes difficult the sleep bathrooms are very poor the toilet is not functioning properly Overall rooms are overpriced you pay mainly for location, Location reception front desk very supportive

270533,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The parking lot is far and so one does not want to take the car out We missed on a short road trip because of this Also we parked at the wrong garage as the location was not made clear but the price was the same , Location is excellent in the heart of shopping and touring Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice Beautiful facilities 
270534,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Unfortunately air conditioning can be noisy throughout the night whether you had it on or not Spoke to staff about it but unfortunately nothing can be done about it , Excellent central location yet in side street Excellent breakfast good choice and variety and could be taken in pleasant courtyard Good pot of tea if you like your tea in mornings Friendly staff Superior room spacious While the bathroom was not new it was clean and everything working in good order with a bath and hand held shower We had bedroom at front of hotel although can be a little noisy from the side street in evenings with windows closed could not hear anything There are rooms facing the courtyard In the lounge you could help yourself to refreshments any time of the day which was a lovely idea 
270535,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The stuff started cleaning rooms at 7 am and they were talking loudly on our floor , Perfect location in the quite pedestrian street but just a few steps from the center of the city Excellent breakfast and a good discount for the parking 
270536,Hotel Mailberger Hof, While the hotel was situated in a quiet street there was this reoccurring 5 second humming in the vicinity of my room at the third floor which could become a nuisance after a while Might be something temporary or very local don t know , Great location in the heart of Vienna Classic hotel Quiet pedestrian area no city noise Good breakfast 
270537,Hotel Mailberger Hof, We had to change rooms as the aircondtioning unit in our first room had a fault However the staff found us anohter better room without delay and the rest of our stay was exellent , The location was excellent and the staff very welcoming and efficient
270538,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The rooms are very good although starting to be in need of some TLC It is fantastic that it is so close to the bars and restaurants although it would be even better if there were also a hotel bar to make use of the garden in the evening , Brilliant location for a Vienna city break Literally a 1 min walk from the centre and a 2 min walk from both the Opera and Stephans Dom An old world Austrian hotel with welcoming and friendly staff A pleasant garden for breakfast although I assume it could be a little dark and gloomy in the winter A good breakfast and a good lounge with free refreshments 
270539,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Lack of interest and helpfulness of the staff on reception , Free Coffee and cold drinks available in the lounge area and the courtyard area for breakfast
270540,Hotel Mailberger Hof, See above, Very good position Comfortable hotel quiet with a great breakfast and a nice garden Felt the staff a bit impersonal Room cleaning a bit minimalist too 
270541,Hotel Mailberger Hof, It needed bacon as well as sausages at breakfast, Iced coffee tea and the free drinks in the downs stairs lounge greatly appreciated after walking the city 
270542,Hotel Mailberger Hof, everything was fine But may be they should increase the Air conditioning to a higher capacity since the room size was big and we felt the AC cooling could have been better, very friendly staff good ambience and breakfast spread excellent location
270543,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Common areas other than reception area decor starting to look a bit dated and in need of updating , Well located for centre of Vienna and quiet as on pedestrianised street Very good sized room All staff dealt with were very helpful
270544,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Windows on third floor were quite small which made the room a little dark but this did not detract from the overall impression , Excellent central location within walking distance of all the main sights and with very good transport links Large comfortable room with copious breakfast The inner courtyard is very romantic and quiet but because of the weather we couldn t use it 
270545,Hotel Mailberger Hof, All was great , Wonderful location friendly staff especially the morning desk girl Great breakfast and lovely lounge with all day tea coffee and soft drinks 
270546,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Property is very old and can do with renovation The staff made our stay as comfortable as they could but there is only so much you can do with a dying property , Location and staff was very hospitable 
270547,Hotel Mailberger Hof, We stayed at apartments since only they were available during reservation they are big but not practical No elevator after 3rd floor carrying luggages require horsepower No toilet and bathroom in the bedrooms you have to pass sitting room and kitchen to rich them , Excellent location great breakfast smart and professional receptionists Availability of beverages and snacks at lounge area at any time is excellent idea ang surprised us since it is unusual 
270548,Hotel Mailberger Hof, No parking at the hotel but there are private commercial garages expensive 5 minutes walk away, Great location in the center of Vienna friendly staff lovely courtyard
270549,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Shutting down the slightly noisy climate compressor in the court would make having breakfast even more relaxing , Having breakfast in the relaxing court with salmon and champagne is oustanding

270552,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Don t expect great things as rooms and general areas are faded glory One of the beds was most uncomfortable sloping and I switched to the other one Problems with television solved promptly by staff , The staff are a credit to this hotel So helpful and friendly Great location as close to the Opera house on a quiet lane with handy restaurants Breakfast very nice including smoked salmon scrambled eggs croissants Very user friendly as a place to stay Coffee in the lounge with snacks gratis Able to store my bag for a few hours 
270553,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Superior room suggested ironing facilities but that just meant borrowing the iron and board from Reception Bacon and fresh summer fruits strawberries etc strangely absent from Saturday and Sunday s breakfast buffet when they had been available in the week and staff were less likely to replenish supplies generally it was like they d clocked off for the weekend Unfortunately this presents guests with an imbalanced service penalising weekend visitors Biggest gripe though was towels and loo roll both of which were poor quality and rough Towels weren t changed during 4 night stay and one also had fake tan or makeup ingrained from an earlier user slightly making me question whether they d been washed at all before I arrived Just a few small negative points that could easily be rectified but they let the overall experience down , Hotel has charm some historic features a nice breakfast room and courtyard and is in a fantastic location Staff helpful and speak good English Beds were comfortable and room adequately equipped Good selection at breakfast during the week days 
270554,Hotel Mailberger Hof, How there can be a 4 star hotel without bar and restaurant OK not a big problem when there are several bars within 50 meters but I just wonder Shoe shining machine which I don t usually need but on this time I would have really appreciated it was out of color and not working not even after a complaint , Well I like this kind of small hotels where you don t feel yourself as a customer of a faceless big hotel chain The location was the main reason I chose this hotel and it was not a disappointment

270558,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Unfortunately it was a construction work just in front of the hotel it brought some inconvenience It was noisy all day and not very comfortable to walk to the hotel Wi fi didn t work properly , Location is great staff is very helpful the breakfast is average I liked the style of the hotel 
270559,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Could you include muesli among the cereals It has been on offer on previous occasions , Always helpful friendly staff and very comfortable and quiet Breakfast an extensive spread of virtually anything you could want 
270560,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Possibly a better room overlooking the courtyard but then we had to arrive late and we didnt choose to upgrade, Excellent location for the Opera House and Imperial Hofburg shopping restaurants and nightlife Friendly helpful staff the continental breakfasts provided without extra cost were excellent

270567,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The mattress was not comfortable nor were the floppy saggy pillows and there was no top sheet just a comforter The worst thing was that the bathrooms had a bad smell I assume the plumbing is very old I had to change room because of it and while the second one didn t smell as much of sewage as the first one it did have a slight bad smell Really unpleasant I had to keep the door closed at all times and spend as little time as possible in the bathroom Finally the Wifi quality was terrible in both rooms I stayed in It was not possible to video Skype or video Facetime and even audio Facetime kept breaking up Really frustrating Overall the hotel is old and tired and really in need of refurbishment Definitely not a 4 star hotel I would not go back , The staff were friendly the location is really excellent the Superior Double rooms are spacious if dark

270579,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Nothing but I had an apartment on the second floor but I had to go to the third by the lift and downstairs to the second , I liked the location which is near to everything the staff is helpful whom booked many trips for me
270580,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The apartment initially given us was very large as per description but old in bad conditions and smelly We complained and probably also because the hotel wasn t full after the weekend we were given a very nice and large room for the second and third nights , Our room for the second and third night was recently renovated and very confortable The hotel is in a very central location most museums palaces and churchs are at walking distance Excellent breakfast 
270581,Hotel Mailberger Hof, We had paid for a superior room and had a very poor bathroom with a cracked basin and a shower over a bath only which made getting in and out more difficult At most this was of two star quality , Great location and excellent breakfast and a nice room 
270582,Hotel Mailberger Hof, The room is much more simple comparing to how it looks on the pictures I would say this hotel would be great if the room price would be less No parking, Very good location in the middle of everything
270583,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Some renovations might help the floor coverings are worn out Some reconsideration of the room decor would make the rooms more friendly though I believe that the owners think that an Old Vienna decor is more appropriate, The location was ideal It could not be more central and yet not noisy A lot of restaurants next door Within walking distance to everything Breakfast was lovely and tea coffee cakes are offered to guests round the clock in a nice side room near the lobby The staff make all the efforts to provide maximal comfort

270595,Hotel Mailberger Hof, Some essentials like tea coffee in the room electric kettle water boiler bath robes etc were missing in the room , The bet part was the central location of the hotel Hofsburg palace Karlplatz subway station and lots of cafes and shopping areas were at a walkable distance The staff was very helpful Overall the place was excellent value for money
