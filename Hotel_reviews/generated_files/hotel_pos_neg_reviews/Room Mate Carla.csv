374881,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, The staff particularly Erika were beyond helpful and sincerely got pleasure from making things easy for me from booking entrance tickets willingly to securing transport to giving me travel advice and even bringing me a fan to take on an excursion because they worried I d be hot The fabulous room equipped with excellent minibar was just a bonus Breakfast was very good as well

374883,Room Mate Carla, Stayed in this hotel for my birthday and my friend requested a birthday cake for me as a surprise The hotel noted the request but did not do anything in relation to this Was also told at Reception while checking in that they ve got a surprise for me for my birthday yet they haven t done anything a bit disappointing but overall a good stay , The hotel is situated 10 minutes away walking from the main shopping strip and it s 20 25 minute away in a car from the beach 
374884,Room Mate Carla, We really loved our days on Room Mate Carla A few things to say about what we disliked 1 The bed wasn t double as described on your site that means there are 2 2 The breakfast was the same every day 3 Too much noisy in the morning for us despite the fact we asked a quiet room when booked it , We appreciated the coffee the cleanliness and the design of the room the mini bar was v good the hotel location 
374885,Room Mate Carla, none, Very kind staff especially Patricio who helped us find another night in the hotel and he gave us discount with free breakfast thank you so much very spacious rooms and has a wide flat screen TV my 2 year old enjoyed in this hotel and the breakfast was also very good with a wide selection 
374886,Room Mate Carla, Twin room not available on arrival even though this had been requested via booking com and then through email direct with the hotel A twin was obviously available but for a higher rate which should have been waived in my opinion , Super comfy bed and all round impressive hotel Local pizzeria Pizzeria Eden on carrer de proven a one road away was absolutely excellent and could not recommend more All local bars and restaurants fabulous plenty to do all with easy access from the location of the hotel Short walk to Sagrada Familia Will probably stay at a room mate hotel again 
374887,Room Mate Carla, The bathroom door did not close properly and the shower curtain is a poor choice for this kind of hotel, The location is great The personel was really helpful The breakfast was good The room was quiet 
374888,Room Mate Carla, Nothing I d love to have a gym but that s not a big deal for a short stay , Beautiful hotel as most of their other hotels Staff was very helpful as they helped me get a doctor come to my room when I got sick Location is great and close to everything especially if you are familiar with Barcelona Plenty of food cafes and shopping around 
374889,Room Mate Carla, Very small rooms Glass door to the bathroom makes it not very soundproof so maybe not recommended to romantic couples , Great location and great breakfast Posh design of the reception areas and rooms 
374890,Room Mate Carla, A couple of minor things toilet flush a bit loose and sockets for chargers not working but very minor quibbles, Staff friendly and helpful nice breakfast great location and room s design
374891,Room Mate Carla, The breakfast is very simple but for the price they charge is ok , We booked the hotel the night before we arrived Most 5 hotels were fully booked and we did not have a lot of options but it ended up being a good thing The hotel surprised us very positively The location is very nice The bed is really comfortable The staff is kind and always available to help We have a young baby boy and they prepared a crib with blue bedding set And the air conditioning really works not a reality in all hotels in Europe 
374892,Room Mate Carla, There was practically no separation between bathroom and the rest of the room , The location and design of the hotel High speed internet available everywhere
374893,Room Mate Carla, Maybe a bit overpriced , Nice decoration very minimal and modern style Bathroom was nice and spacious Excellent choice for young couples and group of friends Direct bus to Barceloneta in 20 minutes In general very good location near Casa Mila Casa Battlo metro and train station and shopping and bar restau area Recommended 
374894,Room Mate Carla, Some gypsies around the corner robbed a friend of mine not the hotel s fault at all but would appreciate it if they d scare them off when they re essentially at their door , Fantastic location decor cleanliness and ambiance Their rooms are so fun and modern Shower is to die for 
374895,Room Mate Carla, Everything was great , The staff and attention to detail were exceptional Especially Erica at reception who went out of her way to make us feel at home and so welcome She was also so helpful with all our requests for directions and assistance 
374896,Room Mate Carla, Our only complaint was that there was no replacement for the drinking water which was probably due to a communications breakdown on our side when we mentioned it to the housekeeping staff , The people on reception were excellant very warm greetings when we arrived always willing to help and give advice and very cheerful Erika Excuse me if this is the wrong name I m terrible with remembering names was especially helpful offering us a free wi fi egg which was very useful when roaming around the streets giving us good suggestions on where to eat etc The hotel had a great vibe in general and the room which was for three was more spacious than we expected 
374897,Room Mate Carla, I paid in full for my 7 nights stay at the hotel before I checked in and yet on the day when I checked out the reception staff asked for an extra 16 for tourist tax This should have been included into the rates or stated on booking com very disappointing , The facilities provided in the room are very good The house keeping was very good as well 
374898,Room Mate Carla, The room was very small and the window looked at the window of the room 10 ft away so we could never have the curtains open Yes we could have paid for an upgrade but we had spent quite enough already on the trip and were just at this hotel 3 nights with not much time in the room I couldn t justify the expense and for the amount suggested for the upgrade I could have booked a better room to start with rather than going over budget on site It would be fine for one person but 2 luggage sets created a very tight space , Loved the d cor Colors were vivid but calming Sophisticated vibe Room was clean with good not great wifi Eixample has many nice shops and restaurants and Gothic Quarter was not too far to walk Much quieter and less party oriented area than Gothic Quarter where we had stayed first with other family Hotel is not really near train bus airport but not so far to make it feel inaccessible We walked everywhere including from the hotel to Park Guell but when checking in and out we felt the need to use taxis to the train and bus station so we didn t drag our luggage so far Liked the ice water and apples in the lobby Very refreshing Room was very quiet 
374899,Room Mate Carla, Noise from the traffic outside is horrible This is not hotel issue rather whole Barcelona issue You can t open the windows literally you can t sleep , Staff is the best Breakfast is really good Rooms are immaculately clean thanks Vanessa Hotel is really in noble part of the city We even got the balcony 
374900,Room Mate Carla, Requested a twin room but didn t get always a bit awkward The bathroom is open planish with a non soundproof toilet No view , The hotel like all of the Room Mates I ve seen was sleek and modern and cool and the rooms really cleverly designed Breakfast was 8 and good value This is in a cool district and close to Sagrada Familia and good places to eat 
374901,Room Mate Carla, Street is a little too busy but street noise cannot be heard inside the room, Breakfast was ok location just great Nice balcony with view on Sagrada Familia
374902,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, The staff at the restaurant that served the breakfast was just phenomenal The attention that I recieved made me feel at home even on the day of check out they gave me excellent service Thank you 
374903,Room Mate Carla, The room was very small considering the price A couple of the staff at the reception were quite rude indifferent I asked for an iron in my room before arriving that did not happen They tried to charge me for things from the mini bar when I did not use it , The breakfast was nice The room was clean 
374904,Room Mate Carla, The loud isolation of windows could be better the first room which was given to us was a disaster and like cave with a view to a apartment space Many people smoked at non smoked rooms therefore it smelt so bad especially in the mornings , Location was quite good 
374905,Room Mate Carla, The 1st room we have which they happily change when we asked for a bigger one was very small Even though the breakfast is very nice they can change some of the hot and or cold items every day , The hotel has a very nice atmosphere The staff is very friendly and helpful and the 2nd room we have was spacious and nice The breakfast is great There are plenty of nice restaurants within 10 minutes walk and all the high end boutiques are within the same radius 
374906,Room Mate Carla, Could not controll temp wi FI slow , Nice buffet breakfast only 8 50 euro Odd bathroom arrangement but big walk in shower small single bowl sink Enough room 
374907,Room Mate Carla, The dark colour use between rooms and in restaurant, The location very nice near to Al Rumbla street and all shopping area The city Tour Bus station very close can visit heart of City by walking 
374908,Room Mate Carla, Nothing, Returned to this hotel for our last 2 nights in Spain as it was our first hotel when we arrived and we couldn t fault it Spotless modern and well located with the best staff we experienced in all of our month long travels Maria especially was amazing as were her colleagues Upgraded to top floor which was extra special Made our last few days in Spain memorable Worth the money 
374909,Room Mate Carla, Nothing, Welcomed by lovely staff Maria was just a delight after a long 24hr flight Was upgraded to spotless modern comfortable room with balcony Breakfast excellent Great location surrounded by cafes restaurants and beautiful buildings Ask for upper floor if street noise bothers you but rooms well insulated Expensive but worth it 
374910,Room Mate Carla, As another visitor said it was a little difficult to find when on foot but maybe that s a style thing that goes with this cute funky little hotel , Loved the contempary style of the room The wallpaper on the ceiling and the bed was the best ever I will defiantly be back The staff were brilliant and helpful too 
374911,Room Mate Carla, The room was the usual good bright and cool concept that is RoomMate Ours was very compact and because of its position in the hotel had almost no natural light we had to keep curtains closed at all times as it was overlooked There are other rooms on the front of the hotel, Breakfast was excellent and the staff were very welcoming and friendly Smart neighbourhood near to the designer stores Reasonable value for good location in major tourist city The bed was very comfortable
374912,Room Mate Carla, The breakfast buffet is good value for money and has all the usual features But both the buffet and the breakfast area lack the inspired wow of the guest rooms The bar on ground floor near the breakfast area was empty during my entire stay It s evidently not working maybe it should be re thought There are no outside areas no roof terrace or similar , Very welcoming staff Thoughtfully designed room Central location and breakfast until 12 00 that s what really counts on a weekend in Barcelona This place and the other Room Mate I ve stayed at in Miami Beach isn t cheap but it s very good value for money No feeling of regret while settling the bill at check out I also stayed at the W which has better views granted but prefer the Room Mate Carla Design wise it achieves modern minimalism without feeling sterile Another plus instead of a bible there s a complimentary copy of the UN Declaration of Human Rights by the bedside 
374913,Room Mate Carla, Closing the only open area terrace in the hotel because of a private event in the convention room Apparently hotel guests aren t allowed to use the area because the terrace is close to the room ,No Positive
374914,Room Mate Carla, There are many rooms with view to pit But you can open window and have a fresh air But dark a bit No slippers Only Spanish language on TV , Rooms with view to yard are perfect Very good bed and pillow Pleasant linen Good hair drier and perfect choise of bath cosmetic Well secured entrance to hotel Wifi is normal Closest metro Line 5 Verdaguer 15 min walking up to Sagrada Familia Taxi to airport 40 eur about 20 min driving 
374915,Room Mate Carla, Could find the entrance when we arrived , Modern decor warm welcome at reception on all occasions great shower quiet room a rose on the bed for Sant Jordis day 
374916,Room Mate Carla, We had breakfast one of the days we stayed in the hotel I stayed in other branches of the Roommate chain before and the breakfast in RM Carla wasn t up to standards The staff was moody my sister actually was scolded as she picked up a croissant with a clean pair of pliers of the hotel but decided to put it back again The woman at the buffet went nuts on her about this Not a great way to start your morning and some parts of the buffet weren t clean The shelves from which you can pick up cups for coffee were sticky and unclean This is really a point of improvement for a hotel that in general is pretty fabulous , The beds at Roommate Carla are divine super comfortable The rooms are spacious and clean and pretty well equipped We had a nice view on a courtyard in the back 
374917,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, The hotel is in elegant neighborhood nice and very modern The stuff was very friendly especially Maria that help us with the rooms and to find our lost bag Rich breakfast Good location Close to the center and all sights Will be back again

374923,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, All the staff were very kind and helpful a special mention for Maria Nacho and Alexander who went out of their way to make our stay so enjoyable The hotel is modern and quirky and spotlessly clean It s in a good location within a five minute walk to the nearest metro There are restaurants nearby and Maria recommended an excellent tapas restaurant just a short taxi ride away The hotel doesn t have its own restaurant for evening meals but the breakfast was very good with a good choice of cold meats pastries and hot food 
374924,Room Mate Carla, Bathroom has no door Windows facing windows of other room There is no restaurant or any food service at the hotel You can only order food from Japanese restaurant Water smells and tastes like water with chlorine from the pool , Perfect location calm away from center madness and noise City center is still easily reachable Very comfortable bed Clean room and bathroom The possibility to make tea coffee in the room Nice interior Friendly and helpful staff

374927,Room Mate Carla, Our room was not ready on our arrival due to a late check out we were offered an alternative but I specifically asked for a front facing balcony when I booked the room so we waited in the bar with a complementary drink whilst the room was cleaned Only two milks on the tea coffee tray No table and chairs on balcony , The room was adiquate and the location was pretty good 
374928,Room Mate Carla, the bathroom door made of opaque glass had a problem it didn t stay closed There wasn t any locking system and 3 4 seconds after closing it the door was starting to slowly open we had to use a towel to keep it close wile using the bathroom Also the shower sewage was noisy we could hear the water flowing every time the shower was used in the neighbor s room , modern room and hotel comfortable bed good breakfast

374937,Room Mate Carla, In the double rooms the bathroom is not really separated with walls from the room Sort of a glass door which is not closing perfectly The sink is in the room and shower and the toilet are separted We have asked if a late check out would be possible considering we have checked out on Sunday when not too many tourists are checking in and they said is possible for 3 hours 30 euro 5 hours 50 euro , The hotel has a very good location just 15 mins away from Sagrada 15 mins away from Paseig de Gracia Nice personnel ok variety of breakfast The rooms are clean they come and make up the room daily There are amenities and if needed more you can request at the reception Free wifi works very good Even if you are a couple choose the twin bed rooms as they are superior size than the ones with double bed For a city break of 3 4 nights I would recommend this hotel 
374938,Room Mate Carla, A bit far from the nearest metro station the washing room facility seems a bit dated and dirty, Relatively spacious room sense of security provided by locked gate at the lobby
374939,Room Mate Carla, Too dark in the lobby and in the corridor Towels could be replaced every two days we put the sign to indicate no change but we were still given clean ones for all the eight days , The staff was great especially Maria R who saw to all aspects of our needs The kettle in the room was very useful Towels were clean and soft

374946,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, The staff was super useful and friendly at all times Loved the design of the hotel and the room very original and different from other places but retaining a practical aspect to it the wi fi connection was very good too and allowed me to take a couple of business calls from the room

374948,Room Mate Carla, Just breakfast repetitive Because we stayed for ten days , First thing you see The beautiful design of the hotel lobby security and staff smiling face Dear Ema Thank you so much to help us 
374949,Room Mate Carla, There were a few things on the large breakfast buffet that could be improved For a start the coffee even though Lavazza machines were present was average Maybe it is the coffee the adjustment of the machines the water or a combination of all Furthermore the prepared coffee from the two machines tasted differently This was certainly not the quality I have experienced with Lavazza in other places The quality of the pastries for a hotel in a city like Barcelona which is known for the quality of its bakeries was average They could do better The scrambled eggs and the bacon were overdone , The location at Eixample Dret is excellent The decor is very original The room quite comfortable with an exceptional rain shower in the bathroom and good flat screen TV The minibar is well equipped and reasonably priced Our room was interior and sound isolation was very good The staff are welcoming and very attentive

374953,Room Mate Carla, The music on the hall was a bit loud and you could hear it from the room The bathroom looked a bit like it was constructed in a hurry and there were some small details to be finished , Location is great near to almost every major touristic attraction Staff is very helpful and friendly The buffet breakfast was very good offering a wide possibility of choices 
374954,Room Mate Carla, We had booked a room with a double bed which wasn t available when we arrived we were advised the room had single beds The solution we were offered was to upgrade to another room which we had to pay extra for The room was excellent but we were disappointed we had to pay more However this did not detract from us enjoying a lovely stay at Room Mate Carla We would stay there again if back in Barcelona , We thoroughly enjoyed our stay The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was lovely and very comfortable Shower pressure was good and the hotel is in a great location 
374955,Room Mate Carla, Cupboards near the fridge have a sharp handle Would need to be shaved down or changed as I got a nasty cut by simply opening and closing the fridge Toilet is adjacent to the top of the bed without a closing door Any trips to the toilet if in a couple would be non discreet and or wake up the other person , Size of the room Location Staff
374956,Room Mate Carla, The tray for the shampoo and shower gel inside the bathroom was loose almost falling down which made the shower less comfortable Also when we had breakfast we found some knives were not washed properly There were stains remained on the knives , The location was excellent Walking distance from the main attractions in the city and La Rambla is also reachable on foot The hotel is new and modern with good service and facilities 
374957,Room Mate Carla, The decor was too ultra modern for me The lobby did not have a welcoming feel , The location was good Within easy walking distance of Sagrada Familia and other sites Staff were friendly and helpful 
374958,Room Mate Carla, We took room with terrace but unfortunately it turned out that terrace is in the back of the building surrounded by the wall so it was not a good choice , We arrived to the hotel around 11am and got our room straight away Staff at the front desk was really friendly and always ready to help Room was in good condition simple and functional with nice design Really comfortable bed Breakfast was really good we could find everything what we need Hotel location is really central so we could walk everywhere We had great time there 
374959,Room Mate Carla, We had a serious leak from the shower ceiling when opening the water Did not really bothered us though Only one couch on a 2 people s room sometimes was not comfortable The hotel public areas are very dark dark colors to the walls not much lightning Night club vibe We felt that there wasn t enough light on the room for makeup for example The air dryer was weak better to bring your own , The all place is designed really beautiful Our room was spacious standard With really large tv 50 inches I guess Reception was always available and very nice Since we stayed for 5 nights we got a free wireless modem with 5 GB to use around the city This was very kind and helpful Also the wifi on the hotel and room was great Breakfast was really good Vegetables fruits cheeses eggs cereal many breads and pastries Soy milk fruit juices espresso machine yogurts and more Location was very comfortable for us many good restaurants around close to the center but still quiet Really recommended

374963,Room Mate Carla, I was not given the room I had purchased The hotel said as the obvious excuse that they were fully booked and that it was the last available surly booking com would have advised before the purchase , We liked the location for our purpose but is some away from Barceloneta and Gothic center to walk 
374964,Room Mate Carla, They only serve scrambled eggs in breakfast You cannot order any other type of eggs And the breakfast buffet was really a bit limited when you ignore all of the sugary crap on display , The location of the hotel is good Close to Passeig de Gracia and Diagonal metro station Nice neighbourhood too The reception staff was very helpful with all of our questions and went out of their way to help with dinner reservations etc 
374965,Room Mate Carla, The room was too small My front door was almost touching the bed The view was into the small box courtyard with the window opposite my room distance of several meters I couldn t open my curtains, Well located The room was very clean

374974,Room Mate Carla, That it did not have a pool and found the bar a little boring, I loved the location The room was big and really liked the separate toilet with sink and the wet room so one could shower and the other could use loo or get ready The hotel is not long open and you can really tell by the look and feel of hotel very modern and clean
374975,Room Mate Carla, The room size is not as written Check the room before you accept to take it because the same room can varies from 16 sqr m To 24 Sqr m , Decoration and style
374976,Room Mate Carla, Nothing relevant maybe more choices of eggs at breakfast and the fact that the cleaning services were not always the same Usually the room was spotless but on one day we found our garbage bag on the floor near the door , The location was perfect walking distance from Sagrada Familia and Paseig de Gracia really quiet and safe neigborhood We booked the standard room which faces an interior courtyard and gets plenty of daylight but we asked for an upgrade and got the balcony room for 10 euros extra per night This room deserved every extra cent as we could see the Sagrada Familia and other beautiful buildings from our small balcony The room size is perfect with lots of closet space shelves and hangers The bed was really comfortable with two types of pillow The breakfast was included even though this hotel is cheaper than other hotels in the area The breakfast was surprisingly good not many choices but you could find almost everything you needed The staff was really nice and helpful Cool lobby with lovely music and perfume smell 
374977,Room Mate Carla, Some local info in the rooms eg bars resturaunts tourist attractions Decor and piped music a bit cheesey , Breakfast was very good Staff really helpful Clean and comfortable good soundproofing so slept well

374979,Room Mate Carla, The air conditioning could have been a little better The room was too warm at times Also our room could have been more spacious as we had friends who paid the same as us but had a bigger room Also our room did not have a kettle which would have been nice , The room itself was comfortable and bright The staff were always helpful when needed and water in the reception area was great The breakfast was delicious Lovely selection of food and the bacon was so crispy I could not stop eating it 
374980,Room Mate Carla, Nothing really to complain about Expect maybe could have more egg options at breakfast but anyway was perfect , Sraff was amazing couldn t be any more helpful Always there to help Room was beautiful had the suite was a pleasure to stay in Beds and pillows are incredible Cheers Mark and Olesya
374981,Room Mate Carla, no complains here for us well done , the hotel is about 3 blocks from passeig de gracia booked a room with balcony the staff were all super friendly always greeting guests and always at the reception if you need them very impressed with the room as soon as we arrived simple and beautiful modern decor the room was even better than the pictures definitely no false advertising here adjustable air conditioning ran without problem in the hot weather great bathroom with a lot of free amenities provided bed was extremely comfy that we didnt want to get up good soundproof lots of storage space big flat screen tv nice view of the sagrada familia on the balcony housekeepers were also very friendly and hardworking so what else can i say totally worth the money had no problems whatsoever would absolutely recommend it oh we wanted to extend our stay but the hotel was overbooked but the staff redirected us to a sister hotel directly at passeig de gracia awesome location and got us a room at a cheap price wonderful we re coming back in august and we ve already booked this hotel 
374982,Room Mate Carla, I believe that during our stay the hotel was fully booked At breakfast the staff could not follow in replenishing the buffet I also believe that the bathroom could use a little more details of design , The staff was very friendly and helpful at any time 
374983,Room Mate Carla,No Negative, The reception staff were extremely helpful and friendly Made our stay very pleasant A friend has accidentally left her wallet in the safe box and only realised this when we were at the airport We managed to email them at the main reception and they very kindly arranged for her wallet to be delivered back to the UK Exemplary service shown by the staff 
374984,Room Mate Carla, The bathroom was a bit old and in need of refurbishing Strange shower no matter how you try to use it you ll always end up getting the whole floor wet , Very nice spacious room Quiet even with balcony facing a busy street I really liked the hotel s design 
374985,Room Mate Carla, no working restaurant, good and quiet location You still have to walk a bit Great Brekkie freshly squeeezed orange juice Very motivated crew at reception
374986,Room Mate Carla, The breakfast could have a little bet more, Great staff Very friendly and helpful Room beds nice and comfortable The hotel in general and room always smelled nice and fresh Location is great 
374987,Room Mate Carla, The rooms sometimes were cleaned right and sometimes were left dirty and missing items like toilet paper tissue etc The phone in the room did not work and it did not get fixed in the 14 days I was there anytime I needed something instead of calling I needed to come downstairs The tub in the shower was broken so I reported it so I could take a bath it was fixed The towel holder was lose and ended it up breaking and hurting my foot My room was too noise having a balcony facing the street was not a good idea I had a bad experience with an employee named Noemi who insulted my intelligence a few times asking me to call myself the phone company if I wanted my room phone to work that was not my job , The location was great The staff at the breakfast area were warm and friendly The bed was very comfortable Some front staff member were very nice like Marta and Cristina they were amazing ladies

374991,Room Mate Carla, The Hotel was very quiet it had changed hands in between us booking and we were not told there was nothing going on in the Hotel to keep us there drinking so we had to keep going out we were the only ones who used the courtyard because knowbody new about it if tat, The bed was great the break fast was out of this world everything you could wish for 
374992,Room Mate Carla, that your very loud vacuum cleaner was used in the lobby which is next to the breakfast area right at the time when guests were trying to enjoy their morning meal , The big terrass we paid extra for was good value for money 
374993,Room Mate Carla, Maybe the breakfast doesn t have a great variety over the week but this is a detail really A pool would maybe be nice but since there is so much to do the great bath and shower already helped to relax after a long day of visiting and walking , Very pretty hotel nicely located centrally close to Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia Great hotel staff very good English very helpful nice and Always ready to provide help or information You could eat of the floor as the hotel was very clean 
374994,Room Mate Carla, No fitness centre Location isn t very very central Hard to find hotel as you can hardly recognise the sign for it outside, Nice breakfast but only one type of eggs scrambled and I m an egg lover so wasn t impressed
374995,Room Mate Carla, The hotel didn t have an outstanding sense of cleanness Specially shower and hallways that although dark you could see them dirty And second but just as a suggestion they offered me a Terrace room for 15 extra the night I had 2 rooms booked so only upgraded one To my disappointment it was the same amount of square meters than a regular room but divided between room and terrace So don t take it go to a regular double room Space wise was much more comfortable The bathroom in this terrace room was very small It could not have 2 people at the same time standing there the double room had a decent size bathroom , Great hotel friendly staff and excellent location I usually stay in the Gothic and I was unsure about this area but it was extremely central walking distance from Sagrada Familia Passeig de Gracia Plaza Catalunya and the metro Lots of shops restaurants and turistic intrest points close by
