468461,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I was expecting maybe a little more for the price but i guess this is a general issue of the hotels in Vienna Room was dark and view was on the back on the inside ring of the building with view to other windows , Rooms were fine but was expecting a little more for the price Staff was friendly Position was close to city center and lot of transportation options were available Room had a big fridge and possibility to heat up food or even prepare it if that s needed 
468462,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The 500 Euro fine if the smoke alarm goes off apparently very sensitive makes you actually afraid to cook which is a shame No wonder the kitchen is so immaculate it s probably never been used The mattress was quite hard But that is the trade off from it being able to fold away and for a sofa to be usable for receiving guests i assume , The room had all the facilities available to make it feel like a home away from home large fridge lots of cupboards etc It was well designed to ensure maximum use of space Extremely clean it looked like the room hadn t been used before In a great location if you want to be in the main city and see all the sights 
468463,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The only downside was that it would have been nice to have had 2 pillows per person I had to ask for an extra pillow and maybe a comfortable chair to sit in as one doesn t always want to sit on the bed, Everything was fantastic the staff were very helpful the room was nice the bed comfortable The location was good 
468464,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The internet was a bit slow, The location was perfect the prater park was 15min walk and there is restaurants within 5 9minutes of walk the staff were very kind 
468465,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, As said bed wasn t a real bed but okay Breakfast is very expensive but is optional No cleaning service included for the 4 days we stayed Rooms are quite noisy , Good location close to several city beaches and bars Room had a small kitchen and dishwasher Bathroom was super clean and comfortable Bed can be transferred into a bank and was a little hard but comfy enough 
468466,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The fitness centre weight machine was difficult to use and there was 1 x 10kg free weight , Really modern hotel in the main ring of Vienna Easy to get around and see the sights
468467,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The lack of natural light The single small window looked out onto a narrow courtyard light well and being on the first floor with the sky a small square far above the room was always dark and we needed electric lights on at all times , The studio apartment was well equipped spotlessly clean the beds were firm and very comfortable the bathroom roomy and efficient It was thoughtful that washing up liquid and cloths were provided and soaps in the bathroom 
468468,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We found front desk staff not efficient enough for our needs , Walking distance from the center yet quiet location Right near a major tram stop Good amenities in the room 
468469,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Absolutely nothing , We arrived late in the evening the reception staff were excellent The studio room was spacious had everything you could want for an extended stay Easy access either by tram metro or on foot to must see attractions Special thanks to Mr Sharma who suggested an upgrade from b sic to superior studio well worth the small extra payment to have opening windows city view Would definitely recommend this hotel to others 
468470,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, There was only 2 coffee sachets and nothing for the coffee machine which is expected but as we couldn t take the coffee home we didn t bother to buy any The booking said the room had city views but ours was facing an office building on the other side of the building from the river and city , It was a large room and had its own small kitchenette with a coffee maker and free wifi located close to public transport and shopping etc It was good value though and close to lots of restaurants and near the university precinct 
468471,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Staff very cold and boring they called my family attention during breakfast twice for some dumb reasons , Very good location and excellent view of Danube it s also in front of public transportation and underground train 
468472,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed was a fold up but comfortable once you got in, The location was perfect with a great view of the river and large opening windows let you immerse yourself in the beautiful Viennese summer Staff gave comprehensive location transport and supermarket details on check in without being asked
468473,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, Good central location with a short walk to all the facilities the town has to offer and the underground is inexpensive and easy to use and very quick to get around
468474,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Room could use a bit of paint Quite scuffed up though nevertheless clean One of my morning wake up calls did not happen , Happy that breakfast started at 630 some hotels start at 7 
468475,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The room was a bit too small and cramped at times The view said we would have a garden view but instead got something different The photos of the room when we booked it didn t look the room we were getting as the photos made out we d have a much larger room but didn t , Great location approx 10min walk into the central city at a very relaxed speed Staff was very friendly and welcoming and answered all the questions we had The bathroom was very big and well maintained with a modern feel to it 
468476,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, On the small ap you can not open the windows Also in the Bathroom there is not a ventilator available For this reason we made an upgrade to a bigger apartment Here was very nice but unfortunately in the Toilet and also in the bathroom no ventilator available , very good location
468477,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, When we got to our room it was smelling very strongly of cigarettes even though it s forbidden to smoke in the whole hotel and the receptionist warned us that there are smoke detectors It is not clearly stated that the Standard Studio doesn t have open able windows and it also doesn t have a door between the room proper and the kitchen Beware The Superior Studio has both but is more expensive worth it in our opinion , Me and my wife stayed in Vienna for 5 days The room was good for our stay we actually booked the Superior Studio because we wanted windows that can be opened The small kitchen had everything you needed and the dishwasher was nice to have We didn t get any breakfast there The location is excellent in our opinion We had a Billa supermarket metro station bike stands and the Danube all within 5 minutes of walking The city center is also very close It s a bit noisy but the windows muffle the sound pretty well We tried wiring the TV to our laptop to watch some movies but we didn t have an HDMI HDMI wire and the hotel didn t help us either The TV itself was too old to know how to read an external hard drive by itself 
468478,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We weren t able to open the window of our room due to fire security measures We would ve liked a little bit of fresh air in the room The mattress in our room was a little uncomfortable the springs in the middle were weakened from use , We were pleasantly surprised by the room we received We also had a little kitchen with microwave and dishwasher included It was very useful in the morning since restaurants around there opened at around 10 o clock and we left early to visit the attractions Room was nicely decorated and comfortable bathroom was large and very clean There room also had hairdryer and iron and ironing board 
468479,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I found the reception staff quite unfriendly at the point of being sometimes openly rude for example while checking me in they also started checking in other clients without apologizing or explaining the interruption for a hotel in that price range this is definitely unacceptable also the carpet on our floor 4th was incredibly dirty , The location is good very central and the room was very nicely furnished 
468480,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Pillow Bed were more firm than I would like but I slept very well , Very quiet Very modern Good breakfast Helpful staff 10 min walk to airport train 10 min walk to main shopping street and nightlife 
468481,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Size of the room, Everything abt the hotel except size of the room it s very small staff very helpful specially arun sharma was very good and helpful
468482,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The room was very small and was really like an ordinary hotel room with a kitchenette There was nowhere to sit other than one chair and the bed , The bathroom was fantastic 
468483,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The frequency of the cleaning services could be improved to maybe twice a week if the daily cleaning services cannot be achieved , I loved the window view of my room The hotel staff were very friendly My bed was fluffy and adequate for me and I loved the space available in my room The whole setting was neat and homely Its also a working distance to the Stephenplatz shopping area which I loved
468484,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, They should care a little more of the cleanness and maintenance The wall needed to be painted , Staff was awesome Dominique really helped us a lot and he was always in a great mood Perfect location with a market just a few steps away We walked everywhere Delicious and local restaurants near by Comfy apartment
468485,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I landed there on a public holiday after a 20 hr flight it would have been handy to keep at least some milk biscuits and water in the fridge I could not buy anything due to the public holiday expected to have laundry facilities in the apartment night was hot without aircon I was told that it works only when it gets further hotter street noise was excessive on opening windows no service cleaning for 3 days, excellent location firm bed friendly staff
468486,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The hotel and the rooms are not clean enough On the first night we got a small dirty room with 2 separated beds and no window although we booked a better room On the next day we were transfered to a better room but still the carpet is not clean Also there is a coffee machine but no coffee or filters they expect us to buy filters and coffee and if they would have told us before we arrived we would have got this , Staff was great friendly and helpful
468487,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, Nice aparments if You are looking to stay for longer and have your own kitchen Good facilities like gym and laundry machines Kitchen was a little small but it served its purpose Staff was friendly Very nice location with a chance to have great views from the window Easily accessible from metro and 2 tram lines

468489,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, the carpet was extremely poor quality that was a real put off and urgently needs replacing everything else felt new and this felt ancient The sink was too tiny to do any washing up but we used the dishwasher The fact that they take pets put us off a bit as we had allergies but the room was fresh and clean , the room was spacious and had everything you needed the bed was fairly comfy in that it was firm and not soft The location was perfect a short walk to St Stephens the CAT a 10 min walk and the Underground a 5 min walk the food shop was opposite for supplies and a big chemist opposite which supplied me with the prescription drugs I forgot to bring In the studio appartment we could adjust the furniture eg pull the table out to eat and put up the bed to make a settee The bathroom was lovely There was a big fridge freezer for all your food a coffee maker and a good quality kettle There are two rings to cook on and there is a dishwasher with dishwasher tablets and you can ask for me The staff were so brilliant and so happy to help Nothing was too much trouble for them There was no cleaning for the room which we prefer I hate the interruption of cleaners there was a hoover which we used once and we asked for fresh towels and were readily supplied There is a washing machine and dryer and you can buy tokens and a washing capsule for 5 euros In the kitchen there was washing up liquid dishcloth scourer sponge and tea towel In the bathroom a big container of soap and shower gel 
468490,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Limited control of airconditioning unable to warm room when cold Sealed windows , Helpful staff kitchenette good size bathroom cleanliness comfortable bed 
468491,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Leaving, The tram stop is just in front of the hotel The kitchenette is complete for us to cook during our stay We got a room with stunning view of the Danube River 
468492,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Would have liked more coffee for the coffee machine no point buying a large container for one night and some little milk sachets even to buy these for 1 or 2 would be a good option , Excellent hotel great location and friendly staff would definitely stay here again when we go to Vienna Love the kitchenette and excellent bath and shower
468493,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Beds too hard Pillows like bag of rocks horrible too hard and too high although replaced with apologies and smile the next morning just after complain Air con no air to breathe and too warm Requested a window to be opened and it was for few hrs day time which made a difference , Everything else Any issue with had was sorted straight away as much as possible beds pillows air con maybe it s just us likening different things 
468494,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Little parking problem if you travel with a car a bit expensive parking near hotel not possible to use the public parking for more than 2 hours , Excellent location friendly staff comfortable nice breakfast free excellent Wi fi signal 
468495,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, 1 They clean your room only once a week 2 The shower could have had a stronger current and the temperature kept heating up every few minutes as if someone was flushing the toilet next door , The bed was really comfortable and the room was quite big The location while not perfect was still very good and close to many public transport hubs 
468496,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Shower drain clogged and windows very small Aso mattress and pillows too hard, Nice accomodation not far from the city centre Kitchen and room equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay
468497,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and relaxed it was a great place for a break and the location to the city centre was excellent Staff at Adagio apartments couldn t have been more helpful as well which made our stay so much simpler from the location of best sites and which tram or underground train to get 
468498,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Extra plastic bags for collecting waste would be necessary, The view to the Danube canal The kindness of the staff Strategic location at the ring and walking distance from the center close to Schweden Platz and access to all means of transport of the city
468499,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, they rooms dont look like the pictures the windows dont open because of some policy in vienna yet this doesnt apply if you pay for an upgrade LOL really , pretty avarage
468500,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, nothing, we liked everything in this hotel at the time of check in we could get the room 1 earlier than standard check in time room and all facilities were very comfortable very reach and delicious breakfast very friendly staff approx 5 minutes walking to the nearest metro station and 7 8 minutes to the center

468503,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Thin bed mattress sofa bed folding bed Bathroom water slow flow out Nothing like the picture I book room with view but the receptionist try to give me smaller room with small window view Must complaint to get better room actually I was staying more then 5 days Room will not be clean unless you stay more then 6 days , Bigger space then hotel room
468504,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Shower was alittle blocked and slow to drain but wasn t a big issue Minor issues were that the radio didn t work and the kitchen could do with a few more utensils , Great location By the canal 5 10minute walk to Wien Mitte where you can get the CAT to the airport 10 15minute walk to Stephanplatz Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby Pharmacy and grocery shop across the street Tram stop outside the hotel Reception staff were friendly and professional Self catering studio was nicely decorated 
468505,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Everything was nice , Very friendly and helpful staff Comfortable spacious clean and well designed room Good wifi connection Nice location next to the river 
468506,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We stayed in a studio apartment All was well except there was no opening window The room was very dry and too hot We tried each day to adjust the air con to be more comfortable but alas We were pleased to be in fresh air when leaving each day , Location and everything really except no window 
468507,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, No linen change except on second last day which we then refused as a waste of time Had to ask for more toilet paper tissues and dishwasher tablets New towels weren t where they said Not sure if this was a language problem though, Location
468508,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, Location city center within walking distance many of the different subway lines were also very close And for once did the description match the actual room and the rooms were in a very fine state 
468509,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The fact that breakfast was not included as i m pretty sure that it was mentioned it to be included when booking the hotel through booking com The kitchen is very small , Convenient location and spacious studio 
468510,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Basic kitchen goods were not enough for example cutting knife food turner tongue filters of coffee maker We must buy some of rhem , Super easy access to seeing spots around Ring Quick and kind responce of hotel staffs Nice kitchen that enable perfect cooking 
468511,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Cold room the first day we had to change rooms Nobody could bring us blankets we had to go down to get them by ourselves We kept freezing the first night The new room was double the size meaning that the first room was not worth the cost but again the sevond room was not cleaned at all for 5 days , Great location some of the staff were helpful it was more like an apartment rather than a hotel 
468512,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Very hard bed , Nice and clean You have small kitchen in room so you can cook some food or make hot drinks Location is good 5min from the old city center Lot s of sight seeing around 
468513,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed was too firm for our liking , Good location on the edge of the city centre no more than 10 minutes walk from the centre and the nearest subway station 
468514,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Bedroom was too hot and fridge didn t work but we should have asked about getting it fixed we didn t so the hotel didn t get the opportunity to fix this for us , The location was great great to have some gym facilities and sauna also Staff were very friendly 
468515,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Staff could be friendlier, Comfortable bed pillows Good location Good View if facing outward Good and adequate facilities room and common 
468516,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The room we got it was a very small hole the window look to a very ugly inner garden We asked for a better room we paid 10 Euro more and we got a very nice room on the 7th floor with nice panorama The hotel is not bad breakfast was also good but i prefer to reserve room on the 7th floor , Location is very good 
468517,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The value for money Perhaps due to the Xmas high season and the average high prices in the Innerstadt but I found the price excessive for what the hotel offered Breakfast was not inlcuded and at 14 euro was far from being convenient since there are tons of places right outside where you can have a much cheaper morning meal The bed was not very comfortable and I realized on the last day that it was actually a sofa bed , The location of the hotel was ok although it is on the outer limits of the city center so plan on walking quite a lot unless you prefer subways but then you don t enjoy the city as much From the hotel to Stephansdom it takes around 15 minutes at a brisk pace so if you re going to the Rathouse for example plan on a 30 minute walk back Again the subway is very close as well as the trams that go along the Ring so that it also an option if you are tired I prefer walking so would have appreciated a location a bit closer to the center The facilities are ok very clean and the kitchen has everything we didn t use it though 
468518,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The staff was unable to find multi plug since this is a city center hotel and hotel should have multi plug becuase people from all around the wolrd stay here 2 different staff were un able to find multi adaptor Also there were no toiletries in the bath room also the towels were dirty not properly cleaned , Location was good Very near to the metro Schwedenplatz City center was just 10 mints walk away Room was clean View was amazing Room had iron with iron stand 
468519,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We paid for a superior room double bed and the receptionist gave us a studio room twin bed After many explanations he tried to charge us with 40euros day more for the room we booked 2 months ago Finally after 30 minutes of negociations he gave us the key of a superior room with double bed as if he made us a favor Old arrogant guy FYI the rooms don t have a sofa and a bed They only have a bed that can be done a sofa , Spacious room clean 
468520,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, In the had a window however it can not be opened due to equipment on the otherside as per the note on the window from hotel management The room became quickly very stuffy and uncomfortable ,No Positive

468524,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The wi fi was unusable The free computer was unusable that s a major problem for travellers I purchased a SIM card to enable connectivity we were not alone in this experience You must fix this or we cannot return The sign coffee costs an additional 2 40 per cup was misleading coffee is included in the breakfast My concenious wife paid for three coffees after breakfast because she did not properly inderstand the sign Otherwise the hotel was very satisfactory , Access to purchase transport and shops
468525,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Smaller than average room but cleverly furnished to make the most of the available space , Nicely appointed hotel Great location with restaurants and shops 2 minute walk Ringstrasse tram stop located right at the door so very easy to get around the city Easy walk to State Gardens and main train station swedenplatz Bonus sauna and gym room Ask for a room with a street view as courtyard not very pretty
468526,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Hallway smelled of food cooking all the time no matter what time and it was always the same smell , Liked the small kitchen We had breakfast in our room Within a few minutes walk of a subway station Loved the gym 
468527,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The linen didn t feel clean and the apartment smelled strongly of perfume on arrival Not possible to open window for security reasons No shelf in the shower so you have to bend down to the floor for soap The towels kept falling off the hooks on the walls both in the bathroom and the kitchen , Excellent location near Wien Mitte the station the direct train from the airport to the city goes to Also near three U bahn metro staions so you could go in every direction And city center within walking distance Still a quiet area Practical apartments basic but with all you really need 
468528,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Expensive but poor breakfast Plugged water discharge pipe in shower room Reluctant staff in response to our complaint Clean rooms per six days , Staffs location comfortable room with small kitchen

468532,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed was rather uncomfortable which was a bit surprising given that everything else was really nice , We were travelling together with our 1 year old son and the studio apartment was very suitable for us The kitchen was well equipped and in a separate room which was very good The location of the hotel is very convenient just a couple of minutes walk from Schwedenplatz We very much enjoyed our stay 
468533,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, When we arrived we were told that the apt we had booked and paid for was not available We were given a superior room and a discount but the apt we booked would have been better for us ,No Positive
468534,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The staff very unpleasant We have used Adagio in other countries and had no problem but not here When we arrive they have made a reservation of the first night amount in my bank account with no warning on the day I had made the booking We arrived to room where we found the previous guests towels hanging in the bathroom When we went out of our room to check out the last day we heard strong air extractor noise and the lifts were blocked We used the stairs to reach the ground floor finding in our way a group of firefighters When complained about not finding out of the situation until we got out of the room the recepcionist explained that the procedure was first calling firefighters and making sure first there was fire and then turning alarms on afterwards Very safe ,No Positive
468535,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The hotel will provide daily cleaning with additional charges , The location of the hotel is outstanding just 10 mins walk and you will be in the Stephen Platz Also the staff are friendly an cooperative and the apartment contains all the requirements This is very recommended hotel for families since it is equipped with laundry facilities where you can wash and dry with 5 only The tram 2 stop is just in front of the hotel and metro station is just 5 min walk 
468536,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, rooms on the main square quite noisy due to traffic no cleaning or change of towels if you stay for more than 3 days coffee machine could be upgraded and or coffee powder and filters could be provided, very nice and helpfull staff

468540,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Constant siren noise from outside All bloody night Can t breathe if I close the window Shower no pressure Can t wash properly No proper parking , Near enough to the centre
468541,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, bed mattress were not comfortable very limited space to around the bed bed was not accessible from both both sides , location cleanness friendly staff
468542,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, While our room was very clean the rugs in the hallway were stained and the floors in the elevators needed to be mopped One other negative consideration that some may want to take into account is the fact that I was informed by email two days after departing the hotel that my Accor account it s a hotels loyalty program that includes Adagio and Mecure hotels among others would not be credited with any points for our 21 day stay at Adagio because I had booked it through a third party booking com The Adagio staff apparently were not aware of that policy and had assured me that my account would be credited but Accor disagreed and denied the credit That s not the hotel s fault but anyone who travels extensively and likes to accumulate loyalty points as my wife and I do should be aware of that Accor policy for Adagio Mercure and other hotels , The location of the hotel is good about a 10 to 15 minute walk to Stephan s Dom the cathedral in the heart of the inner city and the starting point for a very impressive set of stores if you re into shopping The hotel is also just a few steps from two tram lines that allow you to circle the city center and a five minute walk to a subway station Lastly it s only a 10 minute walk to the city station for the train that runs directly to the airport Additionally the staff were very responsive to every question and the exercise room was more than adequate to our needs 
468543,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, everything is perfect , We are glad to book this service apartment hotel at the end of our two week trip in Europe as it provides us with kitchen facility to cook some Asian food The kitchen is well equipped with microwave dish washer and tableware Staff is very friendly Our booking got some problem but they soon sorted it out They also kindly helped me to call the concert box office to arrange ticket change The one bed room apartment contains plenty of wardrobes Really like a home Bed is the most comfortable through our whole trip very good location for tram no 1 and No 2 tram stop is just downstairs and subway We bought the weekly pass so we ride the tram a lot My 7 year old said that she is going to bring her kids to Vienna and stay in the same hotel when she grows up 
468544,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I reserved 2 rooms and we got one roon on floor 2 and the other on floor 8 You do not expect this if you book 2 roons for a group of 4 peoples The rooms have to be next to each other, Staff always ready with good advice how to walk which bus metro to take good restaurants recommendatiions
468545,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, One week booking comes with no room service and you have to pay for cleaning and changing towels we had a wifi problem in our stay and they can not solve it Sirens of ambulance are loud in the lower floors especially on Saturday night , Location is very good and so many location is within walking distance tram is just few meters from the hotel It is a perfect choice for families spacious rooms and no adult TV channels They have arabic speaking staff mr Ihsan who is a very helpful person 
468546,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We found some of the staff to be very rude first by making us wait 10 minutes to check in when there were staff available to help us straight away and again when we asked where the local supermarket was they responded with they were all closed and told us this is Vienna this meant nothing to us as at home our supermarkets are open until 11pm or 24hours and we would still need to know where the local supermarket was for the next morning This was very unhelpful and after an 11 hour flight we did not expect to be greeted in such a way We were also missing an iron in our room which we later had to ask for , Clean big bed air con was good quiet and nice view from the windows The CAT express line is pretty much a 10 15 minute walk away so would recommend this rather than getting an expensive taxi the train is actually quicker too 
468547,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Suboptimal standards of cleanliness e g Carpet with prominent stains not cleaned properly before check in When asked the reception staff they promised to send up a cleaner free of charge however no real action , Location is very nice Breakfast is good in comparison to other European standards 
468548,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Two of after noon staff were not cooperative when I forget my key card in the room they didn t deal with me professionally Also you can say they are not welcoming and you can feel it from the way they way the are dealing with customers Actually before I stayed in this hotel I stayed in three hotels in different cities in Austria and the front deck in all of them were very nice , Location
468549,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Very small room suite for too persons Not good for the money if don t use the apartment facilities and if you use them you have to be prepared to eat in your lap and stand the smoke and smell because windows can not be opened Cleaning is done only one time every 4 days if you ask for it , Relative good location 
468550,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Housekeeping is not that good Furnuture is very engineered with Sharp edges which may hurt you Beds need to replaced Some rooms and aisle way carpets need replacement Expensive breakfast and not a good spread at all Staff need to be more proactive Understaffed front desk , Except Location nothing great about this place 
468551,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, No attention to detail Our room had clearly only been cleaned very quickly and not prepared to a good standard we asked for the room to be cleaned and were told it would cost 18 euros After a complaint a cleaner came and washed the bathroom floor and greasy hand marks on the walls in the bedroom and bathroom The apartments would be much nicer if they were cleaned daily , the location was good
468552,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Unconfortable pillows and lack of housekeeping during our entire stay the daily clean up should be a requirement in a aparthotel , Good facilities for a short stay including the small kicthen 
468553,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Air Conditioner is very weak and does not keep the room cool at all We even switched rooms thinking it wasn t working but there was no difference in the new room Also there was no housekeeping service We had to ask for fresh towels and toilet paper they were handed to me at the front desk Carrying my toilet paper to my room was a bit awkward We were expected to take out our own trash too We stayed for six nights I would not have booked the room if I knew the bathroom would never be cleaned our sheets would never be changed and I would have to ask for toilet paper and fresh towels There are 2 washing machines available for washing your laundry but only one dryer Unfortunately the night we did laundry another gentleman was also washing We started washing our clothes at 8 30 pm and because he kept using the dryer and feeding it more coins we were not able to dry our clothes until 1 30 am We sat and waited patiently for him to finish It wasn t his fault there was only one dryer Disappointing since it is a four star hotel , Location is great Buses and venues are very close Staff are helpful and friendly they speak great English 
468554,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The rooms should be cleaned on a daily basis regardless of the duration of the stay of the visitors at no cost This is normal practice in all hotels overseas , The location is excellent as it is within walking distance from the center of Vienna The facilities of the hotel were excellent too and the service of the staff very good 
468555,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed could have been more comfortable and the walls are a bit thin so corridor noise was sometimes bothersome , The staff were extraordinarily helpful and friendly The location is unbeatable The layout of the room was exactly as described and provided for all basic comforts The kitchen is a great plus and was well equipped The bathroom is big and clean 
468556,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, No socket in bathroom or elsewhere to charge shaver or electric toothbrush bring an adaptor Their taxi service was a bit scruffy and expensive suggest pre book your own from the taxi that drops you off if you are happy with service , Superb assistance from reception staff Great wi fi Easy to get to public transport transport and easy but steady walk to city centre A little supermarket nearby sells most of what you need Towels shower gel and cleaning kit provided Comforatble beds 
468557,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Very dirty room and housekeeping are chargeable Very poor service one lady was shouting on me in the restaurant i will never go back there, Only the location
468558,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, There was a lady at the reception she told me that she will try and give me a room to check in eary at 10 30 instead of 3 00 cool And then she got a phone call kept me waiting on the counter until this lady and asked me if i need help i told her no thank u that lady is helping me But she took a lot of time and she asked me again and went with her i payed and she promised to give me the room after two hours I go to downtown and back to the first lady and she was like sorry i cant give u a room you should have waited for me but you didnt so you ll have to wait What to do this is life that was so rude and she really dnt know how to deal with customers Bas staff, The location of the hotel was great 
468559,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Not cleaning the room as stated is one thing but in a hotel a guests shouldn t be expected to take out the trash from the room themselves Also the policy on not changing the towels unless you pay for full cleaning is incovinient for the guest The carpet and the lamps were quite dusty and there was no shower curtain in the bathroom , The room was comfortable for 2 persons but if there were 4 of us it would be crowded The bathroom is very spatious The kithcen was fully equiped and the staff was very friendly and forthcoming The location is very good walking distance from both Stephan s cathedral and the Prater the Opera is a bit further away but not too far 
468560,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We were surprised to find out we had a foldaway bed when we checked in This wasn t particularly comfortable and when the bed was out there was literally nowhere for our luggage to be stored but in the bathroom , Great location near the canal with easy walking access to CBD and metro stations Enjoyed the small gym and the laundry is great for doing some washing Enjoyed the decent sized fridge and little kitchen and the bathroom was a great size Staff were friendly and hotel was very clean 
468561,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Terrible in my opinion no bin liner you are expected to ask for it same as towels which I found so strange WiFi did not work I have a young child and was asking if I could buy milk and order it to the room I was told as the staff alone I have go down and leave a child who is under the age of two by himself Very expensive for what it is, Nice rooms friendly staff English speaking only 
468562,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I booked for 3 nights first day no one cleaned my room and second day after passing by the reception and requesting to make sure the room gets clean i came back after 4 hours to find there are no clean towels and i have to call and request,No Positive
468563,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bedroom should have a door to give you more privacy especially if traveling with family Travelers with babies should ask the hotel to clean the rooms more accurately as the dust can cause allergy , The location was very good The apartment was very well equipped and was very comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful A Billa supermarket is very close to the hotel for buying stuff It was a value for money hotel and was also close to metro 
468564,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Very uncomfortable fold away bed and no cleaning for stays longer than 3 nights , Good position friendly helpful staff some self catering facilities good WiFi 
468565,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, we booked studio apartment the apartment was very small in size the kitchen was well equipped but very small , the staff was very helpful at reception they helped us to guide about city the room bathroom kitchen was very clean close to the mall and all transport
468566,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We stayed for longer than 3 nights which unfortunately means you don t get a room cleaning service at all during your stay , The location was great Vienna is a big speaking city but you could walk to ask the major points within 20 30 minutes 
468567,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, I liked that there was a small gym and sauna and a laundry room should you need to do a load or two I didn t use the gym facilities but did monopolize the washers and dryers Knowing that these are here may help some when considering just how much clothes you really need I liked that there was a small kitchen as well but with all the terrific food out in town I wouldn t have even thought about cooking It s a good location to use as your base camp The trains and subways are close but the ability to walk around the city can t be beat Despite the cold in March I am glad I toured by foot Staff were the friendliest people around and were available 24 7 Do not hesitate to stay here Plus the rooms are good sizes compared to other hotels in Europe I would stay here again is the best compliment I can pay 
468568,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, Large clean room with modern bathroom comfortable bed Short walk to train station to airport main train stations and city center Staff are friendly

468570,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We arrived at 9am and staff told us we would be priority for check in which started at 3pm and still we had to wait till that time We were no priority at all , Close to subway Big room and bathroom 
468571,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We were informed by reception that we could not open any windows in the category of room we had booked but could upgrade at an extra cost Knowing that the rooms had air conditioning we did not think it was necessary However the room was very stuffy and the air conditioning was totally ineffective The pillows were very hard and uncomfortable We were somewhat surprised that for a 4 night stay we were not entitled to any cleaning or any change of towels or bed linen goodness surely after 2 nights towels etc could be changed , All was not too bad but could have been so much better 
468572,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The hot water system is dangerous and unsafe We had to be careful when having a warm shower when someone else in apartment or in the building used cold water it would instantly get extremely hot no exaggeration but it was like pouring boiling water on yourself Just be careful with children babies and have it on a cooler temperature Also the fold down bed in studio apartment is quite heavy with no pneumatic assist to stop it from crashing down on top of you My husband opened it but for the elderly anyone suffering from a back injury etc I would recommend asking for assistance from the helpful reception team We enjoyed our stay here and still highly recommend it , Large comfortable modern and clean studio apartment on 6th floor with amazing views over the river and city Highly recommend staying here for business leisure Excellent location and convenient to get to with many transport options Tram stop is on front door tram 1 takes you around the city centre stay on it until station Burgring for some great sightseeing Buy ticket from Schwendenplatz station at tabaconist or from machine down escalators Close to Billa supermarket adjacent to main road Friendly and helpful staff

468574,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The toilet does need an extraction fan to get rid of odour faster , Very good size apartment No need to trip over the luggage or get into each other s way Separating the shower from the toilet is a very good idea Enough lighting and power points for a family of 3 or 4 
468575,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Our room was a superior suite but it had a Murphy bed I was not aware of this but it was doable for two nights , Great location to restaurants transit and hookah lounges 
468576,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Internet is a weird beast of the hotel hotel has 2 options free and a payable one The option that is free I have chosen that one works but sometimes can be very very slow For the tasks that I have it was not a problem but if a high speed wi fi is a must then the guest should consider a payable option And it is not a bad or good fact it is an apart hotel but if the guest is still wants to have a breakfast then be prepared for the quite mediocre thing But again if You choose an apart hotel then You are choosing it because of the possibility to have the breakfast of Your choice , I m the fourth time guest of the hotel and consider it to be a perfect place both to the family travellers and the business one Excellent location with convinient location of excellent supermarkets just 10 minutes to Wien Mitte station a crossroad and hub for CAT express train comfortable rooms with all needed amenities All sightseeings are just a short walk You can get to Stefansdom just in 20 minutes on foot in a lazy mode The staff is very professional and friendly eager to help and solve the problems

468581,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The only thing I would have preferred is that the room would be cleaned everyday although it didn t bother us so much since the towels could also be changed on request , The staff was very helpful and friendly The location is very convenient and close to the centre and places of interest 
468582,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City,No Negative, Very nice hotel with facilities available to use eg gym laundry Metro stop is less than 5min walk City centre is about 15min walk Our room was very spacious with a big bed bathroom and kitchen The staff at reception were very friendly as well Would definitely recommend this hotel 
468583,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Nothing just a little bit of a walk which wasn t too bad , I was greeted by lovely staff very polite and friendly told us where to go and what places to go The rooms were constantly warm even considering it was degrees outside Also not far from the underground don t use the express train not worth the extra money Just as simple using the cheaper alternative 
468584,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We booked standard apartment room and were very disappointed that all rooms of this type have windows which could not be opened Air condition system didn t work properly so it was really taugh to maintain comfortable temperature inside We asked staff at reception to air the room but they didn t manage to do it eighter it was too late or they didn t have a key to open the window Another don t like apartment wasn t cleaned throughout the whole week we stayed there According to the contract they clean if you stay 1 4 days if longer not , Good Location just around the corner from city center and sightseeing highlights

468588,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, the cleaning room service in not included, We came to the hotel and Ihsan the clerk was very nice to us always helped us whenever we need he and the other nice man at the night shifts everything was easy and came along with a smile the room was so nice clean there was always a hot water the kitchen is useful and the room was warm and quiet The hotel is nearby every important place shops market subway bars restaurants and culture Perfect Chen Dor
468589,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Room was very hot at night Apparently the building cooling and therefore our room aircon wouldn t come on because it was to cold outside but inside the hotel was very hot , Great location tram stops right outside Fantastic price for what you get Room was spacious and clean with everything you could want provided 
468590,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed is not very comfortable , Reading prior comments I was worried about my hotel choice but we were amazed with our room studio the most cheap option in this hotel Very kind and polite people at reception lovely room with enough space great equipped not that warm you can change temperature as you wish but the best thing is location Just in front of the hotel there is a tram station that is great connected U bahn is 300m far away and st Stephan cathedral you can reach in 7 8 minutes Supermarket bakery and fast food shop are 200m far away We totally loved it 
468591,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Room was a bit hot during the night no individual heating control , Nice location close to city centre Comfortable rooms Friendly staff Good free wifi
468592,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, we arrived on Friday and left on Tuesday During that time the apartment was not cleane and no rubbish removed , good location within walking distance of city centre 
468593,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The hotel runs on centralised air conditioning heating which is rather odd and a first for me Despite it being winter and freezing outside contrastingly the room was extremely warm so it would be good if the temperature was adjustable from a single AC unit , Very comfortable room loved the bathroom the most important element of the room to me 
468594,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, not having a breakfast at this price the seald window the garden view is not a view at all the wallpaper needs to be changed or cleaned it is a 4 star hotel afterall , the location the chance of having an apartment instend of a room the staff 
468595,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The hotel forbids any opening of windows in certain rooms For this reason one would expect that the AC would be adequate enough to stabilise the room s temperature However the room was stiflingly hot at night No matter what differences we made to the AC the room could not be made any cooler bearing in mind it was mid November and this should not have been an issue Additionally there was no extractor fan over the small hob This was a major issue considering that the hotel will charge you with a fine upwards of 500 if you set off the fire alarm This made it near impossible to fry anything without worrying about incurring a huge fine There was also no toaster or grill In short the kitchen facilities were inadequate , Brilliant location close to a supermarket underground station and within a 10 minute walk to Stephensdom Lovely staff 
468596,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, It is not described it any way that standard room is a room without possibility of opening of windows Very dark room in which you ll never see a sunlight What is more the ventilation system does not work at all only possibility to not to get cooked in a room is opening a doors It is forbidden to use a air conditioning in rooms If you d like a room with windows you need to pay extra It should be described and guests should now about it In a hotel there is a manager that seems to hate people and is very unkind , Localised in the city center good room equipment 
468597,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The schedule for cleaning needs to be improved a shorter period is recommended for example every two days instead of one week Breakfast needs to include a variety of food items , The staff were cooperative and responded to any request on time they speak English and some speak Arabic The location is very close to public transport and shops 
468598,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Ventilation in rooms are not so good The only one window in the room was also not to be opened if this could open ventilation would have been better Perhaps they could install window grill or latch , It s like renting out a small apartment studio so felt very personal while staying here 
468599,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, My only complaint was the Wifi was unreliable weak spotty and we were only using it for browsing no streaming videos etc Extra fee for Premium Wifi , Location was great We walked everywhere 
468600,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, All was ok Just small remark for the cleaning staff in order to improve their work especially at the places that are not visible at the first glance , Location and very pleasant laid back atmosphere 
468601,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We requested for a double bed and got two single beds pulled together instead For the price of the room the breakfast could have been included , Very clean and tidy perfect location spacious rooms and luminous Bathroom was big and clean as well as the kitchen area

468603,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, I didn t appreciate to be 29 for an early checking 11 AM instead of 2 PM especially as the bed wasn t even open and I had to open it myself Switch for bathroom was impossible to find see photos bed isn t comfortable cleanliness is really not up to Austrian standards and windows can t be open , Excellent location right on the ring 10 20 mm from most city center s attraction and right across the street from Urania movie theater and excellent restaurant a preferred alternative for breakfast if you are a late riser Staff was helpful especially the charming lady attending breakfast 14 euros is overrated though 
468604,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Energy failed twice in the same night i arrived The aircon in room 704 did not work well the room was very warm with low oxigen Water went cold after 10m in the shower receipt given came with someone elses name on it , Rooms and hotel look nice 
468605,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, We didn t have a bad experience The only small issue was that the jug in the kitchen was faulty but the staff were helpful and replaced it promptly , We enjoyed the fantastic use of space The apartment was small but it was packed with features like a kitchen couch and bed 
468606,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, When I made the reservation it was for superior double room The pictures were very nice but they give me one room on the top with a small windows I m 1 75 I can t walk in space on my side I m sure that wasn t the right room ,No Positive

468608,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Previous guests have already mentioned how the cleaning service is really weird at this hotel you get cleaning if you stay 1 3 nights but don t get any cleaning at all if you stay 4 7 night We knew about it so it wasn t really a problem The only thing that really bothered us is the fact the window could not be opened and we didn t know about it beforehand , Nice location friendly stuff Clean room with new furniture and bedding 
468609,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, while the furnishing is trendy and nice but it is one of the dirtiest floor carpet i ve seen for hotels at this level I see hand oil smudges on closet doors Carpet just looks like hasn t been cleaned for few years Just keep your shoes on , The lobby is nicely decorated and the location all together is very inviting Great bargain 
468610,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The staff was not very helpful We asked them to book an airport taxi but they made a mistake about the time so they had to rebook it Nevertheless the taxi didnt come at the desigated time at the end When we asked them to call the taxi driver they said the taxi was coming but didnt give us any license no of the taxi We waited for half an hour and end up got into a taxi randomly , Location is great very close to tube station and the room is quite comfy 
468611,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Not centrally located You have to walk to underground After 4 oclock there is only one receptionist I have stayed for 10 days only one day cleaning Wifi is slow Kinda isolated you have to walk distance to shops, Apartment is good in size Some of the staff are very nice Some of of them are rude
468612,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The room could have been cleaner rests of pear in the sink water stains on toilet lid There could have been two chairs in the apartment for two persons although we got a second one upon request The pillows in the bed were too hard and too high Althoug the personnel was not unfriendly they could have been friendlier The apartment could have been bigger The hairdryer is not suited for persons with long hair The aparment does not get cleaned if you stay between 4 and 7 days The place was too expensive for what it offered We expected more from a 4 star hotel we would classify it as max 3 star , Good location very close to the city center View from the hotel room 
468613,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Beds were a disgrace sagged in to the middle Staff promised to put extra mattress in told us to leave and it would be there on our return but there was none given Serious back pain after 1 night on the pull down bed Then said they would change room offered filthy attic room which we refused 1 bedroom with proper bed then offered then charged for same Taxi arranged by hotel did not wait at airport Manager would not speak to guests No cleaning done in apartments Had to ask for toaster , Kitchen was useful Location was good 
468614,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The only detail that I thing is very important to improve is the floor carpets They where stain and dirty smell bad and did feel clean For guest s that are allergic to mold or fungus or has asma its not save place to stay My wife had to take medication during are stay since it activated an allergic reaction I would suggest cleaning all carpets or installing new floors That would make The Hotel Adagio a 5 Star Hotel Beside that issue It was great place to stay , It has great facility and it is in Central of Vienna City Staff very helpful and would stay there again 
468615,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, The bed was a little awkward to use in room 107 We would probably have been better with the pull down bed , Because of our travelling times we asked for 2 hours extension on our last day and staff were most helpful It was much appreciated 
468616,Aparthotel Adagio Vienna City, Breakfast is very limited No parking belongs to hotel Early check out, Location near the center Air conditioned Size of the rooms Very Helpful staff
