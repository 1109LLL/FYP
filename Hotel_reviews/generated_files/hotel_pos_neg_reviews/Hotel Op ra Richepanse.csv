49224,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, These were minor things but the lights were a trick to figure out and the kids had to go through our room to shower but it was not a major problem , The suite was excellent Very nicely decorated and lots of space and storage The bathroom was also quite nice The location was great right in the middle of Paris 
49225,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Only thing is on the small side but then again this is Paris and if you wanted wide open spaces you probably would have opted to holiday elsewhere oui , Cant find any fault with the staff or rooms at the hotel opera richepanse Beautiful atmosphere and impeccable decor

49229,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Unfortunately the hotel is very busy and early check in was not a possibility for us As in all Paris hotels the classic room was quite small , Location decor staff everything is excellent As a family with a small child we had a lot of requests and the hotel was able to meet all of them immediately They even had a tefal bottle warmer The Michelin recommended Chez Monsieur right across the street is another plus 
49230,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Nothing Everything perfect , Hotel located on the best area of Paris Room very cozy charming and confortable Everything great I was planning a surprise for my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary and his Birhtday and the staff made such a big effort to make everything special for us They arranged and prepared the room exactly the way I pictured in my head I couldn t be more satisfied It s not the first time that I stayed in this hotel and I have to confess it is my favorite one in Paris I ll come back many times Thank you so much for all the staff for making our stay unforgettable

49233,Hotel Op ra Richepanse,No Negative, Location is perfect for shopping sightseeing restaurants etc Rooms are modern and very well designed Staff friendly and very helpful Right next to Metro
49234,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Housekeeping has not been consistent during our stay with one day they did not replenish tea bags and the other day forgot to replenish shampoo There was a miscommunication with our annivesary dinner reservation between the Hotel and Restaurant On our way to the CDG airport the front desk staff informed us that the taxi runs on meter but the taxi driver claimed that it is flat rate , We were celebrating our anniversary during the trip and the Hotel has kindly upgraded us from a Standard Double Room to a Deluxe Triple Room The room was renovated only last year in a modern and comfortable setting Location is excellent and is only a few minutes away from Madeleine Station and is close by to the shops on Rue du Saint Honore The front desk staff were mostly friendly and tried to be helpful Generally it was a pleasant stay and we look forward to visiting the Hotel again in our next visit to Paris 
49235,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Unfortunately we do not agree with some of the other reviews We specifically asked for a quiet room and we got the opposite They gave us room number 12 on the first floor Unluckily we did not sleep a lot You can hear the metro passing underneath the hotel you can even feel the vibrations it makes an irritating palpitating noise We could also hear every step and sneeze from the upstairs neighbors The breakfast room is too small for the hotel and a bit claustrophobic For us this is a better 3 star definitely not a 4 , The location is great and the rooms are comfortable and quiet spacious with enough storage space for Paris 
49236,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Lighting system was a bit difficult to understand , Great location for Parisian sights close to metro nice boutique hotel fantastic breakfast comfy bed helpful staff Despite urban location we thought our room was quiet 
49237,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Nothing They got it right , I have stayed in many hotels in Paris but this is by far and away the best Fabulous design job high comfort levels and attention to detail Rooms not huge but best use of space and truly outstanding mini wet room Staff were frankly brilliant and terrific breakfast Best location in Paris At 185 a night for my modest sized room this is not a budget option but you get what you pay for in this world and in the present climate of terror attacks and Air BnB competition hoteliers have to up their game This is a ten out of ten hotel and I commend the management for really delivering what discerning travelers like myself look for in a city hotel 
49238,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Nothing , Awesome Friendly staffs clean room beds House keeping was really impressive Great location walking distance to the Louver the Eiffel Champs Elysees 
49239,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Breakfast is a bit pricy compared to what they serve and the place they serve it is very tiny Sometimes you have to wait in line There s Pret a Manger across the hotel with good breakfast items No convenient stores nearby and minibar items are complementary water bottles are served on the first night only so get your water before you go back to the room in the evening , Excellent location safe quiet near the Metro many good restaurants and shops and many tourist attractions are in walking distance clean rooms comfy beds awesome shower nice water pressure nice staffs day staffs very helpful night staff not so much good chocolates at front desk I d definitely consider staying in Opera Richepance next time I m in Paris 
49240,Hotel Op ra Richepanse,No Negative, Excellent location with metro station just around the corner the Lourve Concord and Opera house only a few minutes walk and many good restaurants and shops nearby We booked 2 connecting rooms and the hotel checked in advance how we d like the beds be arranged The rooms decoration is new and comfy

49242,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, Disappointed with room service food Meals although gourmet quality are pre made and heated in a jar , Large spacious family suite gorgeous bathroom comfortable king bed and close to some great restaurants Breakfast room although small food was fresh and lovely
49243,Hotel Op ra Richepanse, The rooms were tiny I nearly feared to stand up straight in the bathroom the roof was so low Inexplicably there was no light in the anteroom that housed the only wardrobe for hanging clothes one had to jam the second door to the actual hotel room open in order to see anything The card slot for the access key was particularly hard to find in the dark , The hotel was fairly convenient for work however it is right over a metro station and the ground rumbles as trains pass through The staff were friendly and helpful
