82474,Amarante Champs Elys es, The room had a couple of little issues including a light bulb that was out and the toilet roll holder was coming off the wall but nothing bad just a little need for attention to detail, The location was great and the rooms comfy the concierge was amazing nothing was too much trouble staff on reception were nice but never smiled lol The price of the room on Booking com was a third of the advertised price in the hotel 
82475,Amarante Champs Elys es, The room is not as expected the photos in Booking com app showing very beautiful and well decorated rooms The room they gave me was not even close to the photos and was very old That is the only thing I didn t like , I liked the location behind Hugo Boss Champs elysees Branch the staff cleanliness of the hotel 
82476,Amarante Champs Elys es, A little dated The air conditioning unit is a floor standing supplementary unit Very effective but noisy Check out was over bureaucratic and lengthy , Location price functional comfortable room 
82477,Amarante Champs Elys es,No Negative, We always stay at this hotel when in Paris it is friendly and has in our opinion a very good location It has a very pleasant lounge and a good lift 
82478,Amarante Champs Elys es, Break fast is typical French style and too standard I was expecting to see more dishes , Good place to stay The best point is where the hotel is In 3mn s you can get down to Champs Elysees This is very good 
82479,Amarante Champs Elys es, The room was supposed to be superior class There were however clear signs of water damage on the walls and ceiling Maybe mould as well The lower part of the entrance door was damaged of water The internet was no less than terrible Could almost not open google and impossible to read the news not to mention getting or sending mail Terrible This including the lobby and breakfast rooms The breakfast was very simple One of the staff a bell boy stated that taxi was faster than the train to CDG Airport Well it s not Not at 5pm on a Tuesday It took more than two hours and we only made the flight because it was delayed 45min , Very good location just one block from Champs lys es in the vicinity of Arc de Triumph The hotel could be very good with just minor maintenance Very friendly staff apart from one guy who was irritatingly friendly and gave wrong info See below 
82480,Amarante Champs Elys es, furniture to be renewed no kettle in the room, Perfect location just steps to Champs Elys es Room space is ok staff was very friendly near to all kind of shops restaurants grocery
82481,Amarante Champs Elys es, Basically we have to acknowledge it s Paris and near Champs Elys es expesinve limited in space and public parking available only We did not expet more from Hotel But Paris as a trouristic destination should offer at least cheap tickets for public transportation and special rates for parking nearby the hotel Furthermore I expected the French chefs would have a bit more pride the food in the majority of the restaurants are below expected standards without passion However France is great and Paris a must of course e g museum sight seeing There are also some good restaurants if you are willing not to worry too much about the budget The only item I would critisize about the hotel is breakfast available only in the hotel room and certainly with an additional charge Probably I would offer free coffee and croissants in the lobby if I would be the owner of that place , Very nice room Welcoming staff 
82482,Amarante Champs Elys es, Room rent plus breakfast charge is comparable to a lot of nice high end hotels , Staff especially at reception was very good Location is superb All metros are 5 minute walk and you can go anywhere you want 
82483,Amarante Champs Elys es, Don t have high expectations and the bathroom toiletry items wasn t stocked daily at all Another thing which wasn t usual to me that I had to pay them off for half of the stay, The location was awesome and great value for the money
82484,Amarante Champs Elys es, A huge mismatch between the pictures on the website and the room we were given room no 301 The hotel should inform customers when they have half the hotel renovated and the remaining half is very old They should charge the rooms accordingly I wouldn t rate this hotel as a 4 No heating within the building Separate heater and cooler within the room Naturally the room was quite chilly when we arrived around 23 00 Very bad wifi connection The hotel needs urgent renovation , Great staff very friendly Location is very good 2 minutes from Champs Elysees and the metro station 
82485,Amarante Champs Elys es, No hot water the first 24h and some kind of alarm set off in the middle of the night The walls was paper thin and you could hear the noise from the street all night long , Cosy and intake environment Helpful staff Good location
82486,Amarante Champs Elys es, They woke us up at night because there was some cleaning going on at 3 am Other than that there was nothing wrong Don t listen to negative reviews Just book it , Location location location It is right at the center of Chaps Elysees Also the room was soo clean very beautiful newly renovated The breakfast was ok I loved it Also the stuff is very very kind They helped us a lot Thanks
82487,Amarante Champs Elys es, Noisy customers at night Bad noise insulation we can hear people talking in other rooms , Very good location 2 min from champs elysees 1 min from arche du triomphe 
82488,Amarante Champs Elys es, Pillows too hard shower was an after thought shower head could not be positioned to spray straight down the tub Thus the water bouncing off the shower wall ran down the length of the tub puddling strike that flowing into and on bathroom floor and then out into the room Quite the mess AC unit did not want to run for long periods DO NOT get suckered in to the breakfast thank goodness I read a review warning me of such 25 Euros for pastries wrapped in plastic Drink at your peril very expensive 6 or 7 Euros for a coke and 12 E for a mixed drink 7 Euros for a beer Ouch Also Hotel is being renovated Floors 4 6 But property is less than a block from Champs and just a couple hundred yards from subway access Oh and the Arch di Triumph is also close Great view PS Rooms definilty need refurbsihing, Bed comfortable Staff friendly and very helpful
82489,Amarante Champs Elys es, No aircon at all in the whole of the hotel due to building works on 4th 5th and 6th floors and it was 36 degrees Not informed of this at time of booking or would not have stayed there Room was ovenlike but given a fan Dubious stains on walls lampshades and bathroom walls If windows were open it was super noisy the French like their horns even at 3 in the morning No tea and coffee making facilities Breakfast was very expensive 20 each every morning did not partake we ate out each day and it didn t cost 40 for brekkie , The reception area was stunning very opulent Staff pleasant helpful and polite Bathroom quite nice Bed comfy Good location
