405,K K Hotel George, Really nothing negative to say about this hotel, Very comfortable beds smart bathroom good shower Lovely facilities garden an absolute delight friendly staff quiet location
406,K K Hotel George, No coffee or tea in the room or lobby No one to help with our bags from Tax into the Hotel No handicapped access At 80 years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the 12 oursidestairs and then up into the lobby ,No Positive
407,K K Hotel George, Room was pretty small for the three of us , The staff was very friendly and helpful in organizing our daytime activities Hotel located in a quiet area but very close to subway and restaurants 
408,K K Hotel George, Nothing really , We stayed at the hotel at a friend s recommendation It has great access to public transport and plenty of shops and places to eat close by Laundrette around the corner is also a bonus for long term travellers who need to freshen things up having access to the back garden was an added bonus for lovely summer evenings Would definitely stay there again 
409,K K Hotel George, Only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others 48 pounds plus tip , Super location on Division underground line direct to Heathrow and central London Older facility but very accommodating staff Good breakfast many restaurant stores 1 2 block away Bathroom was tiny with no fan or ventilation so it got warmish Quite comfy but small rooms Beautiful garden in back Overall a great value for London Would stay here again 
410,K K Hotel George, London hotel rooms are very small There was very little storage Would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage , Breakfast buffet was more than satisfactory Plenty of choices for all Bed was very comfortable Bathroom shower was powerful and plenty of hot water Location could not have been better Very short walk to underground Beautiful gardens at the rear of hotel Very quiet in spite of being close to Earl s Court Rd Staff was friendly and helpful Everyone was very easy to deal with 
411,K K Hotel George, The room for three people was on the small side , There was a beautiful garden at the back of the property where guests could relax in the sunshine read order a drink etc A great location very close to Earls Court restaurants and tube Good breakfast 
412,K K Hotel George, Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to , Fantastic location very clean room someone called Leanne I think on reception was helpful and kind Breakfast was lovely great choice 
413,K K Hotel George, Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night , Breakfast was excellent Staff in the restaurant were very pleasant especially the lady who took our room numbers showed us to our table 
414,K K Hotel George, The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good , The garden was a bonus Lovely area to have some quiet time and enjoy a drink Secure parking was also a good feature 
415,K K Hotel George, The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv , Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area 
416,K K Hotel George, Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back , Location first and foremost Lovely gardens 
417,K K Hotel George, Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel, Very good hotel professional people s and very well organized Unfortunately the fitness area is veeery small maybe this hotel with this kind of level can evaluate in the best future to invest something more in space for this area Sauna was not available but o k i can accept this in summer period i hope this will not hapen during winter nothing more check always the price sometimes without promotion is not acceptable for this kind of structure I will pay for this not more than 150 p more than this price became not anymore competitive with similar hotel with same level

419,K K Hotel George,No Negative, The staff were all so professional and friendly They really made the entire visit special and went out of their way to accommodate every inquiry or request we made The hotel itself was clean and the location to get on the Earl s Court tube was really convenient for all of our planned excursions I would totally recommend the K K Hotel George 
420,K K Hotel George, Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves , Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom 
421,K K Hotel George, The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company , Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel 
422,K K Hotel George, The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English , Fantastic breakfast buffet Great location Quiet rooms

426,K K Hotel George, Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there , The staff was very helpful
427,K K Hotel George, The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold , Hotel was nice and comfortable Very clean Room was a bit small but adequate Staff was friendly and helpful The location was great because it was a 4 minute walk from 2 underground lines Plenty of restaurants convenience stores and ATM nearby

431,K K Hotel George, The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential, Closeness to Piccadilly Line and general ambience of the hotel
432,K K Hotel George, The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra , The location is excellent direct route from the airport at Heathrow The hotel is clean and modern and has basic amenities breakfast room bar The street is quiet A good hotel if travelling on business

435,K K Hotel George, We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food , We had gluten free breakfast They had separate toaster for gluten free breads But I can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet Otherwise I can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast I just could not eat it Still for sure I could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast Enough for a big man It was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel

449,K K Hotel George, couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice, good sized room for the price and wonderfully located having its own bar and restaurant on site was a bonus despite there being countless foodie drinkie options outside their doors

453,K K Hotel George, The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal , Superfriendly staff comfortable beds safe in the closet and the housekeeping was superb they even made the bed extra nice for my daughter by tucking in her Teddybears 3 Clean bathroom nice shower and the room was nice and quiet for my daughter to sleep in the evening Unfortunately it was winter so we did not get the opportunity to spend time in the garden but it made a nice view from the window in our room and at the breakfast table The underground is only a 2 minute walk so getting around was very easy I am overall very satisfied with my stay at this hotel and would recommend it

465,K K Hotel George, We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so , Comfy bed a lovely warm room with good facilities on a cold damp London day Great shower nice toiletries and fab fluffy towels Would stay again as it was a great location The things we didn t like weren t the end of the world and we enjoyed our stay 
466,K K Hotel George, No Iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about , Location fantastic 2 minute walk to Earl Court tube shops and restaurants Beautiful building with parking

471,K K Hotel George, bathroom is really small, great location near the underground 5 breakfast room size consider good when compared to London hotels super fast Wifi
472,K K Hotel George, Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset , location was pretty good with decent restaurants in walking distance Wifi did the job Range of tv channels Shower was lovely
473,K K Hotel George, Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall, Location near Earls Court Tube stop
474,K K Hotel George, Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable , Good English breakfast 
475,K K Hotel George, The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations , Staff on the front desk we re very welcoming 
476,K K Hotel George, The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym , Very short walk from the tube but not on the main road ideal location 
477,K K Hotel George, Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of , Location location location and breakfast 
478,K K Hotel George, Saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening, Wonderful bed Impeccably clean room Staff are very helpful and polite
479,K K Hotel George, The air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc Our room on the 5th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about 3 m2 , Comfortable beds quality breakfast nice and helpful staff short walk to the tube
480,K K Hotel George, The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them, The location the room was a little bigger for the usual London hotel room The staff are generally very friendly from the front desk to the kitchen huge asset for the hotel They provide umbrellas when it rains and of course the wifi fantastic I enjoyed my stay overall
481,K K Hotel George, It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy , Comfortable bed
482,K K Hotel George, The heating was not working in the room for the first two days, Very well kept hotel with a lovely garden Staff particularly friendly and professional A very nice room
483,K K Hotel George, I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer, The Location was good on a quiet street about 200 meters from the Earls court Tube and buses Close to some nice restaurants and pubs for breakfast lunch or dinner
484,K K Hotel George, Noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional, Very comfortable beds well lit room bathroom compact but worked well the staff were all polite and helpful good gardens and quiet location
485,K K Hotel George, The room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight , The staff are friendly and kindly to help Our room is not in the basement and it s clean especially the bathroom which we care most Briefly it s a good hotel in this price we ll choose to stay again next time 
486,K K Hotel George, I can t think of a thing that needed improved upon All aspects of my stay were excellent , Stayed in room 226 Comfy bed and pillows Quiet room facing lovely garden Super clean and neat Good size flat screen TV with lots of channels Staff wonderfully helpful Food in bar restaurant really good and priced on par with other sit down table service restaurants Two minute walk from Earl s Court Tube Also every convenience a traveler could want located right on Earl s Court Road several bank ATMs pubs and other eateries laundry dry cleaning services even America fast food if you need your fix McDonald s Burger King KFC and Starbucks There s even a retractable clothes line in the shower for those travelers like me who do a bit of sink laundry I always remind my fellow Americans who are not used to European hotel rooms that rooms are small compared to US standards but comfort cleanliness and location rank FAR higher in my opinion than wasted floor space 
487,K K Hotel George, Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars , The position of the hotel was very close to Earl s Court Tube Station
488,K K Hotel George,No Negative, The location was perfect Stones through away from Earls Court station Staff were all lovely and accommodating Gardens were lovely Cracking Thai restaurant round the corner too Rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy We didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing 
489,K K Hotel George, Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient , Very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest 
490,K K Hotel George, Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it , The staff was helpful and friendly The lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant It is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road Very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro 
491,K K Hotel George, Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help , Bed linen is so cozy lovely breakfast super showers and staff are great and friendly 
492,K K Hotel George, There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows , Location excellent Staff very helpful 
493,K K Hotel George, We only stayed 2 nights , The location was perfect close to the Underground restaurants etc yet quiet The food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful The staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful The room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden Perfect conclusion to our 3 week stay in the UK
494,K K Hotel George,No Negative, This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again 
495,K K Hotel George, There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK , It was small but comfortable and very quiet The garden was beautiful Breakfast was very good Staff was friendly and helpful It is located only two blocks from the tube 
496,K K Hotel George, there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12 ,No Positive
497,K K Hotel George, The room was really really cold The heating didn t work I was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference This led to a really bad nights sleep , Quiet room
498,K K Hotel George,No Negative, K k is a heath hotel that can a person stay on I like it a lot I get a beautiful welcome I think to come next year with my family And thank you for all 
499,K K Hotel George, Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close , Staff Great friendly Acomodating In particular reception staff and bar man Wednesday night You can open a bedroom window
500,K K Hotel George, The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm, Staff were very helpful
501,K K Hotel George, Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place , Very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys Only a short walk to nearest subway Nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms Good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff Nice breakfast restaurant Will come back again 
502,K K Hotel George, Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint , The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well 
503,K K Hotel George, Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin , Excellent location You have the access to Earl s Court Underground within 3 minutes walk District and Piccadilly Lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially Heathrow without any transfer Many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter 
504,K K Hotel George, Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors , House keeping quality and service very good Even folded our clothes Breakfast was unbelievable You even had stewed prunes First floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet Loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks Liked the breakfast being made available with room price Obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also Would consider staying here again 
505,K K Hotel George,No Negative, Although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city Breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city 
506,K K Hotel George, Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky , I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few 
507,K K Hotel George,No Negative, This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets
508,K K Hotel George,No Negative, close to city center 3mins away from Tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast
509,K K Hotel George, It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again,No Positive
510,K K Hotel George, The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same , This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring 
511,K K Hotel George, Why carp when there is nothing to carp about , Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill 
512,K K Hotel George, The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did , Location is very useful for Heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight The place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good 
513,K K Hotel George, The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control, Great location easy transportation to everything Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores Room was very quiet and comfortable
514,K K Hotel George, The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress , The breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated We especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled Great taxi service was provided when requested 
515,K K Hotel George, The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better , The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request 
516,K K Hotel George, Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night , We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London 
517,K K Hotel George, Bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs , Location Close to some shops and restaurants only 3 minutes walk Underground 4 minutes walk Polite and assistive staff Room space is good

523,K K Hotel George, the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold , It is a smart comfortable hotel and our room was quiet which was something I specifically asked for but 
524,K K Hotel George, Room was small but adequate There was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though I put some paper on it to indicate its existence Fire alarm went off at 2 am and we were all in the street for a while All was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation , A lovely choice at breakfast with freshly cooked food Staff were pleasant and helpful Good late checkout time 
525,K K Hotel George, Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident , Convenient location for our purpose Clean and comfortable rooms
526,K K Hotel George, The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did , Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy 
527,K K Hotel George, Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either , Lovely hotel great location for Earls Court Tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of London sightseeing and very quiet We had a great sleep both nights

536,K K Hotel George, Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal , Like the location as I chose it myself Breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable Bed very comfy
537,K K Hotel George, Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel, Everything except the space in the room
538,K K Hotel George, Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink , The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious The staff are polite and helpful 
539,K K Hotel George, Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options , Great selection for breakfast buffet Hotel location great Near Earls Court tube station Loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage Hotel has a bar high is convenient

541,K K Hotel George, Wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive, Good range of foods and drinks for the breakfast location is just next to Earl s court station compact but clean equipment fully provided room friendly staffs

543,K K Hotel George,No Negative, the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming The bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business I didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there The location to the tube was excellent
544,K K Hotel George, Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way , Location is good 2 mins to Earl s Court station Loads of restaurants nearby Tranquil neighbourhood Clean Free printing stable wifi
545,K K Hotel George, Took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight Temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying , Very comfortable beds Very quiet despite facing the street Excellent breakfast Great location Friendly staff Close to good restaurants and pubs 
546,K K Hotel George, Not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid Aside from that the hotel was lovely , Room was basic for the price we paid It was very hot in the room and not very much room in the bathroom Spotlessly clean and good location 
547,K K Hotel George, Its a hit and miss with the reception staff Sometimes I got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained The restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly , I love the location and working Wi Fi

553,K K Hotel George, The restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing, The room was spacious and very clean and the location meant it was incredibly easy for us to get about on the underground 
554,K K Hotel George, I can t think of a single thing , Refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds We had the classic twin which like most London hotels was small but adequate We suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet Location is great as only a block away from the tube with the Picadilly line leading direct to Covent Garden and the theatres 
555,K K Hotel George, Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip ,No Positive

558,K K Hotel George, The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count , Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time

612,K K Hotel George,No Negative, Often the reality is different from the website but in the case of Hotel George the photos really did portray reality I could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel I chose this hotel because the average review was amazing This was spot on It s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner Just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked Who could want for more 
613,K K Hotel George, A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in , Excellent location and very welcoming staff Great to spend a couple of nights at one of the most desirable Postcodes in the country

620,K K Hotel George, Bed is too hard pillows were horrible AC didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi Wouldn t recommend it at all, Location and the staff were friendly
621,K K Hotel George, The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly , Very good location nice quiet neighbourhood Friendly staff and good breakfast 
622,K K Hotel George, breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme , reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them 
623,K K Hotel George, New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long, Comfortable hotel in convenient location
624,K K Hotel George, Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future , Close to underground station but in a quiet location Staff were excellent pleasant and helpful good choice for breakfast the bed was so comfortable we didn t want to get up

628,K K Hotel George, Lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise Window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open , Good location nice friendly staff 
629,K K Hotel George, The hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like IKEA The gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails, The hotel is clean in good location the breakfast wasn t bad

635,K K Hotel George,No Negative, Easy to get to from the tube station Staff friendly Room was clean The location was quiet Hotel was well presented Good bars and restuarants within walking distance 
636,K K Hotel George, Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable , Good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station Friendly hotel staff Clean room and bathroom with nice big shower 
637,K K Hotel George,No Negative, A boutique style hotel It had a lovely garden Nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use Complimentary fresh fruit plate for us The breakfast was superb Gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates Quiet location but within minutes of bustle 
638,K K Hotel George, a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light , very nice staff at the front desk 
639,K K Hotel George, This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy , Near Earl s Court metrostation really easy to reach Staff was very friendly

643,K K Hotel George, room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast , style breakfast bar meals great staff 
644,K K Hotel George, Small rooms , Perfect Location Great value Very comfortable beds We arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great Nice lobby Right next to Earls Court Tube stop so plenty of travel links Tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area 
645,K K Hotel George, English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice , Lovely hotel with friendly staff Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating We had a room overlooking the garden which was nice Excellent location Would definitely stay here again 
646,K K Hotel George, The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January , The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good 
647,K K Hotel George, Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels , Great location really near to Earls Court tube station and restaurants Friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds Nice hotel with modern touches Definitely stay again 
648,K K Hotel George,No Negative, Very convenient location for Earl s Court Tube station Warm welcome from reception staff Good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon 
649,K K Hotel George, I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home , Location
650,K K Hotel George, Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better, Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast
651,K K Hotel George, Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again , The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen 
652,K K Hotel George, The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price , Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides
653,K K Hotel George, Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger , Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London 
654,K K Hotel George, See above tangent , Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away 
655,K K Hotel George, I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again ,No Positive
656,K K Hotel George, We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor ,No Positive
657,K K Hotel George, Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers, Hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained
658,K K Hotel George, in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources, very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds
659,K K Hotel George, It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride , Staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean 
660,K K Hotel George, 1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm , Bar area and Reception good
661,K K Hotel George,No Negative, We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself 
662,K K Hotel George, On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show , On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal 
663,K K Hotel George,No Negative, I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court 
664,K K Hotel George, The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny , Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated 
665,K K Hotel George, Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good , Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed 
666,K K Hotel George, Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained , Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower 
667,K K Hotel George, Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess, Excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important
668,K K Hotel George, Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall , Location staff and cleanliness 
669,K K Hotel George, Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London , Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel 
670,K K Hotel George, The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant , Good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom Excellent choice of food at breakfast The bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire 
671,K K Hotel George, One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful , 2 minutes from Earl s Court tube Hotel has everything you would want in London Good breakfast comfortable room free wifi that works 
672,K K Hotel George, We had no ventilation in bathroom, The location is superb close to Central and all shopping areas as well as restaurants Our room was good size very comfy Excellent breakfast with big variety vegetarian and vegan options and bubbly 
673,K K Hotel George, The beds Quite small room We asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room It was hidden in the cupboard , The location the view from room 221 Nice breakfast room with excellent breakfast and a nice view to the garden Coffee and tea in room 
674,K K Hotel George, Nothing , The hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of Earls Court Very friendly staff Delicious breakfast

678,K K Hotel George, Nothing It s perfect , Excellent location 2 minutes to Earl s Court underground clean room and new facilities friendly staff a good variety of breakfast to choose from 
679,K K Hotel George, The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor , The place is nice and the breakfast is very good It was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option
680,K K Hotel George, It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so, Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room 
681,K K Hotel George, No bad experiences at all, There was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel Our room was very comfortable and a good size for a London hotel It was clean tidy and well equipped The staff were first class They were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot The breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality We will certainly pay a return visit 
682,K K Hotel George,No Negative, Beautiful hotel great location friendly helpful staff good breakfast included in the price LOVED the help yourself Nescafe in the lobby while waiting for breakfast Thank you 
683,K K Hotel George, Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money , Location for us was important Main public areas high standard and parking a bonus
684,K K Hotel George, Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent , Great location great amenities transport links Rooms had all key requirements Staff helpful
