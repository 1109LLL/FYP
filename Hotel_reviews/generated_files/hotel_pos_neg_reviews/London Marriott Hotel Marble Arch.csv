47059,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Not having a drinks menu on the table in the executive lounge , The executive lounge was worth every penny beautiful hotel with excellent Christmas decorations good location 
47060,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The breakfast service would be improved by one person in the dining room being assigned to several tables and an offer of tea and coffee rather than an everything is just there approach I was told only the chef could order the gluten free toast but the chef who was cooking and serving hot breakfasts had a long queue The hot water dispenser for the tea was part of the complicated coffee machine with no signage the water dispensed straight into a mug and teabags on request All of which I found out after asking four members of staff Location wise the hotel is actually several minutes walk away from Marble Arch not at Marble Arch as I had thought There were problems with the lifts stopping and starting the weekend we were there and very long queues to use them When I mentioned this on checking out the receptionist apologised but said they were not aware I was charged for wifi and had thought as a Marriott Member it was included so beware of extra charges , The beds were super comfy The double double room had beds big enough for a family of four bigger beds than the competition The breakfast was sumptuous however if you wanted a simple cup of tea and a slice of gluten free toast that seemed more difficult on both mornings this request was met with a long delay a of passing the request from staff to staff and no teapots available My family had finished their sumptuous breakfast by the time I was directed to mine 
47061,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Rooms are a tad tired and certainly the bathroom could have done with a facelift And wifi should certainly be free given what you pay for the room it is charged by the day , Staff were absolutely excellent across the board very welcoming and super helpful Breakfast is worth the indulgence and was delicious 
47062,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Our room Was freezing it didn t heat up even with the air conditioner on full blast we called reception in the night and asked for them to assist they did send someone up to have a look and he could not fix it he gave us a extra duvet but this did not help as it was just could getting out of the bed in the night and morning, Bar area and the staff were really great especially Andre who made a special bond with our son he really took the time to entertain him and provided a great service too
47063,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, We booked a room for 3 people We had 2 glasses 2 coffee cups 2 towels When we asked for extra bits to be brought to the room they didn t arrive We also then had to ask for sheets for the sofa bed We were told a member of staff would make up the bed He didn t and just chucked the sheets on the floor If you book a room for 3 you expect 3 people to be catered for This experience was very poor and a real nuisance , The location was good

47068,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, This is an ageing hotel that needs a makeover I paid 450 night You can get better quality for this price I paid 15 for high speed internet with poor connectivity and slow response that s a historical way of doing business in a city where free internet is omnipresent in every coffee shop bookstore and corner restaurant The mattress was awful big dip in the middle and I was constantly rolling into the middle of the bed They need new mattresses The gym was decently equipped with a small pool and jacuzzi but really squashed in a tiny space in the basement Reasonably located near the center of London but nowhere near the standard I expected nor close to that of Sofitel s nearby I have stayed at The neighborhood has many middle eastern establishments adding to the usual cultural diversity of the swinging city , The gym
47069,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff where fantastic so welcoming We had a family loss and their discretion on cancelling a room for some of our party who could not attend was appreciated in a difficult time We definity will be retuning

47076,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, nothing to complain it is however noteworthy to mention that it takes 10 minutes foot walk from next undergroound station, Great breakfast very good and friendly service booked as a full package incl breakfast family room ok for 4
47077,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Restaurant needs to be spaced for the breakfast the rate is bit high for the category of the hotel comparing to Europe hotels the reason might be the season , The breakfast was too good rooms are clean the staff were cooperative and the location is perfect very close to ajwa road the hotel is strict with the number of customer means if you are travelling with 2 adults and 1 or 2 child then book the family room with 4 beds and if you are with 2 adults and 4 children then book 2 rooms for 2 adults with extra beds or 1 family room 1 room for 2 adults The best way to visit anywhere is the Taxi cheap safe and faster

47081,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Unfortunately despite the fact I enjoyed my visit there was a few issues The receptionist charged our credit card for our room despite the fact that we prepaid Unfortunately this was not put back on our card for several days The internet only worked for the first day we stayed not good when you are travelling with teenagers Our room was not cleaned on the second day we stayed until we complained twice once at 3 30 and once at 5 pm , We like the Marriott group we stay in their hotels throughout the world We were warmly welcomed and our room was ready early which was wonderful after a long journey The room was clean and had good facilities We got free Wi Fi and breakfast The breakfast buffet was amazing great quality products and plenty of coffee and they even give you takeaway cups for that extra cup on the go the chef cooks perfect eggs The staff were extremely polite and helpful The concierge staff and the restaurant staff at breakfast were exceptional 
47082,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The location of the hotel and especially the other guests did make us feel like we were tourists in another country Nationalities don t bother us at all but being rude and ignorant when you say good morning or hello to people do , The breakfast was the best we had ever had in a hotel especially the freshly made omlets

47116,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Bathrooms are a bit tired , It was my wife s birthday the hotel sent up complimentary wine a cake very thoughtful a really nice touch Staff could not have been more helpful the buffet breakfast was fantastic for both quality selection 
47117,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, There wasn t really anything that we didn t like everyone had a lovely stay we ust wished there was a tube station nearer but this was only because of mobility reasons , The beds was very comfortable and ideal family room Cleaned regularly and great staff always willing to help Men who worked on the door were so helpful 
47118,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I didn t like leaving that s for sure, The nicest Hotel I have been too Home away from home Maybe the prices for dreakfest a bit expensive but the staff made up for that wonderful people see you in May for our Anniversary
47119,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Tea and coffee making facilities could have been better only two milks in the room we could have rang down for more as stated in the literature but still two only just does one cup of tea and with a family of four checking in would have been better to have more to start off with All in all a very pleasant visit and we will be back again, Check in was excellent very pleasant check in procedure with a smile Room was comfortable and had all the facilities expected Pool and changing area was clean and tidy and we had it all to ourselves when we went for a dip Breakfast had a wide selection to suit many appetites
47120,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The pool and facilities were unclean Danger of slipping and the air was hot and very damp and hard to breath I couldn t stand 5 min there , The staff really outdid themselves and were so friendly and caring A really wonderful hotel Top marks Our child became sick with the flu and they brought us ginger tea with honey always asking how she was doing A special thank you to the staff at the bar restaurant working in the half term Walking distance to Oxford St Marble Arch and ethnic restaurants on Edgeware Rd If you want to be frugal then I recommend the sandwiches from Pret instead much cheaper also M S has great food to take away We recommend dinning at the hotel which is much cheaper than what you ll end up paying incl the service charge of 12 5 elsewhere Will return missing the hotel already 
47121,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Nothing , The breakfast was excellent value as it was included in the room charge With 1 adult and 3 teenagers we more than got our money s worth I have stayed in many hotels such as this one but the breakfast here beats all other hotels hands down 
47122,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff were excellent very helpful and attentive My son was also given a birthday card and chocolate brownie after we mentioned it was his birthday We would definitely be happy to stay there again 
47123,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I prefer higher end hotels so my review may be skewed but I found the hotel to be rather ho hum There are nicer Marriott hotels in the same general area at a comparable price, Good hotel overall but there are better choices
47124,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I could not fault anything with this hotel , We meet in reception a lady called Victoria She was very welcoming and warming to us all The room was lovely bar and its staff just amazing 
47125,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Monkfish main course more expensive than other courses and RIDICULOUSLY small portion Other meals tasty and normal sized portion however Also pool being roped off for lessons when families swimming There shouldn t be lessons ever when a hotel advertises as having a pool facility , Staff really helpful and friendly especially at breakfast 
47126,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, Beds were so comfortable Room was spotless Staff were unbelievable So helpful and friendly Can t fault the place in any way Breakfast had everything Even had gluten free bread Would definitely go back 
47127,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The lift was broken that enable you to go to the leisure club So the alternative was to go out of the hotel down 2 flights of stairs through the underground car park It was absolutely freezing Also I had to carry my daughter down two flights of stairs An absolute nightmare The main reason we chose this hotel was for its leisure facilities I understand that this was an issue that was out of the hotels control However the manager on duty at the time was totally unsympathetic and kept saying it was out of their control I knew it was out of their control Also the beds were too soft so we had backache , Rooms were clean and tidy
47128,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, We booked the executive room it didn t feel very executive It was like a basic room with a sofa bed we didn t even have a coffee machine Didn t feel like paying the extra was worth it based on the room , The executive lounge was brilliant It was well stocked clean comfortable and managed by friendly staff The selection of snacks and drinks was really impressive 
47129,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, See above Bath had hairs in it Bedside phone was not connected , Room freezing cold on reporting this nothing was done We had to ring do own ask again the message had not been passed on to housekeeping 
47130,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The value of the money is too expensive for a just small hotel rooms The room are good but doesn t deserve that value , I like the location The cleanliness only
47131,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, the price is definitly high especially for usual customers and memebership holders they should be given special rates, location and ofcourse wonderful bed and pillow blissful sleep
47132,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I did think that 15 per person per hour was extreme for being allowed the use of a pool table This should have been complimentary surely Breakfast was a little disorganised on the Sunday morning possibly because most residents arrived to eat at the same time However this I would imagine was the norm so I am at a loss as to why the hotel was not prepared for it Room service food poor , Reception front of hotel and bar staff were all very pleasant and extremely helpful Nothing was a problem to them They were courteous polite and very informative Facilities in the hotel were exceptional pool executive suite bathroom toiletries towels etc three lifts that all worked This was my second visit to this hotel with my daughter and grandchildren and I was not disappointed The choice and selection at breakfast was excellent and a happy singing chef was an added extra Loved that extra touch 
47133,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Food very disappointing very limited and not reflected by menu on website Location a bit disappointing Had not realised it was more Edgeware road than marble arch so surrounded by Lebanese shisha bars restaurants and was subject to some comments etc when walking around , Staff were great very friendly and helpful at all times 
47134,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The room probably could do with a little bit of modernizing but it was by no means grubby The hotel is around a 10 minute work in both directions from a tube station so when you re going back and forward several times it puts a bit on your journey , The customer service was superb especially by the concierge staff They were all very friendly and helpful The hotel also accommodated our request for a higher floor and we were put on the 7th The beds were extremely comfortable and everything was clean and the room was fully equipped with tea coffee facilities bottled water and shampoo soap etc The price was also very reasonable for central London The location was walking distance to oxford street and plenty of restaurants supermarkets around
47135,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The staff cancelled my booking and didn t contact me until I came to check in although they did comp my entire stay at their grosvenor square , The location is very good right off Edgware road and the staff is very friendly 
47136,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I had a very unpleasant experience at that hotel The cost of my stay was prepaid two months in advance before we arrived Upon checking in the guy at the reception made a mistake and blocked the cost for my stay from my account even though it was prepaid Total amount 500 pounds That was the money I intended to spend during my short stay in London Instead I had to borrow money from a friend I didn t receive a single word of apology not a thought of compensating me for this horrible inconvenience Instead I was charged 9 pounds a day for using wifi I am very disappointed I checked out and my money has not been released yet I just can t understand how any hotel can treat its customers in such an arrogant manner , Location mest Matble Arch
47137,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I don t like the fact that service charges are automatically added to the bill Not just the Martiott I have to add , The staff on arrival were amazing as were restaurant and bar staff Lovely friendly warm hotel 
47138,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Nothing negative really, Loved the location proximity to Oxford Street for shopping and strolling to enjoy the Christmas lights Winterwonderland breakfast was fabulous with wide choices 
47139,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Nothing, From arriving to leaving couldn t of complained about one thing the staff we amazing They made our tip very special from a birthday card a bottle of champagne and a cake for my mums special birthday Breakfast was amazing best staff ever so friendly couldn t of done enough for us Just want to thank Victoria and her team for sorting everything for me 
47140,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, We booked partly because of the pool table which was taken all night by 8 non resident males who were not purchasing drinks when we stayed This was very frustrating as we really wanted to play pool during our evening and booked paid for this reason , It was a lovely hotel good facilities nice rooms and a nice lounge bar for the evening 
47141,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The spa facilities were just poor The jacuzzi was actually grimy water was brown and looked like it hadn t been cleaned in days and it had such a pungent odour that you couldn t shake The pool was nothing to write home about The Marriott charge for wifi might as well have been a premier inn , The breakfast was everything It was soooooo good and they has such an array of options The omlets was just delicious The staff were aite the room was decent 
47142,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Beware of hidden costs 9 to use wifi on you room but it s not made clear Service charge even when you buy a drink at the bar, Good location comfortable bed
47143,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The room was freezing through the night and we couldn t get warm as the air conditioning wasn t heating up to temperature When we went to have a shower in the morning the water was luke warm and the pressure kept changing , When checking in Katy was extremely helpful and very polite She did upgrade our room however it didn t end up being a very comfortable stay 
47144,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I d like to mention that the lift takes a long time to serve us And the pool was small , I like the pool it was good the staff were helpful and every thing was great 
47145,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Bath room very very small Food kids menu pizza wasn t good at all the children didn t want to eat it In room WiFi chargeable, Location was perfect Staff were very nice Cleaness of room
47146,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Room was freezing no heating and duvet too thin so was cold at night Had to wait more than half an hour to be seated for breakfast after being told it would only be 5 minutes by restaurant staff , Convenient location with parking on site 
47147,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Small dining room which couldnt accomodate our party of 8 together for breakfast and we even had to wait 30 minutes for 2 tables of 4 Thin duvets on beds with no extra blankets and cold room, Friendly front of house staff and concierge
47148,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Location and Woken up up by noisy staff at 5am at executive suit bit stuffy and Ltd compared to other Marriott hotels they may have the same name but are widely different, There is two hotels which appear to be Marriott at marbel arch so it was not the one I thought it would be
47149,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Noise from other rooms Cramped bedroom Bathroom very small Wifi expensive Bathroom water too hot with no signage of danger , Convenient for Theatre 
47150,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, We paid for access to the executive lounge it would have been nice to have more snacks there especially for the children, Went on chistmas eve with my husband and two children They loved it and we had a relaxing time The staff were friendly and nice The children enjoyed the pool table and chess available
47151,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Some days with to long line to get a table for breakfast , Everythingm very polite and nice personel and nice sourroundings and very nice breakfast buffet 
47152,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The car park is underground and quite tight to get in and out if you have a long car , The hotel is very easy to find just off the edgeware road and a short walk to Oxford street In addition you can either walk to the Dominion Theatre or catch a cab Cheap fare or bus If you want to use the underground plenty of stations nearby The big attraction was the hotel has its own car park 
47153,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, Hotel was lovely and great for families my children were greeted at the door and given a lovely colouring and sticker book from the staff All staff were very helpful and polite and couldn t do enough for us 
47154,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, A small one could do with a covered smoking area , The front of house staff were very welcoming and kind They ensured that my grandson was given an activity pack The door men were courteous and helpful Waiting on staff were also friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and staff made sure my grandson could have boiled eggs The reception area was festive and cosy 
47155,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The rotating door at the entrance was not working and the side doors were hard to open We could hear sirens going off all night, The staff was incredibly nice The location was great There were a lot of great places around for breakfast Fairly close to the tube 
47156,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, The pillows too soft bed uncomfortable The location was not ideal for us as we like to walk Good if you are happy to use the tube We stayed at the Thistle Kingsley last time it was much more central , The staff and hotel was lovely Nice atmosphere

47158,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, Excellent hotel in a perfect location 5 min walk from Marble Arch Hyde Park Usual expensive London prices Breakfast was nice room was comfortable bathroom in working order with a decent shower No complants
47159,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, The location Oxford street and edgware road where you can find most of the Arabic restaurants The tube station is 10 mins walk from the hotel too Breakfast has a variety of options
47160,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,No Negative, I have a serious nut allergy and at breakfast the manager came over to me and reassured that I would be fine to eat as the chef will make everything from scratch in clean panes he was so lovely and that just topped a perfect weekend Thank you 
47161,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Shower was not very modern or confortable Bed covers were a bit short and pillow too soft I found breakfast a bit expensive compared to quality , Location flexible changing my reservation to accomodate my children
47162,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I have been a long term user of the Marriott group and have stayed at the Marble Arch on several occasions It is very clear that the hotel has lost a lot of its overall comfort For as long as I can remember the Marriotts always had pride in in their bedding and quality and on this experience it was sadly lacking No winter duvet or extra blankets yes we could have the heating on but this was really not an option due to the general clatter of the system No bath robes or slippers and general poor and minimum soaps shower cream etc Fair quality breakfast but really quite cold in the dining room by the window All in all a classic case of cut backs showing Not the Marriott that it used to be, Great location with excellent staff
47163,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Nothing, This Hotel is a short walk from Marble Arch easy to walk along Oxford street and down Regent Street or straight down Park Lane and toward Knightsbridge The Hotel was extremely well managed with good sized clean rooms Excellent car park at a cost but still good value in central London 
47164,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, No comments every think was excellent, Will I stayed in the hotel before two years ago and I really like the location polite staff and the room size is good for money and good service and housekeeping and this is the reason for my stay this time
47165,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, It was noisy I mean the sound of the ambulance and the police cars is so loud and you will hear it at least 7times at night The room space is quit small for 3 people, Great hospitality and friendly stuff The hotel location is perfect where you can reach hyd park and oxford st in less than 5 min Arabic resturants pharmicies money exchange and supermarket are available around the hotel
47166,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Staff was rude and didn t show any customer service at check in was not ask for help with my luggage and did welcome me at all also was charged for internet when I was told its was free told while to refund my fee also my room was next to a services room couldn t sleep at night charge me 5 for empty my bins, Not much
47167,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Not that it is a flaw but hotel is located in a totally Arabic neighborhood Again wasn t any trouble for us but guess would be good to know in advance, Very good service Breakfast was excellent Room well equipped Well served by public transport with many attractions within walking distance
47168,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Small room and poor shower Not as clean as other Marriott hotels The hotel didn t seem to adopt the usual Marriott themes The gym pool are in need of updating , The service was ok and polite 
47169,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, They only thing I could say but it s my personal preference was the bed was very soft , We had a very pleasant stay could not fault staff or hotel Very happy to stay here again
47170,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Staff were tired except breakfast staff room product is tired and breakfast offer is also quite tired All in all a very tired hotel that has lost its passion and I have stayed in hotels that are tired and then staff and offering compensate for that and it still is memorable and you forget that it needs a renovation Here it is more one grey and gloomy hospitality experience from check in to check out , Location was good and staff at breakfast were lovely except the lady who were doing the omelettes she clearly did not enjoy her job 
47171,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I had to wait a long time to be seen which I thought was poor I also felt that because we were put on a table outside of the main restaurant area we were kind of forgotten I had to chase up the staff for tea and coffee and then chase them up again for cups , The hotel was very nice and I liked the fact they provided lots of towels etc for our room Once seen the reception staff were very helpful 
47172,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Decoration was awfully old fashioned The bathroom was clearly not renovated since at least twenty years shower in a tiny bath the soap was already used no cleaning pad For such a price and for a Marriot hotel I had more expectations, Location was perfect for us Near to Marylebone our favourite area Bed was good staff friendly
47173,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Hear neighbors from next room Car alarms most of night Tv remote didn t work housekeeping guy wasn t listening tried to tell us how to turn it on Room service food was poor,No Positive

47176,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, Bad location Long way to walk to nearest tube Marble Arch Breakfast not included and expensive Not free wifi in the room Asked for upper stories room but was placed at first floor Lots of noise from event rooms at ground floor Would not recommend this hotel , Room was okay King size bed but not very comfortable 
47177,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, I was expected to pay a 50 deposit for our stay even though the room was paid for in full before our stay Although this was above the amount of other more prestigious hotels in London to gain card details in the case we returned from our night out as irrational destructive human beings I was refused to use a debit card with my actual money in the account in favour of a false economy credit card To which the receptionist was quite stone faced and rude Also there was only 2 bottles of water in our room when the booking was for 3 guests But I imagine that they expected us to use the rationed tea bag per person and only sweetners if the third person was at all thirsty The location was completely out of the way with a long walk to a tube station , A selection of the staff were very pleasant
47178,London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch, wish i never went i had to ask three times to get my bed covers changed because my young daughter laid some on them and they did not want to change it always yes yes and they come and try to clean it by hand they didnot remove and put a new duvet or bed cover it was so stinky i had to sleep on the mattress and one clean sheet when j got fed up,No Positive
