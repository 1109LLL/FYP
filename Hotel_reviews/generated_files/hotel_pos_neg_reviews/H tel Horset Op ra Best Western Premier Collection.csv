78095,H tel Horset Op ra Best Western Premier Collection, Basically it felt like poor value for money The staff were helpful but aloof and overall it just felt like a lot to pay for what was essentially a tiny bedroom with an attached bathroom Also they claim to have very good internet but this just wasn t the case and I had a number of times where I had problems with the connectivity for example video conferencing or doing anything more advanced than mail or web browsing , Location between Opera and the Louvre was very convenient

78102,H tel Horset Op ra Best Western Premier Collection, I just couldn t believe the missing basics Maybe a bit spoiled having stayed at some lovely hotels but given it has 4 stars and the price no robe really awful towels mediocre bathroom products no complimentary water biscuits in tea tray not renewed next day door key needed to be re programmed three times kettle lead was silly short so I had to keep pulling furniture about to plug it in No spare blanket and I was cold as it had rained a lot I think Best Western are sitting on their laurels due to the great location but need to up their game It was a bit faded and just not that enjoyable an experience This doesn t include the fact they took the money off my card before I arrived I had wanted to pay in cash for the room and had the euros with me , The barman was lovely friendly and accommodating The location was brilliant quiet but central
