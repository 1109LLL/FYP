372586,The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, The level is supposed to be a 5 star experience we even stayed in a junior suite and STILL had a subpar experience if that tells you anything The staff are not helpful They make you walk down for anything you need instead of bringing it to you Nearly half the items I tried to order either from the restaurant downstairs or the room service menu turned out to be not available We literally ordered 3 different wines at one point and where told they didn t have ANY of them The level facility is hardly a facility at all its an office with a small room available for peanuts whooptie doo they make it sound pretty exclusive so bravo to marketing but if you hype something up you need to at least HALF deliver Especially with those PRICES If I could reverse the entire trip I would stay literally anywhere else because at least I pay for what I recieve for 300 400 a night it was SOOO not worth it that I almost feel robbed because I paid 5 star hotel prices for a 3 star experience If you like to spend a lot of money and you have low expectations then this is the hotel for you If I can even save one person from extreme disappointment I will be happy , Ummm almost nothing we received chocolates every day that was okay but they knocked on our door several times a day to deliver said chocolate so it became pretty annoying The double shower head was cool too 
372587,The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, Nothing Everything was perfect , As soon as you enter the building the staff s service is amazing You re treated with such grace and it s genuine The benefits for staying in The Level are unbelievable I went with my partner stayed on the 29th floor and the view was phenomenal We loved everything about the hotel everything including the eggs benedict It s a must visit and I m back next year 
372588,The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, We took the bus and metro to get to the hotel Really difficult and on the return journey took a cab to the airport for about Eur 38 much better Location is far from the city centre and key attractions and night life Metro station is 5 minute walk Rooms are small and the bathroom is very small , The views from the 29th floor were great Pity its not sea facing Breakfast on the 24th floor also had spectacular views 
372589,The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, The rooms smell of damp due to the lino flooring , Staff were amazing Massage was one of the best I ve ever had Exclusive lounge was a lovely bonus Views from all restaurants were breathtaking 
372590,The Level at Melia Barcelona Sky, The room did get very hot throughout the night The air con could have been cooler breezier , Me and my partner stayed at the 5 Level for our anniversary We were wonderfully looked after like royalty by friendly smiley faces We arrived to romantic petals champagne chocolate and fruit in our amazing room that overlooked the beautiful city of Barcelona and the sea We explored all of the hotels facilities throughout our stay and were not disappointed by the variety of food and drink on offer at all the different bars restaurants terraces within the hotel Although drinks were expensive we were fully prepared for this to be the case and the free bar in the evening certainly made up for this We also enjoyed the luxurious spa facilities which did not fail to meet our expectations Our massages were incredibly relaxing and set us up for a lovely soak in the Jacuzzi and other facilities such as the sauna The staff were very open to recommend new places for us to visit as this is not our first time in Barcelona we were keen to find some new local restaurants and bars and they certainly had some good recommendations which were located within a perfect distance from the hotel We have had such an amazing time in Barcelona and will definitely think about staying here again
