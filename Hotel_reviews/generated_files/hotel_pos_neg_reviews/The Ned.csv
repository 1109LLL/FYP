417946,The Ned, The fact you don t make it apparent that they will charge you an extra 150 a night deposit cover charge the fact they double charged me and won t return my money and are saying it is policy when it is not , I loved everything about the ned
417947,The Ned, Lighting low in rooms difficult for makeup staff a bit disorganised in rooftop restaurant for breakfast and bagel bar multiple wrong orders, Amazing property beautiful elegant and a lot of fun would stay again in a heartbeat rooftop made it 
417948,The Ned, Exclusive rules for children not mentioned prior to booking Rules were poorly explained on arrival and led to embarrassing situation at roof top Aggressive staff policies on roof top Rude service in restaurant Family suite was down two flights of stairs a bit tricky with prams and kids More of a night club than a hotel Confusion between hotel private members club Cars can not stop at the front door making for tricky arrival departure Only hotel in 2 1 2 months travel that we didn t feel welcomed because of the kids, Impressive design and amenities Hotel staff were fantastic
417949,The Ned, Many of the staff were borderline rude and we had to complain twice about very rude staff We did think that the hotel values more pretentious clients and didn t feel welcome The management did listen to our complaints and were very convincing that things would change The hotel is very new and these maybe teething troubles The food in the many restaurants was not very good and certainly not worth the money , The bed was very comfy and lovely toiletries in the room Nice historical building The grill restaurant was very nice although too expensive Some of the staff were very nice but are the exception not the norm 
417950,The Ned, The only thing I missed was a jacuzzi just being greedy , Loved the food brilliant choice of restaurants and bars The attention to detail in the decor was stunning It was a treat to stay in The Ned Staff were warm and friendly We really enjoyed our weekend The indoor pool hammam sauna and steam room was a lovely way to unwind after sightseeing 
417951,The Ned, First thing s first The Ned is a really good hotel I just have a few quibbles and I share them more in the way of hoping they will be constructive than as barbed criticism The light issue many reviews have mentioned this and it is a problem The lighting levels are way too dark Whilst I m fine with atmospheric lighting in the public areas in the bedrooms it is verging on absurd Even with all the many convoluted lamp systems switched on you still need a torch yes a torch to find anything at night That s just silly They should sort this out The wardrobes the wardrobes provided in The Cozy Room are completely inadequate for anything more than a one night stay There is only a half size provision for hanging items which might be fine if you re a bloke and only want to hang jackets but you re out of luck if you re not and you have dresses They just don t fit The wardrobe also squeezes in the room s only set of small drawers Totally inadequate storage even for 1 guest travelling light I can t imagine what it must be like for a couple sharing the room for several nights The restaurant hotel club balance one of the big drawbacks about staying in such a popular establishment is that you ve got little chance of being able to dine in one of the 6 or so restaurants for any meal including breakfast unless you book well in advance I tried to have breakfast in the hotel every day of my 5 day stay and was told every day the restaurants were full The only place I ever managed to eat at was the deli A toasted bagel isn t really the kind of breakfast you expect for a 5 hotel It does very much feel the the F B and the private club are the main focus and the hotel and its customer are a bit of an afterthought Hopefully these small issues get resolved in time as this really is a good hotel , The Ned looks fabulous and the attention to detail in the period design is just fabulous Whilst the bedrooms themselves are small the facilities especially the downstairs pool and spa area are really world class Of equal quality are the staff Every single person I interacted with at The Ned was cheerful helpful and genuinely seemed to be enjoying working there For a hotel club restaurant centre that is as crazily busy as The Ned is that s impressive I d like to thank them all for making my stay pleasant The jazz inspired entrainment is great The food what I managed to get at least is fine The Cow Shed bathing products in the rooms are a fantastic addition 
417952,The Ned,No Negative, Welcoming friendly staff beautiful building inside and with history very clean comfortable room and bed excellent I will definitely be returning 
417953,The Ned, It has to decide if its a city destination or a hotel for it s occupants if it wants to be both it s service staff needs improvement As a fairly new hotel this is understandable as a paying guest no , Exceptionally well put together Reception rooms fittings decor A We took a basic room as i hesitate to take a better room till I ve stayed in a hotel atleast once and i have to say our room was exceptional 
417954,The Ned, Nothing it was really a perfect stay , Hands down best hotel I ve been to in a very long time From the staff to the decor this place isn t missing a thing Great job
417955,The Ned, no, walking into the Ned is like walking onto a film set this has to be the best hotel in London fantastic restaurants lively bars great crowd don t miss the rooftop pool and bars 
417956,The Ned,No Negative, Fantatsic place Only wish we could have stayed longer All the restaurants and bars were packed Book in advance Rooftop pool bar restaurant uber cool 
417957,The Ned, The rooms on the lower floors can be a bit noisy but the hotel offers earplugs , The interior design is fabulous the bed is super comfortable the bathroom is big and full of free toiletries there are 9 restaurants inside the hotel I basically didn t want to leave it in the morning 
417958,The Ned, It didn t bother me but the only criticism I would have is that the bedrooms are noisy as they are all above the super noisy lobby bar area so if you want a peaceful early night this isn t the place for you Neither if you want a quieter romantic meal is this for you I absolutely loved it though and the value for money v its competitors I would class this as placed like Me London etc is incredible , Super cool hotel that is totally unique in London The setting of the old HSBC HQ mixed with the 1920 s glamour vibe that they have decorated the hotel in is a really stunning mix All of the restaurants and bars are in the huge bustling lobby with a band stand in the middle where you get great live music Everything was stunning especially The Vault bar downstairs where you sit in a setting of old safety deposit boxes from the original bank 
417959,The Ned, Nothing, It was like going back in time to the roaring 20 s Decor was amazing staff were extremely helpful and every little detail was thought of Rooms are a bit pricey but they are total worth it 
417960,The Ned, Grumpy staff at reception Incredibly loud in the lobby when music was playing Noise from lobby can be heard in room until late at night , V helpful room service staff 
417961,The Ned, Food in Cecciones Italian was tasteless steak over cooked and tough vegan pasta was bland and sent back to kitchen The only complaint we had everything else was perfect, Beautifully renovated old bank building fantastic attention to detail loved it all
417962,The Ned, I was overcharged through booking com A sum of money was taken from my credit card The hotel had no record of it They said that booking com would sort it out and I am still waiting to be refunded over a month later I m very disappointed with this, Atmosphere was amazing Loved the decor and the ambience
417963,The Ned, Lighting fixtures in room are beautiful but not very practical when you need to really find something Wish they had some bright overhead light as an option , Stylish rooms excellent bath amenities from Cow Shed luxurious towels Super comfortable bed and linens Small details like small cocktail bar in room Food options are excellent Food that we got through a room service was delicious and beautifully presented and quick Very friendly and helpful staff at all levels If you choose to get connecting rooms you get private little annex with room doors facing each other Downstairs hair salon is laid back and pleasant very high quality cuts 
417964,The Ned, No price list on mini bar Roof bar and pool overcrowded A bit to noisy in the bottom floor during night , Very nice staff nice spa with pool and different exclusive facilites Nice with all the small bars everywhere Comfortable room with luxury products 
417965,The Ned, What s not to like Maybe the high prices , Sheer unadulterated luxury the vast beautiful interiors courteous staff quality bathroom products and a super comfortable bed The rooftop swimming pool the gym and spa were great the cocktail bar in the vault was extraordinary and breakfast the next morning was perfect 
417966,The Ned, Staff on the rooftop a little rude I had two guests with me and the policy for hotel guests is for only one guest per room admitted to the members areas The door girl was far from polite and showed us the door Not very cool ,No Positive
417967,The Ned, Too many restaurants and bars in the lobby Very noisy till very late at night , Comfortable room with everything u need Good location for tourists Lots of landmarks are within walking distance 
417968,The Ned, Not being able to eat there just far too busy also not being told to book a table for breakfast then having to wait almost 2 hours to complete , Great hotel but far too busy on the evening 
417969,The Ned, Rooftop swimming pool is tiny expect plunge pool Staff and service vary significantly not five star except for the roof My friend tried to order room service from the night menu and items weren t available and staff were not helpful , Spa pool great comfy bed and good toiletries Rooftop staff great
417970,The Ned, I probably needed more guidance on the different restaurants and types of food as they all looked quite similar and on the evening of arrival were very busy hence the reason why i chose the rooftop restaurant, The provisions in the room were spectacular they had thought of everything The rooftop bar and restaurant with pool and views is amazing as are the selection of the many restaurants on the lobby level
417971,The Ned, Staff should offer better orientation introduction on arrival explaining all food and Bev outlets that guests can access and also that they are not allowed to bring guests to which would avoid embarrassment ,No Positive
417972,The Ned, Too short a stay Still some improvements to make The place us after all rather new room keys not always working Reception area too noisy , Fantastic atmosphere Staff impeccably polite Great choice of bars and restaurants Fantastic spa and treatments Dream in door and outdoor pools 
417973,The Ned, restaurant food not at the same standard as the hotel work needed Italian restaurant on flavour Wine list also expensive for very average wine, Amazing vibe and room room facilities first class Loved the bathroom and mini bar accessories Top class service
417974,The Ned, The only slight downsides were the size of the rooms mainly the second time we returned we were in a smaller room and that we couldn t take our daughter and her boyfriend to dinner at the roof top bar only one plus one allowed per room , Loved the vibe and decor Features of the original Edwin Lutyens building formerly Midlands Bank and then HSBC were left pretty much intact which gave the impression that the hotel had been there forever whereas it had only been opened just over a month when we arrived The rooftop bar was fantastic The staff were great really helpful and the choice of dining terrific we particularly enjoyed coffee in the lobby bar and loved the food at Kaia We liked it so much when we first stayed there we chose to stay there again a week later when we returned to London 
417975,The Ned, Rooms giving on to the atrium are extremely noisy owing to the restaurants on the ground floor and the absence of sufficient insulation for the windows This is a very significant problem In the meantime ask for a room on the outside of he hotel one that doesn t give on to the atrium I would also say that the hotel has yet to reconcile what it wants to be and what it s priorities are Hotel reception was brilliant accommodating to a fault welcoming friendly efficient But the hotel is also a private club and has several independently operated restaurants and bars that are not nearly as interested in prioritizing service for hotel guests On multiple occasions we were made to feel distinctly unwelcome in the restaurants and bars since we were merely hotel guests and not club members That is somewhat odd particularly since over my short stay I paid nearly half as much as a club member would pay in dues for an entire year I hope these are simply growing pains but I fear they might be a feature by design , Rooms are gorgeous with fabulous design much different from standard business accommodation in the City Amenities in the bathrooms are without equal in any of the many hundreds of hotels I have stayed worldwide 
417976,The Ned, I had a lunch meeting and booked into Millie s lounge for lunch Choose the lamb cutlets and unfortunately they weren t the best choice Full of fat and I actually couldn t eat them The hotel seemed to be more of a hub stroke meeting point as the place was absolutely packed and I couldn t get a seat in the bar later in the day Full of youngsters drinking which is fine if it s a bar , Traveling to London very frequently on business I was keen to try The Ned I d booked a middle room which was fine Fairly spacious and a king size bed Bathroom toiletries were great 
417977,The Ned, Tried to go to the roof top pool on Friday evening It s off putting as you have to walk through a restaurant and it s so busy with people in suits standing around the pool that I just didn t want to get into it Would have been nice if it was quieter, The indoor pool is amazing 
417978,The Ned, The hotel is almost too big It s easy to feel lost It gets very busy in the evenings , Wonderful and luxuary hotel brand new and fresh Excellent staff in the reception Super clean gym and spa The roof top bar is fantastic 
417979,The Ned, noisy room limited shelf wardrobe space no luggage rack scratched my hand on the doorknob no shower by pool sauna water station and towels at gym not adequate , great location if you need to be in the city great choice of restaurants love all the Ned Club facilities great place to entertain nice room design and bathroom toiletries 
417980,The Ned, I liked it all with the exception of a power cut at 5 in the morning, Rooms perfectly reflect the neo 30s ambiance public spaces and bars restaurants perfect
417981,The Ned,No Negative, Loved The Ned The room was rather small but very well equipped Great bathroom and products The hotel itself is a dream it looks amazing and has great restaurants The roof terrace and poolside that you can access as a hotel guest is great too Will definitely stay again 
417982,The Ned, A very minor issue I couldn t get the Coffee maker in my room to work , Everything It s like walking through history updated to be an amazing overall leisure and stay experience I will not want to stay at any other hotel in London other than The Ned from now on 
417983,The Ned, Service teething issues Slow some rude staff didn t really understand the system fully most very lovely and polite but just not slick enough given the prices , Facilities great 
417984,The Ned, The room was very small just about 14 square meter It was hard even to move inside for two people It may be ok for single person It was also so much noise the room do not have bath , The people were friendly amd location is good 
417985,The Ned, Went to rooftop pool and the young guy at the desk had a poor attitude asked us to bring our room cardholder to access the rooftop area as if I d done something wrong despite the fact I showed I had my room key and given my name which was checked against a list More his individual attitude manner that was not befitting of a 5 star hotel Had to open the door for ourselves with suitcases on the way out whilst 2 staff members inside the hotel who were not clearly identifiable as were not wearing uniforms stood and chatted Would never have happened at Shangri La where we stayed the next night Other members of staff however were very pleasant seems to be luck of the draw whoever you interact with Minor issues above which did not detract from overall quality of stay but you would expect not to happen in a 5 star hotel , Finished to an extremely high standard Crash pad room more than big enough for 2 people Thought of everything with the facilities available in the room Vault bar and rooftop area very cool and good drinks Breakfast on the rooftop restaurant also good Overall great stay and would recommend 
417986,The Ned, The drilling that started at 08 30am on a Saturday morning The maid knocking to clean the room at 9am on a Saturday morning The 40 minute wait to get an extra bathrobe , Staff exemplary polite helpful and well presented 
417987,The Ned, My room had limited daylight Was ok for one night , Trendy and comfortable rooms Slept super well Excellent bar and restaurant Really made the business trip enjoyable and an experience
417988,The Ned, Everything brilliant , Ab Fab Attention to detail excellent Very busy yet staff unflustered and helpful at all times A brilliant birthday treat for my husband 
417989,The Ned, Nothing , The place is incredible You could literally stay in the hotel the whole time and there would always be something to do The place to be in London at the moment
417990,The Ned, bathroom really needs brighter lighting a close up mirror a second hook for towels You need to do something with the dead corner in the bathroom maybe a seat full length mirror , Beautifully decorated cozy fluffy bed great shower bath with a ton of bath products to chose from
417991,The Ned, Very much an hotel for those who want to be enjoying every minute Few places to relax quietly away from the crowds Restaurants on ground floor are too crowded and noisy to have a relaxing meal other than in the Lutyens Grill which proved to be the welcome exception , Very attentive service during our whole stay we only met one member of staff who let the side down and it was clear that he was the exception Excellent food and comfortable rooms 
417992,The Ned, The room was very noise and could not open the window at night for security reasons so for people like me who like a bit of fresh air at night this was problematic Till 1 am when I had to call the reception you could hear an on going subtle noise of music bum bum they said the had music all over the night and eventually turned the volume down There was an empty bottle under the bed when I got in and where disappointed when I found out that the cosy rooms had no bath though on the sites it says Room facilities Air conditioning Iron Desk Ironing Facilities Heating Wardrobe Closet Cleaning products Clothes rack Shower Hairdryer Bathrobe Toilet Bathroom Bath or Shower , All the unique touches the atmosphere the facilities the style all possible extras you need and more 
417993,The Ned, Nothing, Thanks for making us feel so comfortable We travelled with a 6 month old baby and every member of staff was excellent and welcoming The bed linens were gorgeous and the bed so comfortable we loved all the Cowshed products I bought 3 room service was quick and very high quality I love the little details like the drinks being served in crystal tumblers You have gone above and beyond and it shows Your cleaning staff are superb the room was spotless absolutely spotless Very relaxing bathroom and good sized room We felt very welcome and very relaxed We will be booking the Ned on our future trips to London we were so appreciative of what you have done 
417994,The Ned, The ladies on the roof top restaurant didn t seem to want me to eat in the restaurant on Friday They said all the tables were booked and yet the hour I spent by the bar area having a wonderful salmon salad from the small menu there were plenty of free tables I felt that I wasn t posh or important enough Very sad sorry , Manuel on the check in desk He was polite patient and extremely helpful and friendly Really made my stay feel special Thank you My room was gorgeous Every detail was stunning House keeping were impeccable and friendly 
417995,The Ned,No Negative, The Ned is a wonderful hotel in the middle of the City The building used to belong to Midland Bank now HSBC and many interesting features from that era are still incorporated into the hotel e g vault The restaurant and bars are amazing as is the private club offering a spectacular view of the City Very fair room rates for a top knotch 5 star hotel in London 
417996,The Ned, Sadly the room had a smell and was equipped for a handicapped person resulting in everything being very low mirror sink bed and I m a very TALL person However the staff gave me a new room on day 2 of my stay and it was fabulous , Upon early arrival I received a room right away 
417997,The Ned, The entertainment on the ground floor is excellent but the sound system needs to be balanced and improved Poor selection of beers at bars london is famous for its real ale and craft beers the NED needs to step up , The NED is like a resort hotel in the centre of London With 5 or 6 public restaurants plus a further three restricted to members and hotel guests The rooftop club with restaurant bar and pool is excellent 
417998,The Ned, No free snacks or nibbles in room no camomile teabagsotherwise perfect, Decor ambience grandeur glorious pool views attentive staff Cowshed products 
417999,The Ned, View from room was just across an 8 foot lighting shaft to other rooms Lifts so dark you couldn t see the floor numbers on the panel Electronic door keys were hard to work until you got the knack confirmed by other guests Very little hanging drawer space anywhere No hooks for towels etc in the bathroom They ve only been open 2 months so give them a chance to sort out these teething probs, The terrace facilities and view are spectacular and the general ambience a subtle mixture of posh casual 
418000,The Ned, The location is inconvenient for leisure sightseeing travelers The lobby is a huge fashion scene which is fun if you like that I requested a slightly early checkin and when we got there the room wasn t ready but we were told it would be 30 min More like 90 No turn down service one of the days The room was beautifully furnished and had everything you could think of from coffee to a lint brush but it was very hard to turn on the lights , Beautiful rooms with great in room amenities Great beds great towels great products
418001,The Ned, Checked out and went up to the rooftop bar and pool area an hour or two later for a drink on a nice sunny day Were staggered to be told that as we d checked out we were effectively barred a cheap and unnecessary policy made us feel completely taken for granted, Beautiful hotel clearly no expense spared Great facilities from top to bottom 
418002,The Ned, Our room 200 was above the hotel deliveries area and building work taking place next door so was awoken early on Saturday and Sunday due to the noise , An excellent hotel top class from start of our stay until the finish
418003,The Ned, There wasn t anything that we didn t like about the hotel Next time we will stay longer to make use of the endless facilities , This 5 star hotel was amazing the views from the rooftop bar were stunning the facilities are endless The hotel staff were very friendly polite and accommodating I would definitely recommend having a drink in the vault bar We liked everything about the hotel and will definitely be coming back to stay very soon It s definitely one of a kind for the City The rooms sell out very quick so book in advance to avoid disappointment 
418004,The Ned,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with well appointed amenities Exquisitely designed Loved the attention to detail live music in the lounge and Cowshed bathroom products 
418005,The Ned, Nothing, Great atmosphere in the bars and restaurants particularly the vault Room was very well appointed with everything you could need Will definitely stay again 
418006,The Ned, The milk provided in our room for teas and coffees was off Monotonous house music played around the rooftop pool They add 12 5 service charge when you buy a drink at the pool bars fair enough if you ve had table service but I went to the bar myself he literally had to take a bottle out of a cupboard , The rooftop pool is lovely And the Vault bar is very cool We were able to check in early and got a free upgrade and a lovely cake and a card delivered to the room for my boyfriend s birthday Right opposite Bank tube so very easy to get out and about Very comfortable room beautiful looking lobby with wide choice of places to eat and drink We definitely want to go back
418007,The Ned, space and TV, The location was good the design was supreme but the rooms are too small Nearly daily you wound yourself at the iron bed as the place between bed and wall was too small The television was not working for two out of five days due to IT problems this is not acceptable for this level of hotel 
418008,The Ned, The hotel is new and has a few teething problems My TV kept freezing and the service in Millie s was not good on Saturday brunch time , The Ned is an amazing historic building which I was pleased to see had been saved by being made into a hotel sympathetic to the era of the building and with amazing facilities It was buzzing with life an atmosphere as well so clearly has filled a need in the area I loved it 
418009,The Ned, Few minor stuff ups w room service nothing major, Room cleaned twice day Fast room service Polite staff Asked for early check in and late check out both were provided Wanted hair done appointment available immediately
418010,The Ned, I dined in Millie s restaurant The food was excellent the staff very friendly and helpful but the service could have been quicker Most concerning however was the very loud entertainment in the central concourse which totally overwhelmed the entire ground floor It may be that clients enjoying a drink at the various bars will have appreciated the music Also the check out process was a disaster One of the 3 receptionists on duty was happily chatting to a single client for over half an hour whilst a long queue developed of unhappy clients wishing the check out I was late for an appointment as a consequence which the glass of champagne dispensed by a concerned member of staff did not alleviate The location of the rooms can be confusing , Fabulous location and outstanding property steeped in a history I appreciated greatly The views from the roof terrace are spectacular The room was clean and very well appointed The management have tried to think of everything to make a stay comfortable 
418011,The Ned, Nothing it was perfect , Probably the best hotel experience I ve ever had cannot fault this place Totally amazing stay can t wait to go again 
418012,The Ned, I was woken up 3 times by 3 different cleaning crews Room service needs improving, It was great experience bed was really comfortable the room was cosy
418013,The Ned, The fact we had to go home It really felt like a home away from home Too much choice in regards to eating and places to drink Truly fabulous I would recommend The Ned to everyone looking for a 6 star venue and service , We had a slight issue with the air conditioning in our room but the staff couldn t have been more helpful in getting it sorted The Ned is pure luxury probably the most grand and prestigious facility in the country 
418014,The Ned, As I mentioned above the room was a tad dark, I liked everything apart from I know I m knit picking but I could do with brighter lighting in the room I could hardly see at all But it wouldn t stop me from staying here again
418015,The Ned, It was perfect can t fault it , We got married that morning and when I told the hotel they upgraded us to a two bed apartment with its own living room bar and left us a chocolate cake and flowers to say congrats Really kind of them and made our stay even more special 
418016,The Ned, Lovely bathroom could do with a shower curtain floor gets very wet Breakfast service in Millie s was very slow , Amazing really Had a medium type room and it really exceeded expectations Possibly the nicest room I ve stayed in in the UK I spent 1 night here and visited the Zobblers cafe for a New York style deli sandwich and Brooklyn beer the amazing vault bar for a G T the spa and pool the Italian restaurant for dinner and Millie s restaurant for breakfast I also spent some time chilling in the beautiful room watching a free movie on the huge tv lots of movie choices but in the opulence and grandness of this hotel it had to be the Great Gatsby 
418017,The Ned, staff didn t know who was staff and who wasn t as they all dressed differently and certain staff treat you differently if they though you were not a guest at the hotel I know it is newly opened and they will have teething problems but you staffing issues needs addressed , hotel was lovely roof top bar and pool was amazing
418018,The Ned, My room was small for what I consider medium Also straight in front of the bed was an odd 6ft panel that could have easily been addressed with a tapestry or some other creative solution It looked like an ironing board door but not properly finished There was also a large leak discoloration on the ceiling Room 446 When I was checking out unfortunately their was an enormous ceiling leak in the lobby , Mostly everything It s fabulous and grand in every sense 
418019,The Ned, Absolutely nothing , Everything you need was provided in the room You didn t even have to pack with Net a porter on speed dial in the room Excellent service including a fabulous burger in the bar at midnight rooftop pool comfy beds amazing breakfast just the perfect weekend away 
418020,The Ned, The double rooms could have been bigger Traveller always want more space , Everything fantastic ambience the moment we walked into the hotel lobby which is like no other hotel Live band playing multiple restaurants lots of people just hanging out and plenty of buzz Rooms were good beds very comfy excellent toiletries I wish all hotels in the world have bathroom toiletries like the Ned Makes every bath a different experience 
418021,The Ned, Hot water in bathroom is sometimes too hot or too cold and it should wait for some period to stabilize, 20 s are back again Everything really everything is on perfect level Even live music in the hall is according to the hotel atmosphere I ve never been in better hotel with better mood in my life
418022,The Ned, Lobby lounges were a bit too loud to conduct business meetings , The decor and ambiance was really cool and felt like I was at the center of where everything was happening 
418023,The Ned, Too many knocks on the door by staff , Great coffee at Cafe Sou the best I ve had in England Room had excellent bathroom and associated consumables 
418024,The Ned, Extremely busy poolside rooftop on sat even by 9 20am Crazy stuff We left quickly, Yes bed super cosy Attention to detail excellent Everything you need st your fingertips 
418025,The Ned, only 2 things that could improve our room hooks to hang big towels or maybe another towel rail I wear long floaty dresses wardrobe not equipped for anything long maybe a hook on the wardrobe I had to hang my dresses on the standard lamp , Bed really comfy Excellent tea facilities fabulous towels Loved the little extras slippers fab
418026,The Ned,No Negative, What an amazing hotel Great place to spend a weekend and the rooftop was especially great in the weather The pool and spa area are amazing and the reception is stunning really liked the addition of the jazz band Food also was really good quality and reasonable 
418027,The Ned, Poor noise insulation Staff started hoovering very loudly at 3 45a m Meaning that i used ear plugs for first time in my life Also a shame that the Hamman room was not yet open and was still being constructed , The room the staff bars facilities
418028,The Ned, The staff can be so much better Especially on the rooftop They are simply rude Some colleagues at the reception were embarrassed for them Well they should be Everything is 5 star level except the staff Lots and lots of work to do , Amazing venue lovely rooms and so comfortable Super pools great restaurants and perfect situation in London 
418029,The Ned, Roof top terrace is far too busy and even when it s not service varies from the very rude to incompetent Even staff admitted they were trying to resolve the roof issue ,No Positive
418030,The Ned, Very rude concierge who I mistakenly asked where I could get towels as he was in a uniform on the roof terrace by the pool Instead of finding somebody who could help he just said I dont know I am a concierge ask a waiter The Pool gets incredibly busy and unless you get there super early on a nice day you won t get a lounger or even a chair There is no reserving either or preference for hotel guests I would also say the vibe arround the pool is a bit pretentious , The building is superb and on the whole the staff were really nice restaurants good although still experiencing teething problems no gas meant we only had the choice of one 
418031,The Ned,No Negative, Service and decor was excellent When I arrived the room wasn t ready due to a mix up but the staff were very apologetic and gave me complimentary drinks at the bar while I waited Room was mid sized as I expected for an older building in central London The room was very well finished and both clean and comfortable 
418032,The Ned, got woken up by a very loud person guest passer by or staff I m not sure at 6 30 in the morning He was talking loudly for an hour outside on the street below Not the hotels fault unless it was staff A bit annoying when it s your first sleep in in 2 years but not the end of the world , As a whole the hotel was amazing and the rooftop is the gem 
418033,The Ned, Noise from the backstreet garbage recycling etc poor acoustics for the jazz band playing evenings at the lobby no working desk in the room, Location building lobby ambient bars functional rooms with a lot of accessories for the traveller fiendly staff 
418034,The Ned, Air Con didn t work in room called twice to front desk nothing Mentioned again at checkout some poor excuse about yes its warm outside , Fabulous hotel some teething problems but worth visit
418035,The Ned, I wish it was more affordable, One of the nicest hotels I ve ever stayed in Pricey experience but cannot fault any part of it A lot of thought has been put in to the entire customer journey simply divine 
418036,The Ned, No view from room but I m being super picky and that really didn t matter to us at all , Amazingly welcoming and fun staff great food and drink selection comfy beds lovely toiletry selection and overall great vibe Rooftop pool and bar is awesome but try the indoor pool and spa area too Fun bar The Vault downstairs and good gym 
418037,The Ned,No Negative, Lovely place with excellent service Very good location next to Bank tube station and 4 mins walk to Cannon Street Room was nicely decorated Attention to details is impressive Lovely cowshed products in the bath room One of the most amazing mini bar selections I ve seen and packed full of snacks They provided everything you need Hairs dry hair straighter sliders porter 23 hours room service Hotel has many behtiful bars and restaurants I ll definitely return to this hotel again 
418038,The Ned, Staff Poorly trained Not soho standard Specially the poolside on the roof Staff with massive attitude problem and lack of understanding what s going on , Love the energy Lobby area with great restaurants for local business is a great idea
418039,The Ned, Some staff were really friendly and helpful but others were not Some lacked local knowledge and requests were not actioned as requested It s such a great hotel but is reliant on maintaining it s reputation by the actions of it s staff which unfortunately was the only thing that let it down in my opinion , Superb new hotel with excellent facilities 
418040,The Ned, Nothing of significant, The best cosy room I have ever stayed in I have never come across a bathroom so well stocked with everything you could think of and all the toiletries in full size bottles Cowshed so no skimping Also thank you for putting ceiling lights in the bedroom so many rooms these days only have wall lights I had dinner with my nieces in Millies restaurant and it was excellent my only Moan is I could not get into the roof top restaurant even though I was a resident It would be helpful if you could book in advance Other than that excellent hotel and would definitely recommend it
418041,The Ned, We felt the level of service in the bar restaurant was very poor we were also asked to wait 30 40 mins to be able to have a drink in the vault even though it was half empty We were also told that we couldn t have dinner on the roof as we weren t members and because there were 5 of us looking to eat we were told if we were members they could accommodate us or if there was only 4 eating Such a stupid thing to say to guests even if that was the rule We probably wouldn t return to this hotel in the future , Loved our stay fantastic building and hotel Great food and atmosphere 
418042,The Ned, Cranky people only a couple of persons from the staff were really nice to us the concierge people from the reception the valet Just after check out we realised we had some time to kill until leaving to the airport so we wanted to grab a coffee on the terrace and we were not allowed anymore it was just a coffee that made me realise what horrible service you have and that you don t value anything you take our money and then that s it There was another guy at one of the restaurants in the lobby the first on the left side from the main entrance who was very rude to us we sat down and asked for a coffee while waiting to leave to the airport and 15 minutes after he brought the coffee he asked us to leave because there were people that wanted to eat Although it s members only I really don t see a great service for the guests or members or just visitors I think you need to improve a lot if you really want to have top service for a 5 hotel Despite all that I am still coming back I hope to have a better experience on my future stay , We loved the concept the food was great amazing pool beautiful rooftop terrace well equipped room 
418043,The Ned, Staff on the roof asking us to leave the table ok tell us we only have it for 90 minutes and we got the hint when you brought the bill Don t ask again Air conditioning was tempermental but just for our room I think as a one off , Food was excellent Staff very good great value 
418044,The Ned, The A C didn t work in our room and we had a very uncomfortable night as it was a very hot day There were no bath towels provided discovered after I got in the shower Small annoyances like no hooks in the bathroom cheap acrylic instead of cotton robes The greeter and server at breakfast were a bit snotty and not welcoming The breakfast itself was probably the worst eggs benedict I ve ever had Compared to the breakfast at other luxury hotels in London it was a joke Much of this could be attributed to the hotel being newly opened and all the bugs not worked out , The facility is gorgeous and the renovations very beautifully done Most of the staff were very friendly We weren t happy with our stay however and were given a 20 discount on our bill 
418045,The Ned, Popcorn in mini bar costs 8 Was only allowed to take one guest into hotel s members facilities and had two visitors made me feel not welcome, Well fitted stylish hotel with great gym and spa
418046,The Ned, Chips in Ned s Club Upstairs very average Expected top quality triple cooked chips big chips not small sprat like fries Breakfast Filter Coffee in Zobler s was stewed with oily film Milk for coffee had curdled Very large cracks on glass mirrored door to mini bar Not quite what you expect 380 night room Software issues with TV system persists Freezes, Staff Well appointed rooms Interior design Ned s Club Upstairs and Downstairs Grilled Lobster was fab 
418047,The Ned, The hotel put a hold on our debit card and then charged it before releasing the hold so in effect had charged double the cost to my debit car , The hotel is beautiful we ate at three of the restaurants and the food was very good in each one 
418048,The Ned, The duvet was a bit too thin for me personally but I found a thin blanket to put over it Children aren t allowed in the indoor pool I think that it would be nice to allow them in for a couple of hours each day as is the case for the outdoor pool , Lovely big bed huge TV with free films loads of shampoos and shower gels to choose from gorgeous shower and bath We felt like royalty 
418049,The Ned, New hotel Just needs time to iron out a few teething problems , Beautiful bedroom Magnificent grand ground floor Polite and friendly staff Transported back in time with such sumptuous decor Clean toilets 
418050,The Ned, Tv didn t work Power cut on roof bar Got told off for taking a photo of St Paul s from the roof ridiculous Restaurants super expensive , Look and feel Checked us in early Location Room price was fair Friendly staff 
418051,The Ned, Nothing of note few comments to staff re our room location but would go back again, 9 restraunts friendly staff everything on site exclusive access areas bars food choice
418052,The Ned, Location is in the heart of the City so a lot of traffic and time to reach other parts London , fantastic atmosphere in the rooftop terrace super trendy with a young vibe Live music in the main dining area superb and once again so was the decor and atmosphere Room had everything and more then we needed 
418053,The Ned, Can t think of a thing , Fantastic stay Roof top pool was smaller than I expected but still lovely with a superb view Service was great throughout the hotel cannot fault it Cowshed toiletries in the room were lovely they had thought of everything I really didn t need to pack half the things I had haha
418054,The Ned, Took a while to get served for drinks in the main lobby and not a great choice of cocktails in the vault bar, Extra huge comfy bed great design in hotel lots to check out Great rooms and lots to use in bathrooms nothing missed Great bars and restaurants but very busy and fully booked so book if you intend on eating
418055,The Ned,No Negative, Awesome hotel really quirky Fitted out in Art Deco style but really tasteful Cool bar in the old bank vault downstairs and the rooftop pool is great lovely to eat breakfast up there too Huge hotel so even though it was busy it didn t seem cramped at all 
418056,The Ned, High service charge for a buffet lunch when drinks took ages to arrive after several reminders Rooftop restaurant was shut on first day of visit , Very friendly staff good food fantastic roof top restaurant
418057,The Ned, The lack of signs On numerous occasions we ended up going down staff staircases and coming out not into public places , We were upgraded twice which made my partners 30th birthday extra special A hand written card was left in the room to congratulate him as well as a birthday cake Everything had been thought of whilst staying at The Ned and the extra thought to decorative details in the room were fantastic I would definitely recommend The Ned for any special occasion 
418058,The Ned,No Negative, My whole stay was fantastic I loved the bathroom toiletries cowshed products The extras in the room were all v useful phone charger hair straighteners etc Super comfy bed The roof top area was stunning
418059,The Ned, Unfortunately shower leaked and wet the whole bathroom floor Noisy room next to a lift , Great array of cowshed toiletries and even hair straightener Plenty of high end drinks snacks in the room 
418060,The Ned, Our first room it was small hard to get to long hallways and with little lighting, The service is impeccable we didn t like our first room and it was no issue to switch and our second one was fantastic The many restaurants Out door pool and general atmosphere of the hotel is extraordinary Location is very central and close to various tube stations
418061,The Ned, It was a little posey on the rooftop pool area But that s to be expected as a private members club Also the hotel took a large deposit from my credit card which they didn t make me aware of so it was quite a surprise when I checked my bank statement after the trip The bank has informed me that they will be keeping this for 7 days before it s released back to me , The staff were very friendly and helpful Having full use of cowshed products during our stay was wonderful We stayed in a cosy bedroom and the size was surprisingly large The interiors throughout the whole hotel were gorgeous 
418062,The Ned, Couldn t open my window and the AC was broken Chambermaids didn t replaced everything I d used the night before towels bath mat coffee , Quality feel of the place 
418063,The Ned, Our room was a crash pad as we were only there overnight However it was very hot in spite of having the air conditioning turned down low It was also quite noisy , The location was ideal for what we were there for The hotel was very new so obviously clean and fresh 
418064,The Ned, No disabled access to either pools very poor considering it is a spa hotel and meant my mum could not enjoy either pools The hot water did not work in the room they kindly upgraded us to another room however we could not gain access to the room untill16 30 having arrived at the hotel at 12 00 The wrong cases were delivered to our room I tried to contact concierge but the telephone did not work and to top it all they even tried to charge us for a complimentary pressubg service so all in all not a great experience for a 250 a night 5 star hotel ,No Positive
418065,The Ned, The only issue we had was that the air conditioning was either faulty or ineffectual It was very warm in the room even though the air con was on the lowest possible temperature and you couldn t open the windows There was also a high pitched droning noise in the room so I had to use ear plugs to get to sleep Everything else was perfect really amazing but if you can t get a good night s sleep then what s the point , Beautiful room all very high quality with a Roberts radio playing jazz when we arrived Amazing selection of Cowshed products and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into everything being perfect for guests they even provide hair straighteners and an array of phone chargers The roof top terrace was amazing I have stayed in a few 5 hotels and this was absolutely one of the best I don t think there is anywhere better to stay in London 
418066,The Ned, The room service menu is the worst I ve seen in a hotel of this category This is especially bizarre given that they have a whole bunch of restaurants downstairs ,No Positive
418067,The Ned, Didn t come across anything that I didn t like, The attention to detail the service and the food were excellent The range of food and entertainment on offer across the hotel was fabulous and the rooms were well equipped with particularly comfy beds What s not to like
418068,The Ned, Wifi could be better The staff was so friendly to give out the staff wifi but for a new place I expect a bit better It s usable though , Amazing service great place 
418069,The Ned, Stepping out of the lift to an unfinished area and strong smell of recently plastered walls Cooking smells from the nearby kitchens if windows in the bedroom were open and also coming in via an air vents meant the windows had to be kept closed and air con kept on continually The phone was faulty so we had to use mobile phones to contact reception or go downstairs to reception in person the problem was reported at 3pm but was never resolved The TV did not work on arrival the problem was reported at 3pm and was not dealt with until after we had gone out for the evening The fridge had not been plugged in and it was impossible to move the fridge to locate the sockets that were somewhere behind a panel with circular hole cut in to it As the fridge had not been plugged in the milk inside had gone off The fridge problem was not resolved though we were supplied with fresh milk for an end of day hot drink and a pot of coffee for one was delivered the following morning At no point were we offered a change of room When we checked out the following morning our modest cost of bar drinks and snacks was waived by way of compensation , The bed very comfortable and the room tastefully decorated My wife was pleased to find hair straighteners provided in the room Lovely decor in the shower room which was very well stocked with toiletries The staff were all friendly and welcoming We enjoyed the live music in the main entrance bar area The rooftop terrace has amazing views the outdoor pool area is small but will no doubt be enjoyed by many once the weather warms up Sumptuous indoor pool changing area the water looked inviting and was lovely to swim in The Vault Bar and lounge was great for an end of day post theatre drink 
418070,The Ned, Couldn t open window in room Luggage lost for an hour Difficult to know who was staff and who was guest as no uniform badge etc Woken up at 7am by mistake Very difficult to drop off luggage, The building and the variety of facilities 
418071,The Ned, Roof top bar need umberellas that allow you to sit outside so everyone doesn t get crammed into the dome on rainy days staff that don t enter your room without knocking to put a missing bottle of coke in your mini bar when you ve already said it s ok sort out the dumper truck that makes a noise for 15 mins at 5am near room 262 , A really awesome place even if it s manically busy Only open3 weeks so still a few teething issues
418072,The Ned, The ground floor is a huge space advertised as eight restaurants but in fact is one huge bar area with live music It is possible to get different types of food in the various corners but many of the tables are low with easy chairs around The ambient noise is such that a private conversation is next to impossible Good for a drink if you like bustling places not good for a quiet dinner , The restaurant on the roof was really pleasant but not much advertised in the description the hotel so I didn t find it till late
418073,The Ned, was not told the sauna steam room and hammam were not ready they were still being built No discount for the inconvience swiming pool change rooms lockers had no numbers on them some had gowns and others did not drinks in the evening got 1 st round of drinks and never saw a waiter again thereafter finding a waiter is not my idea of good night , beautiful architecture beautiful room awesome music in main hall
418074,The Ned, Leaving , Staying at The Ned is a totally amazing experience You have 9 restaurants to choose from we tried 3 and all brilliant The buzz on a Saturday evening is awesome You really could stay a week without leaving in fact a year 
418075,The Ned, Nothing , I ve been staying in London for a number of years and when I heard about the Neds opening via MrPorter com I couldn t help but give it a chance DEFINITELY the best hotel I ve ever stayed in The food the staff the atmosphere the guests everything about it was superb 
418076,The Ned, Feels like the membership is highly over prescribed Any time I went into the Vault Bar or the Rooftop I found it extremely difficult to get served due to the sheer number of people in them A few times I gave up and went for a drink elsewhere , Hotel is gorgeous They have considered absolutely every possible aspect of a luxury hotel And the service is amongst the best Ive ever received Rooftop pool will be the envy of every London hotel come summer 
418077,The Ned, The Hotel was not at four star rating yet All wellness is not ready yet Children not allowed during normal day and early evening time in the swimming pool The age of child is stated to be younger than 18 years Defintely not in line with normal standards Kitchen is not working properly yet breakfast never arrived eggs not boiled coffee to cold no gas at a certain stage Security is not in place and functioning properly open doors to the road backdoors escalator open for everybody a lot off day guests walking through hotel bars and restaurants emergency doors are blocked no strong security policy at front door, The Ned is a brand new Hotel nearby Bank station It will defintely become a top hotel however at the moment the Hotel is open but a lot of the functions are not in place or do not function Location and room are super and well decorated in a retro style hospitality is very good however the staff is hampering with a lot start up problems When the hotel is functioning well after a while it will become a very pleasant and cool place to stay Anxious to know when this moment appears 
418078,The Ned, The room was very quiet with the window over the central atrium Until they started emptying a weeks worth of bottles from 7 restaurants and god knows how many bars into the recycling That started at 6am and lasted despite a phone complaint to reception until 6 40am on a Saturday It s the only thing I can fault but it did spoil my stay somewhat Having got in a 2am I was looking forward to a lay in I also had some trouble with the electronic room key These are minor points and I m sure they will be sorted out Overall a very positive experience , This is a fantastic location in the city of London The We hotel is busy and buzzy with numerous bars and restaurants to choose from The roof top bar is for members only but hotel guests can take one visitor up there depending on how busy they are Views over London are fabulous Roof top is not surprisingly pretty busy Plenty of staff to help out Welcoming smiling and efficient The grade one listed foyer is a treat with live music most nights 
418079,The Ned, The fish restaurant will need to resolve the smell of smoked haddock which wafted through the bar area We settled down for a night cap at 11 30pm to be advised that all the bars were closing this came a surprise so our group of 12 went to another hotel We thought that there was a 24 hour bar Teathing problems in expect , Great team of helpful people who seemed to be enjoying their work at The Ned Our stay was on a Monday one week after their launch and they made us feel special 
418080,The Ned,No Negative, One of the best hotels that I have stayed at recently tastefully decorated rooms a lovely choice of restaurants and a fantastic rooftop pool and restaurant The attention to detail in this hotel is truly impressive 
418081,The Ned,No Negative, Every little detail was carefully planned The themed decor was brilliant the staff very friendly and approachable the food was delicious the rooftop restaurant was unmissable the vault bar was like something from a movie the cowshed products in the rooms were a nice touch All other hotels will now pale in comparison to the glorious Ned 
418082,The Ned, slow checkout unable to get receipt upon leaving as printer was broken then a promised e mail with my receipt but I had to call twice for it , rooms were lovely and bed comfortable Such high standard toiletries and it was above and beyond my expectation excellent service in the coffee bar area during a meeting in the afternoon
