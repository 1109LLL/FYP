486699,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, The location of this hotel is perfect very near to all the sightseeing activities designer shops and restaurants all within walking distance from the hotel Staff friendly and helpful and followed through on any enquiries or requests we made
486700,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Wifi was nearly unusable as there is no password on it so everyone at the bar and nearby jumps on it slowing it to a crawl 14 pictures took hours to upload to the cloud The door key has to be in the slot for the lights to work and everytime you remove the card the AC gets reset to 23 C The fridge is pretty full so putting medication in can be challenging , It was really close to the Duomo Literally just around the corner For those that like to shop there is a huge shopping center right outside the hotel too Lots of restaurants nearby Some are really good The Duomo museum is just across the square too For those that like the bar scene there is a bar on the bottom floor that seemed popular The place is modern I would call it bizarre There is no door knob on the outside of the door the bathroom door disappears into the wall the bed can roll across the floor the shower has no door there is no counter at the bathroom sink the sink is tiny making water go all over There is no place to hang a towel near the sink or near the shower You can hang 2 towels on the bathroom door if you want to drip across the bathroom to get to it You can hang a towel over the bidet There are USB ports at the head of the bed to charge with delivering 1 amp for larger devices There is a huge piece of art sitting on the floor at the end of the bed just waiting for your toe to stub Seating is a small cube or a medium cube There are additional outlets around the room The lighting is odd too lights around the edge under the shelf reading lights hallway and bathroom with switches in various places Finding them all is a challenge 
486701,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The rooms are not particularly large, Brilliantly located Hotel with interesting different decor Manuel the front of house Manager was charming very helpful Will definitely stay again
486702,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I can t think of anything that I dislike about this hotel , Location is super very close to Duomo and all the shops The staff is also very helpfull and friendly Help up with our lost baggage by calling the airlines many times 
486703,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The front desk service was terrible Even though checkin was at 2 they made us wait until 4 the only front desk staff who was good was the lady who was checking us out she seemed to be someone from the old straff staff and Atleast new how to take care of her customers The new management is terrible and should be replaced as this hotel has so much potential and it s really sad that the people are ruining the experience , Good breakfast excellent location 
486704,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Bathrooms are all black so a bit dismal , Loved the design elements of the decor the quality breakfast amazing staff and superb location We would definitely stay here whenever we are in Milan again 
486705,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Be sure that a design hotel is the experience you are really looking for the all black bathroom was disconcerting , Absolutely central in Milan couldn t have been better 
486706,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Tricky window blinds to close at night And impractical but pretty wash basin design with no waist height space to place personal items in the bathroom , Excellent location right next to the Duomo It is close to everything for tourists Very friendly staff always helpful Small buffet breakfast but very good quality Interior design is very stylish 
486707,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Our bathroom smelt bad something wrong with the pipes it was just our room my friend s room next door didn t have the same issue the manager seemed aware of the problem already but said as the hotel was fully booked there was nothing they could do and sent us a bottle of wine as consolation and that they would send up the housekeeper to spray perfume but she never showed up The room was over 640 Euros a night because of design week so kind of expected a bit better standard especially as we were staying 5 nights Also thought it was bad form that the staff initially told us on Sat night that they were too busy in the bar to bring us room service , Location
486708,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , WiFi was very very slow and sometime disconnects Noisy rooms with street view due to bar crowd , Location is super design and style is chic Staff are very friendly and helpful 
486709,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I asked for a quiet room but received room 101 which is next to the gym As soon as the people started to use the treadmill which was already the case at 07 30h sleeping was over as you can hear it very well Disappointing ,No Positive
486710,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , At 4 30 am garbage truck made incredible noise In the morning some truck are coming and While carrying supplements into the hotel they are making unbearable noises,No Positive
486711,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The modern lighting was hard to navigate, The location is the best Being in the heart of the shopping and a stones throw from the Duomo Great restaurants close by train station and cab rank About a 25 minute walk to see the last supper Straf bar is a great place just to sit and watch the locals and tourists walk by with an aperol spritzer in your hand Staff were delightful and extremely helpful 
486712,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I like a warm cosy hotel greeting it was a bit cold in reception but this is a minamalist hotel with stone walls etc so not sure how they could achieve this, Amazing location and staff
486713,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The only issue is that the towels are very fuzzy and everything in the room seems dusty, Very helpful and nice staff Location is unbeatable especially for shopping trips style of the hotel
486714,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The decor was all black felt a bit drab and weary and didnt feel luxurious but it became secondary when considering the advantages and so I would come back here , Location location location The staff were so obliging and friendly Coffee and breakfast very nice 
486715,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Fitness center was a little cramped but it was still good to have one , Location was superb Step outside and straight into the Galleria and the Duomo Hotel had a cool design edge Room was modern Massage chair was necessary Staff were extra friendly Breakfast was included and scrumptious 
486716,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Breakfast this was disappointing they have juices made from concentrate and if you want to have a fresh juice you have to pay extra same thing for the warm choices you had only scrambled eggs which were not edible really poor quality and if you wanted omelette or poached eggs you had to pay extra This is not good and probably the reason why I will not go back it is like to say i give you cheap things unless you pay extra but in order to sell the room in an easier way I advertise room with breakfast included A suggestion sell the room for 10 euros more but don t do this trick because it looks bad and even other clients around me complained about it , the hotel is in a very good location nice and comfortable bed room very nicely decorated and helpful staff
486717,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , the bar closes very early around 11 30pm and you are oblige to go to your room the climatisation system in my room didn t work the shower hasn t the classic 2 showers so you are wet entirely not many plugs and not close to the bed it is part of SPG but you can t earn points if reserving via booking com, THE location is amazing in the center of Milano by walk away from the different shopping places
486718,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Wifi wasn t working most of the time some lights were broken in the room and there was no real follow up , excellent location friendly staff and nice bar
486719,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , not extremely clean all this modern industrial decoration is anyway dark so some meticulous cleaning is necessary the bathroom amenities were poor as there was no soap and no hair conditioner shampoo and body cream came in big package to avoid waste front rooms looking the street are very noisy breakfast room is very small so during rush hour in the morning you end up waiting in the line , great location which was the best of it comfortable beds 
486720,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The decor is very modern No place to put your makeup etc in bathroom No place to hang bathroom towel No seat with a back anyplace practically in entire hotel Beds a bit on the hard side All a tradeoff for great location, Location could not be beat Steps from the duomo and across the street from La Resciente the department store with great food and views on the 4th floor Staff was friendly and helpful Breakfast was good and many selections 
486721,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Very noisy The bar was right below our room Also the bathroom was not convenient to place your toiletries counter was too low , Very close to shopping and the and landmarks like the church the castle walking distance to view the Last Supper 
486722,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Worst experience in my life The longest check in and check out The hotel bar is very noisy specially if you are in first floor i can guaranty that you hear a full conversation of the people in the bar there is no sound proof I book my room one month before my trip and they block the amount in my credit card and forget to deduct the money so we had a trouble when we check out There s no iron in the room and they force u to send ur clothe to the hotel laundry The staff are not an english specker so it was very difficult to find someone understand what you need and they re not even nice, Just the location
486723,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Pre booked car to airport as i was traveling alone Driver was fine and great car but he was texting and taking phone calls for the whole journey so I didn t feel very safe at all times This needs to be addressed to stop any accidents occurring , very friendly and helpful staff clean rooms and great location of hotel for us to shopping areas
486724,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , My room was located on the first floor right above the hotel s bar where they played loud music all night which made it impossible to sleep with all that noise, The location was excellent
486725,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Reception desk could do with being bigger There was only 2 people ahead of me when I was checking in but took at least 15 minutes before I was seen I wish at check in they explained how to get in to your room as upon first arriving as the hallways are quite dark and there is no door handle it took until the cleaner came and helped me that I actually got in The bed was on wheels and as the floor was not carpet the bed moved every time you got in to it or just generally moved in it Other than that it was comfortable All in all a lovely stay and would definitely return , I have never stayed in a hotel that is as perfectly located as the Hotel Straf It is a 60 second walk away from the Duomo and main shopping district so easy to pop back to the hotel to put your bags down or charge your phone It also is positioned down a quiet side road so the entrance does not have any cars or a lot of tourists outside I think the room was a perfect size and not too small at all as some of these reviews say I loved the bathroom area and look of the room Is really dark and I m normally someone who prefers everything to be light but I feel the darkness really aided my sleep and I felt very well rested when leaving Milan Staff were really friendly and helpful When I had an issue gaining access into my room cleaner on that floor at the time helped Waiter in breakfast room was very pleasant and accommodating as were the waiters in the bar I had forgotten a European adaptor toothbrush and umbrella all of which they let me borrow free of charge When I checked in females on the desk could have been better and a bit speedier but male on desk at check out was excellent This is when I asked where I could purchase an umbrella as it was torrential rain outside and he gave me one Really great customer service Would return and recommend to colleagues 
486726,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I didn t like the all black bathroom I also found there was not enough places to put make up and toiletries is the bathroom and the shower was difficult to operate , The staff were extremely friendlly and helpful The hotel was small and easy to move around
486727,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Check out just a little slow, Very modern sleek decor Manager was excellent and provided great restaurant and Places to shop Bar in hotel is perfect with an incredible happy hour spread
486728,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , That there was no kettle to make a tea when needed We weren t inclined to call for room service for just that , Massage chair Sliding blinds Body wash and moisturisier Environmental care Gluten free options at breakfast Coffee at breakfast Ambience throughout with design detail was sought after expected and what as designers we expected This was the main reason as well as the location that we really wanted to stay here
486729,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Breakfast was a little cramped and choice of food limited we thought the room we had was over priced , Check in and check out staff were really great very warm and friendly The hotels location is excellent 
486730,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, We arrived early were given access to our room plus we had a late departure were able to stay longer in our room Very friendly helpful staff A comfortable bed stylish facilities 
486731,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent the staff was very helpful and nice Next time I m in Milan I will stay in this hotel no doubt Very recommended 
486732,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, Location location location The bar is great rooms are big bathroom is large a beautiful hotel The bar is excellent too I have been to Milan 11 times and 4 of these times have been at the Straff 
486733,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Layout of room was slightly confusing with too many light switches a minor problem though, Location was superb ideal for walking around and viewing the sights Quick check in and friendly staff 
486734,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Nothing Everything was more than we could have wished for , It s a funky hotel in the best location Stone throw from Duomo There is really no better place to stay as the Straf is in the centre of all attractions and shopping heaven 
486735,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , internet was difficult to connect to, The front office manager attitude the amazing room with balcony over the street executive room the overall hotel design and the location
486736,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I can t stay in hotel without WIFI the wifi was not working and i spent half of my time in the lobby using the PC of the hotel on a not comfy chair and then wait for my friends to finish so we can go out for a simple reaps that the wifi was not working and when we complain the staff at the reception answered its free WIFI very disappointing, Location is great
486737,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Hard to get a sleep because of loud music and noisy guests from the bar operated by hotel Don t stay on 1st to 3rd floor Be careful not to pay an exorbitant price when check out Hostess doesn t care the price of booking com Please keep the booking evidence , Good location for experience of central Milano Modern and stylish metal interior of guestroom Somebody wouldn t like the design but attractive for me Nice breakfast with fresh bakery 
486738,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Loft style decor not to our taste Bathroom was really strange all black with hidden light switches had to call reception to figure out how to turn off the sink lights Breakfast had no hot items and cappuccino wasn t as hot as normal Very loud music from bar request a rear room if you are noise sensitive , Great location spacious room free apples at reception nice view of church across the street 
486739,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Strange staff I had an impression that they don t know what they do We ordered a transfer they didn t arrange it and they even didn t tell us that it is not arranged They rather don t care about clients ,No Positive
486740,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Design goes way beyond practicality please add a few hooks on the bathroom walls make an easy instruction for how to manage lights in the room and point to where to find the little box where extra toiletpaper is stored hopefully , Loved loved loved the location Was fascinated by the contemporary yet not so userfriendly interiors and decorations but we got quite a few good laughs out of it Enjoyed the breakfast and the dangerously tasty afterwork buffet very much and the Aperol spritz s too indeed Recommend it 
486741,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The price for the Salone week was over 2000 for 4 nights The breakfast was TERRIBLE and the room decor dated Also there are no irons available in the hotel unless you pay 8 per item for ironing Bit of a con , Great location and great bar
486742,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Bad lighting very dark Dusty Room sometimes didn t get cleaned until 2 pm Small breakfast area Very noisy bar that kept us awake The rooms were very hot, The location was very good Few of the staff were friendly
486743,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , ONE lift for the entire hotel takes ages to go anywhere Staff does NOT read notes and requirements when booking made ONE guy not exactly intelligent dealing with the reception long line No water in rooms ,No Positive
486744,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , To rank this as a 4 star hotel is very misleading The breakfast provided was simple and cold Warm food cost extra Room service was irregular and not thorough The toiletries included two huge bottles of cheap soap and hand loation under the pretense that they want to save plastic The wifi never worked Could pass for a 3 start hotel sort of , Perfect location
486745,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Can hear everyone from the corridor Too modern in some places not the most comfortable for living not cosy Breakfast was slow almost no food left around 9 and waiters was not attentive not enough space to sit , Central stylish
486746,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Too fancy decor very dark and gloomy Concrete gold and black black commode etc Great if you like that style but hard to see things if you need reading glasses Very hard to figure out the lighting in the room fancy but too complicated No windows in breakfast area very closed in felt crowded, Unbelievable Extremely good location for shopping and sightseeing Very comfortable beds Helpful and friendly staff in the reception Quiet neighborhood no noise at night with room to the back we slept well and long
486747,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Unfriendly lobby staff Room view was the escape stairs at the back at the same price as the rooms looking on the street duomo, Location Bathroom Bar Breakfast
486748,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , This hotel deserves a good breakfast kitchen Breakfast was so poor not a single hot dish to eat , Great location I think the best great design very comfortable Should stay there
486749,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , I ask the reception for a massage person and they sente someone who did pressure massage I wanted a relaxing massage w oil Furthermore no massage table it was proposed to be done on the floor The hotel should research more the massage person they have in the list And the rate was high I cancelled the massage after 10 mins of the session No excuse given by reception , Location breakfast room although the part where you have the sink is not too practical as there was an unusual place to put the toiletrie bag
486750,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Bathroom amenities shampoo hand wash etc are all in one and not very nice I suggest you bring your own shampoo Bathroom has a weird echo nice initially but gets tiring after the first time bathroom sounds get amplified if you get what i mean Weird impolite welcome paper in the room when you arrive saying that most things in the room are for sale and mentioning that if something is missing when you leave you will be charged for it better check everything is there when you arrive Airco makes the air extra extra dry dry throats when you wake up , Outstanding location can t stress this enough 
486751,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, I liked that the staff were so helpful contacting me by email before we arrived and helpful advice on restaurants etc Central place to stay with so much to do 
486752,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The d cor took a little getting used It was very unique having concrete floors and barely any furniture After a couple of nights it was fine , The bed was amazing I usually find that it takes a night or two to settle into a bed but the I had a great sleep from the first night 
486753,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , This was our second stay Unfortunately the room was just too hot It was the middle of winter and even with the windows open and air conditioning on we could not get much relief Opening windows meant street noise all night , The hotel is in a fantastic position right in the centre of Milan Nothing can fault it s access to everything The staff are fabulous and helped us out after the loss of valuables on a train A staff member helped track down a handbag after the train company and local police told us it was a waste of time It was magnificent 
486754,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , No cleaning of room before in the evening Poor breakfast Offer complimentary drinks in bar you have to pay for Not willing to sell their town by informing what to do , Location 
486755,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The bed and pillows were so hard and extremely uncomfortable It s a relief we were only there for 2 nights The bathroom too not convenient either in terms of where to put your toiletries and the shower was pretty poor too , Location is excellent and the staff are pretty friendly and helpful
486756,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , It was noisy especially having a room above the bar and being woken up early every morning by garbage collection trucks The continental breakfast was average and measly for the included breakfast deal the added breakfast prices were exorbitant 17 euro for a boiled egg really and that didn t include toast Surely some fresh fruit and yogurt could be part of the continental breakfast Each time I ordered room service the coffee was cold even though I asked for it to be extra hot The room service meals and menu left alot to be desired very unexpected in Italy I could not believe they would have frozen lasagne on the menu The wifi connection was very slow and kept dropping out so it was extremely difficult to do any work I was charged 20 euro to iron a couple of garments as I was told that it was too dangerous to supply an iron to the room when the website stated that it had an iron and ironing board available The room was very dark being all black and for a so called eco hotel I was surprised at the number of lights and light switches that were in each room and being so dark the lights needed to be left on during the day The double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together one being a different height to the other very annoying in the middle of the night when you roll over One side of the bed was very comfortable though The hairdryer in the bathroom was useless I had to actually book into a salon to have my hair washed and dried There was no shampoo or conditioner either and the products supplied were very drying on the skin All in all I was very much looking forward to my stay and was bitterly disappointed , the size of the room was great and the location was quite good in that it was central to where i needed to go
486757,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Bathroom design was great but the sewage smelled bad and the shower head was not in a good condition sending water everywhere Most uncomfortable shower ever , Best location in Milan Excellent design both of common areas and rooms Buzzy bar downstairs during aperitivo time Very good breakfast Friendly and helpful staff
486758,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , An ocasional smile would have been nice from the staff The room was too small and over decorated and looked like a prieson room from one of the movies The bathroom looked like a chicken box too small and had only a shampo and a cream bottle Very limited breakfast chooses pastries only One of the staff at the reception tried to rep us off by offering a privet transport to Ferrari museum by over charging us 500 euros and 50 euros for every hour did not even bother giving us other choices when I said its too expensive Hotel the gray in the opposite side by far is the best the reception staff looked down when I told her that we are checking in at hotel the gray, Location
486759,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , shower that you can t move by yourself and cold room on a first evening third bed was next to the window and it was impossible to sleep there so we had to move the bed by ourselves wi fi connection was poor in the room , position enterior art design
486760,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The way my credit card was debited during my stay 2 times without any notification Before checking out again my credit card was debited for the 3 rd Time and even after I left the hotel my credit card was debited on the second day when I reach Lebanon most probably because they forgot to check the mini bar so honestly as an advise pay cash Don t take the breakfast in the hotel go outside it is way more enjoyable extremely poor and stingy breakfast we reserved a suite the water from the shower was brown literally brown we call the reception they said no there is no problem Nobody cared to check we left without shower in the evening just a small word from the reception you were right we fixed it Honestly will never ever visit this property again , Nothing 
486761,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , If such a thing exists I would say its a tad too modern with all walls in the room being either concrete or a mirror , Location location location A perfect location when staying in Milan The hotel was clean and incredibly modern The staff was nice and quite helpful directing and recommendations 
486762,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, Excellent location just 2 minutes walk to great Milano Duomo cathedral And next to the hotel is a good shopping mall Close to all major shopping streets and brand shops Staff is friendly and able to help 
486763,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , the design is a positive but also negative thing they compromised comfort for look the rooms have concrete floors and walls making the environment around cold the bathroom is also quite uncomfortable , Design and location perfect nice breakfast
486764,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Dark dull rooms Uncomfortable bed matress Poor breakfast Only one elevator No cofee making facilities No complementary water bottle SLOW housekeeper, Location
486765,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Room was really tired looking The black bath and sink had large water drip strains above the plug and looked dirty Fittings need refurbishing looks like it was great 8 years ago but nothing has been touched since Disappointing as the Straf is a go to destination , Location is fantastic Public areas are trendy and up to date
486766,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Difficult to locate light switches no hooks or railings in the bathroom to hang wet towels Small details but unpractical , Very stylish modern hotel Contemporary design detail was very cool Central location was perfect for the weekend Staff were friendly helpful in ordering taxi s which arrived within minutes Well organised 
486767,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The wifi in the room was too slow for 2015 Management needs to upgrade the net speed , We like the location of the property Walking distance from duomo and the metro 
486768,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, Fantastic location Great breakfast Very comfortable bed Whole hotel very well presented Liked that all bedrooms different and unique Staff extremely helpful and courteous 
486769,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , 2 rooms on 2nd floor was pretty small with bed at the centre which takes up space Breakfast ham was limited and have to wait for refill , Location and the room 107 is very good and spacious 
486770,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , Form over function Very design y but shower floods onto bathroom floor Also breakfast is served on a communal table with plush stools not exactly what you expect in an expensive hotel such as this , Location Just steps from the Duomo Scala opera house Vittorio Emanuele and Rinascente stores 
486771,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , The rooms are super chic and modern but the facilities aren t the most practical Just figuring out how to turn off the myriad of lights was an ordeal , Location is ideal the staff are helpful and friendly and the bar downstairs is cool 
486772,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , No bad experience to report , Everyone was nice We could stay for breakfast It was too early when we left They made coffee and breakfast crackers with jelly available Way to go the extra mile They even called and rescheduled one of our tours since we needed to change the time on our original booking Oh the massage chair in the room was great after a long day 
486773,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, Great location to access central Milan This hotel is a very modern style The staff were very helpful in advising places to see The rooms very clean 
486774,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels , When u first reached I was given a dark color room which I didn t like After complaining they have upgraded me to a better room , The location was great and the style of the hotel

486777,STRAF a Member of Design Hotels ,No Negative, The proximity of il Duomo Vittorio Emanuele shopping La Scala la Rinascente the Straf Bar and it s atmosphere and aperitivo and the immediate access to the Metro makes this location 1 The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was great
