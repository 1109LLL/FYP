335352,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Location was central but getting to the hotel from public transport was not easy to navigate, Danielle at reception was fantastic very helpful and very willing to help us
335353,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very nice hotel Quality accommodation with amazingly comfortable king size bed clean room friendly atmosphere welcoming staff not far from the center by train Definitely will come back again 
335354,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Lights are not possible to make as wished but only how it was fixed there what was too much for me , This is a real hotel with real hotel rooms What means good size of room space for bag to move in the room to put your things with mini bar good wifi char table night curtains bathroom with a minimum of space for being comfortable inside Really I can only recommend this place Plus they let me check in 3h before check in time 
335355,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Room very small View from room wasn t nice , Proximity to underground transportation and supermarkets Very clean and nice shower Clothes line in bathroom to dry towels etc 
335356,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The district street and walk from the metro to the hotel are nothing too fancy , The large room renovated bathroom and the free coffee to go and fruits for take away available in the reception in the morning when you don t have time for breakfast 
335357,Rainers Hotel Vienna, 90 for a night considering location was steep but couldn t fault anything , Clean hotel very nice room service actually Wasn t expected the quality of Risotto I had No iron in room but called reception who gladly brought it to the room within minutes Rooms were lovely and spacious Tall ceilings and although the view was of the car park its minor as I could still see a bit more from the floor I was on 
335358,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The location though it appears very near the train station but with the big luggage it was quite a task to figure out how to get from the station to the hotel bed was too soft and small for the twin room lift was a bit too small for a big hotel , Staff was quite friendly and helpful clean room They offered discount if you dine at the restaurant should you opt to skip housekeeping for one day for our 2 nights stay 
335359,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The location could be better there are very many Arabs around But it is just within 4 stops of the public transport from the very centre of the city , The room is wonderful clean light with a safe a fridge BUT the best facility is the bathroom of course The satff is very helpful and positive 
335360,Rainers Hotel Vienna, It wasn t in a nice neighborhood a bit far from citycenter but there was very good tram connection to the City , Everyrhing was really good No complaints 
335361,Rainers Hotel Vienna, the price of Parking was very high 21 Euro per night , the bottle of white wine just after arriving the room was very clean and has very nice facilities 
335362,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Poorly maintained hotel overheated small rooms grubby dirty walls Staff changed our room three times none to our satisfaction We would never stay here again or recommend it to anyone ,No Positive
335363,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The area was not vibrant Level of restaurants around the hotel was not up to my family standards Though I do understand this very well as I chose the location myself , The shower The comfy bed 
335364,Rainers Hotel Vienna, We didn t like that we have to pay about breakfast and that the cost was approachable for a simple meal 14 50 per person No Way We traveled there for the marathon so as we have to eat before it we went to the supermarket and buy few things Also the area around has nothing to do , When we arrive we found at room a sparkling wine complimentary of the hotel We did not drank it but it was a really nice move I liked the bed it was soooo comfy and also the cleanliness at the room at the hotel and at the whole city Also a big thank you at the men that they work in the reception they gave us a lot of informations on how to use public transports which it was only to 2min away by walking 
335365,Rainers Hotel Vienna, All was as good as expected, Our room was very bright and the beds were super comfy All was clean and neat when we moved in and in overall it felt very nice The staff was friendly and helpful Also they brought us a free bottle of sparkling wine in a bucket with ice as a thank you for choosing Rainers hotel which was a really pleasent surprise To sum up I would recommend it to everyone as it feels very cosy and is a great value for the money we paid 
335366,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The room s size was absolutely fine however the bed was a bit harsh and uncomfortable The ventilation system was not working as expected and heating was always switched on even when the switch was set to OFF , The staff members were super helpful and friendly The breakfast buffet had a lot of varieties The hotel lies within a very dynamic neighborhood Restaurants shops cafe s and supermarkets are just within a minute walking distance from the hotel The hotel is about 2 mins away from an underground station making commuting within the city using public transport very suitable 
335367,Rainers Hotel Vienna, When we arrived at the hotel the staff was very unfriendly but we thought perhaps they were very busy then I have a wife of Indian background while I am white myself After my wife spoke to the receptionist the lady pretended not to have known about our reservation and not a smidgen of smile or welcoming attitude Only when I came to the desk to ask what was he hold up suddenly everything as ok The amount of security checks proving who we are and documents we had to produce to be given the key was beyond insane We didn t get this much questions at the border control on our way back In the morning instead of greetings like when you see your guest and say good morning there was this ever so present silent treatment and disapproving stares I actually came up to the reception desk to say if everything was ok and then joked with the receptionist that he should smile more he didn t find it funny though We ve had a dog with us and we were told that we d have to pay 35 euros extra per night for the dog normally it is 5 10 euros in any German hotel for comparison The room was ok but the bathroom wasn t safe to use as the barrier from the shower to the rest of the bathroom was leaking and looked like a little swimming pool after I took a shower very dangerous if you re not standing firm on your feet Overall the sleep and room itself wasn t bad at all but the attitude of the staff was beyond appalling with clear not even subtle racist attitude towards my wife We will never ever return there and I would like to strongly recommend to all non white guests save yourself the bother and find somewhere else this place will not welcome you sadly ,No Positive
335368,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Parking was really expensive 21EUR day You can find cheaper parking even in the center of Vienna Expensive breakfast Though for the same money you can have much better breakfast in numerous cafes in the city center That s what we were doing Otherwise across the road you have a Turkish restaurant , We did get real good price from Booking com The room was big clean and tidy As per my request I ve got double bed instead of twin Bed was big and comfortable WiFi was free and very fast Very close to hotel you can find several options of public transport So getting to city center and back is so easy it take just few stops of tram Day tickets for public transport can be purchased at reception which is really convenient 
335369,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, very quiet hotel good noise isolation neighbors didn t bother stayed for 3 nights complimentary bottle of wine was delivered at my room upon check in it was a pleasant surprise considering the wine was not bad good room service clean room clean bathroom clean bed clothes complimentary tea and coffee with a kettle the price was a little higher than usual but anyway it was almost the cheapest choice in Wien by that dates so it s rather pro than con 
335370,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Nice and cozy rooms Bathroom was also very well designed Was very surprised with free welcome drink that waited for us inside our room when we arrived Staff was very friendly 
335371,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Nothing negative at all, Good location 2 seconds from bus stop that will take you to the metro metro connects all over Vienna Get a travel card though Room was large airy and very clean Never slept on such comfy beds in my life Staff were lovely we checked in early and they looked after our luggage on our last day Could not fault in the slightest 
335372,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I wish it was closer to the city centre, Very helpful even gave me a packed lunch as they knew I had to leave before breakfast in the morning It was super close to Erste Campus where i needed to be for work 
335373,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The hotel has a view on the cemetery and the neighbourhood is very unlikable Yet it s easy to get to the centre via public transportation , It s a nice hotel for the value 
335374,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Car parking handling can be better 1 Free for guests the parking is really empty 2 Handling re entering the parking can be managed easier with the staff e g how to take the care and come back with the same ticket , Nice design clean sufficient room space
335375,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The room service people should check before entering the room wothout permission Should b provided with adequate training , The room was very comfy specially the bed and the linens were perfectly set
335376,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The carpet was old and smelly The lights in the toilet extra powerfull and no possibility to modulate the intensity only one switch on off If i stay more than 10 min in toilette i feel very inconfotable No romantic atmosfere was possible , Generali the Hotel was good The staff very gentle 
335377,Rainers Hotel Vienna, After cleaning lady random hotel stuff keep entering our room multiple times that day while we were trying to sleep , Very clean and helpfull polite staff
335378,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Inability to control temperature as it was a bit over heated, Great value location a bit further out although the tram and train only 5 mins away and bus stops outside Staff were extremely helpful
335379,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The cleaners where knocking the door early in the morning eight a clock even we were still sleeping , It s good value for the money you pay The room is big and comfortable The train station is five minutes walk and you can easily visit all the places in centre of Vienna or outside 
335380,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Bedroom was very hot even though it was freezing outside and the heater was off Much traffic noise when windows open Beds slightly worn but not too bad , Good location near public transport Nice room with updated bathroom Friendly staff 
335381,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I would probably consider staying closer to the city if I had had my time again although it is close to public transport Sports bar is expensive with a very average range of alcohol Housekeeping walked in on me getting dressed one morning simply knocking at the door prior to entering would have avoided this altogether , The room was wonderfully clean and spacious Beds were comfortable and the location was very quiet Staff were friendly and attentive 
335382,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Hotel s staff was very friendly polite and helpfull Even if the hotel is not located in the city centre it is pretty convenient to reach main attractions using public transport 
335383,Rainers Hotel Vienna, everything was very good from my perspective the mattress was a little bit to soft but it was ok , Staff very polite very cheap and near train and transportation free parking in all area no need for park at the hotel 30 min walk far from the ring 
335384,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The check in time is at 3pm which is very late for shorter stays , I only stayed for one night but it was very comfortable The room and bathroom were clean and modern The room is not huge but a good size for 2 people max Also if you are using public transportation there is a train station near by and a bus stop across the street which was very convenient 
335385,Rainers Hotel Vienna, There isn t much around the hotel so you will need to drive cab or public transport about Luckily the public transport in Vienna is great and only a short walk from the hotel , The hotel was lovely very helpful staff and the rooms great with very comfy beds 
335386,Rainers Hotel Vienna, A bit far from the city centre and a view from our room included the old Evangelist cemetery which was a bit unexpected so keep in mind , The room has everything you need it is spacious clean and comfortable You can get to the bus and railway station in 20 min by foot
335387,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Walking around the area at night trying to find somewhere suitable to eat was a challenge We weren t sure if women were welcome in some establishments as all the patrons were men Lots of smoke in the restaurants which was off putting We preferred to stay in the city for our meals , the staff were very helpful Location was close to the train so we could get into the city easily Rooms were very clean Breakfast buffet had an excellent range of choices 
335388,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Receptionist were correct but not to friendly There was no room for smokers as written on the website of hotel , Very beatiful and stylish design room clean and quiet with modern lighting comfortable Bath extraordinary spotless Coded key Daily cleaning 
335389,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Nothing in particular, Very Clean Very friendly staff Very Quiet Very close to tram and train station so you can reach the city center in 10 minutes 
335390,Rainers Hotel Vienna, nothing to say about it Can t think of anything , Overall our stay was very pleasant The room itself was spacious clean and comfortable Breakfast was quite nice as well We even had a prosecco for it 
335391,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The location wasn t ideal for my needs but I knew that when booking and is no reflection on the quality of the hotel , The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful and made my stay very easy 
335392,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Poor location very run down part of city overlooking a cemetery Bed extremely soft Staff a little curt although everyone in Vienna seems like that , Room was clean and appeared very recently updated
335393,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Two times cleaning staff tried to enter our room while we were in the room and didn t check out yet Nothing complimentary even no water in the room ,No Positive
335394,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The way from the tram to the hotel is not the nicest In had see drynk jonkey people No one bother me but made me feel uncomfortable The carpet on the room was a bit smelly , The room was nice The hotel is close to the trainnstatuom and tram stop Staf ok 
335395,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Drinking glasses in the room were not entirely clean but the glasses in the bathroom were spotless , Very Comfortable room looked newly renovated Excellent staff members and very good public transport links to the city 
335396,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The manager at the sports bar was a bit irritable the night we were there , Reception staff very friendly and nice helped us out a lot with advice re public transport etc A very positive experience and would definitely go back recommend to others 
335397,Rainers Hotel Vienna, It was a bit outside of the city maybe a shuttle service connecting the city center to the hotel would have been great , The comforts of a 4 stars hotel and friendly staff ready to help us out
335398,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Parking is paid we had breakfast shortly before closing hours and some of the trays and cans were not being refilled , Friendly staff good breakfast clean
335399,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The five ten minute walk from the tram station to the hotel was through a road quiet and a bit isolated it isn t ver far ftom the centre though, The breakfast was fantastic 
335400,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Nothing It was perfect for my needs , The hotel was clean and well appointed Everything I needed was available and the staff were knowledgeable helpful and friendly 
335401,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The staff were beyond awful My sister left her passport in a taxi and they pretty much said we couldn t do anything about it They reluctantly booked us a taxi back to the station where we found the passport through another driver They didn t even say we re glad you found it Such a bad experience , The calamari in the restaurant was delicious
335402,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Location seems to be not so safe as other parts of city, Nice and comfort hotel Very friendly staff 24h reception with possibility to leave luggage after check out
335403,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The items in room drinks such as water and wine and beer some of them was not any price of them and they have not put any notes about cost if the guest use this drinks Restaurant was extremely busy was no place during dinner time to seat , Aa excellent hotel very comfortable very close to train station Very friendly staff good value of money and really great facility 
335404,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Parking expensive we didn t use it But nearby is perfect to leave the car Any problem to park next to the hotel for free , Even it was not in main town its good located Really near train station public citybikes are near as well Bed comfortable 
335405,Rainers Hotel Vienna, On hindsight we would have paid a bit more to stay somewhere more central Elaboration Parking at this hotel was 20 per night Not exactly cheap But because the hotel was not that near to city center and we didn t want to take public transport we drove out Parking in city centre was not cheap either and we paid another 25 for parking It was time consuming to find an empty parking lot in the city too So we say unless you re ready to take public transport choose somewhere more central and leave your car at the hotel , The hotel is clean new and modern just how we like it 
335406,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The only downside is the location which is far away from downtown and major sites but if you are an avid walker like I am it is definitely manageable , Clean rooms excellent breakfast helpful staff 
335407,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I don t know what s wrong with the front office only point the 2 men whom work in the morning such bad face for me without any smile which made me feel so bad to this hotel in the beginning , All things in the room are good 
335408,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The staff there was so meant there was a man that makes fun of us except one kind guy and the room conditioner was so hot and the toilets smell so bad and cleanrs never cleaned well and the windows was so dangerous for kids and there is no cctv and I m not going there any more and there were small kids shouting in the halls, Great location 
335409,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Nothing , Lovely clean room with good mini bar and tea coffee selection Bathroom was lovely Staff were really nice and helpful directing us to the nearby tram station in order to get into the centre of Vienna in about 15 mins 
335410,Rainers Hotel Vienna, it smelled very strongly of male perfume in the room for no particular reason despite everything being clean the smell was invasive, Clean spacious room
335411,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Only that one must take public transport to go anywhere in Vienna , The hotel is indeed very well located meaning close to Wien HBF and relatively close to the Old Town if moving by public transport Nevertheless to from HBF or to from the Old Town public transport is a MUST and is not a easy walking distance 
335412,Rainers Hotel Vienna, 2 single beds near to each other are not as comfortable as a double bed The staff could be more helpful onece I felt a bit sick at the evening so I couldn t have dinner but I got hungry at 11pm everything was closed near to the hotel it is not in the downtown so I asked for some butter and bread at the bar and they said that they can t find them in the kitchen , The tram 1 and 18 stop near to the hotel it is easier and more comfortable to use them than the metro the most important train stations and the Opera are one these lines and it is easy to get to Sch nbrunn as well The breakfast is nice 
335413,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very good location It s convenient to take public transportation in Wien Matzleinsdorfer Platz The room is very clean and the workers are nice 
335414,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Unfortunately ubahn is not that close but it is not that far either There is a bus stop outside that can take you to ubahn or you can have a 15 minute walk , Stuff was really helpful and polite 
335415,Rainers Hotel Vienna, We booked a double room with a double bed for me and my wife and we got 2 separate beds linked together which was very unpleasant And I told them from the beginning but they haven t done anything about this The wireless connection in our room was so weak we couldn t use it at all We had to go near the lifts to have wireless connection And again I told to the staff the situation but they haven t take any action only verbally they said will solve it but no action taken We found hair on the sheets when we arrived but after telling them they ve change the sheets , The breakfast was nice good variation and tasty 
335416,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The room was tiny but very clean I must say I didn t pay too much for it so it was fine , The staff was very friendly and helpfull I was really surprised I didn t have to pay for parking the car for one hour there And in my room I even had a small fridge with drinks an electric kettle and some tee bags as well 
335417,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Not much information given about things to do in Vienna best to research before arriving Hotel is a little outside the centre would recommend the 24 42 72 hour travel pass as this makes going into the centre cheaper , The room was very clean the hotel was close to the tram and train stop Staff were friendly 
335418,Rainers Hotel Vienna, During the luggage storing i would have liked if they could tag my suite case instead of just putting all luggage with no mark Its just feel safer And as a four star hotel that should be a basic service, The room was clean and spacious The housekeeping team is great The tram was 3 minutes walk from the hotel It takes 15 min to get to West banhoef 
335419,Rainers Hotel Vienna, Parking is not free and it is very expensive That is the main reason why I would not recommend this hotel to nobody and why I would never come back to this hotel Also the wifi connection is very slow, The rooms are very nice and clean and the tram station is 2 minutes walk away from the hotel that is great because the city center is less than 10 minutes driving with the tram 
335420,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, This is one of best hotel in Vienna if you are coming by car Very easy to reach it and good connection with high way Staff is fantastic and I really recommend it 
335421,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The neighborhood is not the best in town Also kind of far from the metro close to the S Bahn though it takes about 30 min to get to the center , The hotel is clean the room is spacious and the staff was helpful 
335422,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Very modern room Good breakfast buffet Location and exterior dont look promising at first but inside it s good Room decor nice good tea and coffee making facilities in room and great shower 10 mins to city centre on tram 2 mins walk from hotel
335423,Rainers Hotel Vienna, We are not happy about location of our room it is far away form lobby And while going there there are many rooms under constructions But they dont change it Our heater was broken And room lock as Well, Beds comfortable And Rooms are clean
335424,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The reception always had trainees they wanted to help but didn t have all the needed information Not many things to do or places to eat in the neighbourhood, Location very close to metro and train The room was clean and confortable
335425,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, very Comfortable and clean bus stop right in front of the hotel which is very convenient having a bathtub is great after a day of walking Staff are helpful and friendly and even help to print my train ticket Lovely experience 
335426,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The room was dirty and small for a 4 star hotel also our room was 5 minutes away to any chairs or elevator about the neighbourhood we ve found it scarry there were lots of imigrants, The food is really good and there were lots of choises 
335427,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The room isn t that big the parking is very expensive , The stuff are very nice and good breakfast easily you can catch the downtown in 15 20minutes
335428,Rainers Hotel Vienna, It was clean however the bath should be cleared as the water went out problematically , Staff was really nice and the location is good especially if you travel by train to Vienna HBF 
335429,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, The biggest advantages of this hotel is reasonable price and location The latter is maybe not in the nicest area but it s very close to the S Bahn and Tram station 2 min walk to Matzleinsdorfer Platz station The room was very clean and comfortable All facilities were provided as per the list mentioned on the website Nothing to complain about Great thing was that we could leave our baggage for free after check out and pick it up later 
335430,Rainers Hotel Vienna, location in a seedy area Restaurant staff member was arrogant and the meal over priced 17 euro for burger and chips Bread which is normally complimentary was charged for and overpriced, room was comfortable and reception staff helpful
335431,Rainers Hotel Vienna, We liked it all , Our very short but happy stay in the hotel began with the pleasant reception staff Our room was quiet very spacious and well equipped with a bar fridge and safe and all the necessary amenities The linen and towels were fresh and crisp and the bed was extremely comfortable There was a gym and a bar and although we didn t have breakfast the buffet looked delicious There was a supermarket next door which could be useful The hotel is a pleasant 40 minute walk from the Old Town centre but you can also easily catch the team We certainly recommend this hotel 
335432,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I can t complain for anything, 1 Good price 2 Clean and nice room 3 Very helpful personel 4 Good situated nead bus metro train 5 Uncredible comfortable bed
335433,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I bought a double room But hotel provided me a twin room and they told me they have sold out double rooms They either sell something that they don t have or sell your room if they have another client and give you another room which does not fit your requests Normally they shouldn t charge me for the room And the excuse was so weird They simply defended that they have no free double rooms and they ignored that i bought a double room , Some of the staff was helpful Room was clean and comfortable Location is not a walk distance to city center but not far away if you take a metro 
335434,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The wifi isn t free after 3 hours and the restaurant was priced a bit above our budget so we didn t eat there but it was no problem , The room was amazing 
335435,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The hotel location is not that nice and it is full with foreigners The metro station is 15 20 minutes distance by walk Everything else was ok , Very suitable for people with car The breakfast was excellent Clean room with AC for hot summer nights 
335436,Rainers Hotel Vienna, The airco was aimed at my head when sleeping This was annoying so we turned it off while sleeping Since it was 38C outside this wasn t ideal Also the wifi speed was capped Netflix was barely possible , Nice and attentive staff The airco functioned well 
335437,Rainers Hotel Vienna,No Negative, Everything was great The staff was amazing gym was excellent location was great for the 1 tram as well Couldn t have asked for a better stay 
335438,Rainers Hotel Vienna, I wasn t super crazy about the location I wouldn t really consider this hotel in the city center It was a short walk to a train station then one of many trains into the center , The staff was very friendly and the hotel was nice and clean The beds were super comfortable
