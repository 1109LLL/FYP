481858,Meli Milano, You had to pay for ironing ridiculous the fact they don t have a iron in the room due to health and safety reasons , The designs at the hotel lay out the breakfast sausages
481859,Meli Milano,No Negative, Great experience for our family The kids were surprised with gifts and a treasure hunt through the hotel with a price at the end There was fresh fruit and cake in our room when we arrived Staff was extremely helpful and wonderful 
481860,Meli Milano, Only 1 robe in my room The view from the balcony was blocked by a concrete slab that was across every balcony at head and body height My bin wasn t emptied daily there was dirty dishes lying in the corridor for a couple of days My towels weren t changed when I left them in the bath they were just hung back on rails The tables were dusty when I arrived and the prices of the mini bar were excrushiating 6 a small can of pop when it s 75 cents in the shop around the corner ,No Positive
481861,Meli Milano, Grubby walls in our room and other small things which aren t that important i guess as we loved it overall, The staff were lovely honestly They really went to the end line to make things comfortable The breakfast was just lovely and the coffee was pretty good Kiwis are generally fussy about coffee your coffee was pretty good 
481862,Meli Milano, To me the hotel felt slightly old fashioned and our room was nice but not 5 star nice I remember closing the bathroom door and a piece of the doorframe fell off Over all we had a great stay gigantic comfortable bed and the location is great too , Staff where really friendly and helpful
481863,Meli Milano,No Negative, The hotel is quite luxurious and the service is impeccable and very helpful The location is a little outside the center though very close walking distance to the Lotto subway station on Metro lines M1 and M5 We found a couple of restaurants in the neighborhood we tried one the pizza from a wood fired oven was quite good We could see the San Siro stadium from our balcony They offer a lot of choices for the breakfast buffet and all of them seemed very high quality 
481864,Meli Milano, The breakfast wasn t any good and the room wasn t perfectly clean on the floor there was dust and nails , the bed and pillows were very confortable as well as the entire room space
481865,Meli Milano, On Booking com it was originally advertised as having parking which the hotel did not have Breakfast included would have been nice too , Clean rooms good facilities Good location Helpful staff 
481866,Meli Milano, My personal lack of time due to a hectic schedule that prevented me enjoying the facilities to the max , The staff is the perfect mixture of cordial and professional for an establishment of the kind and tending to any and every whim Breakfasts offer everything from utterly healthy fruit brans etc via great variety of salty salmon mushrooms eggs in a myriad ways to absolutely scrumptious international and local pastry and deserts Also late check outs don t require extensive negotiating and as I had a late evening flight was offere to use the lounge as long as I needed it so basically Meli Milano pampers Guests even beyond the official check out which is a unique feature other 5 star chains could look up to Braviii Meli Milano 
481867,Meli Milano, In my opinion just the fact that there is no private parking can be considered as a bad thing but there is the chance to park in the street which is in front of the hotel so no big deal , The bed was very comfortable and big The room is quiet and clean 
481868,Meli Milano, Nearby neibourhood not fancy and not many food attractions options , Luxury hotel near Fiera di Milano Only one block away from subway and 10 min ride to Piazza del Duomo and Galleria 
481869,Meli Milano, The balcony in the room was very depressing with no view at all and no table and chairs outside If you want to see something form your balcony you have to lay down on the balcony floor Some lights were not working in the room as well They did not tell us about the Milan charge when we checked in or even on their website which is 5 per person a night They only tell you when you go to check out that you need to pay it , The free smart phone with free internet which you can take with you and use for the durration of the stay Also the touch control in the room was nice too Hotel lobby was very good and looked like a 5 star one 
481870,Meli Milano, It s not value for money And to be frank this is probably one of the worst experience I had in 5 star hotels The bathroom shower was not really working well and the shield of the shower is also broken We are 2 guests but in the room everything was prepared for one person including slippers and towels There was one free bottle of water when we check in but just one and no more in the second day Spa seems not accesible and it comes as a surprise Breakfast is not up to continental level and there is not much service in the restaurant Staff was not helpful and I literally see no smile on any of them and I even got a weird looking when we request some service You can see staff here was not really trained motivated to attend to the customer to the detail but rather simply perform the routine There is also this big cell tower by the room we stayed and there is no view outside of the window I don t really want to be some needy customer who always ask for dream experience in a hotel where you are just suppose to sleep in It s simply that I would expect more with a 5 star hotel when I spent the money and that the peer hotel with same cost simply provides much better stay experience , You can see the hotel tries to be creative and modern by introducing the smart control system of the room and as well a smartphone including city guide and has some data that you can carry with you and surf with The room was clean and bed was comfortable 
481871,Meli Milano, The day we reached there was dust in the hotel room the day we had to leave a enormous problem and misunderstanding happened We payed for our stay the first day then we used room service and so on the last day we went on the Reception to pay our bills for the room service and they told a sum of money we considered small for what we actually had consumed we asked ten times re you sure that this is all that tomorrow morning when we check out we wont have anything else to pay unless we use room service again of course and the answer was YES Then the next morning we found ourselves in a trap You need to pay the last night we had spent all our money shopping the previous day and we had payed all of the nights in the day we checked in To sum it up They took from our paid stay money for the room serive which I happen to experience the VERY FIRST TIME in my life in a hotel So if this is hotel policy this is a total ABSURD If it is a personnel mistake well nobody took the responsibility nor compensated us in any words I loved the hotel but this made me think twice if I would visit it EVER AGAIN , The location is great far away from the center quiet but very close to the subway The hotel is good the restaurant is good and the personnel are very kind and gentle 
481872,Meli Milano, Paid for a premium room did not think it was good value for money we had a small court yard which was appalling the view was a medium size concrete wall with a satellite mask which was totally unexceptionable So overall I was extremely disappointed with my room and the cost, Staff
481873,Meli Milano, Above already mentioned points old no clean rude staff changed room second one in front of a gigantic repeater tower Very dissapointed , Nothing about it old property for the money spent
481874,Meli Milano, The area around the hotel is a bit boring, The room is great Staff is very friendly and helpful with perfect english Gym is amazing in regards to hotel gym
481875,Meli Milano, Nothing Everything was excellent , Without any special request we received a special attention according to our celebration excellent service in all aspects and so close to the metro station 
481876,Meli Milano, I booked this hotel due to its location and spa No booking com description or my booking confirmation says that spa sauna is not included in the rate I had to pay 15 Euros for a 2 3 star spa I guess this is one of the ways how this hotel generates additional cash The response from the reception was like this is how it is They clearly understood that this information was not explicit on facilities description or in my booking but didn t want to provide free access to spa ,No Positive
481877,Meli Milano, Breakfast breakfast area did not meet 5 standards For breakfast coffee we had to use self service full automatic coffee machine Come on In a 5 hotel in Italy you would expect a real italian espresso being served to the table ,No Positive
481878,Meli Milano, Hotel room and location, The room for a 5 star hotel was absolutely basic and bare It would compare to a 2 star hotel room in my country South Africa Stayed in 5 star hotels throughout Italy on this vacation and the Melia hotel room was the worst It was very depressing being in that room The pictures shown on the website are not a true reflection of the room Very far from the main attractions The breakfast was good though and made up for part of our terrible stay at this hotel 
481879,Meli Milano, First of all i want to start with saying that the Melia Milano hotel on Via Masaccio 19 is beautiful and has great potential but I m very sorry to say that some thing has gone terrible wrong when it comes to the staff and service I am a used traveler and i only stay at 5 star hotells when i do with over 100 travel days a year i thought i could with confident say that i had seen it all until this trip i have never felt the need to give a bad review or sending a e mail like this but this time i just can t let this go without pointing out all the flaws that we had during our stay in room 336 from 28th December to 2th January i would never send this unless the personal did not take my points seriously and just nod and walk away First of all the Cleaning is really bad we arrived to dusty room with dust on the glas and mirror in the bathroom letting it go and hoping that when they clean the room it will be taken care off to our surprise when we come later the first night we see that its still dusty and only bed and towels has been changed and trash has been missed thats been in the middle of the room I decide to not make a big deal about this and decide to clean it myself This type of problems has kept turning up during our stay at the hotel Personal forgetting to take used coffee muggs and food from the room The personal even forgot to refill the minibar for 2 days straight this is when i felt the need to call down to the reception and point out the flaws and just get hited back with excuses and promises that it will be taken care off one more day passes and still no refill in the minibar or properly cleaned room I decided to make a little test to see if I m over reacting and ordered food from the room service wich arrived cold I ate it any way and placed the tray outside the door around lunch time the 1th january when i arrive back to the hotell later in the evening i see the tray is stil there its more then 8 hours later ,No Positive
481880,Meli Milano, The hotel is not in the center so there is not much to do around it Staff not much helpful we asked a night before for a late checkout and they told us to wait till tomorrow to have an answer and when we called again the next morning they gave us only 30 min more as a Late checkout The light controlling system in the room is not practical , Good value quality price hotel for a 5 in Milan The bed is pretty comfy 
481881,Meli Milano, Some of college wasn t friendly It would be better when they have more SPA or wellness , When we arrive at the morning we receive soon the room and we were able to enjoy breakfast The Lounge was good with drinks and food The room and the bed was excellent 
481882,Meli Milano, the air condition is not so good for it always feel like cold when i stay in room even after i increase the AC setting to higher temperature , the room is big with sufficient and good quality room suppliers slippers lotions lounge provides snack and teas any time convenient close to take subway nice welcome chocolate
481883,Meli Milano, One female front desk clerk at check in had a poor attitude was not friendly wrong personality for that position , Very comfortable Bed Nice room Elegant lobby With one exception great friendly staff Good location near subway on off bus tour stop safe Excellent breakfast buffet 
481884,Meli Milano, Plug points sockets would not work with my electrical gadgets No subtitles to television programmes , The glass of orange juice and the lovely decors The bathroom was nice
481885,Meli Milano, Breakfast was poor really Choice The chef cooking the breakfast was aggressive first day so I avoided going and just had cereal I needed an iron I arrived at the hotel at 11pm from a flight I had a meeting at 8am and I arrived at my meeting with a creased shirt Not a good luck I do believe laundry facilities were available from 8 30am,No Positive
481886,Meli Milano, The room was cold we asked for an extra blanket and was very hard to communicate with the Housekeeping or Concierge The automated light switch in the room was not working properly and there was no heating , The size of the room
481887,Meli Milano, We were not informed on check in or the next day that work was taking place next to the room we were in 413 Hoping for a lie in as it was our last day before we travelled back to the UK we were woken up at around 8 00am to the sounds of hammering and drilling When we checked out and queried it we were told that emergency work needed to be carried out in the room next to us but I don t understand why no one could have called us or knocked our door to inform us of this We were terribly inconvienienced and the best the hotel could do was say we can offer you a free coffee or tea in the bar considering how much we paid for the room and the fact that we weren t told in the morning about the work was terrible , Had good breakfast options
481888,Meli Milano, Beside the fact that I paid my stay upon arrival and I had a creditcard I had to pay also a deposit Which was returned after checking out , Location is great Facilities also
481889,Meli Milano, Nothing, Very nice and helpful staff They treat you so private Breakfast was excellent Rooms were very comfortable Simply we liked everything 
481890,Meli Milano, Its far from the center but close to the metro station We had to pay extra to use the pool, Very clean the area is nice for a walk Room had a balcony with a nice view Bed was comforable We loved our stay If you want a five star hotel with reasonable price Melia is the best
481891,Meli Milano, Breakfast could be better more staff better service are needed and why not offering fresh milk rather than UHT one a cheap option for such a gorgeous hotel , Great rooms with lots of comfort polite staff luxurious entrance 
481892,Meli Milano, The controls for the lights and ac needed some explaining and a reboot One of the cleaning staff opened a window and didnt fully shut so the ac wouldnt go on We got back latr and didnt kniw so sleeping that night was difficult and uncomfortable , People were very helpful hotel was nice Liked the 24 hours level lounge
481893,Meli Milano, You would expect the rooms to be impressive too but the contrary is a fact The lousy furniture lack of a carpet and missing wall design give impression of a 3 star hotel at most the airconditioning was not cooling The terrace if you could call it that wasn t more then a prison cage with no more view then a concrete wall right in front of your nose and a dozen of old soaked sigaret budds on the floor The sandpaper sheets made it impossible to sleep without oijamas and socks , The lobby is impressive
481894,Meli Milano, Reception is not smile very aggrasive I can not belive that 5 start hotel does not provide complentary water coffee fruit etc, the worest 5 star hotel I have seen
481895,Meli Milano, The breakfast in the main breakfast area was poor I asked for two fried eggs The cook put two eggs onto the griddle and one of them broke He still continued to cook it and serve me with it Just generally a breakfast incompatible with the very high standard of the rest of the hotel and staff Small changes needed to make this a 10 , The reception on level one was superb 
481896,Meli Milano, Nothing, The staff service were absolutely fantastic couldn t be faulted The staff in the bar were especially helpful attentive Loved every minute of our stay 
481897,Meli Milano, The daytime staff could be a little more friendlier helpful , The hotel itself was better than expected Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Milan 
481898,Meli Milano, There was cold in room one evening we have problems with light in The room air condition doesnt work old rooms are in bad conditions far away from Center high price in The restaurant, Level Room Jagger Restaurant
481899,Meli Milano, Not very welcoming staff When I asked to recommend me a restaurant for dinner they didn t spent too much time on the research and they gave up in a second , Room big and clean but 25 euro for breakfast is a shame 
481900,Meli Milano, We were two girls no one helped us with luggage at check in and chekaut 120 per night single had to pay breakfast and even the spa for a 5 star hotel this is unacceptable especially for the spa I mean We asked for an iron and we announced Prices for the service and for evening dress the price was 32 Claim your ice bar with ice bucket 5 Everything is paid it is biasing sorry but we are very disappointed, Beautiful Lobby and close to metro station
481901,Meli Milano, The bed is not comfortable The room survice is opening the door by their key without permission imediatly after nocking the door while we were in the room which is realy rude and unrespectfull , Very nice location in the med of milano I visited milano to attend c9nferance in II sole 24 ore which is 5 min walk away Metro station is just few steps away the hotel is clean with frindly stafs 
481902,Meli Milano, Some rooms are old and we had to pay extra to change to a renovated room without carpet due to my allergies Isolation between rooms are bad and the noise of the room next to you can be bothersome The phone in the room was not working this is not acceptable for a five star hotel The staff during check in was not very friendly , Location is good very close to the metro station The breakfast was good 
481903,Meli Milano, Hotel does not has parking what is sad for a 5 star hotel Close by is a shady and worn down over expensive garage We did not felt well having our car parked there The room rates are without breakfast also very disappointing and unusual for a 5 star hotel , Clean and staff very friendly The bathroom was very spacious and beautiful 
481904,Meli Milano, Quite far from the center Breakfast too expensive for quality and choice Bathroom not very nice shower is not very easy to use no bath Very slow free wifi connection Pilow are not confortable, Nice luxury hotel lobby and general Nice rooms
481905,Meli Milano, Card reader hence electricity did not work and we figured it out when coming back quite late to the hotel The problem was fixed in 20 min , Beautiful decoration spacious and comfortable room 
481906,Meli Milano, Breakfast and restaurant food are very expensive so we didn t order anything , Great location very close to subway so it s convenient to go to the expo which is only 15 minutes away Quiet street though it seemed to me that Milan overall is a quiet city Comfortable beds awesome gym with all sorts of equipment including free weights 
481907,Meli Milano, Cleaner on Saturday morning knocked to clean room 8 45 am 9 10 am 9 45 am and 10 15 when we where trying to have late morning I thought it was, Very clean
481908,Meli Milano, Smell in the room no swimming pool no free parking unless you drive a fancy car , very helpful bellboy and the staff were responsible Stupid song in hotel channel you should see it
