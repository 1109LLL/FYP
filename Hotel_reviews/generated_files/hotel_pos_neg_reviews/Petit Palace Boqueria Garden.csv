288224,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The rooms were not ready until 3pm But they did store our luggage so we could go tour around, The breakfast buffet was TREMENDOUS the rooms were very nice and spacious with GREAT showers 
288225,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We had a room for 3 people which was one of the smallest rooms we had ever been given at a hotel The area for the double bed was very small and our son slept in a small area behind the TV The view was over a small road but you couldn t see it as the doors would not fully open I think this was for security health and safety reasons The price of this hotel was far too much money for what you get this is the first time I have ever said this in all my years of travelling It did t ruin our trip to Barcelona but when I return I will definitely do a bit more research on the hotel , The entrance to the hotel was very nice and the reception staff were helpful The shower was nice a big That s about it 
288226,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, There was no iron which was strange but when we requested it the staff brought it up in an instant My niece was up in the top bunk and she found the ladder hard to use , The bed was very firm but I liked it like that and they were a good size They were also separated into two beds 
288227,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It was a shame that that the outside garden area was closed for three of our four nights stay due to refurbishment may have been better to do this before summer guests arrived, We really loved the comfort of our room and the fantastic breakfast selection and the extremely helpful staff

288230,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, One long window in the bathroom with no curtain The strong light disturb though the glass door of bathroom They put the toilet seat too close to the shower box Very slippery floor in bathroom We did request floor mat for this problem but no one care They are busy with fully booked Then no service The towel in bathroom is all torn out and very dusty cause allergy to us I am very upset to stay here , good breakfast the bed mattress is ok

288232,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The bed was to singles pushed together a proeprndouble bed would have been nicer , Bigger rooms than normal in Barcelona beautiful quiet garden away from stress of streets 
288233,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The shower in our room was very messy water got everywhere We had to buy sponges to mop up the water as the shower screen was useless Also the ladder on the bunk bed was not secure so kept moving around which made it difficult and slightly scary to use , Breakfast was lovely there was lots to choose from Location of the hotel was incredible the metro station was right outside the beach was 20 minutes away and we were on the doorstep of La Rambla Hotel was very clean and all the staff were super friendly 
288234,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The design of the suite isn t good and you can see strange things happen through out the window where the prostitution at night going on in the street just open the window and see for free I also waited long time in the reception to make check in I will never ever get back again , Only the location is good
288235,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No elevator at apartments section I had to carry all my family s bags 5 large and 3 small up the stairs to the 3rd floor on check in and I had to carry it down the stairs from the 3rd floor on check out because they only have one luggage guy and he was busy It was a nightmare I think I should get a full refund , Location

288238,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The unit was clean but there was no sitting area They had a king bed bunk beds and 2 desks Considering this was a family unit I thought that was a serious limitation Be prepared for a noisy street at night Barcelona parties hard and into the early hours The cacophony created by the daily 4AM trash truck will serve as the crescendo All in all we did not get much sleep , The staff was very friendly The unit was clean May good options for breakfast or elaborate sit down means in the immediate vicinity Loved the ice cream joint next door They also have a convenience store right adjacent to the hotel We were able to purchase water snacks sandwiches there Neighborhood was beautiful This hotel is pretty much on La Rambla one of the most happening places in Barcelona Walking distance from Picasso museum Cathedral of Barcelona and Placa de Catalunya We thoroughly enjoying walking around and felt very safe Closest metro stop was about 200 meters away

288257,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We had a sixtaplet room and one of the top bunk beds had dirty sheets While that by itself was not a good experience I was far more frustrated to be faced with a puzzled look on the part of the front desk person I discovered the dirty sheets at 11pm at night as we were preparing to go to bed A common sense suggests one would not be making this up after a day of travel and walking , Location property staff for the most part and the bar garden 
288258,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Very difficult and complicated to get to the rooms especially with luggage , Very extensive breakfast buffet in a lovely room Nespresso machines to make your own coffee A whole table full of detox juices fruits seeds and superfoods also vegan gluten and dairy free options The location was excellent just one block from the main promenade of Las Ramblas Many restaurants and shops are all nearby

288265,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Only fault was some sign of mole in bathroom easy to clean up, The value for money location we booked room for 4 adults got a room with King size and a bunk bed room was spacious bathroom was spacious quiet room We asked for a few extra amenities and they were attended to quickly They offer mifi for 5 a day so my whole family could tour Barcelona and have wifi The hotel is near the Placa Catyluna just 5 min walk everything is close by

288274,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, The location is excellent a surprisingly quiet little haven just off La Rambla near Liceu station in the busiest part of town The hotel has their own bicycles so if you see them in reception you can take them out We also took advantage of their mi fi a wifi hotspot you can take out with you for 5 a day may not be cheaper than your roaming data and you ll definitely need the charger 
288275,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The sound insulation was bad and couldn t keep out the noise caused by drunken shouting of tourists down on the street The seat on the toilet was broken and replaced with an unmatching one Certainly not something I d expect from a hotel of this caliber The drain in the shower was clogged The distance from our window to the next building was 2 arms length meaning no natural light in the room , Nice quiet garden in the middle of the bustle of El Gotic 
288276,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Would have been helpful for us if the hotel had offered something in the way of food throughout the day especially having 2 young children but they didn t mind us bringing some snacks in and eating them in the courtyard , Fantastic location just off La Rambla but near some great shopping streets and cafes restaurants Breakfast was fabulous lots of choice and some great healthy options Staff very courteous and efficient Hotel did exactly as we asked in putting our two rooms opposite each other and putting extra safety sides on the bunk beds Very happy

288281,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing, The breakfast was too good great range and quality including all the Spanish options you d want The hotel is in a perfect location just of La Rambla and 200 metres from the central market which is an experience and a half The hotel is clean moderately priced good facilities and has a charm about it with courtyards and gardens adding to the appeal Coming in off the busy street it is like an oasis of peace Had a great four days here with nothing negative at all 
288282,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The things I didn t like were nothing to do with this hotel but with Barcelona It is too busy too many tourists too many homeless too many beggars too many street vendors, Breakfast great Staff obliging
288283,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, There was nothing to complain about the hotel If you intend using the metro with 2 buggies and young kids the stairs may be challenging although escalator and elevator facilities do exist in certain stations , The location is simply perfect if you wish to walk around take the metro bus to different areas in Barcelona be it to shop swim dine have drinks visit sites and the various areas Gothic Barceloneta El Born Parc de la Ciutadella etc etc in Barcelona The fact that the hotel is located within a pedestrian area was great with the kids under 5 years and the hotel has a nice outside area to relax and have a drink 
288284,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No car parking available Had to book through a third party site Coffee machines look very pretty but they re too complex for most people to work at breakfast , Property location was excellent Rooms clean and well appointed 
288285,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, What are genius Perks did we miss out on something , the location just off La Rambla is excellent with a metro stop right there as well essential to pre book various site visits Sagrada Familia Park Guell Casa Battlo Music concerts etc however it wasn t cheap not sure if this is because it was also Grand Prix weekend which we had not realised 
288286,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Lack of swimming pool La rambla is seedy drugs offered on every corner and ladies of the night quite aggressive Not hotels fault, Great location to get about the city lovely staff helpful and kind

288291,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, nothing, We have stayed at the Petite Palace Boqueria Gardens on 2 previous visits to Barcelona and love the property Location is sensational so close to all the action yet once you walk inside it feels like a quite sanctuary Rooms are well appointed The staff have always been fabulous I also love their signature fragrance 
288292,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Room size shape and in need of update Bathroom is big but mouldy peeling paint no soap holder thin towels and torn bath mat Poorly cleaned room , Location was excellent and the hotel gardens are beautiful
288293,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was a bit warm and we could not figure out how to lower the temperature so we just opened the door to the tiny balcony That was fine but one night was very noisy even though our room looked out to a tiny alleyway , The extra pillow was good to have and the little desk table outside the bathroom was great to have Rooms need 2 luggage stands and most have only one so the table functioned as our second luggage stand 
288294,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Went away for my 50th birthday with girl friends and presumed i had booked a room with 1 large double 2 single beds and one set of bunk beds I thought our apartment would be bigger Our room actually consisted of 1 large double in one room and 2 sets of bunk beds in another room This did not spoil our stay in fact we laughed about it This may have been a problem if we had been older people and unable to climb to the top bunks Not the hotels fault but could be worded more clearly on booking com , Excellent location very clean helpful friendly staff Good value Would stay again 2 bathrooms which was great for 5 women staying in the same room 
288295,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, A roof terrace or swimming Pool would have been nice The interior of the bathroom was poorly finished and seemed old aged , Very nice and helpfull staff The bed bathroom were spacious enough to make it comfortable Very quiet and nice view on the 4th floor upon a green garden with trees and the interior court lounge terrace Nice breakfast room with plenty of choice 
288296,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Only fault I could really say was the noise outside the hotel and the gaps in the bathroom door Didn t like the bunkbeds as the steps to them were very hard on the feet , The location was amazing The beds where very comfortable I was there for my sisters birthdays and they left a lovely muffin and 4 sweets and 4 bottles of water as a birthday treat 
288297,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Lack of heating in bathroom Heated towel rail would be good so towels could be re used Mirror needed in main bedroom , Excellent location Easy access to all forms of transport Used Aerobus from airport to Placa Catalunya and then easy stroll down La Rambla to the hotel which is situated in a quiet side street Efficient staff easy check in and out Large room on second floor No view at all but not an issue for us as we didn t spend much time there Bathroom was large but no heating in there Nowhere to dry towels but good powerful shower Only one mirror and that was in the bathroom Not ideal for hair and make up Free safe in room and also effective air conditioning Breakfast was very good apart from a temperamental Nespresso machine which even after three days I couldn t get a decent coffee out of Overall very enjoyable stay and would stay again if in Barcelona 
288298,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, had a room facing the courtyard very noisy sometimes until 3 am ppl talking and laughing in the courtyard I guess Very loud Found the rooms a bit expensive for what you get Maybe if they were about 25 less ,No Positive
288299,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, given the four star rating we were disappointed with the lack of coffee making facilities in the room or ability to obtain a hot drink prior to the breakfast area being opened We were also a little taken aback by the attitude of one particular staff member on the front desk as we had not run into this type of attitude before when we have been travelling It is a shame as the rest of the staff were extremely professional and it has coloured our view of the hotel , The bed was extremely comfortable
288300,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No tea coffee making facilities in room , really good location we had a small issue with the room but was dealt with by one of the managers called Irena in a very professional and understanding manner Room was very quiet even though only a stones throw away from Las Ramblas 
288301,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, the staff front desk martin breakfast and the airconditioning in the rooms booked 2 rooms for 4 nights with breakfast for our family 4adults and 2kids we booked this room upon the recommendation of our relatives and also based on the reviews from the internet when we arrived at the hotel the front desk officer girl told us that it s not possible that the kids will stay in our room since it s indicated in the booking only adults 2 adults per room i told them this is not the first time travelling with the kids and we normally just get 1 room 2adults 2kids for twin rooms since they are still small we told them just charge us for the stay of the kids and we will have no problem we can just stay in 1 room they said they will make an exemption on this case provided that the kids will pay 6 30 euros for the breakfast for the whole duration of our stay the following day breakfast time this MARTIN who claimed to be the manager went up to us in the middle of the buffet area and asked why are there kids when there should only be 4 adults I explained to him and informed him to just talk to the people who did the check in but despite all my explanations he didnt believe us he made it appear that as if we were hiding the kids from the hotel he even ordered us to be back in the hotel by 3pm before his duty ends and to bring the passports of the children even when i already told him we will be on a montserrat tour and dont know what time we will be back to make the long story short and as the story drama progressed i found out this martin was well informed by his colleague and was informed that they made an exemption already and yet he still went his way just to HUMILIATE US never felt so discriminated my question why did he still come up to us when he knew already that there was an exemption in our case that there was already an arrangement prior to him that the kids will pay breakfast , only the location close to metro and la rambla
288302,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It would be difficult for people with disabilities to maneuver the steps through the garden to the back sleeping quarters No written material in Room to provide basic information on the facilities and room amenities how to use the telephone and channels available on tv are two examples, The size of the bed and the luxurious sheets and duvet
288303,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Security not great Special requests not entirely satisfied , Great location between Pl Catalunya and the Port The Double glazed windows are very effective in keeping noise out

288306,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The bunk beds were a bit perilous as the top bunk was very high up and there was no safety barrier The stairs were also a bit dodgy as they could slide across Not suitable for little children to sleep on the top bunk, We booked three rooms for a hen weekend The rooms were spacious and clean and the staff were very polite and helpful Great value for money given the prime location Would absolutely stay again 
288307,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It was a bit noisy at night and early morning but this is to be expected as being so central , Location was perfect very close to the metro and in walking distance to many of the sites Large clean hotel with friendly reception Bedroom bathroom were great sizes and were very clean Double bed was huge and very comfortable Would definitely stay again 
288308,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We were upgraded to a room for 6 after being told we couldn t via email so had one room too many and weren t able to cancel it at the hotel this came at a cost , Breakfasts offered so much and were delicious the rooms were huge

288314,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, After being up since 2 am in the morning we were not too pleased that our room still wasn t ready by 3pm Reception staff were apologetic but we had to wait a further 40 very tired minutes to get in It might be an age thing but we do like a coffee or tea whilst in our hotel rooms There are no drink making facilities at all which I thought came as standard even in B B s We went out and bought a kettle 2 mugs and drinks etc only to find on our last day there is actually a sign in the lift saying to ask for a kettle if u want one doh lol Maybe just put one in the room to start with A few scuffs on the floor but other than those few minor details everything Muy Buena Grazias x, Beautiful lobby and very smiley friendly welcome from reception team Fantastic location so easy to find off La Rambla Perfect place for sightseeing Very clean and very comfortable Great value for the money definitely recommend 
288315,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Our quiet room was at the back overlooking the bar courtyard We had almost constant noise until late into the night from the radio television music sounding out across the area from the big screen just under our window forcing us to keep it closed which would not be our preference When open it also let in the cigarette smoke from below Not ideal Having been provided with cups for hot drink making we had them taken away by the chamber maids on more than one occasion When they were actually left in the room they were left unwashed something which we did not feel we should be doing in the bathroom sink They also took away the extra sheet that was provided upon request Both these shortcomings meant having to ask the reception staff for replacements , As noted in previous reviews this hotel is in a great location for the old city the Ramblas and the harbour Just one minute walk from the Liceu metro station with fast frequent trains to all parts of the city Comfortable bed in a reasonably sized room with good provision of quality toiletries plus travel essentials Pre requested kettle and cups were supplied and appreciated Excellent choice of buffet breakfast with a range of mainly continental items plus a few cooked things which didn t look particularly appetising apart from the scrambled egg which was good for a hotel mass producing There was also a trolley of interesting healthy items which went down well Breakfast staff were friendly efficient and helpful They were also happy to accommodate a request for gluten free items 
288316,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing really , Excellent location just off La Rambla As long as you don t mind that it s very lively in that area Which was exactly what we wanted Good size clean rooms Excellent walk in shower It s in a pedestrianised area so take a taxi from the airport Don t drive 
288317,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Rooms facing the street can get noisy but easy fix sleeping with ear plugs Slept like a baby , Staff was very friendly and welcoming Breakfast was delicious with a great selection Awesome location in the Gothic Quarter and easy access to public transportation This was our first stay but we will definitely return 
288318,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The booking com system didn t connect well with the hotel and so our reservation was not on the hotel system when we arrived A few nervous minutes whilst the staff tried to work it out and we were given a room but it could have been a disaster , This is a very comfortable hotel with spacious rooms and bathrooms Everything worked and the staff were happy to oblige if we needed anything like a kettle The location was the real winner Right in the middle of the beautiful narrow streets of the Gothic Quarter there are so many cafes shops restaurants boutiques etc We spent hours wxporing just outside the hotel 
288319,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing to dislike Shame there were no tea coffee making facilities in the room , Excellent selection of food for breakfast for all nationalities Not a full English breakfast but hot food was available The hotel was clean and comfortable and all the staff were very welcoming and friendly Most of them spoke English 
288320,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nil, Room and bed was comfortable the location of the hotel was excellent Convenient to travel on the train to your places of interest Good value for your money Staff were great friendly and helpful Had a wonderful trip in Barcelona Thanks
288321,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing I could not find faults , Great location super facilities and very friendly helpful staff Perfect for visiting all the sights of the city We intend to go back 
288322,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, They did not have ac during the month of march We needed it , The breakfast was amazing The staff went out of their way to give directions and even packed us a picnic breakfast the morning we left to the airport 
288323,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Could not have early breakfast on day of our marathon Also asked to change to 6 bed but were told couldn t do booked another 2 bed and found they had upgraded us to a 6 bed We were told we could not cancel the 2 bed because we had done it through booking com Cost us an extra 400 Euros Any chance a discount in future , Lovely apartment
288324,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It was extremely noisy at night had to change rooms The lack of air conditioning outwith summer season meant windows had to be open which exacerbated the issue , The staff were excellent as was the breakfast and location to sights 
288325,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Head board behind pillows very dirty mini bar not working only one small window in room air con not working bare wires showing by side of desk, Breakfast although it was mostly a cold option with only a couple of hot selections
288326,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Limited access with a car , Amazing Location with great access to the heart of the city La Ramblas and Gothic area Also this property features a beautiful garden 
288327,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, shower was difficult to operate very modern though lots of knobs for water , location was great desk staff were very helpful room was ready on time extremely clean 
288328,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I think there could be tea and coffee making facilities in the room , The bed was so comfortable and huge I loved the shower with the choice of massaging jets To be able to open the window for fresh air was great Staff were so professional and friendly Nothing was too much trouble Also I loved having a full hairdryer to use 
288329,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was pretty cold and felt a bit moist and humid since it s was on the ground level It was extremely loud since it s close bars Not a place to relax in , The location of the hotel is very good close to the Rambla and many restaurants 
288330,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, For some reason i thought in our apartment we had a kitchenette from the photos i was sent confirming the booking i just wrongly presumed that this part of the room so feel i was slightly led to believe we would have this, the location and rooms were excellent the staff extremely friendly i would highly recommend this place to anyone thank you for making our weekend so amazing 
288331,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I met the worst reception guy ever his name is Mark which prove that sometimes one single silly detail can ruin a hole experience He was really rude and impolite and out of professionalism He asked me to sign another reset when i arrived which is not a normal and my answer was that you already withdraw your money he said to approve that you arrived which doesn t make since because i signed the form of registration And finally i signed because he enforced me by shouting in front of other clients that i have no choice either i sign or i wont have the room although i gave him the option of return my money and i can leave On the other side they are having a problem with their electronic cards of the doors and he kept giving me a rude answers by saying maybe you dont know how to use it while i knew from the bill man that he is giving help 100 times everyday to other clients for the same problem and the manager was really polite and decent and she gave a free breakfast in the end but her answer for my complain was she missed the situation which really not professional but to be honest the other staff were really good and helpful and friendly The issue is you can put your policy and i need to have the option to accept or refuse and finally the way you deal with your clients specially in hospitality , Location view bathrooms breakfast 
288332,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Would prefer a larger bed Not very sound proof rooms , Awesome breakfast with much more variety than most hotels including salmon lots of Spanish charcuterie Nespresso coffee even a healthy corner with smoothies and superfood all to enjoy in a cosy and nicely decorated environment Excellent location walking distance to everything in the heart of Barri Gottic Large room and bathroom Bikes for free great idea 
288333,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Standard and Superior rooms not that big and not much difference when you pay more for Superior , Perfect location for exploring the old town of Barcelona We had an astonishing upgrade to a junior suite which was a magnificent room Breakfast a wide array of Spanish foods and really nicely done Bikes a brilliant idea for exploring 
288334,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, The location was really good the staff were excellent every member of staff was professional friendly very helpful and made my daughters and I feel both safe and welcome The room was very good not too cramped very impressed for a short city break 
288335,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The staff at the reception and bar were not very kind nor helpful The bathroom had a leaking tap which was extremely annoying Water everywhere around the sink and on the floor , Excellent location and very comfortable beds 
288336,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It was a Shame there was no gym or pool This was made up though through their free bike and ipad use , Very central location The staff were always friendly and tended to our needs Room was clean and characterful 
288337,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Great location very friendly helpful staff free hire bikes Cycled around the old town in the park with the parliament then along the coast really enjoyed it Very Cool Hotel really liked it will certainly stay there again when next visiting Barcelona 
288338,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It would be better if they put slippers in the room , Very good central location Just in the heart of Barcelona Near La Rambla shopping streets and old city Very friendly staff especially in restaurant Breakfast nice Very clean rooms 
288339,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Only the first three days the room service only included the beds and bathroom but the rest was at the top , Every thing was perfect and great starting from the staff to the location wifi cleanliness and fast check in and check out in addition to the value for money I would stay in this hotel during my next trip for sure 
288340,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, almost nothing , The location was in the between la ramblas and gothic area People thinks it is museum Breakfast has varietry of delicious food And you can enter the building with card that your room belongs Good for securtiy 
288341,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, This place is so perfectly located right in the heart of the Old Town that youd be happy with anything but it turns out this hotel is really well run very nicely styled and furnished and has a great breakfast room 
288342,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The ac wasn t working properly but my mistake we didn t inform the staff no complimentary bottle of water or tea coffee in the room , Good location just few steps from la ramblas and also metro station Room was clean and spacious staff were so friendly and nice 
288343,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, What actually annoyed us was that we could pretty much hear what was going on in the room in front of ours , The hotel is very well located unbelievably close to the Liceu subway station but we expected a bit more given the price The bathroom was ok and the shower had some interesting features Bed was comfy the room was very clean and the internet worked just fine Staff was pleasent as well 
288344,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Was disappointed that the room was in the courtyard as it rained all weekend got wet going from the bedroom to breakfast Wouldn t stay there again because of this, Room was fine a little small if anything
288345,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, The staff on reception were charming and helpful We arrived early and could check into our room Beds very comfortable Good bathroom with bath tub A few steps off La Rambla but very quiet at night 
288346,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The rooms were not at all fancy but comfortable I would have liked a breakfast included in our price of 800 for 3 nights , We loved the location of this hotel There were actually more beds in the suite than we thought so we had ample space for our family of 6 There was also one full bath plus a half bath which helped out a lot Free bike use was also a plus 
288347,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Fab location couldn t be any better Right in the middle of everything But still fairly quiet for a good nights sleep Great choice of tasty food on the breakfast buffet Really great and friendly service from all of the staff I would definitely recommend this hotel 
288348,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The bathroom in our room was a little dated and the shower leaked badly through the shower door The communal rooms were very quiet perhaps as it was our of season , Great location for a base from which to explore Festively decorated and pleasant 
288349,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No real issues , Friendly and helpful staff Nice welcome at reception Excellent location Very convenient for the Rambla and the Gotic quarter yet just off the hustle and bustle of the Rambla 
288350,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Rooms are a bit small but I it is hard to find larger rooms in the La Rambla area The pricing was a bit too much but it was on the New Year s Eve so it explains it We got single beds that were close to each other But the mattresses were larger than the beds so they often slip aside The cable TV worked only 5 minutes each 10 minutes There was a problem with it The overall look is good but if you look close at the details you will see that it needs some reparations like the ceiling in the bathroom Also the bathroom doors have a 1 2 cm gap on each side Basically you could see and hear everything in the bathroom Not very pleasant , Clean hotel nice staff location on Rambla quiet rooms Would recommend It s way way better then the similar priced hotels near by 
288351,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Could be a little more attentive during room service clean up before check in , Service was excellent and all reception staff attended to our needs almost immediately during our stay 
288352,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Service could be better rooms are extremely small so small that with the windows open you had to crawl over the bed to get from one side of the room to another Same with bathroom huge crappy shower but once the door open the bathroom was just split in half , the location was ideal
288353,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Not being able to adjust the cooling and heating I like the aircon on so the rooms were a little warm for me , The breakfast was very nice Basically a continental with a few hot dishes Very fresh and more aimed at for the Europeans but that was ok 
288354,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing bad to say , Perfect location very clean and near the port Delicious breakfast and a few English channels Staff was friendly and took our bags to hold before our room was ready 
288355,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I would have appreciated a kettle in my room In the elevator it was written that if you needed one you had to ask the reception for it So I did but I got no kettle anyway , A very beautiful hotel located a few steps from the subway right in the middle of everything The Boqueria market Barceloneta the cathedral Barrio Gotico Pedrera and Batll house were just a stone s throw from the hotel you could easily walk there All what was not within walkable distance could easily be reached riding the subway Staff was friendly and talked fluent English Free wi fi was good We were given a bottle and cakes for Christmas Everything was clean
288356,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Just an idea open the charming little breakfast caf into a tapas or just a bar for evening , The little attentions for our pet bed croquettes bowls the staff super friendly helpful and efficient 
288357,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, TV in bedroom did not work and we did ask reception to see if it could be fixed as we were staying with young children but it wasn t Also tap in bathroom leaked When we booked the description stated the room had twin beds double bed and bunk beds However it had twin beds and two sets of bunks which wasn t ideal , Location was excellent Couldn t have been nearer the action However the hotel was still in a quiet little street 
288358,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Bed arrangement not ideal for a family of 5 Bunk beds are in the same room with double bed , Great location Easy access to activities Apartment was clean Staff was excellent Very helpful and welcoming during our stay 
288359,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The beds were really uncomfortable and there was no tea coffee making facilities in the room , The location was in a fantastic location just off the Ramblas The entrance was beautiful and the central garden lovely The breakfast was excellent 
288360,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Bathroom did not have heating Beds pillows could be more comfortable for a 4 star hotel , LOCATION is really really nice Loved the fact that when you inserted card key inside the room a signal outside would light up indicating to staff that room is occupided helps avoid disturbances and embarassing situations Free biycle rentals I think they only have 5 Mifi rentals 5 5 Euros Most hotels do not offer mifi this hotel did which was GREAT for somene like myself visiting Europe Hotel looks lavish when you walk inside Makes a good impression Bathroom comes with a lot of things like razor and razor creame tooth brush Bathroom shower shoots our high presssure water at diff areas 
288361,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, As an American I was not used to having to go outside and through so many twists and turns to get to our room Didn t really negatively impact our stay however , Excellent location very modern and up to date 
288362,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, they could prepare our room on time but we checked in around 4pm which wasnt very acceptable , location was amazing room was very very nice except window didnt close properly so we could hear all the noises coming from the street but still was very nice 
288363,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was worse The shower leaked Staff is not really interested We got a big discount of Booking Com but probably the worst room of this hotel , The location Right in the centre and close to the metro 
288364,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room didn t get cleaned until late afternoon a few times There was some loud repair work going on next door one evening but nobody came to apologise about it in advance We were told that some items were taken from the mini bar even though we didn t touch anything but hotel staff was very good and didn t charge us for it , The location and cleanliness of the hotel were great 
288365,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Overall temperatures in common areas were too hot Couldn t get room temperature cool enough for us and an open window at night was very noisy , Very pretty hotel with attractive exteriors Great location just off la tabla next to metro station 
288366,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was hot and the air conditioned system been shouted down so we struggled to sleep but other than that we liked the place, The location The staff The cleanliness 
288367,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, i complained 3 consecutive days my last day that housekeeping kept getting into my room to clean when i had the do not disturb room on my outside handle ,No Positive
288368,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Cab ride from airport on the way there was about 60 euros I think we got ripped off because on the way back it was only 25 euros But honestly you can take the train to the hotel from the airport The website said iPads in room but it turned out you have to get them from the lobby but it s 1st come 1st serve Same with bikes make sure to get up early Wifi would cut out around 12 at night Also staff would recommend some places to eat but did quick google review and they weren t that good but I guess they were getting a kickback from those places since they gave you a card to show the resturant to get a small discount For the sagrada familia church book early online to save money But make sure it s an official website the hotel staff said a different one didn t really trust it just took a can there and they said no that s not official and pointed to a huge banner outside the church with the correct website , Great location friendly staff everything was clean front desk was 24 7 check was not till latter on and we did not want to walk around with our passports lobby staff put it in the safe in a sealed folder
288369,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The service is so so and the room was too hot on certain days even though it s winter The view is the neighbors living in the next building, Nice place conveniently located
288370,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Didn t get the requested double bed two singles pushed together reluctantly , Lovely clean room with good breakfast in a great location topped with really nice helpful staff
288371,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, There was an accident happened during our stay The door of the bathroom was locked by itself and we cannot open it at about ten at night I went to the reception and a young lady took the issue and told me she would contact the maintenance But we waited for about half an hour and no one came I had to go to the reception desk and found the young lady was not there Then I had to describe the situation again Though the problem was solved next day I was not satisfied with the front office In addition the sound insulation is not that good , Nice location
288372,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, THE BREAKFAST WAS VERY GOOD BUT A BIT EXPENSIVE AT 15 00 PER DAY ONLY HAD IT ONE MORNING , THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH GETTING A TRIPLE ROOM SO WE WERE GIVEN A ONE BEDROOM APPARTMENT AND IT WAS VERY COMFORTABLE 
288373,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Our allotted room was at the front of the hotel above the entrance Stay clear of room 1101 if you want to sleep It was very noisy until 3am and again from 5am As the room was not double glazed we didn t get much sleep However we were able to move rooms next day much better Didn t get any discount though , Excellent location could t have been better fort US Staff were friendly and helpful Whole hotel was clean bright and airy Would definitely go back 
288374,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room I was given was too small I had paid for a king size bed room I had picked to pay a little more than alternatives so I could get a nicer room but it did not turn out that way although I specified arrival time my room was only available at 15 00 I asked for a late check out and the tolerance I was given was only one hour no soap shelf in shower no complimentory drinking water in rooms easy to hear all the noises from the corridor , the staff was extra nice location was great 
288375,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Little bit of noise from the alley next to the courtyard but not a deal braker We were in room 1310 on the third floor Didn t really spend time looking at the courtyard , The hotel was right off Las Ramblas and very convenient to everything It was well lit and we felt very safe in the area The staff spoke English and were very helpful 
288376,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It was very hot in the room and we were here in November Imagine how it is during the summer I would not recommend to go to this hotel during summers Airconditioning is not working properly , The bed was good 
288377,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Shower water went every where One of our showers didn t drain well Could sometimes detect that musky smell that occurs when something doesn t dry well , Rooms were surprisingly spacious and we were very comfortable Staff was extremely helpful about attractions to visit directions etc Portable WiFi at was so helpful and reasonably priced 
288378,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The rooms are really small but probably that is expected in the Old Quarter , The location is absolutely perfect in the Gothic Quarter just a few steps away from the middle of the Rambla You can do a lot of exploring walking and for the attractions that are farther away the metro station is at a 2 min walk 
288379,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Our room was rather simple but clean and comfortable Not even similar to the photo , The best possible location in Barcelona everything is close Friendly and helpful staff 
288380,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The only annoying thing was the extremely heavy scent room perfume in the lobby and room as well I know that this happens in many hotels shops etc nowadays but I really can t stand it , Excellent location fantastic staff
288381,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, tea and coffee maker in the room would would have been nice but there were any amount of cafe bars close by, Staff were very efficient and we were 2 mins from la Rambla
288382,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Honestly the room wasn t cleaned as it should be every morning we leave eatly to come back at night finding dust in the corners and some torn small pieces of paper still the same place they were The toilet is not sterilized accept the day we arrived and shoes where not removed to clean the floor below them Glass cups were exchanged only the 1st day and not with plastic wrap on them so I had to wash before using , I liked most how the staff welcomed us from the moment we arrived and they were extremely helpful and supportive Mariona was super nice and helpful answered our many questions with a great smile and assisted in places to visit with some tips as well offering wifi iPad for our daughter and stroller this is amazing client servicing Iria Joao and Xavier as well were so friendly and supportive assisting with a great spirit making us feel home If we re gonna be back only due to these people 
288383,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Excellent location close 20m to the Ramblas and Metro Liceu yet quiet despite this Comfortable clean and modern interior Staff friendly and helpful 
288384,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The air conditioning in our room was noisy at night and can be improved, Location was extremely convenient it is near all the major attractions and la Rambla yet is not noisy Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with our travel and booking printing out tickets and in my case a report that I need to review
288385,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The shower was not very good because it spills water everywhere but other than this minor detail the hotel was very good , Staff very helpful and kind They speak several languages and are willing to solve anything you may need Location is very good and the room was spacious clean and very comfortable They offer portable wifi to the guests for a very reasonable price They had a nice variety for breakfast 
288386,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Utilities need a serious revision there was water everywhere after using either the sink or the shower They fixed the sink after giving them feedback but we would expect a check before letting guests in especially considering the price Also the strong smell of fried eggs and others in the room was unacceptable for a hotel quoted that high , Great location English speaking reception staff good breakfast 
288387,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room entry card reader wasn t working properly The glass bathroom door Rather small room to 4 , Good location Boqueria market Safebox operated with an own card The breakfast was ritch 
288388,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, We got a lot of troubles so they have to change our rooms 2 times but the staff cristian xavier and cristina were excellent I ll go back definitely 
288389,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The staff were unhelpful and border line rude towards us The room was a bit of a let down The hotel in general was quite loud with many kids running up and down the hall and banging on doors late at night My overall experience was not four star and wouldn t recommend a stay here There are plenty of hotels on Las ramblas Try there first , Location is the only good about this hotel for me 
288390,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Location is a bit noisy at night but that is typical for the district and the hotel cannot do much about it , Location is perfect for exploring just a few steps off the Ramblas Breakfast is delicious Beds are comfortable 
288391,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Hotel was about 20 m walk from Rambla but we heard no noices from there The situation was fantastic for shopping and sightseeing Rooms were clean and spacious we had a family room for three the inner garden was lovely Plumping was typical spanish water did not all go to the right Place but it didn t matter so much Breakfast was not very special but adequate Breakfastroom was beautiful Special thanks for the staff they were all very friendly especially those who had black and grey working trouses on 
288392,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The AC could have been a bit cooler and the fan in the bathroom was not working The breakfast buffet was slightly disappointing , The staff were courteous and polite Location was excellent 
288393,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The suite was at the first floor and was facing the garden and the breakfast outer area Of course a great view but on the other hand if you want to open the curtains to have more light everybody s seeing you and you can not get out of the shower This is not enough private, The location the suite the friendly personnel and of course their cooperation and help for anything needed 
288394,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We complained twice about the shower flooding the bathroom but this was not addressed The bathroom door was frosted glass and it did not close by 2 so we had to use a chair inside the bathroom to wedge it shut Our room overlooked an alleyway and was very noisy throughout the night The breakfast was expensive at 15 euro a head so we walked 5 paces across the alleyway to a cafe which was exceptionally clean serving excellent breakfasts The hotel bar was expensive and empty most nights so there was no atmosphere , The location was perfect for a city break where you could easily walk or catch public transport to all the main attractions The staff were very friendly 
288395,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Location cannot be beat The hotel is older but I found it clean and well maintained The breakfast was predictable something for everyone The staff were friendly and helpful The metro is within 100 There are restaurants and entertainment in the immediate area Best yet it is close to the Boqueria market 
288396,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Room would have benefited from the following Mirror above desk area in bedroom Hooks on back of door to hang coats More coat hangers for our clothes Tea and coffee facilities Extra towels and dressing gowns We expected a little more comfort for a 4 star hotel at over 200 per night for our room We had problems with our safe which meant we had to waste a few hours on our 2nd day and ended up not using it as it still didn t work after being fixed 3 times, Good location staff responded to our needs comfortable bed breakfast was nice
288397,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We requested a room with a garden view however we were put in a room overlooking the street which until the early hours was noisy, The location of the hotel was perfect A good Base to explore the whole city 
288398,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Water from shower would go all over the bathroom and make the floor very slippery , Staff were very helpful always happy to answer our questions Black out curtains were excellent we all got a good nights sleep Shower was lovely 
288399,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Free coffee if wanted during breakfast without eating the large buffet Inner garden Blue lights in our hall Friendly staff Newer room Great shower Comp bikes though we didn t use them No time So close to the market 
288400,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The rooms are small and lack some maintenance You would not expect this in a 4 star hotel There were holes in the bathroom wall for fixation of the towel support in a previous position The shower was leaking in a corner and did not have a closing door so whenever we took a shower the whole floor was wet I told the manager and he said he will send someone to repair but he didn t The lamp in the room and it is not well fixed to the ceiling The room they propose as a family room is very small for 4 people I am sorry to write this because I liked the hotel overall and the position is perfect I would still recommend it , The location is perfect the common area lobby coffee area garden area corridors breakfast area is very nice very clean well decorated The breakfast is wonderful 
288401,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, A kettle might have been nice but I think you could ask for this , Great location and not at all noisy Easy to get to from airport bus and near to lots of restaurants Lovely courtyard 
288402,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The kitchen was not that well equipped with utensils would ask for a quiet room away from the main entrance facing the court yard , 4th time I ve stayed at The Petite Palace great location Stayed in one of the deluxe apartments which was very spacious and slept 8 Would recommend this hotel if you are travelling with children Lovely court yard 
288403,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Great location and very nice and helpful staff We specially like to thank the front desk manager Iria for her kindness Great place to stay in Barcelona 
288404,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, For us nothing But if you are scared of rain its probably 50 m along a pedestrian only street off La Rambla and if your room is in the garden wing there s no under cover access If you need a pool and a gym the staff may be able to get you access but there s none on site , Great location for the experience of life in the contemporary old town of a great european city 200 m from the metro in a cafe bar district with food available 22 hours day and major department stores a gothic cathedral the roman town square opera jazz and the concert hall within 15 minutes walk Staff were friendly helpful and we had no trouble communicating 
288405,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was noisy especially on Sunday morning You could hear the other rooms door closes and the sound of luggage passing the corridor was very loud and disturbing Some of the noise by early house keeping , Breakfast was good room was nice and the location was excellent 
288406,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was just OK for the money the room atrium was worrying and smelly door didn t lock properly and not very clean , Very good location vibrant side of town The room was ok 
288407,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We are very light sleepers snd found the room 206 very noisy There way an electricity switch board on the room which hummed through out the night very annoying An alarm briefly went off twice during the night which lead to a disturbed nights sleep , The location of the hotel was its best benefit offering a haven to return to after a busy day site seeing
288408,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Tub in bathroom was slow draining Had to shower in water up to my ankles Also a little exspensive but thats Barcelona as whole , Great location Mostly friendly staff Super family friendly 
288409,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Rooms are nice not overly spacious The furniture is a bit Ikea ish , Excellent location in the busy Gothic quarter but nonetheless quiet at night Bar and very nice breakfast room no restaurant Pleasant and helpful staff Many many places to eat nearby Three minutes walk from Pla a R al 
288410,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, The staff were really excellent helpful polite and friendly Breakfast was first class and hotel location very central to the Ramblas Gothic quarter Good quality accommodation with comfortable bed great bathroom and super clean 
288411,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Price it needs to be very good at the prices charged Breakfast extra , Excellent location just off La Rambla in the gothic quarter and close to metro Friendly staff Good breakfast buffet Very modern hotel in older building Spacious comfortable rooms Very pleasant courtyard for sitting out Good wifi 
288412,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Purchased breakfast but due to early flight asked for the charge to be removed Clerk said it couldn t be done Did prepare a small take away which we couldn t get past security due to water included so we just pitched it all I would like the 30 charge to be refunded , Spacious room suite and excellent location 
288413,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Despite of do not disturb sign staff stepped in and the next day desperately tried to call while we tried to take a nap , Everything but the do not disturb function 
288414,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Would be nice to have free drinkable water and coffee machine Air conditioning sounded like there war a rocket missile launch However they ve fixed it pretty fast, Nice breakfast Good location in the city center
288415,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The first room we slept in there was a lot of noise coming from the Pub Cheers across from the hotel i asked to moved which happened very smoothly , The location of the hotel to the train station the Rambles and many other tourist attractions 
288416,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Note of caution be careful with your wallet While you are picking out what kind of ice cream to buy they can take your wallet from a zippered pocket , We were upgraded to an apartment which was very nice especially liked having 2 bathrooms This hotel is reasonably close to the port as well as the airport if you are cruising and well situated to get the vibe of the city

288470,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, starting from the arrival at the hotel no guidance was provided on where we should get dropped off as the hotel is in a pedestrian lane The ideal solution would be for the hotel staff to speak with the taxi driver and provide them with the exact drop off location We had to walk 10 mins through lanes to find our way and it was not comfortable for first time visitors with children after having read stories of pick pocketers the check in area et is extremely slow as they are grossly understaffed House keeping is pathetic We were there for 6 nights they did not vaccume the room as sand was there for 2 days after we visited d the beach and the cleaning was sub standard A double bed had a single blanket and the blanket cover was provided separately for us to complete the needful a lot of noise in the room from the outside and light penetrating through the bathroom door they need door stoppers and people tend to bang the doors in the middle of the night which is very disturbing the hotel staff and least helpful in case you need any assistance with any tourist guidance some staff were helpful Christina who did put in an extra effort to help but overall the service experience was sub standard for a hotel rated as high on booking com the breakfast was average but there are a lot of cafes at La Ramblas after repeated complaints they included breakfast in our room package for 3 days but the customer service experience is frustrating when your on a holiday Lastly there is no security at the hotel Anyone can walk in and out of the hotel access the stairways and reach your room No checks and controls in place , The only thing good about this hotel is the location which is right in the centre of La Ramblas

288475,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The air con was pathetic and only worked to a minimal degree Staff said it couldn t be improved Our solution was to leave it on all day whilst we were out as otherwise we returned to a hot room This meant that the light outside the room was on and the maid therefore didn t try and service the room Maybe an old fashioned knock might have been sensible We borrowed the free bikes and within a mile a pedal had fallen off my bike in the middle of a very busy junction We hobbled back but it couldn t be repaired as the mechanic was awol I speak some Spanish so could understand the phone call to try and locate the guy so we did without Another lady saw us and said the same had happened to her the day before and we saw the bike being returned the next day with the same problem Not impressed, The Hotel is a few steps off the Ramblas so is excellent for exploring the oldest parts of Barcelona The room was adequate with quite modern decor and a decent bathroom Nothing special but nice and the location made up for some of the disappointments

288503,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The AC was not effective Also AC was facing the kids bed making the AC blow directly to the kids The main bed was little away from the AC and hence was not getting the enough AC effect Also the bathroom design was the worst I have seen so far in all of my trips there is no shelf for the toileteries making it all wet in a single use of the washbasin There is water everywhere in the bathroom after a shower since there is no door to the shower area , Location and staff are good Located in the heart of La Rambla and very close to Metro it is the best location for tourists Staff were courteous and helpful Rooms are clean and decent 
288504,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The only thing I would add to the rooms would be a full length mirror Otherwise there was nothing I didn t like , Everything about this hotel was wonderful The location was brilliant the rooms were spacious the courtyard was a welcoming haven and the staff were helpful and friendly 
288505,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Some staff were rude First they didnt tell us about the bike rentals until we found out upon check out They refused to give us bathroom slippers saying those are reserved for suites only and they refused to give us a plug since our cables are different than europe s cables until we insisted The room doesn t have a mirror except in the bathroom which is incovenient for two girls on holidays The shower does not have a door or curtain so the place turns into a swimming pool everytime we shower And finally upon check out i was carrying my big wedding dress in its wrapping and we came down leaving our suitcases in the room assuming someone would bring them down like EVERY other hotel in the world The guy at the reception told us we should bring them down ourselves And went back to typing on his computer Then we asked to keep our suitcases in the storage room since our flight was at midnight and they wouldnt extend our checkout past 1 pm He showed us the storage room and it was a disaster There was no way i was keeping my wedding dress in there with our suitcases Then another guy was kind enough to open another room for us and we kept our things there The bar restaurant were we watched the final champions league in tv is too small volume too low All in all i would not recommend this hotel to anyone despite its excellent location The staff need to have more manners with guests , Location was perfect in the middle of everything Hotel was clean So that fullfills the two requirements we look for in hotels
288506,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing , Location is perfect Staff was very nice and helpful We didn t get the room we ordered there was a mix up and it was no longer available However we got a different room that we liked and money back for there was a difference in room prices Amazing service 
288507,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Heavy up sell pressure on check in larger room pre paid meals pre payment for room etc was instant turn off Wanted to turn around walk out Foul odor from restroom plumbing Smelled like sewerage Insufficient supply of towels and wash clothes If you want quiet this is NOT the place for you but noise didn t bother me personally , Good sized room Decent comfort Centralized location to Las Ramblas 
288508,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The hotel safe was a bit troublesome Works on credit card swipe memory not punch in codes Also the breakfast buffet though good was poorly serviced in terms of Nespresso coffee machines running low on food and crunch of people Breakfast staff did a good job trying to keep up with the demands Sometimes line to check in or out was a bit long , The location just off the Ramblas at the mouth of the Gothic Quarter and near La Boqueria market was outstanding A short walk put you on Barcelona s waterfront The Gothic quarter maze was just outside the door Also close to metro lines Best standard doubles are on higher floors facing the garden Internet worked well Rooms are modern Beds very comfortable Bathroom fixtures modern and everything kept clean Also reasonably quiet To get there if you don t have a lot of luggage take the Airport Bus that drops you off at the Plaza Catalunya for about 6 Euro and just roll your luggage down the Ramblas or the sidewalks next to it About a 10 minute walk Calle Boqueria a bit hard to spot Staff were exceptionally friendly 
288509,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No complaints whatever , Lovely breakfast Great choice of food Super comfy beds Super helpful friendly staff Lovely walks through narrow streets and secluded squares where talented inspiring musicians entertain the crowds 
288510,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, the breakfast pooring the towel some times not avaliable the room v dirty the door to the our side was closed discrimination in dealing with us, the location of the hotel great the man how cary the bags was so nice and kind
288511,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The noise other guests were making in the garden which is below the room windows , Very convenient place in the very heart of the centre you can find all bars restaurants and shops just few steps away from the hotel The bathroom is huge and very clean the room itself has a good size comfortable bed and anything you could need The staff is very helpful and quickly responding to any request They even let us check in earlier which was great The window is facing the backyard a really nice garden so no problem of not having a city view 
288512,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It would have been great if the hotel had tea coffee making facilities , This hotel is centrally located to Las Ramblas but was very relaxing and quiet The courtyard area was really nice which was why I booked it however the weather wasn t good enough on our trip The bed was extremely comfortable and a superking size This took up all the room however we had a separate area for wardrobes and a desk area It would have been good if the desk area had a light over it and a full length mirror would have been useful The bathroom was large and the shower was really powerful The hotel was slightly expensive but the facilities and the location were great 
288513,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, You can hear the noise from the corridor and the other doors closing a common problem to many hotels , Great location and quiet room on the inner court of the building The room was nice and reasonably spacious Possibility to take some bicycles from the hotel We didn t get the breakfast in the hotel but there were many places around where to get a coffee and a croissant Free wifi was very appreciated 
288514,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Great staff 18 middle aged man on a stag night will put the fear of God into most people but very helpful and had every thing organised Xavier was very good when we booked in The small but friendly team copied very well all 18 of us where more then pleased with the whole experience
288515,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, room on the walking street are noisy in night time due to the people on the street floor in the bathroom and in the shower is really sleepery when wet be careful , hotel is nice and very near to ramblas the hall is modern styilished and comfortable breakfast area is good the quality of the food is not superb but acceptable wifi works very well and is included 
288516,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The drain in the shower didn t go down properly so the water was always high when you showered Water went down eventually but it wasnt nice to have to stand in it The double bed was two singles put together which kept separating which was quite annoying , Clean and great location 
288517,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No tea coffee facilities in the bedrooms Could replace one of sausage dishes at breakfast with bacon , Excellent location friendly staff comfy beds warm atmosphere Good food
288518,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I m vegetarian and lactose intolerant so I had a bit of an issue with breakfast more vegetable and fruit could be great, the bed and shower were amazing
288519,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Not a 4 star Hotel Breakfast was chaotic There were not enough tables for all guests Breakfast is poor very small food selection not hot food choices Under the 4 expectation We wouldn t class this Hotel as a 4 The pictures on the website of the rooms and hotel garden are misleading Think it is over priced , We liked that it was central for everything museums shops restaurants public transport just around the corner 
288520,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, it is very hard to get to the hotel by car so either by taxi or metro, the location is amazing 2 min from the Bucaria and just in the enterence to the gotic part The hotel it self is amazing we took the 6 person room and it was wide and beautiful breakfast is a bit expensive 15 Euro but very very very good 
288521,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, shower was leaking out of the bath in the morning time no presure in the hot water took 4 night to change double bed to single, the staff is awsome great breakfast best location in the ghotic rambla
288522,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, this hotel has all the good things, The reception manager was a very helpful person I did not meet a more helpful person than him in the whole of Barcelona After a very bitter experience in Catalonia Plaza Catalunya it was a refreshing change Though leaving catalonia plaza at mid night due to their aircon not working was a very painful experience 
288523,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Some drinking water in the room would have been nice, Front of house staff were incredibly helpful nothing was too much trouble Marc was especially helpful 
288524,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Great location lovely hotel with friendly staff and good facilities The bunk beds were great for travelling with teens I wouldn t hesitate to book again or recommend it 
288525,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No sofa to relax on had to sit on beds only three chairs provided for the breakfast bar had trouble drying hair flex not long enough Would take my own next time , Shared apartment with five friends beds very comfy including bunk beds shower and bathroom excellent great value for money staff very pleasant 
288526,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Our room was very loud during night time Breakfast is not a good value for money Coffee is awful and selection of food is fairly poor not well cooked either , Location and cleanliness
288527,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Room location was incredibly noisy from the pub right outside our window but more annoying was that the lock on our door was broken so anytime we wanted to get into our room we needed to wait for a staff member to let us in ,No Positive
288528,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Needed to ask for some essentials There was some cigarette smells which as non smokers we struggled with but staff were supportive and tried to deal with issues The hotel is supposed to be non smoking , Very friendly staff who were always happy to support any questions asked Gave lots of excellent support when asked 
288529,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, If I cud change anything I would have like to have tea and coffee facilities in the room however I know that s not the norm in Spain , It s a lovely hotel in an ideal location with wi fi and a laptop provided in the room the buffet breakfast was better than we d expected and the staff were very helpful and friendly 
288530,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The vieuw of room 1409 maybe cut some top of the three and it will be awesome, The service was perfect And as suprise they give us a bottle of cava and litle present This is our short honeymoon We will choose this hotel absolutly again Thanks to the staff and the beautiful people of Barcelona And the location of the hotel is right in the middle of centrum and still no noise in the room 
288531,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, nothing, perfect location amazingly friendly staff gorgeous breakfast clean comfortable rooms with plenty of space good wifi lovely bathroom and shower
288532,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, i had booked a junior suite for 3 people as we were 3 friends first night was spent on the sofa although it was advertised for 3 people We were brought another single bed the second day after complaining and are told it was clear on the website but it was not clear that 3rd person would have to use a hard sofa as a bed, breakfast not included in booking of junior suite shower gel and moisturiser and stuff not replenished without asking for it although they knew we were 3 women Robes were taken away 2nd day so had to request them 
288533,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, 3 items we have shared with the hotel GM shower design is missing a door and the floor of the tolilette gets messy the hair dryer is very old and the variery of TV channels for sure must improve to have a better variety of global channels especially for kids , It was our first time in this hotel my brother recommend it to us and in general I beleive that it was a great choice Food cleaninless service general condition ventilation and natural freshness of patio breakfast good enough and rooms good size for small kids Location of course is perfect 
288534,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Being a junior suite it accommodated a family of 4 Unfortunately although the description states that the extra 2 beds are sofa beds this leaves you no where to sit other than on your bed I have to say i do not think the single sofabeds were suitable sleeping on The bottom sheet was placed directly on the leather sofa without a topper mattress so it was very hot and sweaty My kids didn t complain but i think for a room of that size a better quality sofa bed is needed I also think a tea coffee making facility should be provided we had a kettle but nothing else , We stayed in the Junior Suite with Terrace as a special treat for my husbands birthday The room was impressively large with tall ceilings with a private outside seated area Due to privacy concerns the hotel constructed tall obscured glass walls to this area rendering it a bit unpleasant to use Apart from that it was clean and the staff were helpful and friendly and the location was perfect 
288535,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Would have been great to have a gym, Staff were amaxing nothing was a problem very helpful Location was the best Great vibe Will come back and highly recommend 
288536,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, There was nothing to dislike, Had problem with room and staff resolved and upgraded me without any fuss rooms were comfy breakfast excellent and staff went above and beyond to help and make our stay pleasant
288537,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I was expecting a nice evening bar which was not available Some staff attitude put me a bit down in terms of service breakfast waitress , Nice and confortable room 
288538,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No kettle in the room would have been a nice touch A bit warm in the room despite turning the heating off and air conditioning on the communal areas were nice and cool Hotel bar wasn t open for two nights , Double superior room was lovely spacious and very clean Bed was enormous and very comfortable Location of room on 4th floor very quiet Housekeeping services very good Good choice of food for breakfast Lovely coffee via Nepresso machine Need to go early as it gets very busy by 9 am 
288539,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Some of the guests talked loudly after midnight when arriving to the hotel , The location is absolutely perfect if you enjoy being right next to La Boqueria market hall and old town 
288540,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Very basic furniture in the bedroom Breakfast was very busy On our first day there were not enough tables and staff cleared our table before we had finished On returning with a second course we found other guests seated there We had a problem in our room on the first morning but there was only a young member of staff on reception and we had to wait until after breakfast to get it sorted and only after we reported it a second time , The room was quiet which we asked for and the bed comfortable Staff were quite friendly Great location 
288541,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The shower was blocked and no one came to fix it while we were there in 3 days Cleaners came at 4 45pm to clean the room Very small bedroom with 4 beds and we had a 12 year old which was not what the photo depicted, Good location for 3 days max
288542,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We asked for a recommendation for a good restaurant similar to restaurants we had visited on previous visits to Barcelona The junior member on reception was helpful but had little knowledge on this matter The senior member of staff could have stepped in at this stage and offered assistance The room was uncomfortably hot in the evenings the fan in the room gave little relief but the issue needs to be addressed , Location was excellent On our final day the manager saw us borrowing courtesy bikes and offered us some tips which was nice The same culture of helpfulness needs to be encouraged among other staff
288543,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Noise So noisy in all rooms no noise insulation at all between rooms doors Bedroom doors being banged through to 6 am by inconsiderate guests Guests congregating in corridors in the middle of the night instead of going to their rooms We had an outside room that had an alley narrow road running alongside it Location It is central to La Rambla and not even on the main road but not a great place at night Hotel room We had a 1st floor outside facing room that was large but didn t have much in the way of natural light due to the buildings the other side of the alley and a large window with the shutters closed due to a garden lift the other side of it We asked to be moved to a higher floor with natural light and was told the hotel was fully booked although we could have been moved to an adapted room for the disabled Had a look online and what a surprise I could have booked a double room for the night so clearly they did have a room to move us to Definitely ask for an internal room As our room was on the outside next to the alley we had the pleasure of prostitutes along the alley outside the room They were eventually being moved on once the police arrived not quite sure why it took so long to move them on but an hour later they were all still there having a heated discussion As the window was as soundproofed as well as the rooms and doors were we may of well have had the window open Ask for internal rooms Hairdryers We had 3 separate rooms booked not one of the hairdryers worked properly if at all actually they were all dangerous so ladies take your own If you want a late check out the charge would be 50 although you can leave your bags with them once you have checked out , Initially though it was a great location central to La Rambla Friends had good sized internal rooms on 3rd floor Breakfast was plentiful 
288544,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Can t fault them great hotel, Staff were great very polite and helpful we were delayed on our flight in to watch the barcalona game so we only had 30 mins to check in and go the game but the hotel booked our tickets for us and taxi so we just made it Even tho we checked out at 12 our flight was not till 8 in evening but they let us stay in the bar and still use wifi I will definitely be staying here again
288545,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, when we arrived we had a room above the street and the noise was very disturbing After we complained at the desk they transferred us to a quiet room above the patio , we loved the location the cleanliness and the staff s smiley and helpful attitude 
288546,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Due to the hotel s location the main entrance is opposite a British style football bar which is up my alley but wouldn t suit every traveller Las Ramblas is well known for being dodgy at all hours with pickpockets and prostitution common I was offered drugs along the route outside the front doors and would recommend fellow tourists to be mindful These facts do not change how I feel about the hotel but need to be taken into consideration , The hotel is an oasis in the Gothic Quarter a minute s walk off Las Ramblas The staff were pleasant to talk to and very helpful The garden area is lovely and a great place to eat breakfast in the morning in the sunshine 
288547,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Service was slow to the room Room was too small There was a big hole in the flooring by the bed No room to sit at the table in the room Curtains and bathroom door let too much light in to get a good nights sleeps, Location was ideal Bathroom and shower were of a high standard
288548,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Our check in receptionist was a little matter of fact and could have been a little friendlier and smile more , Pllows were super soft room bathroom was modern location was ideal and decor of hotel was beautiful Would definitely stay again next time
288549,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Area for breakfast slightly small A bit chaotic when all guest arrive at same time , Very welcoming and helpful staff at reception Very quiet room but no view Very comfortable bed Terrific location seconds from the Ramblas Selection of food for breakfast very good and substantive 
288550,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Breakfast area is kind of crowded during peak hours but offers a wide range of cookies bread eggs cheese etc , Ecellent location quiet rooms and very friendly staff recommandable for a short stay We would definitly book this hotel again 
288551,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The airconditioning unit was not functioning and the room got to hot to sleep Opening the window made it noisy in the room However we stayed for 4 nights and by the 3rd night we were used to the sounds and were able to get a good nights sleep , The friendliness of the staff as well as the location of the hotel to Ramblas 
288552,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Breakfast could be a bit chaotic with inadequate seating after 9am The Bar also wasn t open as often as it should have been , The location of the hotel was excellant it was a great base to explore Barcelona from Staff were generally very good and we loved the central garden layout which helped created a quiet atmosphere despite the hotel being only a stones throw off Las Rambolas 
288553,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Room to front noisy at night Shower flooded bathroom due to inadequate shower screen Inadequate ensuite door, Location Friendly staff Good wifi
288554,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Rooms and view Breakfast Small details to make a stay more comfortable slipper shampo holder in the shower or soap tray next to water basin etc , Location Staff WiFi 
288555,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I didn t like the twin beds but I did really like the location of the room at the back of the garden Very quiet room definitely wouldn t like to stay at the front of the hotel , Location is fantastic right on the edge of the very cool Gothic Quarter 
288556,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing, Staff were very helpful Hotel is located centrally on the rambles Free hire of the bikes were a great bonus as we used them one morning for a trip down to the beach 
288557,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, I had a slow check in process due to only one member if staff trying to manage 20plus people , Great location excellent feel of the place and really nice rooms 
288558,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The first room I had the shower is digital Unfortunately it didn t work They offered to have me shower in the next room which was vacant which I eventually transferred to for the remainder of my stay , The hotel was well maintained and staff was courteous and professional The breakfast was complete with fresh local fruit Room was very spacious and wifi worked in every room Excellent location 
288559,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing, Excellent location in the gothic quarter just off las ramblas and easy stroll to the port Very friendly staff Super clean and the best smelling hotel ive ever stayed in Room comfortable and good shower 
288560,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The en suite had 2 glass walls and was unnervingly close to the bed ie no visual or acoustic privacy whatsoever Not sure if they re all like this but it really really took the romance out of our romantic weekend , Location Amazing buffet breakfast Great little bar around the corner
288561,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing, Location and service was excellent Had beening in Euro Star Marima It did not compare with your hotel Our stay with you was very much better 
288562,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Bar was not always open in the evening but it was Spanish holiday , Fantastic hotel and facilities friendly staff breakfast was outstanding Rooms modern spacious comfortable and clean Excellent value for money excellent location highly reccomend this hotel
288563,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We stayed over the New Year The location was fantastic and first person we encountered at the desk was very helpful We had to pay up front though and then the service went downhill Our shower and bath was completely blocked after the first shower and there was no option to move The bunk bed made a crazy loud and painful squeak that woke up my other 2 friends with any movement at all They fixed the bath on the second day but then it broke again for our third day The bells from the nearby churches also go off regularly and we had to keep windows open as room was extremely hot with no option to control room temp, Location was great Beds were comfortable and room was clean
288564,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The air con heating didn t work in our room and even though it was December the room got uncomfortably hot during the night and there was only a small window to open, The location staff were very helpful very clean lovely hotel
288565,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Couldn t quite get the temperature right in the room The air con was off because it was winter Probably need a better setting just for air flow , The spot was fantastic close to centre of everything 
288566,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing to Lock the toilet from inside never experienced that before Very small room although garden was a very good feature and we had a small balcony with table and chairs Not good if you are looking for a quieter location , Location was excellent if you are looking for shopping and a busy place The area is vibrant and opens late Staff were good specially the porters were very helpful and polite Breakfast variety is good and price is very reasonable Wifi was good as well 
288567,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, There was not much information about the facilities and the staff were not very informative The hotel layout was poor with a grand entrance but we went up to our rooms through a back staircase with a laundry trolley blocking the landing Our room looked out onto a back alley which was very noisy late at night and also early morning emptying bottles The shower screen and wash basin leaked in the bathroom , Great situation just off Las Ramblas Beautiful courtyard at the back of the hotel but this was not made much use of maybe because it was winter Our room was clean and nicely set out and decorated 
288568,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The bathroom had a fowl smell that came from it The bathtub had hair in it when we checked in The bed was extremely uncomfortable you could hear every spring everytime you moved on it The TV had only 4 or 5 channels , Great location close to the Ramblas market area
288569,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room only had heating and the room was super warm Kept window open and had to do a bit of air conditioning myself , Staff helpful Nice Location and good Wi fi
288570,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The bathroom in room 1304 needs a lot of attention mold around the tub water leaks from the tub exhaust fan that was dirty and didn t work , Location is the great for shopping and strolling around Las Ramblas Staff very helpful Excellent wi fi Good breakfast 
288571,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, This hotel was very welcoming and the room was lovely The breakfast was very good You do have to have be careful and have your whit s about you in the Las Ramblas area at night But its a great lively area We would come back to this hotel 100 Went to a lovely Italian restaurant in the square near by recommended by the hotel Cant remember the name might have been Rossini 
288572,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, This is a great hotel just off La Rambla a perfect location and we could walk from the hotel to almost all the major tourist attractions and shops We did not eat in the hotel as we were able to walk to the restaurants tapas bars Walking into the hotel from the hustle and bustle of busy Barcelona City Centre was like walking into a little haven The staff were friendly informative helpful cheerful and really helped to make our stay so enjoyable We would definitely choose this hotel again
288573,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, staff did not understand our needs No heating it will be installed next week We request a double size bed we got 2 twins conected by sheet we requested to change room they put us again in 2 twins bed The first room view was a smally ally could not open the window In one word SHAME, Good location
288574,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, the hotel fasciitis weren t maintain well at all The bathtub tap was broken we couldn t drain the water after use and the jacuzzis jets started and stopped spontaneously The air conditioner wasn t working either just noisy, The reception team were very nice and helpful
288575,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Front office staff need a lesson in customer service Not helpful at all Made a few specific requests with our booking and received none they were not even acknowledged Room amenities are satisfactory but not great for example no tea coffee facilities, Hotel is perfectly situated it s in close range of all the main sites and districts Tonnes of amazing restaurants near by 
288576,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The beds are not really comfortable , Location is amazing right in the middle of Ramblas and Placa Cataluniya The garden area is amazing Loved the breakfast ans the staff were amazing they help you in anything you ask for 
288577,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The staff were down right rude and not at all helpful The decor downstairs could do with some freshening up , The location was excellent The rooms were a decent size
288578,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, breakfast is poor with a very small food selection and almost no hot food choices check in takes AGES we specifically asked for separate beds upon booking and afterwards during check in yet we got a room with a double bed which was inconvenient given we were travelling with a friend When we called reception to clarify the answer was these are two separate beds they are just together D needless to say the beds could not be separated overall definitely not a 4 European hotel 3 max, perfect location just off Ramblas and Gothic quarter with a metro stop 2 mins away
288579,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, No kettle in room Not a great welcome reception Would have appreciated a map of city They were on the front desk by time of check out but too late , Location fantastic Rooms very clean
288580,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Even it is one of the best hotels and expensive one the communications are difficult on english You don t exately know if they really understand what you say when typical answer is si and after that a deeeep silence Simple things can be very complicated , Location and breakfast sortiment
288581,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Hairdryer hardwired in bathroom rather than in bedroom, Excellent breakfast friendly and helpful staff air conditioned room ideal location just off Las Ramblas and 2mins from Metro and Bocqueria Market
288582,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It is inside one of the small streets the taxi couldn t get inside so I had to walk with my luggage to the hotel I didn t find anyone at 7 30 to carry my 5 luggages to the taxi Also I got a room in the first floor and it was very noisy we stay up till midnight till the pub opposite to the hotel is closed ,No Positive
288583,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, It is very expensive for a family to book breakfast for 14 person day It would have been nice if that was included in the price , Everything was okay
288584,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, If you have as much luggage as we did don t ask for the top floor which we did as there is no elevator Got our workout in though Worth the struggle , The room was beautiful and perfect for a family with 2 teenage girls It was so nice to have 2 beautiful bathrooms for those girls to get ready in Great location Loved it there and would stay again
288585,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We only used our credit card in the hotel and it got cloaned while we were away Im not saying it was the hotel as we can t prove how it happened but just put a bit of a downer on the weekend , Location was great right I middle of the Gothic quarter and a minute walk to Ramblas p I would def recommend the bus hop on hop off trips well worth the money X
288586,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, We had a quiet room on the 4th top floor Fantastic location right in the Gothic Quarter Note it s in the pedestrian zone small alleys so cars can t get to it We walked everywhere from there El Raval El Born to the Harbor area and Barcelonetta Not even a minute from La Rambla and a 10 minute walk from Placa Catalunya Nice rooms and walk in shower 
288587,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We wouldn t class this Hotel as a 4 star Rooms were very small and cramped insufficient hanging and drawer space Shower was not up to standard and badly designed After having a shower the whole floor got soaked , Location and central for everything
288588,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, Everything was wonderful The staff was very cordial and the location was perfect The hotel manager was amazing He spent a great deal of time with us 
288589,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, We had a family room up to 4 people for three persons However the room was very tiny We also missed a mirrow above the table It was really difficult to enter the balcony as the door was right beside one bed After our first night the cleaning person took our three towels and replaced them with only two clean towels We had to call to reception as also the bathroom mat and hand towels were forgotten The hotel staff were ok when we asked their help or advices In general I think they were not very professionals not saying hello or good night etc when walking by , Location is excellent near metro and interesting places The breakfast was ok but the restaurant was really noisy 
288590,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The room was rather well used bathroom fittings were broken and the shower didn t work properly The room had a safe that could have been very useful but for reasons beyond me it wasn t bolted down and could simply be carried away , The location was excellent and the staff pleasant 
288591,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, terribel welcome by unprofessional staff our confirmed booking would not give us a room from start much aruging with staff no explanation no excuse much fuss and we tried to find antother hotel ourselves we were discriminated compared to other guests who came after us and got their room finallay we got an apartment but no possibilities to take the heavy luggage in an elevator no possibillity to get a cup of coffe before leaving unfriendly manager bad service we expected an excuse and an explanation but we got none , maybe the location

288593,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden,No Negative, The room we had was nice because we paid to have a suit The breakfast not worth having at Hotel better restaurant opposite that do nice English breakfast the pictures on the website of hotel garden and other public rooms are misleading not that nice to the naked eye would only rate it a 3star not a 4 star so think it is over priced
288594,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Nothing not to like , The location of this hotel was perfect and the facilities were utterly charming The room had all the necessary components a safe gorgeous bathroom and good lighting The wifi worked perfectly and the breakfast was superb Best of all were the staff They gave us good advice directions and we were able to purchase skip the line tickets right at the front desk

288597,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, That the bunk beds had no sides to stop the child falling off in the middle of the night We had to put one mattress on the floor , We loved the location in terms of where it is in Barcelona and also the fact it is down narrow cobble stoned streets

288600,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Cleanliness wasn t good at all you can see accumulated dust under beds once the maid came to clean the room and there was someone in it she putted new towels and didn t come back to clean when the room was empty and we wasn t sure that towels were changed everyday and we paid some of the amount by credit card and we were surprised that someone took the next day an amount of money from my credit card without my agreement so I was obliged to stop my credit card and to change it when I came back to lebanon , The good location 
288601,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, Unfortunately our room number 1110 was next to a door that went out to a terrace then down to the outside eating area All night people were using this door and just letting it slam shut We were woken numerous times to the door slamming Also we had a lovely jacuzzi bath but no plug so could not use it , Very good location

288608,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, One particular staff Xavier who handled our check in was particularly rough I asked him to lower his voice we were a group of 12 coming in from Los Angeles a long flight and his impatience was palpable When people are in the service industry they need to add on an extra layer of courtesy and respect especially for traveling passengers We are a well traveled family and aware of the European regulations with respect registration His tone demeanor voice nearly yelling was not appreciated I told him twice in a stern voice to lower his voice And his response was to say that was his normal tone of voice Fingernails dirty appearance unkempt were things I also noticed about him That man did not want to be there , The location of the hotel We had previously stayed at this hotel in 2012 and specifically chose it for our return trip because of the location and overall appeal In 2012 we took 3 rooms in July 2015 we took 4 rooms 
288609,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, The hotel safe was a pain to use and the WiFi was horrible Worse was the state of the room The floors are laminate and mine had a large patch with a hole in it I complained but the staff didn t seem to see why this was a problem They offered me some chance of moving sometime the next day , The best thing about this hotel is the location It s extremely close to the metro and a number of the sites Also there is a walking tour that stops nearby that s quite nice Also they have a very reasonably priced breakfast buffet that opens rather early by Spanish standards As for the staff I would say that they were uneven Some were nice and could suggest restaurants and tours others didn t seem to understand why holes in the floors are a problem to be clear not to the point of seeing through to the next floor but to the point that damage had clearly been done and other parts had what appeared to be burn marks 
288610,Petit Palace Boqueria Garden, staffs have a temper and they get overwhelming easily and the beds were really bad as they dumped them on a the floor in one room and the other on a sheet of wood which make them slide easily Elevator and location of the room on the second trip was awful while the first one was OK staff by name Alma and Angel were not helpful , Location is great very accessible to almost everywhere in the center of the city
