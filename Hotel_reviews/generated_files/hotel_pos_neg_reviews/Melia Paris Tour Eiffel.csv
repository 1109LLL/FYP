159941,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, I arrived at the Hotel at 9am after a very long flight total of 13 hrs and had to wait till 2pm to get my room , I like the location also the staff were very nice and helpful 
159942,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel,No Negative, The room was a good size with a good sized bathroom and good shower in the bath It was walking distance to the Eiffel tower the Champs Elysees and the Notre Dame cathedral Close access to the metro and a supermarket fairly close 
159943,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, Was too warm in the room Tried to turn on the conditioner climate control but got only warm air Unfortunately couldn t get fresh air as there is only a door to the balcony that can be opened only completely which is not a good idea if you are leaving the room and going to the city , Great location of the hotel with very friendly staff at the reception Luckily there were umbrellas provided by the hotel It was raining during all days of my stay 
159944,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, Not very charming hotel with somewhat old fashioned interior Ok for a night but nothing to spend more time at , Very central location clean all advantages of a chain hotel 
159945,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, The room was stuffy but I didn t feel safe to open the balcony door as the balcony is one for all the adjacent rooms on the floor without any partitions The bed was rather uncomfortable , The room was clean and the bathroom contained all the necessary amenities
159946,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, Poor pressure in the shower and a very shabby shower head Takes a century to wash your hair Always a problem to catch the elevator Even if you are lucky enough for it to stop at your floor it s going to be full full in this case is 2 people and a bag and with no room for you to enter Definitely have to do something about this , Location right next to avenue Montaigne Nice breakfast We had a prime roomon the 6th floor with amenities and bathrobes and slippers So I guess everything was fine Our friend on the 5th floor however had a regular single and did not get even the simplest amenities not speaking about a bathrobe But what you gonna do the location sells itseft 
159947,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, Just the heater is not working properly sometimes p, Safety location and valuable price Also the reception guy staffs r very helpful and nice e g Miguel Thx for the service and we will try this hotel one day if we visit Paris again 
159948,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, Overall our experience was excellent but the matrass was old and lumpy and although the staff was very concerned and friendly essentially it was changed for another matrass that had the same problem As a back sufferer that was seriously problematic Also the first two days of our stay there was no internet which nobody seemed to be able to do anything about , Excellent location very friendly and helpful staff room was above expectation 
159949,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, computer in lounge not really working and printer broken annoying for checkin in or printing out concert fight tickets but receptionist was very helpful and solved the problem Nevthelss for the price the hotel could afford a new computer with a better software etc, beds and pillows very comfy and staff is so friendly and helpful really lovely people location is excellent i always go to this hotel when i travel to paris for a concert at the theatre de champs elysees because the hotel is almost opposite 
159950,Melia Paris Tour Eiffel, International News Channels such as CNN and BBC didn t work Couldn t find Euronews either The electronic door lock froze and I had to rush for a meeting that morning The Housekeeper solved it with her Masterkey I had breakfast at 8 30am and the bacon tray was empty and not replensihed and too little scrambled egg was left and hardened already , Staff is great the location is perfect the room comfort is great and the breakfast IS as usual great EXCEPT no bacon and little hardENED scambled egg Juices breads cold cuts fresh fruits cerials milk sausages butter jams honey etc are fantastic and tasty Coffee is also great Good choice of international newspapers too English French
