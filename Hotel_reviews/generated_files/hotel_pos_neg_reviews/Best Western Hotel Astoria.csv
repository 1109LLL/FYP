495945,Best Western Hotel Astoria, The rooms a smaller than usual 4 hotels , All the staff were really helpful and friendly It s a 10 minute walk to the San Siro Hippodrome which was the reason I booked it 
495946,Best Western Hotel Astoria,No Negative, The hotel is at a 10 min walking distance from the M1 line which goes straight to the Dome The surroundings are perfectly safe It was beautiful even at the end of April we had some nice weather around 20 degrees The subway stations are very short so even if you have 7 stations to the Dome you will only travel between 15 to 20 mins with the subway waiting time included Also you can walk between a lot of the Milan attractions distances are quite ok All in all it was a very pleasant stay and experience 
495947,Best Western Hotel Astoria, Small shower cubicle and I am a petite person , Tha staff were all very friendly and spoke sufficient English to make communication very easy especially Andrea and Angela The rooms were very clean with toiletries supplied and tea and coffee making in the room Comfortable bed Supermarkets and Lotto train station very close I highly recommend the Best Western Astoria I will stay again 
495948,Best Western Hotel Astoria, , Location Easy access to metro station walking distance 15min to San Siro stadium and wide range of restaurants Nearby parking garage Patient and helpful staff Clean room 
495949,Best Western Hotel Astoria, Upon arrival I was informed that the bank card I had used to reserve my booking didn t have enough money on it They could have told me this much earlier so that I might trasfer money into that account or prepare cash But they didn t So be prepared to pay up front in cash at least part of the cost Otherwise you won t be able to check in And don t expect them to warn you about any problem they will save it as a surprise for when you check in When I tried to change my dates via the booking com website it wouldn t allow me Instead I had to contact the property When I checked in my bill contained the old dates and a larger overall cost We eventually sorted it out and I only had to pay for the nights I had requested But the final invoice contains a lot of scribbling and handwritten editing very unprofessional Check the invoice they give you and if it contains any unoffcial editing ask for another one The sound proofing needs improvement , The room was clean comfortable and had a thermostat that worked fine The breakfast food was good healthy and diverse The staff never grumbled if I showed up towards the end and stayed right until the end of the official interval The staff were friendly and spoke English very well They were willing to help me with any query and call a taxi upon request The location is good within 15 min of the Milano Congress center MiCo great for symposia and congresses It s also relatively close to a metro station Amendola The neighbourhood feels pretty safe The wi fi works well There s a private bath laundry service an elevator and a tea making appliance The window blinds are operated by a switch by the bed I d never seen this before it s pretty cool you don t have to get out of bed to close the blinds There s a supermarket around the corner as well as a take away pizza place They also have the option of rooms service which I haven t tried The hotel guests get discounts in a few local expensive restaurants The hotel design is quite modern and pleasant Overall very good value for money
