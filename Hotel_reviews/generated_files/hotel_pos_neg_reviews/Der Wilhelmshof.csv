359063,Der Wilhelmshof, Iron and ironing board are in a room behind reception rather than having a few available from housekeeping so you can iron in the room Challenging when you ve been on the road for a few weeks and need to iron a few things for a conference , Funky fun hotel with great art decorated rooms in a gentrifying area of the city Mid way between the old city and the conference centre I had to get to most days but close to a major metro and train station so getting about was very easy Great range of food for breakfast and really friendly and attentive staff In a less touristy part of the city so we saw a bit more of the gritty side of Vienna no bad thing at all 
359064,Der Wilhelmshof, Only one iron for the whole hotel which was located off reception wasn t ideal with given the hotel was busy for a conference , Great location by transport links friendly staff
359065,Der Wilhelmshof, Only slight downside was we were in a room for four adults and although the room was lovely as was the bathroom the bathroom door was opaque for the central section with clear glass top and bottom offering the rest of the room a view of your legs and feet whilst using the toilet Area surrounding the hotel on first impression looked rather suspect and indeed it was rather run down but as it was only a short walk to the metro this didnt prove to be a problem , Very good and informative reception staff Hotel quirky and beautifully designed Absolutely first class breakfast excellent choice of superb quality food lovely coffee Would thoroughly recommend this fabulous hotel for its closeness to the metro only one stop to the centre its unique and tasteful decoration its delightful garden helpful and friendly staff and most of all its first class breakfast 
359066,Der Wilhelmshof, Breakfast definitely needs some upping , We had a lovely 2 day stay at Der Wihelmshof Check In was a little slow and they charged us 30 euros for an early check in Extra money for a few hours early check in is a strange concept for us but maybe that how things work in this part of the world The reception is small dark and could use a warmer facelift The staff are all very helpful and smart The room was a pleasant surprise Spacious enough and clean Immaculate linens and very comfortable beds The bathroom was big contemporary and extremely convenient Stocked with generous portions of the shampoo body wash and lotion I am a cleanliness freak and couldn t find one thing I could fault Having travelled mostly in Asia and Americas it always surprises me when not even one complimentary bottle of water is provided in the hotel But again that s just Europe I suppose Breakfast was average nothing great really Eaten better breakfast buffets Could use more variety and hot options Walking distance from the main metro station easy access via metro to all attractions 
359067,Der Wilhelmshof,No Negative, Good location metro stations and e g fun park close by friendly personnel and good breakfast We are a family of 5 and could fit well to the room which was nice clean and quiet 
359068,Der Wilhelmshof, The AC in our room did not work properly It was super hot at night time Feels like in a sauna We could not sleep well We did not enjoy our 3 nights stay because of that We tried to tell the management on the 1st night but they said there s nothing they could do We didn t open any window because the receptionist said the AC won t work well if the window were open Hoping that the AC will work apparently it s not , We love the breakfast The best part about this hotel is the breakfast Wonderful staff and great food to start your day in Vienna 
359069,Der Wilhelmshof, the Airco was out of order for 2 days 34 C outside temperature so the room was not nice to come back to after a day s work , Spacious room The hotel offered us a reduction and some free drinks to compensate for the malfunctioning airco Very close to railway station Very close to Austrian Standards Institute ASI 
359070,Der Wilhelmshof,No Negative, Very good size bedroom and bathroom Close to the U1 underground safe and very frequent service 4 minutes longest wait cost for 72 hour pass 16 50 Euros each 
359071,Der Wilhelmshof, There really was nothing I could find fault with I would definitely stay here again , Our room was perfect The bed super comfy I wanted to bring home my pillows they were soft as a cloud The breakfast is wide and varied and excellent Only thing missing was toast it s an Irish thing 
359072,Der Wilhelmshof, We found the room a little too warm even with the A C because of the quilts We should have asked for a sheet Outside temperatures were 30C at this time of year It was just a little too far from the city We did a lot of walking We are fit and expect to walk a lot in any city but the hotel location gave us more than we expected , The desk staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was very good good staff there too We loved the city Great food and beautiful architecture very clean 
359073,Der Wilhelmshof, Air conditioning was poor in bathroom and one bedroom No mirror above sink where toilet was You Would have liked coffee in room , Breakfast was great Enjoyed it every morning Beds were very comfortable Shower was great 
359074,Der Wilhelmshof, Not the best neighborhood a bit far from the city center, Very beautiful hotel Friendly staff Perfect for families Good breakfast with the possibility to get some gluten free bread 
359075,Der Wilhelmshof, Only thing was WiFi was a bit slow at times really not a big deal for us though could be for someone who has a lot of work to do , So the property was very nice From the breakfast bar which was extensive to the staff that could not be more helpful there was no bad at this hotel The location was nice near one of the main train stations taxi stands restaurants and was 10 minutes to down town and 20 minutes to the airport The beds were overwhelmingly comfortable and relaxing I particularly liked the funky art work and style and a top notch bar and patio that stays open late on site wasn t a bad thing either Overall I thought the price of the hotel was an incredible deal for Vienna and highly recommend it to anyone looking for comfortable accommodations 
359076,Der Wilhelmshof, Wifi was not too fast in the room but worked OK , The hotel room was quite large clean with and perfectly maintained It had all the amenities I needed Including a kettle Large desk Close to Praterstern metro station 
359077,Der Wilhelmshof, I stayed at the first floor where some renovation works were going on Actually I was hoping to have a renovated room but when I compared with the pictures at booking com my room seemed to be old fashioned and not so fresh so be careful what type of room you book Water was coming out every time I had a shower I found wifi not to be stable enough many interruptions as working at nights Again another hotel with no ventilation at all at breakfast room so be prepared that your suit will smell the whole day bacon and eggs , This was the first time at Der Wilhelmshof I booked here because of the overall rating and the nice pictures at booking com and the proximity to public transportation Praterstern train metro bus and tram station is just 5 minutes walking time and the city center or the Vienna International Center is just a few metro stops away Also from Praterstern there is a direct train link to the airport in 20 25 minutes Staff very friendly and very nice breakfast I liked very much the bread variety 
359078,Der Wilhelmshof,No Negative, Excellent hotel even if a bit far from the center two metro lines within walking distance though Fantastic bed very comfy Good breakfast selection A kettle to make coffee tea in your room is a nice addition

359080,Der Wilhelmshof, We got a feeling of greed from the hotel no extra pillows no supply of tissue paper when empty had to ask for new towel , Location public transportation easy nice rooms 
359081,Der Wilhelmshof, The Wi Fi on the 4th floor was rather spotty and tended to kick out more frequently than I would have liked It was usually resolved after disconnecting and reconnecting every so often but it made using the laptop just more cumbersome than strictly necessary , We were awed by their attention to detail uniqueness of each room tastefulness of decoration and above all their 100 dedication to sustainability For example the hotel generates a huge percentage of their electricity through solar panels in downtown Vienna no less Every bite of food is organic and locally sourced or produced in house Strictly Fair Trade Tea and coffee are even imported by a CO2 emission free sail ship http fairtransport eu ships tres hombres Staff was very attentive at all times from early mornings to late at night and unwavering accommodating It goes to show that you can successfully operate a business and be environmentally conscious and maintain a good relationship with your staff and guests Great example and impressive 
359082,Der Wilhelmshof, It was difficult to adjust the water temperature in the shower but we were too busy to ask for help , Room was good sized and very comfortable Great breakfast spread with fruit eggs charcuterie etc

359086,Der Wilhelmshof, The bed to me was a little hard but i find that with all hotel beds There was only one pillow which was quite flat , The hotel was beautiful service was great rooms were beautiful and clean food was very good Very close to the public transport Restaurants in Vienna are very good their is a lovely Italian just down the road from the hotel reception told us about it Food is generally reasonably priced Very good city break

359092,Der Wilhelmshof, 1 A bit expensive for what it is 2 Our room gave onto the inside courtyard where people go to smoke and it was very noisy 3 The d cor is simply ugly there is no other word for it Big swirls of yellow orange and purple It looks dated and cheap The room numbers penciled on the wall How could you , 1 Excellent breakfast wide variety of choice and good quality 2 Good location near the Prater and 2 metro stations from the centre 3 Very very very helpful and kind staff

359098,Der Wilhelmshof,No Negative, Nice hotel It is not fully renovated and you can see this from carpets in the rooms and old elevator Nice lobby small one and nice breakfast but with short of staff Some staff very friendly and some other specifically one lady in the breakfast almost rude In order to go to the city Centre you need underground that it is not preferable In general I am satisfy If I go again I will book a hotel closer to the Centre walking distance 
359099,Der Wilhelmshof, WiFi was bit too slow sometimes was no internet connection at all No restaurant for lunch or dinner but the staff is ready to recommend nice places in the vicinity, Very comfortable big and quiet room for the three of us For a change the folding extra bed is huge not the usual tiny couch we are used to and even when it is open there is a large space in the room Very nice own branded toiletries Great breakfast the hotel s own branded jams are fascinating we especially liked the raspberry one yummy If you like them you can even buy some and take it home with you Location is very convenient just around the corners you find 2 U bahn stations and the Prater is in a very comfortable walking distance Extra nice staff feels like home

359103,Der Wilhelmshof, Location wasn t as central as desired more reaidential in a neighborhood 2 subway stops from the city center No room service smelly pillows and lack of variety of bath amenities made it feel cheap , The included breakfast buffet had a nice selection Mini bar prices weren t over the top 
359104,Der Wilhelmshof, Beds were a distance from bathroom so unless you disturbed other person by putting light on it was a trek in the pitch black, Terrace area Comprehensive breakfast with plenty to choose from
359105,Der Wilhelmshof, Just the elevator was a bit too small for so many guests but that wasn t really a problem The location is not exactly perfect not a very beautiful place but the underground station is near so it s pretty practical anyways , A very good hotel Not exceptional but very good Helpful staff comfortable rooms with satisfactory size good breakfast and the location is practical near two underground stations which take you everywhere
