253051,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Came back at 5 and told room had been overlooked and not serviced After long day on our feet expected clean room to come back to Perhaps if rooms could be serviced by 2pm that would be great , Loved everything Although very busy a safe environment Helpful pleasant staff Great vibe Cafe staff in am very helpful 
253052,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bed was rather soft the view wasn t spectacular but everything positive evened those things out for us On the weekend evenings there s a party going on in the lobby which didnt t bother us but still would have been nice to know in advance , Super friendly staff very quick to help with anything Nice complimentary breakfast at the room every morning In the whole room hotel it felt like it was thought through in design writing atmosphere and facilities 
253053,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The only thing I could fault would be that the room was too hot and no air con however we did stay on a really hot day , Room was nice and clean breakfast was a lovely touch 
253054,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing I want to live there , Crispy white linen spotless bathroom cute tea station wifi radio TV fantastic air conditioning made this a very cool cool hotel Lovely boxed birthday balloon made was a really nice personal touch Nothing was too much trouble staff were incredibly friendly it looks like a nice place to work 
253055,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Bluetooth speaker would have been nice and a savoury option for breakfast bag but these are very small negatives, Location feel atmosphere look comfortable beds design unique but welcoming
253056,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The location is great friendly staff nice area close to brick lane many good restaurants in the area close to old street station northern line 
253057,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Fabulous communal spaces which are buzzing and lively friendly and welcoming staff excellent design details throughout which are super stylish but emphasis on comfy and cool not fussy Bed SUPER comfy Nice touches and sense of humour Homely and loungy in a very cool way Not pretentious just well done Superb avacado poached egg toast for the morning after a lovely wake up fresh juice yoghurt and banana at your door Well done guys consistently satisfied 
253058,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing I didn t like I just wish they had a pool , Great hotel helpful staff convenient location I will come back often Plus they leave a lovely free breakfast bag at your door every morning It includes a fresh orange juice a granola and a banana 
253059,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I was charged for over 80 of drinks that were not mine as the fracture between the hotel bar separate company and hotel reception I complained but after waiting for over 20 minutes to have the issue resolved I had to leave for fear of missing my train , Location Decor
253060,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Didn t have an Iron in the room , The hotel lobby bar was always busy and lively but when you went to the room you had peace and quiet This gave a nice best of both worlds situation The location is excellent as well the tube is a short walk and there is a great selection of bars nearby 
253061,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I called afterwards as I didn t receive my receipt by email took me ages on hold for 15 mins to get through to anyone and still have not received the email with the invoice ,No Positive
253062,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Glass bathroom door made sharing room with a colleague a bit well more intimate than either of us were comfortable with , Lively atmosphere great coffee great food 
253063,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The drinks are very expensive Some level of parking facilities would be good but probably very impractical for the location , The atmosphere all over the hotel is great As is the bar area The shower is amazing The breakfast bag is a nice touch 
253064,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Bfast needs a gluten free alternative, Liked lack of wastecw regard to shampoos etc large containers good Staff excellent location great and terrible I gave friebds all overcand traffic is terrible therefore hours in cabs ubers or metro
253065,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I would have liked a dressing gown , The rooms like the rest of this hotel are beautifully designed the bed was comfortable with crisp cotton sheets All the staff were friendly and we just generally enjoyed the ambience The breakfast was also excellent 
253066,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Couldn t get checked in at 2pm which we were advised by reception staff was the time we could check in We arrived at 1 30pm and didn t get into our room until 3 35pm , Hotel was fab room was great lots going on within hotel 
253067,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The hotel restaurant staff were very poor and unattentive I waited over 10 minutes to be acknowledged I had to ask for my drinks after my meal had been served the wrong drinks were brought out without even an apology they did not once check back on me throughout the meal and I than had to ask for my bill and than waited another 10 minutes to receive it Very average service which is chalk and cheese to the service I received at the Hoxton in Amsterdam , The facility is very funky cool with a great industrial vibe 
253068,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Misleading room description led me to think it was a better bigger room terminology on booking doesn t match the Hoxton website Booking said it was a discounted deal but was actually 10 more than on the hotels own website Early check in wasn t possible but only found out on arrival Asked for a room on a higher floor but when we got back at 22 30 we were given a 1st floor room Asked if the restaurant was still open and excited it was dropped bags off came down only to be told it was closed Told no room service asked how we could get food only to be given a dominoes menu Mattress on the bed was soft thin the bed squeaked with every turn in the night Really was a stay of style over substance wouldn t stay in a cosy double again , Cool style nice bar
253069,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Air con kept turning itself off , Late checkout available on the day that you checkout for only 5 an hour which is an excellent service Room service very quick 
253070,The Hoxton Shoreditch, It was loud at night I could hear people opening and closing the doors, Great atmosphere and the price was incredible Rooms were clean and cute Loved the shower and the smell of the toiletries
253071,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bathroom itself was very clean but the bathroom door was filthy It was impossible to get a night cap at the hotel as it s more like a nightclub downstairs on a Saturday night , The bedroom was well designed quiet and comfortable 
253072,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Staff were rude and came up to us to say that we needed to leave it turned out that one disgruntled person didn t like how we were queueing at the bar Once we told them we were paying guests at the hotel and also explained that we d been ideal guests they were apologetic of course but it took the shine off a good evening and I don t recommend others go there if they are from ethnic minorities , Great vibe the bar is a great place to head to for an evening in London
253073,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Difficult to gain entry to the hotel late at night Didn t seem to be any provision for guests to be treated differently to the other customers in the bar area ,No Positive
253074,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I would like to suggest if there is one more option for breakfast other than yogurt some people may feel not well after having yogurt or milk The cushion in the room is little bit dirty , Idea of simple breakfast is good 
253075,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Although the majority of staff were polite the morning food team weren t fantastic One girl in the morning was a little abrupt almost ordering us to our seats rather than politely informing us that they preferred to offer table service The serving staff forgot my colleague s breakfast and when he went up to find out where is was was told to sit back down or words to that effect This was eventually rectified I should point out at this point that we did go to a till with bakery goods on show to place our order We were not just aimless milling about , An exceptionally Hipster hotel The interior design was fantastic and we loved the bar reception area where we met friends in the evening The fireplaces really added to the atmosphere of the hotel The rooms themselves were comfortable and functional but most importantly quiet I was only based on the second floor and was not disturbed by the music downstairs in the slightest The bar and reception staff were brilliant friendly and welcoming as were the door staff in the evening A quick flash of the room card to show that you re a guest is also a fantastic power trip when there are people waiting to get into the bar in the evening 
253076,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The only downside was the noise from bar on ground floor I stayed on second floor and the noise continued throughout the night into the early hours of the morning , The hotel was in every way superb very trendy Reception area doubled as a cafe and bar which was always busy The rooms were glorious lovely beds light breakfast included shower facilities were lovely Couldn t fault the room at all 
253077,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, I LOVED this hotel We walked in on a Monday afternoon and the lobby felt like a busy Starbucks on a Sunday times 10 People everywhere drinking coffee and tea and working on their Macs Loved the energy feel right away As I was a bit off on my sleep time ended up down in the lobby at 3am to do a little work I asked the desk clerk if there was any chance I could get a coffee and he went and made me one told him he was my new bff staff friendly excellent thorough and accommodating I would go back here just to hang out In fact had dinner last night with some people I met there 2 weeks ago Highest Marks really great hotel 
253078,The Hoxton Shoreditch, We stayed on a Thursday night and they had a DJ in the lobby The music went until about 3am wish we hadn t been on the 2nd floor , We loved the hotel design the room was beautiful and the bed was extra comfortable The lobby was always busy and we ate at the hoxton grille and loved it 
253079,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The room was slightly run down with scratches in the paint The hotel was a little noisy from people in the corridor so not the best option for a light sleeper , Super fluffy thick towels big TV and a comfortable bed 
253080,The Hoxton Shoreditch, All good this time, Always a pleasure to stay here The rooms are great very nicely designed and don t have any of that hotel feel that seems to be almost inescapable in many big cities 
253081,The Hoxton Shoreditch, When we booked we selected to have a quiet room however our room was on the first floor facing the busy road outside which made it rather noisy with the windows open The room was also above the foyer area where there is a restaurant and bar which had a DJ playing and therefore revellers outside the hotel smoking and socialising until quite late We ate lunch at the Hoxton Grill downstairs however the chicken breast was rather gristly with several pieces of bone This was brought to the attention of the waitress but no action was taken or apology made , This is a very stylish and well thought out hotel in a vibrant part of London with lots to see and do and great transport links The room was great with lots of little features that give it a wonderful sense of identity and the inclusion of a Roberts DAB Bluetooth speaker was great as we aren t really TV people The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also excellent with good quality toiletries available 
253082,The Hoxton Shoreditch, All good, Very alternative and modern Chesterfield style couch Little add ons which made it great Free yogurt and fruit digital radio books Well done Hoxton 
253083,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Shower did not heat up very well tepid at best and toilet flush was poor in the bathroom , Fixtures and fittings were of a high standard and the room felt spacious although was smaller than other hotels of a similar price point Loved the mugs in the room rather than the tiny pointless cups you normally get Loved the idea of the breakfast bags too 
253084,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Loved the room comfy bed adequate size not big but you don t exactly need lots of space in a hotel room there was enough room for a desk and an arm chair and space to move around I loved that you could borrow a bike for free there was proper milk for your free tea and coffee and a small breakfast in the room was also free These little things when many other hotels seem to charge extra for every little hints these days Restaurant was great too and the communal areas really great 
253085,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I don t like the way people will come in and use the hotels facilities stay there all day take up all the seating not order anything and make it difficult for hotel guests to enjoy their surroundings as there is nowhere for them to sit I believe there should me a minimum spend for non hotel guests , The reception staff are so lovely and accommodating never had a bad experience in all the times i have stayed here 
253086,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I would ve given a higher rating but the staff and customer service leaves a lot to be desired with 1 2 exceptions who were responsive helpful I rarely put in requests when I travel but it so happened that I needed to carry a number of bulky items so I requested for a paper bag to hold them The staff completely forgot my request and had to follow up 3 times in a span of 1 hour to check on the status only to be told they didn t have it in the end During another instance I requested to borrow a pair of scissors and they forgot my request Fed up after 30 minutes I had to go down the front desk to get it myself only to be told they were too busy to bring it to my room , Walking distance to the tube and vibrant surroundings around Shoreditch Hip happening hotel it gets loud at night and the lobby gets really packed on weekends I didn t mind these at all but it may not be to other people s liking if you re looking for some peace quiet 
253087,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The Hoxton is in a great location in East London mere minutes from great cocktail bars restaurants and small art galleries an easy walk to Liverpool Station to get to the centre of the city and only a 20 minutes stroll to the Thames and London Bridge The rooms are small but comfortable and just right for a short stay The lobby bar has a nice buzz cushiony seats by the fire and friendly staff We d certainly stay here again 
253088,The Hoxton Shoreditch, In the room above someone was scraping a chair across the floor at intervals through the night very loud so disturbed sleep, Always really like the breakfast bag feels like Santa has been 
253089,The Hoxton Shoreditch, We had a room which joined onto next door and you could hear everything through it which didn t make for a good night s sleep , Great location and excellent restaurant 
253090,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Could fault the hotel, great personal touch from reception and Hoxton hotel staff to leave a small bottle of red wine and card in the room as it was my girlfriends bday 
253091,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The cleaners in the morning were talking really loudly in the hall way and it woke me up Would be better if they can keep the voice low , Everything is good 
253092,The Hoxton Shoreditch, restaurant lobby always overcrowded impossible to get a seat , the hotel is a place to be in east london hip design and cool visitors highly recommended for young urban travelers 
253093,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Problems with the AC the first night gave a bad sleep This was fixed the second night, We loved the neighbourhood Good restaurants and busy nightlife Fun place to stay The hotel had everything we needed including free breakfast snack delivered to the room 
253094,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The restaurant at breakfast The scrambled eggs were a bit rubbery We ordered extra toast and had to wait ages for it even after a polite reminder , The staff were very polite and helpful The room was a last minute booking so we did not pay full price I don t think I would have been quite so happy if I had 
253095,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar was extremely busy late at night it was a good atmosphere however it was quite rowdy , The whole experience lovely room Very polite staff The food at the Hoxton Grill was great also 
253096,The Hoxton Shoreditch, the pillows weren t great feather pillows always go flat and the foam pillows we asked for were lumpy , The bed the complimentary light breakfast the cool vibe
253097,The Hoxton Shoreditch, This place needs to decide if it s more important to run this place as a hotel catering for the guests or as a nightclub The guests are totally ignored when it comes to being able to have a quiet drink at the bar with friends or colleagues later in the week For example the lounge is totally taken over on Thursday Friday and Saturday night by nightclubbers the place also has a very loud disco jammed packed with party goers It s totally impossible to even get to the bar have a seat or be able to talk to your friends In fact even trying to get into your hotel on a Saturday night is a mission having to queue at the door be scrutinised by burly security personnel only to find once inside that you have to push your way through the crowds of people to get to the lift Even then in your room you can hear the loud music Their Breakfast is a strange system they have nice pastries on display but you can t help yourself Why not have a buffet Instead of having to wait a long time for the waitress to arrive then a longer time for the food Then they want you to pay a service charge , The location was very good plus close to the underground 
253098,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Too many non resident clients in the public areas hogging seating and internet One guy occupying a 3 seat sofa for 2 hours plus using internet access Another drinking her own can of coke also using internet Many residents forced to stand Staff turn a blind eye all to this , Location very convenient and great hotel facilities 
253099,The Hoxton Shoreditch, It took 20min to get served coffee in the morning Waitress couldn t tell us the difference between half and full English breakfast and they forgot my orange juice that I ordered , Bed was amazingly comfy
253100,The Hoxton Shoreditch, only thing missing is a gym weird thing everything in the fridge is complimentary means two small water bottles LOL, Very nice and comfy room good food nice crew
253101,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The look and feel of the hotel is brilliant cannot fault a single thing Rooms are such a highlght and you are greeted with such cleanliness when you enter from the street 
253102,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The reception wouldn t check in my partner and give him key to the room beacuse the reservation was in my name He had e mail with the reservation but was told they need e mail from me We have never come across such a requirement despite beeing frequent travels neither has this been specified at the time of booking In result he had to wait in the lobby until I arrived While we both appreciate extra security the person at the desk dealing with us couldn t sound less helpful ,No Positive
253103,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar was extremely crowded with no where to sit even though it was early on Saturday evening A rather unpleasant atmosphere with too many people who were drunk , The decor was well designed and the facilities were excellent 
253104,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bed was noisy and uncomfortable them pillows are the worst Only half the TVs channels worked , In general the staff was very helpful and polite as a whole the hotel looks great 
253105,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I couldn t fault anything If I was pushed the mattress was a little softer than I like but nothing to sto me staying again, The staff were friendly and helpful Nothing was too much trouble The hotel was busy but we had the full attention of staff at all times
253106,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, This hotel is classy and sophisticated with a modern interior throughout As a staying guest the attention to detail made by the staff was excellent putting the customers needs as their first priority 
253107,The Hoxton Shoreditch, There was an issue on check in where the hotel system hadnt, The room was great and we felt right at home while the food at the restaurant was delicious 
253108,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Leaving on a cold grey rainy morning , As ever The Hoxton was cool cosy welcoming Relaxing vibe from the minute you walk in not in a serene or peaceful kind of way but in a warm easy but professional kind of way Breakfast was just fabulous 
253109,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Breakfast in a bag a croissant alternative or pastry would have been nice Downstairs lobby very crowded in the evening the hotel is the it place to be but nowhere quiet to sit during the day the settees are occupied with laptop users , Bed comfy bathroom excellent tea coffee facilities top notch especially the fresh milk and water 
253110,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Everything was wonderful as always , My go to warm friendly and comfortable hotel in East London which ticks all the boxes for service and location It is my very first choice when travelling to London from Sydney Australia because it is a total package in a dynamic Shoreditch area This was my fourth visit Can t wait to return to The Hoxton family 
253111,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Pillows were too flat couldn t sleep shoulders hurt There was no vanity kit shower cap body lotion cotton buds etc There was no vanity mirror with proper light couldn t see my makeup poor lighting near the mirror Could use some extra storage in the room The little breakfast bag is a great concept however maybe you could have an option where you choose flavored yogurt instead of granola yogurt In general all of this can be fixed the basics are there a bit more extra effort will make it a great hotel , Shower was great Bar and Grill restaurant downstairs was really nice The hotel design in general was cool and modern The little radio in the room is a great idea as well Loved the little breakfast bag idea 
253112,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The card system to get in the lift and room kept playing up and not letting us in the lift or room , The bathroom and corridors were quite unique and very nicely done 
253113,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Tout etait top petit dej inclus a la porte de la chambre tous les matins possibilit de laisser les bagages meme apres le check out pour encore profiter de la journee sans encombrement Lhotel est magnifique et vivant
253114,The Hoxton Shoreditch, It was Christmas and bar very busy lots of groups of drunk people to walk through to reception and getting into the lift Perhaps a one off but wasn t enjoyable walking through by myself, Room was lovely breakfast bag a sweet idea liked the available glassware in the room
253115,The Hoxton Shoreditch, It is an expensive place To pay 5 GBP for a beer at the Hotel lobby is not cheap is it , Great Place to stay Good Food good people and vibrant place 
253116,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Terrible room service Twice I had to call to remind them they forgot to clean my room which had a sign that said clean my room The lobby is nice but gets packed quick w English yuppies and hipsters kind of like Brooklyn , The location in shorditch was fine and close to public transportation and the bar staff and reception were nice
253117,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Two slow slow lifts for the entire hotel One not in service at all , Trendy very popular with young crowd Very helpful staff restaurant upscale American diner which despite the crowd and the noise delivered excellent food Clean comfortable and stylish 
253118,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The restaurant and service was very poor Id brought a friend to try the steak but by only 7 50pm that evening half the menu was sold out , The room was cosy but very small I loved the breakie bag left for us in the morning too 
253119,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The pillow were very flat even with the extra pillows The room was quite dusty There is a lot of noise outside but that goes with the lively location , The room itself was lovely as well as the staff and the location Busy lively place which was great for us The light breakfast is a lovely touch Great location for bars and having fun 
253120,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Small but cosy room in the heart of Shoreditch Great location if you are planning to hit the town Somehow i had accidentally managed to book to rooms but management had no issue with refunding the second that we weren t to use 
253121,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Pillows were a bit on the super soft side and the bed dipped down on the one side , Fresh milk in the room paper bag delivered with your breakfast Location location 
253122,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The only thing I would have liked would have been staying longer , Great hotel in a great location in East London The staff is super friendly and helpful and the coffee and the bar downstairs are great as well 
253123,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Was disappointed with the size and comfort of the room Didn t feel particularly luxurious as per the hotel photos , Breakfast was delicious with a great choice and reasonable prices The bar and restaurant is the highlight of the hotel 
253124,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Staff answering the phone when you are at the desk deal with the customer in front of you before one on the phone, Great location tube station just 3 min walk away
253125,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Double deluxe room was too small awful view room 309 and need some cosmetic refurbishment I didn t feel that the room was worth the money Very poor quality and selection of bathroom cosmetics, Location staff and the bar grill
253126,The Hoxton Shoreditch, There were lots of decorative cushions pillows but not enough sleeping pillows Sheets did not feel particularly high quality and there was some construction remodelling going on that was a little off putting visually Minor niggles though we had a great time , It felt very cool and the proper tea and coffee in the rooms was brilliant Staff were very friendly and welcoming and waived our late checkout fee 
253127,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The rooms are very small The bed is only a double and there is nowhere to place your luggage It would suit a single person but not a couple The cleaning staff also knocked on our door several times during our stay sometimes as early as 9 30am despite us having placed the do not disturb sign on the door We arrived late one evening from a few drinks and found that our access cards wouldn t work The lady at reception was needlessly rude Overall while the hotel amenities are very cool the rooms themselves are lacking I did not feel that the hotel was worth the price paid , The location was great The room was nicely decorated and most staff at check in were incredibly friendly The hotel bar lobby was very cool and always buzzing with people
253128,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Kettle in room was not working and this was reported on the first day of our stay but nothing done to rectify situation , Very comfy bed Well designed rooms with plenty of well situated power points Good shower and places to put things in bathroom Great buzz and activity in the downstairs area Easy to get taxis or buses in the road outside the hotel and only a few minutes from tube Proximity to good restaurants 
253129,The Hoxton Shoreditch, didn t appreciate having to make my bed I was in a concept room needs some stronger light bulbs in places but not so as to ruin the atmosphere , atmosphere was great there was a buzz staff helpful great shower in the rooms 
253130,The Hoxton Shoreditch, We checked in on a Friday night It was like a nightclub The music was so loud I couldn t hear the receptionist Awful first impression From our room we could not hear the noise but going and coming was like a nightmare all weekend ,No Positive
253131,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I believe the personnel who receive the room service calls should have a better understanding of English other than that everyone is very helpful and professional without being pompous, Excellent front office both welcoming and quick to answer any queries the rooms are spacious and well decorated the breakfast bag has been such a comfort when I have early morning meetings and no time for a proper breakfast
253132,The Hoxton Shoreditch, No moisturiser no biscuits No shower cap, Bed duvet pillow armchair fittings fridge breakfast blackout curtains vibe and spacious characterful public spaces
253133,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Having house services knocking on the door at 9 30am when it was a 12pm check out asking if they could do the room yet Don t really see the point of a check out time if you get interrupted earlier anyway We told reception who said we should have put a do not disturb sign up I don t think that on the morning you are due to leave you should have to put a do not disturb sign up I think they should just communicate with house services when guests have checked out so the room can be cleaned then It is quite an expensive hotel so I thought they could have considered this , Good location nice room
253134,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I hate to complain if overall is was good No complaints from me, Value for money great location restaurant is good the hotel is well presented and the bedrooms are cool really homely and clean Had the most fabulous stay Can t wait to stay again
253135,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing, Great location friendly staff Room was comfortable with everything you need and the free water and milk was a nice touch I was concerned because some reviews said you could hear music from the bar in your room We couldn t hear anything and we stayed on a Saturday and the bar was very lively when we went to bed 
253136,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room was hot without the air con on so when you returned to your room it took at least two hours to cool down Some may find the music bar intrusive but it is cooled off around 11 00 Very trendy hotel so only for the trendy If you are a little conservative find a quieter place But then you wouldn t be in this part of London, Uber chic stunning decor all the staff young but really focuses on the customer also the area is amazing So many trendy bars and restaurants catering for all types The detail of the Hox is awesome down to its mugs and health a safety notices the detail of the design is top notch really on trend It s like the cover of Grand Designs magazine 
253137,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Absolutely nothing , Wonderful friendly and informative staff relaxed atmosphere excellent lunch in the grill great vibe we loved the dj in the bar in the evening Would love to stay here again in the future 
253138,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The complimentary breakfast is a nice touch but is really too small A nice buffet downstairs is the minimum you would expect from such an establishment ,No Positive
253139,The Hoxton Shoreditch, bed was uncomfortable my back was very sore the next day I also advised member of staff and was expecting a refund , quirky stylish and modern buzzing in the eve the cosy room i booked was very cosy 
253140,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Stunning place Love the little touches in the rooms The hox breakfast in the paper bag is mega cute Stayed here before and would stay again Love love loved it 
253141,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Our room had a distinct mildew odor After one shower I discovered why the beautiful shower door had a design defect water drips between the door and wall gap runs under the bedroom floor boards I asked twice to speak with a manager via email or in person This never happened The desk staff suggested a room move but other rooms had the same issue Final immediate solution more bath mats It was too noisy to open the windows for ventilation The lobby club crowd and door bouncers can be a bit much in the evening for hotel guests , This hotel has wonderful location and the front desk staff is very friendly and helpful The room and bath amenities were great plenty of coffee and tea and the breakfast bag was perfect Wifi is great and free 
253142,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The shower cabin was leaking Windows are looking at the house witch is being constructed So people who work there can easily spectate you If you are a tourist visiting london for the first or second time then probably it is enough to stay for one or two days here checking around the hipsters life After cover other London areas , If you are in a Shoreditch and would like to feel all that hipsters feelings than this hotel is for you A lot of young people are always there at the lobby and in the bar Some of them are using this place as a co working and some as a place to hang out with friends It is always noisy there and the life is boiling Nice way to serve a mini breakfast right in the room Rooms are small but cozy Nice staff 
253143,The Hoxton Shoreditch, A bit of a building site out back but not to the detriment of our stay , This is a hotel for adults Being here makes you feel like you re connected and in a capital city I m not a great fan of staying in hotels for my entertainment especially in a vibrant hub like Shoreditch but the bars and restaurant here are part of the hub The staff were young enthusiastic and efficient and there are no cheeky little extra charges What you see is what you get 
253144,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Wonderfully convenient for The Wedding at St Botolph s without Bishopsgate and the reception at the Village Underground A taxi was ordered for us to get to the wedding but thereafter we were able to walk We loved the allotted bedroom at the hotel comfortable and appealing and elegant 
253145,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Staff were extremely friendly and seemed like nothing would be too big of an ask for them The style was nice and the breakfast bags on doors was a nice touch
253146,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, We stayed in the hotel over our wedding weekend as it was located close to our venue I d made a request ahead of our stay which they kindly took into account and accomodated During our stay the staff were extremely helpful friendly throughout all the prep and after our big event The rooms are well equipped and clean and the hotel offers most facilities you could want and you can t beat the location for convenience if you need anything else The bar and restaurant downstairs are both great too with good food and plenty of seating options for either meeting friends or having meetings Would stay here again without a doubt 
253147,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Loved everything from the room and all its little touches to the vibrant graffitied streets of its Shoreditch location Staff was helpful and energetically polite Would recommend to anyone who is looking to have a fun place to stay in a hip fast paced area 
253148,The Hoxton Shoreditch, This hotel is a cool hipster place smack bang in the middle of trendy Hoxton Shoreditch It is noisy in the extreme Friday Saturday the reception bar areas were more of a nightclub with a DJ playing from early on Make sure your room is high up or away from the reception areas at all costs otherwise like me you will be requesting a room move at 10 30 at night which they did accommodate because of the noise , The staff were good and the location excellent for exploring this part of London
253149,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Stayed on a Saturday and Sunday night for a course I was taking in London My girlfriend came with me to make a weekend away of it Room on first floor Loud thumping music comes right through the hotel from the bar in the lobby from about 7pm I cannot understand how anyone could ever have stayed in those rooms unless perhaps they went out early and did not return until the hotel bar had closed So we complained and were immediately moved to the top floor no quibble I cannot complain about the staff during this interaction here The problem though is that even from the top floor it s not a huge amount better to be honest the place seems to have pretty poor sound proofing Ran into several couples in the lifts and on corridors who seemed to be experiencing the same incredulity at the volume level That was our first night On the second night we went to a friend s house for dinner and when we came back we found a note under our door telling us that they had tried to phone me but could no get through to let me know that refurbishment works would start at 730am on our floor now the 6th floor and if we would like to change rooms again to just ask at the reception While the staff were nice when I asked to move the first time you couldn t really consider it a great service to be promptly moved out of a room that no one should have been put in to begin with and then to be asked if I would like to move out of the second room as well There was no voicemail or missed call on my phone so I don t know how seriously someone tried to call me not that this would have ameliorated my disappointment with the whole experience though if I am being honest Also because the ground floor and lobby essentially function as a night club when you return in the evenings you will be subject to the usual scrutiny and menace from the now ubiquitous enormous thug bouncers that you find around London everywhere , Very good location in Shoreditch 10 20 mins walk from old street and Liverpool st stations lots of bars and restaurants around Has a really great bar which essentially takes up the whole lobby unfortunately this great bar proves to be its downfall as a hotel 
253150,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The room was expensive for the size etc It was opposite a construction site the safe broke and had to be opened , It s a buzzy fun place with small but well thought out rooms 
253151,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Not enough toiletteries one shampoo one conditioner one body shower and one soap no lotion the street is strictly no parking 2 red lines so taxi uber car can t stop in front of the hotel they have to park in a side or back street, The staff security bouncers outside the hotel in the evening offer more security great restaurants cafes bars and supermarket nearby tasty snacks offered every morning in recycable bags and 2 water bottles and milk for free room full of electric plugs in every shape and 2 usb ports busy yet quite neighborhood with street art buses to central london very effective Spitalfield Market Brick and Borough markets London Tower Bridge the Gherkin St Paul Cathedral and Holborn are within walking distance 
253152,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Ridiculously loud nightclub in the lobby staying on the first floor was unable to get any sleep and needed to be up early the next morning for a 100 mile cycle ride Very disappointed , Nice room Homely feel
253153,The Hoxton Shoreditch, One of the bar team was rude not at all engaging room not cleaned after our first night we had to prompt reception to do this , Great location in the heart of Shoreditch great bar with a good vibe 
253154,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room was shabby Tv didn t have a good signal and no one fixed it Generally rooms were not great considering price tag, Location and the downstairs areas
253155,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Not a hotel issue however building renovations across the road meant we had to keep the curtains closed , Friendly and helpfull staff room was clean and comfortable location great and although busy downstairs it didn t impact our stay
253156,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Keycard problems and poor tv and radio reception channels missing , Bday balloon was a nice surprise Very comfy bed and decent sized room Liked the lively foyer 
253157,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, i liked the design and the vibe of the hotel the rooms are species clean an comfortable The location was just perfect for me and overall this is a very cool neighbourhood with lots of dining options
253158,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Would ve preferred cooked breakfast included on price but lots of hotels don t in London so not the only one , Rooms were great beds comfy good facilities great lounge bar e celebrate staff 
253159,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bed could have been a bit bigger and firmer not as comfortable as we would have liked as we are both tall it was a bit of a squeeze , Complimentary breakfast bags were great The room amenities and layout were excellent and the room was very quiet with the double double glazing perfect for a quiet night s sleep in a busy part of town 
253160,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Bit crowdy at times with groups birthday and hen parties , Nice cozy room location in heart of shoreditch buzzling atmosphere morning complimentary mini breakfast in room
253161,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Love the hotel Second time staying here always impressed with the staffs willingness to go the extra mile for guests Rooms are beautiful and London is magnificent in the summer 
253162,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Coming into the hotel on a Friday or Saturday is a little overwhelming as the place is a totally happening bar too Hard to take kids for dinner in the hotel those nights Fantastic place otherwise , Great room just a little warm for us but staff got us a fan right away Very responsive staff and nicely appointed room 
253163,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The bed was like a cloud I had requested if possible down pillows That was possible and we were extremely comfortable We did eat in the restaurant for breakfast once and it was very good it even had freshly squeezed orange juice 
253164,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar s a really popular drinking venue in the area so gets really crowded at the weekends , The staff obviously love working there and it makes the visitor experience that much more special 
253165,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Room was modern and very comfortable The hotel is in a excellent location and the bar area is lovely I let the staff know on arrival that it was my boyfriends birthday and they arranged for a balloon and a bottle of wine to be in the room for us to enjoy which I thought was a lovely touch I really enjoyed staying here and will defiantly return in the near future 
253166,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The price could be lowered slightly I felt it was over priced for drinks food and the stay over all But hey It is London after all , The bed was extra comfy the atmosphere in the hotel was brilliant Pricey for what it is but all round a lovely place to stay
253167,The Hoxton Shoreditch, More accessories in the bathroom eg moisturising cream ear buds small toothpaste etc, Very modern hip and trendy Loved all the exposed brick work 
253168,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Location very lively and busy especially at night but room well soundproofed so no noise Breakfast in bag great idea and tasty great for on the go Rooms funky and well designed Bathroom clean and rain shower great 
253169,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Location couldn t be more perfect it was right in the heart of Shoreditch which is our go to area when we stay in London Staff were so friendly when we arrived The room was spacious clean ultra modern and comfy everything you wanted from an up market hotel Bathroom was a geat size The complimentary breakfast bag was a really nice touch too I will be staying here again 
253170,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Expected more as the pictures and description sold it as unique and luxurious Room was small with a small double bed and furniture and floor was worn and tired Very expensive as it was not luxurious The hotel and bar restaurant was very nice but we were only using the room and we could have stayed somewhere equally was nice for half the price Gutted I spent so much for something that wasn t unique or luxurious , Ambience and staff were nice 
253171,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Corridors a bit noisy , Great bed nice room shower was powerful so was the hairdryer Tea coffee making facilities were great Staff very welcoming and professional 
253172,The Hoxton Shoreditch, A stranger entered our room at 2 30am using their electronic room key If you don t want strangers entering your room in the middle of the night use the bolt lock , The mattress pillows and duvet were excellent 
253173,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing it was all as to be expected , Ideal Location nice design and style of rooms Bit of a hotspot at night in the bar area Food and cocktails were delicious 
253174,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The electricity cut out in the first room we were booked in to but the staff quickly arranged for us to move rooms without difficulty, Staff were very attentive and made sure to match us up with a room they knew we d really enjoy 
253175,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Friendliness of staff Efficiency of staff on check in and check out Water and refreshments in room Mini breakfast free just what I needed Atmosphere 
253176,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Restaurant service was pretty inattentive often felt like the staff had mich better things to do such as navel gazing Can t be great for sales I gave up ordering on a number of occasions after trying to get the attention of oblivious cruzing space cadets, Nice place great vibrant restuarant on the ground floor Room was great nice design well executed 
253177,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The closet hangars are cheap and the entire bar falls off as you grab a hangar Also no easily accessed power near desk for laptop , Coffee shop makes a V60 pour over Outstanding 
253178,The Hoxton Shoreditch, They took 50 from my account for 5 days but on check in told me they were just authorising my card , Really comfortable well designed rooms 
253179,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Every time we have stayed 4 times so far the Hotel bar has been impossibly packed full of non hotel people so there is no where to sit and the service is jammed up Hotel guests should be given the privilege of a separate lounge bar if they wish to sit and relax with a drink , Location is excellent hence why we stay here 
253180,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The restaurant was a bit of a disappointment Try it twice breakfast and diner it didn t worth it but looks quite cool , Fun atmosphere the bar is pretty popular comfy rooms nice staff 
253181,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The pillows are very thin even though I doubled up The bed is not for tall people Somebody in my party had to check into another hotel for this reason I m 6ft and struggled all night With a bigger longer bed I d be back , The check in was brilliant An Italian gentleman in glasses and a blazer at the reception desk was extremely thorough and professional He made me very welcome The staff who worked on my cousins party in the apartment were equally lovely and professional 
253182,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Found room card a bit difficult used also to call the lift it didn t want to work but after quite a few attempts it did, just the right location for daughter s wedding at Clissold Park staff helpful and friendly but most importantly we felt relaxed and upbeat in the trendy hotel surroundings and also felt at home would definitely stay again eclectic mix of visitors young and old 
253183,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The continental breakfast was a little on the small side , The staff were super helpful and friendly and the room was just what we needed for our stay Loved the shower 
253184,The Hoxton Shoreditch, nothing , Just amazing service as always cool vibe in the bar great location lovely little touches like a breakfast bag hanging on your day when you awaken from your big night out 
253185,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing to dislike , Everything from the quality of the rooms the service from the staff and the changing atmosphere during different parts of the day evening and night 
253186,The Hoxton Shoreditch, No breakfast hall just a banana youghurt orange juice in a bag on your door and they didn t get it to me twice The hotel entrance on a weekend night is very noisy as there is no hotel lobby you re actually going into a pub first then take the lifts to the hotel , Trendy Clean Nice Staff You can say a cool hotel
253187,The Hoxton Shoreditch, there was no granola pot in my breakfast pack as promised just a yoghurt , bed was really comfy nice shower location amazing would go back even though it was loud downstairs couldn t hear I think when we went up to bed 
253188,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar is really popular late at night as residents it would be good to have a residents only section so that we don t have to wait behind a bar that is 4 people deep to get a drink , Breakfast was excellent really good Rooms are perfect everything you need and nothing that you don t 
253189,The Hoxton Shoreditch, the mattress was not particularly comfortable, the whole hotel has a great buzz full of people having a great time the hotel gets buzzing in the afternoon even mid week
253190,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room a little on the small size but had everything needed and fine for a single night sleep , Room had funky and quirky decor shower fab comfy bed breakfast bag a nice touch love the 12pm check out 
253191,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Arrived very late and in need of sustinence but room service ends at 11pm Asked where I could get something to eat but staff unhelpful unable to offer suggestions or solution so ended up having to order pizza which they wouldn t even bring up to my room for me , Great location 
253192,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I ask for a bottle of champagne to be in my room when we checked in as it was my girlfriends birthday but unfortunately I didn t receive the bottle , The rooms were great a little quirky but at the same time very smart 
253193,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Bed standard double and not the comfiest I wouldn t have felt happy paying usual price but the deal offered made it worth while View from room 318 horrible looks straight into another office , Shower was very powerful and Lots of hot water Room service fast and efficient 24hour too Hotel offered great selection at breakfast although extra
253194,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Two things Parking is horrible 49 a night at one place and the nearest puts you in a lift with your car and shuts at 18 30 Not their fault but needs a better solution Hotels in York UK concierge takes and brings your car just like the US Second breakfast is a bit random Getting a pot of coffee hot milk and a hot cup is impossible You get choice of cold hot small cup cold hot milk a pot with one cup why etc and no way to get a plate of fresh fruit I settled for a large tomatoe juice v nice Also breakfast main courses are too clever standard English is huge but no butter for bread and a massive 4 egg scrambled egg solution Perhaps less style more reality , Its a happening place so its got a buzz 
253195,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, There s no unesacerry flapping or messing about ask for a garden facing room on a higher floor to avoid early traffic noise for a good lay in The breakfasts are worth getting up and going down for 
253196,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Bar and restaurant very noisy fantastic buzz but wouldn t recommend for a quiet romantic meal , Trendy great atmosphere very well thought out rooms and really helpful staff Really good food simple breakfast included but really recommend restaurant for breakfast great menu Midday checkout at weekend which you can extend up to 4pm for a fee Rooms well sound insulated 
253197,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Rooms are very comfortable with all of the facility s you would expect Loved the breakfast pack up brought to your door idea which was included in the price nothing fancy but something quick to get you on the go Also loved the proper coffee a very nice touch , Excellent hotel a very modern feel but relaxed atmosphere Rooms are superb Very close to Old St Station which is ideal Would 100 recommend and would definitely stay at this Hotel again 
253198,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Super quirky hotel with a very distinctive vibe Has a really great ambiance that s aimed more towards a younger visitor but fulfills all expectations whatever age you might be The atmosphere down in the reception area is amazing super cozy and inviting and the rooms are really comfy and snug as well The bar downstairs is one of the hotspots of Shoreditch LOTS of people and hubbub at night great music and generally a really inviting vibe Loved every minute and my go to hotel in London 
253199,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Breakfast bag delivered to the room really nice however it could have been a bit bigger lobby is really comfortable and always full of people location is perfect 
253200,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing to report here , The Hoxton is an extremely cool East London hipster hotel and hang out We loved everything about it from the cozy areas to sit and read a book to the delicious food from the Hoxton Grill the old skool photo booth and of course the amazingly squishy beds The room was on the smaller side but everything about it was great The whole experience felt personalised to us and they even left a Happy Birthday balloon for my boyfriend in the room The bathrooms are lovely and the shower was big hot and powerful You get a little breakfast included in the price which got delivered to our door at the chosen time a nice little touch There are little quirks all over the hotel and the staff are a very friendly bunch We loved everything about this place and would highly recommend it 
253201,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Noisy air con Saturday night absolutely packed as you would expect bit disappointed nowhere to sit down even for residents, Room was cosy but everything you need staff were lovely and we enjoyed the restaurant food excellent cooked breakfast and would recommend the sirloin steak
253202,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The grand entrance is buzzing with people going about there business and pleasure Room wasn t ready due to a special request when we arrived so complimentary drinks were provided from the lobby cafe Nice touch Loved the location and the staff were very helpful Would definitely stay again 
253203,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Our room was on third floor of the hotel that housed the restaurant bar which mean that we could hear the music from bar area in our room It did not prevent us from falling asleep but it may be a problem for other guests Perhaps ear plugs could be supplied for these rooms , Everything room service the staff the bar and restaurant area the food 
253204,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room smelled of mold The bathroom was not really great a see through bathroom door which didn t really close a leaky shower door Also it would have been better with a proper breakfast buffet instead of the not so great breakfast bag on the door knob , Comfortable beds nice looking room and great location Excellent coffee in the room 
253205,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing, Open spaces were very inviting open fire sofas nice bar etc Breakfast bag was a great idea granola with greek yoghurt banana and Tropicana juice 
253206,The Hoxton Shoreditch, All the staff were foreign and led to some confusion on checkin and ordering at the bar an extra tax one dosent need especially on check in they should have a caricature of a neuvo Hoxton type with a generous smile welcoming guests the place needs a personality the staff seem like guests rather than natives who care if you come back or not , Liked the feel of the place vibrant foyer and good bar food nice breakfast delivered in bag to room but always think breakfast should be included in price not an extra the cooler hotels in the word don t make this distinction but overall a good place to stay 
253207,The Hoxton Shoreditch, beds too hard As hotel guests we were not impressed at having to order food to sit in an empty restaurant late at night when there was no other space to stand , staff welcoming Nice decor good atmosphere Like the breakfast idea but not so good if dairy gluten free diet 
253208,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, It s just a cool hotel the little shop at reception that charges normal prices for things is unheard of in London Mini bar prices are a joke when all you want is a Diet Coke Not here 65p or something Honestly little things like that are what get me 
253209,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Having no main light in our room was a little challenging when doing hair and make up when my other half was in the shower The plug socket nearest the mirror would have turned off the light for example for me to straighten my hair but it was the only one nearest the mirror , The overall ambience and friendliness of the staff Laura who served us on the Friday night of our stay was lovely 
253210,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar was so busy we had to go elsewhere for drinks which was a shame but testament to how good the bar was I guess , The bed was really comfortable the room well planned out the location perfect 
253211,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Would have loved the option to have a room with a bath, Friendly efficient staff stylish room and decor real milk in the room fridge welcome breakfast bags very comfortable great shower 
253212,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room wasn t very big but fine given the price and location, Enjoyed our stay lovely hotel Really handy location walking distance from Liverpool Street station the tube Brick Lane lots of nice restaurants Nice decor not bland and corporate friendly staff good atmosphere
253213,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Unfortunately I receive a room facing a back street with a massive building site So I ve got woken up quiet early on Saturday and Monday morning But this ha nothing to do with the Hoxton hotel And I ll ask for a room facing an other side of the building next time , Second time I stay in this hotel Still everything great from the room to the staff and the food in the restaurant
253214,The Hoxton Shoreditch, There is nothing to fault , Great location nearby lots of restaurants and tube station Loved the decor and the little extra touches such as breakfast in a bag and the ironing room made the stay enjoyable and stress free The bed was also one of the comfiest we have ever slept in 
253215,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Would be nice if breakfast was included in the room rate The Hoxton grill is great but not cheap for breakfast , This hotel is basically hipsterville Central Loved the design of the hotel main areas and the rooms All the hipsters parked in the lobby using the free wifi make the place feel homey and cosy 
253216,The Hoxton Shoreditch, If I d known that the hotel was such a busy happening place on a weekend I wouldn t have stayed there as I had to get up early on the Sunday morning Even though I was on the third floor music was still very loud Like I say not a problem if you didn t have to get up , The staff where all very friendly and helpful Hotel was modern clean and easy to find
253217,The Hoxton Shoreditch, No bath shower only, This was obviously a very popular hotel not only with people staying there but for young people socialising This place is buzzing always busy in fact when we pulled up in the taxi outside we thought it was a club Rooms are on the small side but very clean and comfortable 
253218,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Having to ask for condiments three times to accompany the breakfast delivered in to the room When they finally arrived my breakfast was cold and therefore unpleasant to eat ,No Positive
253219,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Had a meal with my daughter and boyfriend in grill area and found it challenging with noise level from music So did they Would not eat there at night time as a result, Bedroom ESP bed very good Loved fridge fresh milk and coffee sachets 
253220,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Don t bother with the restaurant downstairs too loud and the food is way overpriced Most well done burger I ve ever had couldn t finish half of it This doesn t take away from the amazing vibe of the hotel though , Great room comfy bed brilliant DAB radio free breakfast bag so nice Gorgeous area downstairs very welcoming Love the whole vibe and feel of the place 
253221,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Reception staff was not very flexible to extend check out even an hour they charged extra , Great hip setting and lively atmosphere It was overall a positive experience I would definitely consider staying again 
253222,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I prefer smaller boutique hotels and given the size and crowd it didn t have a personal intimate touch, Good locations comfortable bed very lively bar and restaurant scene nice atmosphere in room 
253223,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The room was clean warm and quite when you enter the hotel you feel like you are at home open fires with sofas to sit back and relax on with a drink book or laptop while you book in The food was nice to will come back again 
253224,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Our rooms were comfortable and well designed only let down by lots of finger prints on glass bathroom doors and the entrance doors to the rooms , The customer service throughout the hotel was excellent all staff were attentive smiley and nothing was too much trouble Thank you 
253225,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Not much to dislike we were very impressed The bed was a little firm but still very comfy , Amazing location super trendy rooms and bar great facilities US Euro and UK plugs in the room Fast reliable wifi The shower was fantastic The staff were very friendly 
253226,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Excellent hotel Very stylish rooms were beautiful Perfect location for an evening out in shoreditch Enjoyed the bar downstairs and the staff were very helpful It s a very cool hotel Highly recommend 
253227,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Wish the window opened wider in our room Breakfast was a little stingy Bed was a touch hard too , Stunningly minimal and cool interior design lots of mixed materials and attention to detail Great bar lots of space and fun parts love the artwork too Good atmosphere 
253228,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar was really crowded at night and the areas near the fireplaces were always reserved , Perfectly situated in East London Great lobby bar with 2 cosy fireplaces Light breakfast available on demand included in the room price Comfortable bed
253229,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Only thing I didn t like was the breakfast but my boyfriend did also the bar was very expensive but that is expected in London, Our hotel room 640 was very cool and arty as we requested a cool concept room which is the same price as a normal room hotel nightlife very lively and fun Staff were helpful
253230,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Cleaning staff knocking on door early till we got up and answered to them we didn t need to be checked out till 12 so shouldn t come before then unless we were checked out , The bed and shower room was amazing
253231,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Coffe in a bag in your room Normal sachets would be fine , The whole experience was 10 out of 10 From the front of house staff to the bar staff Everyone was very welcoming Definitely stop there when I am next in town 
253232,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Breakfast in a bag no substitute for a sit down in their lovely restaurant which clearly they don t want paying guests to eat in Bad form Really cheapskate given the quality of the rest of the hotel ,No Positive
253233,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I would have liked firmer pillows and the sound from the bar travelled up to our room at night , It was very trendy The food was great I loved the design of the hotel and the little touches like the radio being on and the breakfast in a bag 
253234,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Not being able to book a table in the restaurant despite paying a lot of money to stay there The restaurant and bar were packed throughout our stay which made for a bit of a frustrating situation Room service was also really slow during busy times Gives you the impression they aren t really set up for that extent of service which is a shame as you re paying a lot to stay there , Location comfort of the bed warmth and ability to change temperature easily overall facilities and amenities in the room 
253235,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The fact that my girlfriend left me two days before this thing and now I m spiralling into anxiety and depression she hasn t even offered to pay back her half , Hard to say as I never went Maybe install a better refund policy 
253236,The Hoxton Shoreditch, bit too expensive for during the week but week end deal was great , Lovely room great efficient service inc room service and loved the fact that there is fresh milk and water in the fridge Very good shower and the light breakfast is an excellent idea 
253237,The Hoxton Shoreditch, have to ask several times via phone at reception for the drinking water supposed to be FOC in the room I was informed while checking in that I ll have 1 hour free international phone calls of course it didn t work Called front desk they informed me a technician will come to fix the phone of course nobody came in spite reminding them couple of times So I guess my overall input might be a bit high , location cleanliness handy caf on the lobby
253238,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Couldn t get through to room service on the phone, Super buzzy great relaxed atmosphere Rooms are very comfortable and quiet even though it s situated on a busy street
253239,The Hoxton Shoreditch, food wasnt good macoroni cheese was mediocre awful cheesburger rubbery and overcooked , Overall good hotel and location room service cheesecake was great and hot chocolate 
253240,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Water shortage at arrival no water in the room until the following morning Breakfast offered to compensate Super noisy room even if at 5th floor on a weekend not advisable unless rear room is available , Staff super helpful 
253241,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, It had great buzzy atmosphere and all staff very willing to help Good team work I was there to attend the wedding of my God daughter Great skyline 
253242,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The head door man Kevin I believe his name is is very rude I dont think he understands the etiquette of the place based on the amount of times I ve been there he doesn t know how to speak to people My friends were kicked out of the hotel on sunday 31st based on the altercation that happened friday 29th when he insisted I leave the premises rudely without finishing my drink and we both had words We were sat in the hotel peacefully on sunday 31st and he wasn t even on shift that day he came over insisted we leave the building as I was banned I didn t get how the bar manager thought it was okay to include or get him involved in the discussion bearing in my mind he wasn t even wearing his security badge the bouncer on that night was actually polite none the less we agreed to leave without an altercation and got a refund for my room Not the great of experiences Like I said I stay there all the time This guy is on a power trip , I stay there all the time Love the atmosphere of the place 
253243,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Burst water pipe caused chaos and no running water on the night we arrived not the hotel s fault and then a lack of hot water for showering the next morning , Awesome location near all the East End must sees Hoxton Brick Lane Spitalfields hotel has a fab restaurant and bar nice rooms nice little touches in the room and throughout Very busy very buzzy very cool very Shoreditch 
253244,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The room delivered breakfast was a great touch and also delicious We liked the lack of formal hotel feel in the open lobby reception we ll definitely be back for a coffee or breakfast And the room s decor was exactly to our taste 
253245,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Free healthy breakfast in the room every day Very cool hotel So many things to do close to the hotel Easy to get around Great atmosphere in the hotel especially in the lobby and restaurant 
253246,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Upon arriving there was no hot or cold water in the entire hotel This issue was fixed at around 7am next morning As a temporary solutions we were given 3 bottles of water to make some tea but we had to ask for them Nobody bothered to offer in advance On top of that instead of paying 99 for the night my card was charged for 423 After 2 phone calls and 2 live chats at the reception in the end I ve got refunded but only 30h later Got a free breakfast as an apology for not having water at all the entire night and for taking extra money from my account I don t know how to thank them for the generosity ,No Positive
253247,The Hoxton Shoreditch, maybe a teeny bit pricey, great looking room nice little touch with the mini continental breakfast for free GREAT restaurant downstairs Stones throw from Old Street station
253248,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Great room very comfortable and well furnished Breakfast being delivered to the room worked brilliantly as we just wanted to relax and enjoy not having any child care The Hoxton Grill located in the hotel looked wonderful for breakfast or lunch The evening crowd was buzzing Close by is Shoreditch market and the Dennis Severs museum both well worth a visit Will definitely return as really helped make my birthday weekend in London special 
253249,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I have stayed several times at the Hoxton I have been quite disappointed this time My new parfume disappeared from my room I have notified this situation to the staff of the hotel They promised they would search for it and revert back to me They never dared although I let them my contact details This lack of concern is far below expectation ,No Positive
253250,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Quite possibly one of the best hotels I ve stayed in in terms of value for money The decor and overall feel of the hotel is great and the staff were really helpful making sure that I could check in early to get ready for a wedding 
253251,The Hoxton Shoreditch, There is no space for residents A very noisy bar restaurant if you wanted to relax but not possible in your room no where to go for a relaxing drink maybe we are just too old Very trendy but would go back for sure, The staff without doubt make the place excellent steak 
253252,The Hoxton Shoreditch, On Monday morning at 7 30 am the building site outside our window of room 401 started their day LOUD banging and the noise of machinery were awful I complained at checkout firstly we were not made aware of this when we checked in and second his answer was that he would put me on the other side of the hotel the next time I visited , Location is good 
253253,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The breakfast in the bag is limited for someone with special dietary needs gluten free as there is no choice available , The rooms were lovely but a bit on the small side
253254,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The staff are super friendly and helpful The hotel is in an excellent location close to Old Street tube station The room was clean and comfortable had everything necessary in it Excellent place
253255,The Hoxton Shoreditch, At a pinch would say the bed wasn t outstandingly comfortable That s it, Everything It s just lovely Quirky but not for the sake of it 
253256,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I was harassed to check out by the cleaners who were knocking on my door over half an hour before check out This happened again 15 minutes later The to add to my stress my laptop was stolen on check out Although the staff were friendly and concerned I was left feeling that it was a oh well these things happen It spoiled my entire visit and I do not intend to stay at the hotel again for this reason , I stayed here before and really enjoyed it Good location just off the main city track but close enough by tube Also plenty of places to meet eat and drink for lunches and nights out The rooms are excellent 
253257,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, The bar downstairs is great in the evening super lively Staff was very friendly and willing to help Bed super comfy The books used everywhere as part of the design decor made it feel more like home
253258,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Great location near spitalfields market and with good transport into central London Nice cosy rooms friendly staff The bar is buzzing during the weekend and the food is excellent Get the Mac and Cheese
253259,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I liked everything about hotel But I didn t like the staff uniform in the grill Those pinafores and bare legs look horrendous on all staff not a good look but the staff themselves are super , Location food look vibe
253260,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Had a lovely stay with my boyfriend at the Hoxton for his 30th birthday I held a surprise party for him downstairs in the lounge area and staff were more than helpful with this and made us feel so welcome and special We were upgraded to one of the designer rooms on the 6th floor due to the special occasion and had a lovely gift box with a balloon wishing my boyfriend happy birthday Lovely personal touch Always good vibes at the Hoxton cocktails are never a let down Will always recommend 
253261,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Not an applicable section We have no reason to complain or comment negatively about the hotel , The vibe in all parts of the hotel Attentiveness of staff throughout the premises The general attention to detail and design not forgetting the terrific rate offered for what was a last minute booking 
253262,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Had a trip to London with my son and picked this hotel because of position and reviews We were not disappointed a very lively bar lounge and bar area greets you as you enter with a modern open plan reception to the left We were dealt with very quickly and professionally by very curtios staff who also booked a table at the very busy restaurant The room though not large was very well thought out and was perfect for our needs large flatscreen TV tea coffe free wifi mini bar with complimentary water and fresh milk There was a lot of quality little touches that enhanced our stay and I would recommend this hotel without reservation
253263,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Pillows and bed are too soft Our room was cleaned late in day We would come back to rest to dirty room , Atmosphere downstairs and room was charming Was close enough to underground to take us anywhere easily Appreciated the breakfast water and daily milk supply 
253264,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The Breakfast bag is the only thing that lets The Hoxton down with such a good restaurant on site it is possible to produce a great hot choice or continental style , Lovely decor lovely atoms attentive staff makes this place a winner on most levels 
253265,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Hotel bar and restaurant are very very busy with groups from outside of the hotel To be fair we went in mid December so first night Friday looked like a massive Xmas party but the second was more groups and birthdays etc and perhaps more like the norm This caused us no issues for the room we couldn t hear the busy bar and music below but meant if you just wanted to have a drink before you headed out it was very busy and took ages to get a drink and the only places left to sit were reserved for external groups Being a hotel this isn t a brilliant experience when your hotel guests end up playing second fiddle to people on a night out Pillows on the beds were rubbish so sleep wasn t the best and a bit disappointing to be honest , Great location good facilities in general Rooms are well laid out ensuing the most is made of the relatively small space which was just fine for us 
253266,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Wouldn t change anything, Everything It s witisism and it s energetic atmosphere We came pre Christmas to celebrate a Wedding Anniversary in our old stomping ground It was everything we wanted Friendly staff were very attentive and their informal but efficient approach felt well pitched Location is great easy walking distance of Spitalfields Market Columbia Road Flower Market Sunday and Brick Lane and everything Hoxton Shoreditch has to offer at night Would definitely go back and would take our teenage children next time they would love it 
253267,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Serving only a banana orange juice and a granola with yogurt is far far away from being breakfast If i am a guest paying for a night for a hotel this should include proper breakfast at least , Decoration comfort was great
253268,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Just one small point Had organised late check out as had all night flight to come but 3 times housekeeping came and knocked on the door Annoying but otherwise great stay, Great hotel with very friendly staff and relaxed feel
253269,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Couldn t get a table to eat my own fault as I didn t think guests would have to book in advance, Loved the contempory style of room and security attached to entering lifts
253270,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The back side of the hotel has a building site so they start quiet early in the morning but it s independent of the hotel so can t really complain, Almost everything Fast and friendly check in Great food at the restaurant served all day Fantastic waitresses Comfortable beds Comp little breakfast bag hanging at ur door every morning
253271,The Hoxton Shoreditch, We didn t get our breakfast delivered but got this later form reception the waiting staff were very slow in the day time n, Very welcoming and hotel works for all ages Like the laid back feel and professional approach 
253272,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Easy check in led to a lovely decorated clean room Complimentary breakfast was a nice surprise We even found a penknife to cut our Lemmon Location was just where we required Staff where very helpful Checkout box made leaving a lot easier We will return 
253273,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Only criticism would be that the lighting in the bathroom was a little dark and hazy , Fantastic fit out modern comfortable and practice The bar and restaurant down stairs was also fantastic Location was also good only two underground stops away from kings cross which made getting around easy 
253274,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The room was quite small so if you travel with lots of luggage you may need a bigger place , The mini breakfast by your door each morning The decor and the youthful vibe Eager to please staff 
253275,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I got the hotel at a great price But in general the price has been really hiked up since it was taken over and refurbed Also no movie package anymore That used to be a perfect compliment to a hangover in the hoxton , The little quirks and touches The bar as always is great Staff are good to
253276,The Hoxton Shoreditch, It would have been nice to have a hotel guests only section in the restaurant After a long day of travel all we wanted to do was get something to eat downstairs but it was packed and booked up the entire night , The view of the London skyline from our fifth floor room was amazing The staff was very helpful and friendly 
253277,The Hoxton Shoreditch, None Wish I booked longer time , The whole thing designed well the feel of the whole hotel relaxing Will come back to you Great Location for gigs 
253278,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Very crowded dance party every Saturday evening i e could not enjoy a night cap at the bar with my friends However good thing is that despite the thumping extremely loud club music I couldn t hear a thing from my room , Modern funky interior mini breakfast for free delivered to your door handle in a small paper bag and friendly staff
253279,The Hoxton Shoreditch, My only negative was the bed although lovely pillows and duvet the mattress was a bit hard Pretty minor though , Perfect location for exploring the streets of Hoxton and Shoreditch So many restaurants and bars pubs to explore two days was not enough We were allocated a concept room on the top floor which was lovely I am sure all rooms are as equally as well appointed Would certainly return for another city break Balloons in the room for my partner s birthday were so great Thank you 
253280,The Hoxton Shoreditch, There was a fire alert and the alarms went off There was no sense of urgency or guidance from staff There was no explanation of what was going on far far top laid back in a situation that could have been tragic Need to do better, The location the ambitnce the funkiness The design of the room The clever attention to detail 
253281,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, When staff found out it was my girlfriends birthday they left a note and gave us have a complimentary drink from the mini bar You can buy a later check out for 5 per hour Bar and lobby area very cool 
253282,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Quite simply seem to have thought of all the little extras back that up with excellent customer service no complaints Will definitely return 
253283,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bar menu was s but out of touch More craft beer on draft and better cocktails would be good, The charity shop records and dreadful books I the room and hallways were pointless
253284,The Hoxton Shoreditch, My only complaint would be that our room was at the back and construction started on the building behind the hotel at 8 am Saturday morning not your fault but is was annoying to be woken by the noise , Check in clerk really welcoming and friendly sorry don t know his name but he was Italian 
253285,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing , Fantastic buzzing lively hotel great facilities and location Staff were friendly and professional and eager to help We have already booked another visit 
253286,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Noisy restaurant due to open plan layout Down pillows way to soft for comfort Not easy to park nearby, Good quality bed Decent shower Controllable heating system Down duvets need a good shake to fluff up 
253287,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Beautiful furnishing great style excellent friendly customer care Despite central location our room was very quiet will recommend to friends
253288,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Great vibrant place to stay Location is perfect the cool vibe hits you as soon as you walk in with people relaxing with coffee wine and fizz Chatting working and eating You can stay at the hotel and have everything you need or just a small walk you have lots of choices of restaurants bars cool coffee shops I would certainly return for business purposes and or pleasure 
253289,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I might have missed it but as a vegan I d like the option of featherless duvets and pillows I didn t like the fact that the hotel stay was completely non refundable I can t imagine that they struggle to fill the rooms so a cancellation option would be nice The staff in the bar restaurant had no idea which of their wines were vegan so it meant although only 1 5 of us was vegan we all went out to drink , Great location comfortable beds and I even got a free vegan breakfast 
253290,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, We were made to feel very welcome on our arrival at reception The rooms are small but absolutely spotless and everything worked Bathroom very clean and again everything worked not the usual slow drainage out of the plug or scaled up shower Breakfast hung on a peg outside your door in the morning is very good yoghurt with granola on top and a banana A carton of fresh milk is in the fridge ready to use with high quality teas and coffee On checkout the Manager recognised us from check in and asked us how the wedding went which we had attended Excellent staff and very comfortable accommodation means we will be back when we next stay in London 
253291,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I was woken by the maid at 8am when i didnt need to check out until 12pm so that was a bit annoying they really should check that , Loved the vibe of the bar hotel rooms were compact and had what you needed for 1 night think if you were staying any longer this would be a problem as so small with no area to put a clothes case Breakfast on the door was fun and handy yoghurt OJ and banana 
253292,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Nothing for a city hotel All good Not there long enough to think about gyms or other facilities I would find the room small if I was staying for more than a couple of nights then again you should be out doing stuff not sat in your room , Quick check in out Friendly efficient and knowledgeable staff Great idea for a healthy breakfast in a bag Small room but well appointed comfortable aircon that works and a very cool theme Great restaurant and bar excellent eggs benedict helped us recover from the cocktails the night before Loved the bar and atmosphere 
253293,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The bed wasn t that comfy it was noisy from the bar and there was bad reception Breakfast wasn t included except for orange juice banana and muesli and staff could smile more, The location

253300,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Breakfast in a bag Would have been nice to have croissants included The room rate was quite high so would have expected a continental breakfast available in the restaurant as paying guest , Lively atmosphere stylish and funky interior design monsoon shower great cocktails comfortable bed 
253301,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Air conditioning unit in room was broken which meant we had to open the window Only downside to this was the kitchen food smell came into the room , nice rooms
253302,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Room was noisy room 505 some can t be helped outside construction 2am revelers but the door slams in the hall way are bone jarring, Funky decor clean rooms fun lobby crowd excellent front desk staff
253303,The Hoxton Shoreditch, think they need to adjust some of the door closures on the room doors as I heard a lot of doors slamming through the night, the food in the restaurant was amazing recommend the steak

253306,The Hoxton Shoreditch, Had stained marks on my pillow case Unable to make the room cooler the aircon was set to 19degrees but it seemed much warmer in the whole hotel windows didn t open Also had a view of a huge building site with cranes which stated work at 7 8am lorrys turning etc , Decor was cool lounge bar downstairs was lovely and trendy 
253307,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The security staff during the evening hours felt being overtasked making the difference between hotel guests and party folks It should also been considered to installed a smoker lounge away from the main door entrance , The lobby is amazing 
253308,The Hoxton Shoreditch, That I had to go home , Loved loved loved it This place is faultless Very hip and stylish place and surrounding area has great bars and restaurants The staff are very friendly and helpful 
253309,The Hoxton Shoreditch, N A, It was simply AMAZING The vibe is so chilled and everyone is so friendly The quirky touches just make it that extra bit more special and you can tell they have paid a lot of attention to detail We requested through booking com a room on a higher floor and with a nice view and did they deliver or what They put us on the highest floor with a city skyline view that looked just like NYC The lounge area is great to take out your laptop and get on with some work or just chill and the table tennis room is just great The surrounding area has a hipster vibe and there are some really cool places to eat and drink There s a co op store right opposite the hotel which comes in handy too Overall this hotel is AWESOME and would definitely recommend it to all

253311,The Hoxton Shoreditch,No Negative, Great atmosphere in the hotel reception and bar area both during the day and in the evening The small free breakfast delivered to the room then the option to have a larger breakfast downstairs for which you simply pay for what your order and is reasonable priced is brilliant Very comfortable beds great shower great toiletries The rooms are well sound proofed so noise from the street and the hotel bar late at night is virtually non existent

253320,The Hoxton Shoreditch, I booked the room for a couple myself and my wife but there was only one bath towel and one hand towel in the bathroom The bath towel had a dirty mark on it so that was a bit off putting We didn t ask for another towel just made do as our visit was such a short one , The location of the hotel was perfect for our purposes The desk clerk was friendly but it took him some time to find our booking although we gave him all our particulars

253326,The Hoxton Shoreditch, The lobby which doubles as a night club sometimes gets very noisy at night and it was hard communicating with staff during these hours , Visually pleasing rooms with excellent comfort The complimentary breakfast bags really add to the feeling of being spoiled in a slightly old fashioned way
