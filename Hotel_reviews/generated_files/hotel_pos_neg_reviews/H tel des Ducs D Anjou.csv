13182,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, First room air conditioning didn t work internet was dreadful last straw was no hot water in the morning for a shower so left a night early For the money was not expecting the Ritz but could be better, Good location and quiet room
13183,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Stayed in the blue quite and Wifi and TV didn t work To be fair I did not mention this to management as most of the time we were out and about Lift is small 2 normal people a very large person would likely not fit nor would large luggage with a person leaving stairs as the only option Shower bath was oddly missing any side glass sheets to stop splashing water hitting the floor and it lacked a holder for the shower head which made showering fun I guess they assumed everyone would take a bath instead None of these were major issues to me hence still giving a very good rating because everything else was fantastic , Great location super close to Les Halles short walk down to the river loads of cafes and restaurants nearby Aircon fantastic Suite s balcony was fantastic Hotel staff super nice Rooms comfy good night sleep 
13184,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, The hotel decor was a little shabby in the room bathroom was very basic no shower , Location was perfect for access to centre Staff were friendly and helpful 
13185,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Wifi was non existent we aren t desparate for it but needed it to organise our next day sightseeing , Great location on chatalet metro easy for Gare du Nord and into the city Good value for money great for 1 night stay with two teenagers especially as rooms connected 
13186,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Room and bathroom was a bit smaller than I had hoped for No bath as requested when booking the room just a shower The smallest lift I have ever seen it is a 2 person MAX or 1 person with 1 suitcase , Bed was very comfy the continental breakfast was good especially the croissants The hotel staff were friendly and helpful The location is spot on Right in the centre of Paris with easy access to metro rail stations which makes seeing All of Paris easy Several busy cafes bars in a busy pedestrian street However the double glazed windows really do shut it all out making the room really quiet we were on the 1st floor facing 2 busy cafes 
13187,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Rooms were tiny and not what was advertised as per images Bathroom was tiny and could not fit a male comfortably Wifi was non existent 1 out of the 3 receptionists could speak understandable English Overall poor experience , Location was great
13188,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Decor was slightly shabby Room was slightly small for the furniture in it , Helpful and efficient staff Very good location particularly once you have found the best exit from the Metro Many restaurants and bars nearby would especially recommend Pizzeria Mimmo at 14 rue Saint Dennis wifi worked well
13189,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, pure dissapointment I booked the penthouse apartment with a terrace room was dirty the bed on the terrace was missing mattress and lighting was not working when I wanted to contact manager the reception told me that it is a weekend and they are not allowed to give the manager contact number to the guest and they can do nothing they did nothin for 3 days and never get back to me, nothing this time 
13190,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Hotel is on very best place because this place is very noisy , Breakfast was typical for France Staff don t speak english breakfast Clean underground is 100m 
13191,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Since the suite is at the top floor we bumped against the low ceiling in the bathroom over the bathtub most of the time A bit hard to find via car GPS because Rue Sainte Opportune is not a car accessible road , Great location the metro station is right in front of the hotel Quadruple Suite is nice cozy clean and come with all amenities Good wifi 
13192,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Well if you re on a sightseeing holiday it is vital That you plan your next day feom your hotel room Now this was something we couldn t do neither our neighbors from different floors The wifi was absolutely rubbish Many people complained including me throughout the 4 days we spent there But hey reception restarted yhe rooter every time what did not solve the problem promising tje next day it shall be fixed since he s going to pass on our rightful complaint You see we paid for a room with wifi Well they didn t manage to fix the problem hence the full house Really disappointed could have found a better place for that money The other little problem was that after room service always left with one set of gel and shampoo Every day And I ve asked every day for another set One day we only had shampoos Not really thoughtful Overall cleanliness was good tough , Excellent location 
13193,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, It seemed the room was a little small the shower even smaller you could have used the curtain as a flannel and I am of average build The noise of the revellers during the night was ok but got a bit lively and loud during the small hours Use the stairs as the lift is very small , Bed was comfy the breakfast was a good selection of food hot and cold the hotel was in a lively area 
13194,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Poor wifi non existent mostly and room over heated but we could open our window but then got street noise below , Excellent location right next door to Metro Chatelet station and easy walking distance to Louvre Notre Dam
13195,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Rooms are small and dirty , This is definitely not a four star hotel One has to be extremely careful while booking a room in Ducs D Anjou A room described as standard room can be 12 square meters Elevator can hardly accommodate two people Quality of this property and service offered does not correspond with price 
13196,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, The room was small The Internet was poor to say the least , The bed was comfortable the design of the hotel appealing location good and staff friendly 
13197,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Very small room with and very tiny bathroom In thw shower there was a curtain couldn t feel it clean Photos don t show what it looks like in real ,No Positive
13198,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, the room given to us very small The shower cubical is so tight and badly designed that all water spills to rest of the bathroom not much of choice of free tea bags and they even not re fill next day of our stay wifi was very poor and slow i would only give full marks to its location, location
13199,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, On Saturday early morning the rubbish bin cleaners outside were so loud it woke us up and found it hard to go back to sleep Wasnt relaxing that morning , Loved the view clean and comfortable rooms Bedroom was quite small for the price I paid however I do believe this is normal for Paris 
13200,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, This hotel markets itself as a 4 star and charges four star prices I suspect the French don t use the same standards as everywhere else in the world as this hotel is at best three star There was barely enough room for the bed in the room the wifi connection process was prehistoric with a series of codes for each device that kept cutting out we had to run the shower for 5 minutes each time before the water was hot staff didn t replace the shampoos unless we asked them this is a seriously over priced hotel and was definitely not worth the money, Location of hotel was good bed was comfortable
13201,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, This hotel is for no reason a 4 star hotel The room was very small one double bed could hardly fit in The bathroom was very small as well especially the shower The check in was very bureaucratic you need to fill in a whole form with personal details The internet was slow The place for breakfast is on the basement and seems like a cave , Tle location was the relevant advantage The breakfast was also decent and the bed comfortable enough 
13202,H tel des Ducs D Anjou,No Negative, We had the penthouse suite for the night the views were out of this world The bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on the clouds The view over paris rooftops from the Bed was like a dream Highly recommend With the penthouse comes a roof top and that is so incredible 
13203,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, There was no bar in the hotel not a proper restaurant either facilities weren t that great and the rooms were too small , I liked the location and the staff were very friendly and helpful
13204,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Room service not at all attentive mini bar not replaced in 5 days I had to chase them for soap towels creamer etc, Florence at reception extra helpfull great location very good breakfast
13205,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, I didn t ask for the breakfast since it was expensive 17 euro per person but I could buy food from the 2 supermarkets The hotel assigned me a very small room at the beginning very hot and without ventilation but after the first 2 days I asked to change it and they gave me a better room I booked the taxi from the hotel to the airport and the driver seemed to know the manager of the staff and I was surprised that for 30 min driving he charged 76 euro When I took the taxi from the airport to the hotel I paid 50 euro for the same trip Don t book a taxi with the hotel , The location of the hotel was perfect The metro Chatelet is only 1 min walking There are 2 supermarkets close to the hotel 2 min The river Seine is 5 min walking where you can take the river cruise Notre Dome is 10 min walking and Louvre is 5 min walking Could t ask more The staff of the hotel was amazing They were all very sweet and helpful I had asked to have the baby crib and I found it in the room when I reached the hotel 
13206,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, It was really noisy not just from the street below but the walls were thin and you could hear the people next door taking a shower or opening their door , The location was good Really close to the metro and lots of places to eat and drink 
13207,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Internet that s the only reason why i won t be back at the hotel once again poor connection i was at the second floor asked several times a day to restart the connection but nothing helped , The location was amazing steps from everything you need and wants staff was friendly and mostly helpful 
13208,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Nothing really I found everything good , I liked my room suite camelia very much it was clean tidy comfortable I slept very well I also liked having breakfast in this hotel I had a good choise about what to eat 
13209,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Internet did not work AT ALL the entire stay Could not control heat either too cold or too hot The rooms are noisy There s no standing shower just a hand spray in the bath Breakfast is a rip off especially with all the restaurants nearby The rooms are super tiny Don t be fooled by the wide angle lense used to take the picture Very few tv channels This is more like a bed breakfast Expect a bed in a good location and no other amenities , Location was about the only true benefit The staff was friendly 
13210,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, No ventilation in the room and so eventually had to prop window with coat hanger Teabags not replaced and no coffee available in room Front Desk staff men were pleasant but not very knowledgeable Arrival had to wait for him to finish something and then check in was quick but called room number out twice so people in lobby could hear The woman at check out could have been a robot no eye contact no question as to the stay Asked for room number did not confirm with name asked for payment and gave copy of bill no offer to put in an envelope Did not enquire as to quality of stay wish good trip home or invite back any one would have been pleasant , Good central location offering an acceptable rate Nice to have been asked for special requests and receive them i e bathrobe and slippers Also some restaurant recommendations 
13211,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Wifi servive was tiresome Never been to a hotel where I had to get a new user name and password from front desk every day Half of them didn t even work ,No Positive
13212,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid Hopefully you take the feedback on board Would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics right, Hotel very nice and comfortable we had a great stsy lovely room however the breakfast experience was terrible we had to wait for coffee and eggs and servce no variety of yoghurt and cheese or ham the tables we had to clean up ourselves and was dissapointed to see only one waitress that neded to serve and do and handle a lot of work she was great and very nice and friendly but sorry to see her without any other help also the room was not equuiped with enough toilet paper and coffeee things lovely hotel but dissapointed to lack so many basic things that we paid very good money for just basic things is not much to expect for the rate of hotel and price paid Hopefully you take the feedback on board Would not hesitate to recommend hotel but please get the basics right
13213,H tel des Ducs D Anjou,No Negative, Excellent location near chatelet les halles station and very close to lovely bars and restaurants small rooms but comfortable beds and location makes up for it quick and satisfying breakfast
13214,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, The fact that we had to log onto the WIFI every time we came back to the room was slightly irritating but only a minor issue really , The location of this hotel was perfect for what we wanted right in central Paris and convenient for taking the train to and from the airport The hotel was lovely smartly decorated and very clean and comfortable 
13215,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Our room as are most rooms in Paris a bit on the small side for four adults to be completely comfortable Our teenage boys got a great deal of enjoyment out of the spiral stairway to our 4th floor room The rest of of squeezed into the two person elevator a true luxury in this part of Paris , This hotel is pure Paris traditional and welcoming It is located a short walk to two different Paris M tropolitain stations that can whisk you away to any part of Paris and the location of this hotel is near shopping and many bars restaurants without any transportation needed 
13216,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Photos depict a much higher standard of hotel than reality Good location but in quite a noisy area especially if on the front side of the hotel The smallest lift I have ever seen Bath tiny and although there was a shower attachment you physically couldn t stand to shower due to the angle of the ceiling see photo , Location good really easy to find from Gare du Nord via the metro
13217,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, The room was minute you simply couldn t enter carrying your suitcase even a small one You had to go in sideways or else climb onto the bed to enter the room And a little soundproofing would be welcome as it s located very neat a number of noisy late night bars , It was very clean centrally located and the staff were pleasant and efficient 
13218,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, No access to hotel with car if driving Pack light Tiny lift fits 1 person 1 luggage bag bloody inconvenient when traveling with young kids and big luggage , Location 
13219,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Toilet and bath room was not clean wifi was extremely slow and disconnected several times that is worth in upper floor , The staff were so helpful and polite However there is a language barrier for some of the staff which just could speak French 
13220,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Our room was called a junior suite but was basically a bedroom with a second single bed stuffed in a niche right next to the large bed Fine for my mother daughter and I but lacking in privacy one might expect with a suite The public areas of the hotel seemed a bit worn While the location was central and convenient it lacked in charm Though very close to the Marias which is full of charm , the room was charming just like the pictures and had a great balcony The location was very central and convenient to trains walking to the marais the louvre 
13221,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, The location can also be busy so if you want a super quiet place don t stay here having said that the double glazing and sound proofing is excellent so after having a few drinks and enjoying the local surroundings you can go home in a few mins and not hear much at all Shower was small and not the best water pressure Not a huge deal for me but may be for some , Super comfy bed and nice room with good facilities The staff were extremely helpful and friendly nothing was a problem Location is steps away from Rue Du Rivoli Forum des Halles and so many other sights are in walking distance metro is a stones throw SO central 
13222,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Wifi connection problems due to room location as wifi works well in hotel in reception area, Spectacular breakfast and staff and very attentive to guest needs Evreryone speaks English also a plus 
13223,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Room bar fridge had a really bad smell which staff were quick to clean it still smelt after and cleaner was happy to do it a second time It still had a bad smell so I defrosted the fridge and cleaned it myself , Excellent location to restaurants and metro
13224,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, the decoration in the lobby is really not my cup of tea but that s personal and only a detail it has nothing to do with the rooms and the comfort , great location near Louvre lot of bars in the street x large bed for Paris good shower and friendly staff
13225,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, I had a great roof top room with an excellent view of the quaint Parisian rooftops surrounding but unfortunately the room only has a bath tub with no shower , Great location in Paris walking distance from great destinations Le Marais Notre Dame and Rue St Honore Would definitely return 
13226,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, This hotel does not have the room sizes facilities or services you expect from a 4 star establishment even in Paris At best this is an average 3 star hotel It is totally over priced as a result The corridors are narrow 75cm and continuously crowded with hotel maids dirty laundry and cleaning equipment The room food service is sourced externally and therefore takes ages to be delivered The beds are hollow and the pillows too hard resulting in back and neck aches The Wifi login is cumbersome and cuts off periodically At this price the breakfast which is served in a basement room should be free in Paris it is cheaper anyway to go to a nearby street caf , Very good location within 15 meters of the Chatelet metro station Friendly and accommodating staff Clean 
13227,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, everything was good I could not wish for more, Location location location The hotel is nicely done with nice bathrooms and lovely furniture and there was 100 clean and neat everywhere this is not always standard in Paris 
13228,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, Very expensive for the room size bathroom was very small and missing some showering items Very small and slow elevator , Very nice hotel in very good location friendly staff clean and offer nice breakfast
13229,H tel des Ducs D Anjou, What wasn t so great was the photographs of the room had suggested the suite provided two separate bedrooms this was not the case Additionally there were problems with the electricity where we had to turn on wall lights in order for sockets to work When one set of sockets worked others switched off , The hotel location was great close to a metro station which allowed us to travel around Paris with ease 
13230,H tel des Ducs D Anjou,No Negative, It was my wife s birthday I asked for flowers and Champagne as a surprise and they did As a surprise the hotel gave us an upgrade a suit So for us it was super
