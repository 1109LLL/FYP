457425,The Stafford London, The room wallpaper is from a day gone by but adds to the charm of the experience I suppose , Absolutely 5 star service from the moment we walked in The entire experience room restaurant bar staff was elegant without being pretentious If you want to do Central London you couldn t have nicer more convenient accommodations Not sure how big The Stafford is but it has a very quiet and boutique presence in the middle of London The bed and the bathroom were to die for 
457426,The Stafford London, we were booked in a standard room wanted a larger room and were willing to pay as well they upgraded us to a junior suite as no other larger room was available for more than 100 GBP to our utter shock we realised that the so called junior suite was located outside the main building on ground floor the junior suite had connectivity issues and no network was available we complained about it as well the duty manager offered to change the room as soon as she could get one but we were not keen to stay in 3 different rooms for 3 nights the duty manager then agreed to waive off the upgrade charges when i asked her to consider our plight she gave a further discount on our stay , the staff at the breakfast venue were very hospitable
457427,The Stafford London, Staff really not that friendly or attentive to details nothing like the fabulous staff at the Wellesley Drinks offer as mentioned above only included soft drinks Also worth noting that I was aware the hotel had lots of empty rooms the night we stayed Seems a shame for the staff not to offer a room upgrade even for a small fee , Location ideal Bed very comfy and full size luxury bath previously stayed in the savoy but it only had a tiny bath We were offered a welcome drink But when we got to the bar the staff didn t know anythjng about it After finally getting a manger we were offered a limited selection of soft drinks which was a shame most hotels will include alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks or a cocktail Room was spacious and bed very comfy 
457428,The Stafford London, Nothing This was one of the best stays we have had in London, The room was large and very comfortable though this was partly because we had a free upgrade to one of the suites in the courtyard The bathroom was outstanding with a large shower and heated automatic toilet Breakfast was delicious and freshly cooked and all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly
457429,The Stafford London, Bed could have just been bigger we are used to super king sized it was however very comfy just not big enough, Beautiful Hotel loved the decor very friendly staff Lovely spacious room very English surroundings
457430,The Stafford London,No Negative, Wonderful staff Terrific bed and bathroom heated floor and toilet seat fun outdoor and bar eating Great shopping nearby Walking distance to many sites and Green Park 
457431,The Stafford London, Please see above , The room was well designed well furnished and very comfortable The electrical system was the only adverse feature which was far too complicated and resulted in no main light in the bathroom Breakfast was very good
457432,The Stafford London, Aside from the size of the room nothing , Food was good and room was comfortable albeit small Typical of a European room in an older building The comfort of the bed made up for it and although in a busy part of the city extremely quiet 
457433,The Stafford London, There was nothing at all to correct everything was perfect In fact I somehow dropped a precious diamond and sapphire earring without knowing it and when I returned at the end of the day the maid had found it and placed it in a dish on the desk Needless to say I was thrilled and will always trust the Stafford , What a beautiful hotel with excellent staff and an exquisite chef in the restaurant I really do not know what more one could want in central London the outside mews seating for the American Bar is a delight as is the proximity of the Park A wonderful experience all around I come to London 2 3 times per year and will certainly return here 
457434,The Stafford London, Nothing that we did not like however would of liked to have been informed of daily service charge in advance , Excellent service from all staff we dealt with comfortable room very comfortable bed 
457435,The Stafford London, Breakfast is served in two adjoining areas If you are unfortunate you will be given a table in the rear part as we were which has no natural light and is a gloomy place to start the day , The Stafford Hotel is situated in St James s Place a small and quiet street immediately off St James s Street It is an ideal location and had the bonus of allowing us to step out of the front door into Green Park for the start of our early morning walk The staff were friendly and the hotel was exactly what we wanted 
457436,The Stafford London, Breakfast was over priced for what was slow service, My room was very quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable The American Bar within the hotel is excellent a hidden gem 
457437,The Stafford London, It will be better if sound insulation is improved You can hear neighbors slamming doors in the morning and at night That s the only problem I have in 6 days , Everything is perfect The staff were friendly and helpful It s a very convienent safe and quite place to stay during nighttime Although the room is not big it s a historic hotel in zone 1 so I am totally fine with it Good place to stay in London 
457438,The Stafford London, The view on 3rd floor to an office building across implied that we for privacy had to draw the lighter curtains on friday but in the weekend it was empty Mattrass was extremely soft too much for me but after the first night staff changed it to another On the other side my daughter loved the soft mattrass Bathroom small but functional and with a nice large tub , Staff was very welcoming from the moment the taxi arrived and we were met by a broad welcoming smile and help with our suitcases Room was small with a lot of pretty mahogany furniture which gave little space but also made it functional and very cosy It was quiet and the windows could be opened Lots of storage space in closets and drawers Great pancakes for breakfast Charming and unique American Bar 
457439,The Stafford London, Room was very small and filled with too much furniture items Not enough room for two people and luggage , Great location Helpful staff Public areas well maintained 
457440,The Stafford London, Have already pointed out to the hotel that the bath drainage was very poor as was the standard of ventilation in the bathroom itself , Excellent staff hotel hospitality at its very best The bed was supremely comfortable better even than the beds at The Four Seasons 
457441,The Stafford London, Small room Food was below average Kitchen closes at midnight simple cold food after midnight , Large bathroom They upgraded me to a junior suite All Basic needs
457442,The Stafford London, There was no mirror near a plug so you could dry and style your hair There is no lighted make up mirror in the bathroom , The room was lovely the staff helpful and it looks like an English hotel should look 
457443,The Stafford London, I ve ordered boiled eggs for breakfast couldn t finish them and asked to send them to my room to eat later Which was done But then the cleaning stuff cleared the eggs away so I didn t have a chance to eat them It was fun , The breakfast selection was lovely
457444,The Stafford London,No Negative, the staff were wonderful from reception concierge american bar game bird restaurant attentive from start to finish i don t normally give reviews but The Stafford was great 
457445,The Stafford London, A common feature now with hotels but it would be nice to have a little fresh air in rooms To open a window just a little would be perfect , Thoughtful polite very helpful staff clean perfect location
457446,The Stafford London, The property is very nicely maintained but tired Regarding the room part of the view was a tile wall across an alley We had what was billed as an upgraded king room which was so small that it did not have room to place a suitcase on a rack It was difficult to get from the far side of the bed to the door bathroom There was only one useable drawer The tub was elevated and doubled as shower It was dangerously difficult to stand in it The finishes were dated and for example the lamps were just plain cheap I do not think that the hotel qualifies as five star based on the rooms , The staff is excellent helpful and friendly 
457447,The Stafford London, I love everything about this hotel , From the moment you arrived the staff were warm and welcoming Our room was beautifully decorated and a good size with a luxurious bathroom and the most comfortable bed and pillows I have ever experienced The American Bar has so much atmosphere and is a wonderful location to meet other guests and other city workers as a guest of the hotel you can reserve a table and eat from an extensive bar menu if you wanted a more informal evening The main restaurant has just recently been refurbished and is beautiful a great improvement on their original design with great music not too loud and a delicious new menu to boot The location is quiet but still only a 10 15 min walk to the National Art Gallery 
457448,The Stafford London, My room was a bit tight the windows were closed all the time i could not open it I wish if i had a better view wih a fresh air coming along from the window , Typical british
457449,The Stafford London, Unfortunately restaurant renovations were in progress so meals were taken in a dedicated lounge area or The American Bar All served perfectly well but the tables were a little low , Full English breakfast was extremely well cooked and served Eggs Royal likewise 
457450,The Stafford London, The food was good not great breakfast quite expensive and nothing special , The bed was comfortable and the room just lovely Every amenity was considered The bar is wonderful 
457451,The Stafford London, The room was a little tight really The bathroom really needs a do over mouldy grouting mastic For a place that costs around 280 per night should be better maintained Main gripe would be the breakfast 31 for the breakfast is pretty steep I d say Yes you can have fruit croissants and fry up fish eggs florentine etc but really how much can you eat for 31 The cherry on the top of the 31 was the 2x service charges that they pop onto the bill at the end which you can red facedly ask them to take off but lets face it not many would One charge at 13 per day and another at around 7 per day Bringing the daily cost of breakfast to 82 for 2 people which I think is rather galling Shame As the 31 was enough to bare to begin with , A lovely quiet discrete hotel tucked away behind Green Park Staff very kind attentive and helpful Healthy sort of fry up Very squishy yet comfy bed Super sheets and pillows 
457452,The Stafford London,No Negative, Helpful staff amazing food at the American Bar best fish chips I ve had and very good afternoon tea as well Rooms are very well equipped 
457453,The Stafford London, Room was small but expected as this is typical in EU Westminister Portions of the room showing slight signs of wear corner of a wall scuffed dented from high frequency of guests literally 1 minute with paint would look 200 better Otherwise rooms was quaint and relaxing , Location was amazing close to big sites and tube Staff was available and attentive Room was equipped with all std high class amenities comfortable and clean We very much enjoyed the restaurant attached to the lobby as they served a complete delicious English breakfast variety of afternoon teas with impeccable service in a dignified setting 
457454,The Stafford London, The English breakfast in bed seemed a tiny little over priced but was still lovely , The lead staff were very friendly and wanted to go above and beyond the bed was super comfortable and evening turn down was perfect Breakfast in bed was amazing and came quickly I wouldn t stay anywhere else in London now I have been here 
457455,The Stafford London, Dining area is mixed with lounge and has odd low tables , Old fashioned quiet discrete but excellent service Beautiful decorated rooms and super comfortable beds 
457456,The Stafford London, Nothing I can think of Of course expensive but fair value compared to other hotels at this category level, 1 Fantastic service from all staff 2 Great food in restaurant for Breakfast Dinner 3 Luxurious in discreet understated way very relaxing 4 Great location for central London but quiet with direct access to Green Park 5 Overall Feel Good Factor 6 Great bar full of character for evening drinks
457457,The Stafford London, nothing, Cosy boutique style hotel in a great location The staff were always friendly and courteous and made us feel very welcome from check in till departure The room and its decor was nice and the bed was super comfortable Definitely a place we want to come back to 
457458,The Stafford London, We were sent a form prior to arrival about requirements etc for the room It also asked if it was a special occasion which it was our wedding Nothing was done for that or even mentioned by the staff Seems rather pointless in asking if one is not going to do something special Also the bar has a great atmosphere filled with memorabilia However a bit of attention needs to paid to the cleaning of the objects There was a lot of dust on some of the pictures , The location is ideal Staff extremely polite and helpful It seems to be looked after well and run well too It has almost a club feel to it 
457459,The Stafford London, as other guests have already highlighted bed is too soft, Great hotel with amazing staff Certainly a fabulous experience for a special occasion in London 
457460,The Stafford London, They failed to show me how to turn off the air blown heating system that rattled all night , We were over charged for our two breakfasts and I object to a 10 service charge being added to the bill when their prices are sky high 
457461,The Stafford London, Some staff incl receptionist and restaurant manager had such poor understanding of English that significant mistakes were made Why was room equipped with only coffee making facilities and we had to ask for tea making facilities Expensive for what we had not helped by hidden service charge of over 10 in bar Plumbing noises far too audible at night, Location decor and ambience Mostly very helpful staff esp conciege 
457462,The Stafford London, Hard to imagine what to improve The rooms are well equipped so can feel cosy and I had to make room for a work surface by moving the coffee maker etc There is a discretionary service charge of 5 added to the room charge on billing While I am OK with this provided that all the money does actually go the staff I think there should be more transparency on this at check in perhaps provide the option then , I usually stay at The Stafford when in Central London This stay was like others so relaxed and comfortable in all respects The top floor room was so quiet that it was hard to believe I was in the Centre of London The breakfast is highly recommended clearly cooked to order and immaculately presented Wifi is excellent throughout and the staff friendly and engaging 
457463,The Stafford London, For over 1000 per night I would have expected better service I ordered a pot of tea to be delivered to the lounge area which I had been told was available and no one seemed to know how to accomplish that After 20 minutes it still hadn t arrived When I asked about it it was obvious that the order had been lost and it was another 10 minutes for it to arrive There was no outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer They had special plugs for electric razors but the hair dryer furnished by the hotel couldn t be plugged in I had to use it in the bedroom which was disruptive to family members who were still trying to sleep A light bulb was out in the bathroom and no one noticed for a couple of days Even with all light bulbs burning the lighting in the bathroom was terrible It was so dark it was difficult to put on makeup There was a New Year s Eve event in the restaurant which overflowed into the lounge area for hotel guests We came back to relax for a while between dinner and fireworks and had to sit it our room for over 2 hours since we couldn t use the hotel s public spaces This is my fourth trip to London and I will be returning to the hotel I have stayed in before Won t be back , Bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in Location was fabulous during the daytime 
457464,The Stafford London, Stayed in a mews suite there was no mobile phone reception and there was construction work and people creating noise , Food in the American bar was very good 
457465,The Stafford London, Probably overpriced despite upgrade to king size bed Only two Nespresso capsules provided and although others could be brought to the room this was not convenient early in the morning No hairdryer in room Shower was reasonably small for such a starred hotel Not 8 rating for the price range and location , Fun welcoming multilingual staff Comfy bed and very good bath products Floris Room small but adequate Nespresso machine in room Good access to tubes and local sights Decor pleasant 
457466,The Stafford London, There is are 2 large tables just outside the dining area between the 2 fireplaces that are used for breakfast and large families The chairs are way too low for the tables We saw other guests also ask for extra cushions to prop themselves up higher , We particularly enjoyed the beautifully appointed room and extremely comfortable bed 
457467,The Stafford London, Restaurant staff sometimes did not listen to our food requirements particularly at breakfast The Xmas Eve Dinner did not represent value for money whilst prepared and cooked well it was disappointing in that it was quite average, Staff were friendly and courteous Location of hotel was excellent for all places to visit
457468,The Stafford London, The waiting staff in the restaurant were new and not trained to the standard of the other staff , The hotel staff were excellent from start to finish 
457469,The Stafford London, Bathroom could have been bigger but we managed fine , The decor was rich and opulent very well laid out and everything was of a high standard Nothing was to much trouble staff were all pleasant and very helpful 
457470,The Stafford London, Not really a dislike more an observation the payment of 340 was taken or held overnight Friday although booked as pay on arrival This could have caused problems if I hadn t checked before we left home, The American Bar english breakfast xmas tree in room
457471,The Stafford London,No Negative, Staff very helpfull Hotel location is great Hotel itself is very good Breakfast is very good you can choose from the card what you want and not just have scramled egg with beans and sausages 
457472,The Stafford London, We did have poor service at breakfast one morning but the graciousness of rest of staff more than made up form it , Charm welcoming spirit of staff made you feel at home 
457473,The Stafford London, The choice of whole meal bread used for both toast and the bacon sandwich that I ordered for breakfast were dreadful some awful cheap sunblest entirely tasteless Not at all what I would expect in a good restaurant , Lovely service as you would expect of a 5 star hotel The lady in the bar was absolutely charming 
457474,The Stafford London, Room could have used an update Breakfast was inordinately expensive I was charged 5 50 for toast in British pounds when I had ordered eggs a la carte eggs tea and toast 28 pounds no juice no extras plus gratuity I am used to 5 star hotels but I felt thjis was out of range, I found the hotel staff delightful welcoming and helpful Loved my bathtub sheets towels and amenities
457475,The Stafford London, The bathroom size is good however the shower is too small and cramped Perhaps when next they renovate they can remove the tubs in some of the rooms and create more space for the shower I never use tubs in hotels unless it s the only choice I have and it has the shower attachments , The boutique sophistication of the hotel The room was spacious and the bed was cozy I absolutely loved the American bar The decor the story behind it and mainly the great drinks The location is just perfect and the park next to it really adds to the charm and beauty 
457476,The Stafford London, Nothing it was perfect, Everything From the moment we entered he Hotel the staff were wonderful as was the service and quality of food and wines Location was perfect 
457477,The Stafford London, No hot water in bathroom for entire stay Wedding anniversary was thus completely ruined as neither of us was able to wash bath or shower at all Appalling ,No Positive
457478,The Stafford London, Restaurant front of house reprimanded waiting staff in our hearing did not speak very nicely to her, Bed that you sink into so comfortable great night s sleep Lovely outlook and very pretty room
457479,The Stafford London,No Negative, Few hotels maintain a high quality of staff and service over many years The Stafford has done so Moreover the rooms are well furnished and decorated with excellent amenities And the concierges are brilliant at finding theater tickets and recommending restaurants As one who travels extensively my opinion is that The Stafford continues to earn full marks 
457480,The Stafford London, Room service was a bit slow and when it arrived the tea was cold but that is a very small gripe and when I complained at reception they credited my bill immediately , The bed was amazing The most comfortable I have ever slept in The whole hotel just oozes luxury and it is one of the only London hotels that I cannot wait to return to 
457481,The Stafford London, Little more wardrobe space if staying more than one night but given this hotel is full of character and rooms limited by size might be difficult to achieve , Having traveled extensively this year we were very pleasantly surprised to find we receive exactly what we booked From arrival to departure we received 5 star service the staff were 100 from doorman to waiters and bar staff We declined to pay the extra 80 for a king size bed but were comfortable in the booked queen size room However if we had been staying more than the one night I think we might have opted for the upgrade They offered a tea tray which duly arrived while we were out though the coffee machine was fine Breakfast was till 11 00am which is a nice change having been to a late dinner dance the evening before and food of good variety and quality Even sough dough bread The American Bar at the rear where they also serve food through the day was a wonderful surprise with a well protected courtyard and overhead portable heaters for milder days all in all a great find well decorated and furnished will return when next in London
457482,The Stafford London, The bed was a little too soft for my liking but very sumptuous I m sure perfect for most , The staff were very welcoming and the room was 5 star luxury Lovely decor in hotel Breakfast was delicious
457483,The Stafford London, They gave me the worst room ever i saw in my life which was not the same what i reserve through booking when i checked out the deduct from me one night extra penalty , Nothing i like it it was 2 star hotel experience
457484,The Stafford London, Bad air conditioning Bad only one elevator Whole day Maintenance Bad location Service room close by guest rooms You hear the door open and close most of the day The hotel will try to find any reason to charge your credit card , Bed is conformably
457485,The Stafford London, 1 The location is not easy to find 2 Its quite noisy at night because of the bar 3 The hotel charged me unbelievable phone bill They said I made a phone call to Brazil I think one of a cleaner used the phone ,No Positive
457486,The Stafford London, The bed was way too soft I woke up with a sore back The air conditioning was loud Apart from that there s nothing else to say , Everybody was just so friendly The location is fantastic and the buildings are charming The decoration is tasteful and the rooms are generous in size 
457487,The Stafford London, The wifi service was terrible with receptionist asking for firewall to be removed on the computer before a wifi service could be provided The breakfast chefs were very poor to the point of being ridiculous for being a 5 star Hotel Kippers served in a big pile 40 min after request the next day traditional English breakfast served 2 min after request very poorly cooked Sunny side up eggs were baked scrambled eggs were runny to be point of being half cooked In essence this hotel wins on style but loses out completely on detail Not a 5 star proposition at all, Good location nice room very clean and turnover service good The shower however was positively dangerous with one person in the shower and one in the bath opening a tab in the bath changes temperature water in the shower whilst person in shower cannot get out due to cramped space 
457488,The Stafford London, Disturbed sleep a couple of nights due to a screaming child in nearby room Our room located opposite what appeared to be a staffroom where staff went to smoke Not good Prices in minibar excessive , Bed very comfortable turn down service excellent liked the sunken bath Great T V and we were there during a mini heatwave so grateful for the superb aircon Staff were very attentive Location excellent quiet but not far off the buzz of Piccadilly Little bits of history everywhere 
457489,The Stafford London, Room was very small and very basic although I was only able to have an entry level Queen room The hotel is quite dated including decor compared to other London hotels I ve stayed at and I thought for that reason 5 stars is pushing it , Staff were excellent very helpful and professional The terrace is a great feature and the bar welcoming and traditional Concierge were experienced helpful and welcoming Good breakfast 
457490,The Stafford London, Waking up and seeing the office staff from the window close by staring into our bedroom , Lovely continental breakfast in Bar Quiet and friendly setting in the morning
457491,The Stafford London, Nothing , The unusual and characterful mews layout the Carriage House room we stayed in extremely comfortable bed and the flawless service Thanks to Eddy and Liz at the front desk for making our stay a pleasurable one The Stafford is by far our favourite hotel in London 
457492,The Stafford London, I was upgraded to a superior room which was a smoking room this was not pleasant and I woke to a strong smell of smoke which resulted in an irritation to my sinuses and my breathing In addition it was adjacent to the outside seating area in the bar which meant it was noisy until quite late then once the clients had all finished there was a lot of noise of bottles and empties being moved In the morning there was a lot of noise early on for me this spoilt what should have been a very relaxing overnight stay and as a result I did not stay in London to enjoy myself sunday but drove home as I was tired and felt I needed the rest Please give more consideration to non smokers that means under no circumstances do we wish to experience second hand smoke in any situation , The service was excellent and staff pleasant but there was an issue that made the stay very uncomfortable 
457493,The Stafford London, Couldn t get in for breakfast as they were full and we were asked to wait This was at 9 25am and it didn t look as if anyone was leaving soon Others were waiting ahead of us so we had breakfast elsewhere Disappointed about that , Staff very helpful Very nice position Lovely room Would love to go back soon 
457494,The Stafford London, The room is small Deluxe King Pillows are not comfortable Not efficient flushing system Very noisy of the doors keep opening closing in the morning the guest walking in the room above me , Friendly staff Great location in Central London just a few mins walk to Green Park Comfy bed air con is good 
457495,The Stafford London, We were given a room we did not request but were told we had asked for through Booking Com It Was a room right outside of the American Bar with a lot of smokers and the smoke permeated our room, The staff reacted very quickly to our dislike of our room
457496,The Stafford London, Hotel needs a more thorough overhaul to look feel more up to date starting with the hotel entrance Main door to room needs serious isolation as all is heard to the minutest detail from the corridor and presumable vice versa Indiscrete Get rid of the shower curtains unfathomable that they are still in use Simply unhygienic Otherwise good bathroom , Very comfortable bedding and linens 
457497,The Stafford London, What s not to like , I accidentally made a non refundable reservation for the wrong date They were kind enough to allow me to change the date We were upgraded to master suite Breakfest was great a bit pricy there are plenty of other breakfest options in the area So we had some days at the hotel other days in a cafe up the street Great location close to everything yet very quiet 
457498,The Stafford London, The only thing I dislike was some noise from the bath , Fantastic hotel very attentive staff concierge very helpful the lady who made up my room did it the way as the room was her own I would definitely recomend this hotel
457499,The Stafford London, There was nothing I didn t like enough to complain about, Bedroom was roomy and we ll set out bed and pillows comfortable American bar in hotel very good had food twice in the bar and both times really good quality
457500,The Stafford London, I booked this hotel as a Booking com Genious and was eligible for an early check in and a welcome drink none of these were available which was not a problem but rather an observation of the modus operandi Booking com is having with the hotels , Beautiful outdoor bar area with exceptional service Room was nice and clean with comfortable bed 
457501,The Stafford London,No Negative, The staff are amazing very helpful and not intrusive They made our visit Great location for theatres shopping and the parks Went to see Sunset Boulevard at the ENO amazing and a short walk back to a welcoming bar at the hotel to finish off a great birthday treat 
457502,The Stafford London, Absolutely nothing Home from home, Wonderfully friendly and comfortable Charming staff that as a solo traveller for business couldn t do enough to help I think this is now my new favourite hotel in London So worth the money 
457503,The Stafford London, Our fault but we did not stay long enough to sample the delights of the American Bar , Friendly staff Excellent beds the best we have ever slept in No noise Clean modern gym facility 
457504,The Stafford London, The room was especially small The bathroom was hard to fit into The shower curtain was pushed into the tub It was hard to take a shower , The Stafford is a nice quiet boutique hotel in the St James area which is very convenient to shops monuments and restaurants
457505,The Stafford London, A traditional British hotel loved by all has been modernised to be less than than satisfactory It has little or no character and might just as well be a block of Service Apartments rather than a hotel in one of the nicest parts of London , Location is great as is the bar 
457506,The Stafford London, I don t appreciate having to wait in the lobby for a breakfast table in the dining area Breakfast was good but overpriced , The rooms are not huge but the furnishings feel palatial Room service was very pleasant 
457507,The Stafford London, I could not get a drink in the evening both the bar and the lounge were full There was not enough accomodation for staying guests Coffee at breakfast was disgustingly weak , The convenience 
457508,The Stafford London, I only wish I had a slightly bigger bathroom not next to the door , The service is welcoming professional well trained a delight in today s modern world The beds are so comfortable I hope to be back next year Michelle M Peters
457509,The Stafford London, To be picky it was a pity we only had coffee facilities in the room Would like to have had tea fizzy water maybe some biscuits at least as additions The bath robes were worn and lacked luxury , A lovely central but quiet location the hotel oozes charm and character The room was comfortable and a good size though not over large No views But good bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space The staff were helpful attentive and happy We had a lovely stay Comfortably decorated for Christmas it was so welcoming without being extrovert 
457510,The Stafford London, Over the years of staying here I ve realised you only have a 50 chance of getting exactly the breakfast you order but I accept it now as an idiosyncrasy of the hotel This time they got it right , The location the staff the luxury
457511,The Stafford London, very noisy you can hear every thing happening near to you No 24 restaurant service the hotel is like going back 100 years in the history, good location excellent staff and good room services good to try for one day
457512,The Stafford London, My booking stated that I should have received a welcome cocktail however this was not offered provided Next time maybe , This is a classic high standing British hotel Very well and nicely furnished it offers a level of confort well in line with the 5 stars rating I appreciated the room s bed and lining you may choose different pillows and isolation from rumors Excellent but expensive american bar Excellent location in a quiet street in central London area 
457513,The Stafford London, My room was actually on a back street and had the hotel restaurant tables by its doors People chatting prevented me from sleeping before 00 30 for two consecutive nights , The interior of the room 
457514,The Stafford London, Decor and smell, Hotel has major sewer problem was told last time I stayed I would be taken care of this time but ended up in smaller room and had to upgrade and pay extra 200 to get ok room
457515,The Stafford London, Bathroom door didn t shut properly and breakfast very expensive but probably typical of this calibre hotel, Location good yet peaceful hotel and comfortable bed

457526,The Stafford London, I have stayed there many times but on this occasion the bathroom I had was very small and narrow , A lovely small hotel in a very quiet location
457527,The Stafford London,No Negative, Hotel location was ideal for a family celebration nearby and as we had stayed at the Stafford before we were not disappointed
