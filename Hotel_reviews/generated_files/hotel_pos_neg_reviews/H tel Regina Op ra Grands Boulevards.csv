33660,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, The room we got was very small compared to what was shown in the photos There wasn t much space to put the toddler s bed for our son Also the bathroom arrangement was bit awkward as it would have been helpful to have more space for toiletries , The room and bathroom were done to a good modern standard and the staff were very helpful The location is very good for walking to a number of attractions and has a number of restaurants and grocery stores nearby 
33661,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Wi Fi was ABSOLUTELY terrible Fridge smelled EXTREMELY BAD and wasn t cold Location of hotel was in a sketchy neighborhood Views were obsolete , The layout of room was nice Close to train station 
33662,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Wifi was patchy annoyingly , Lovely modern rooms USB ports didn t work for charging devices but having them there ws a good idea Loved the warm red room and some 5th floor rooms open onto a terrace via french doors which was gorgeous Would stay here again

33666,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, The night time staff who was less than friendly The shoe box size room The ridiculous hand held shower The price of breakfast at 15 e each which we didn t have , Not a great deal If it hadn t been for the day time reception staff would have rated this hotel lower He was lovely and extremely helpful 
33667,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Smell outside the hotel Air condition wasn t working first day had to sleep in hot weather Breakfast not that good, The receiptionist Raphel Location not bad Near shopping area with good prices 3 different metro stations around
33668,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, In Europe not just Paris ALL hotel rooms are rather small in comparison to hotel rooms that us Americans are used to in the U S , The front desk staff member Cecilia provided exemplary customer service and was extremely helpful during my stay in France Cecilia has a great personality is very intelligent and did a great job with giving me directions to the historic landmarks that I wanted to see in Paris 
33669,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Traveling in July and our first room had no a c so they moved us to the 6th floor which sort of had a c Our room happened to be a room where the ceiling slants in for the roof so you had to be careful over there We were only there for 2 days with plans to see Versailles and the louvre so we didn t do much walking past the metros This was the only of 5 hotels I stayed in during my trip that did not include breakfast It was 15 per person so we skipped that part can t review the food , Very close to metro updated interior locked doors at night with 24 hour front desk It was very easy to get to the cdg airport by metro train and less than 12 person instead of the 60 they charge for a cab and took about an hour There is a great Chinese place outside the hotel and a grocery store around the corner 
33670,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Air conditioning in our room did not work properly We were switched to another room with AC that only functioned part of the time The staff told us that they were aware of this issue and were trying to have it fixed but based on other reviews here this problem has been ongoing for over a month The weather in Paris during our stay happened to be unusually hot so it was quite uncomfortable Bath towels were small and not very absorbent they seem to be old and thinned out and could use replacing , Staff including cleaning staff were extremely helpful and kind There was a mixup on our bill on check out where breakfast had been mistakenly added this was corrected immediately and with no conflict Room size was good and showers had good pressure 
33671,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, Awakened me alarm at 1 00 am in the morning without any special reason There was no hot water one day reception did not know when the hot water would come Once there the hot water was brown Disgusting In front of the hotel homeless lying several days on the car all day Around the hotel all smells like piss and garbage It is very seedy around the hotel Shady characters around the hotel retain Additional homeless at the beginning of the street Someone threw toilet seat several meters from hotel entrance and it was there all time The room was extremely small about 10 square meters and it was in the attic and was required to duck when entering the bed and going to the toilet Breakfast is even 15 euros per person which is too much No chair to sit there is only one stool In the hallway outside the room is stuffy the elevator is old and slow as the hotel probably Shower is extremely small Until late at night the noise and the noise in the vicinity of the hotel hundred disrupts sleep because of the need to open the window in order to have fresh air Descent on foot to the center accompanied by sex shops , Free wifi in room Metro station near hotel The room was clean 
33672,H tel Regina Op ra Grands Boulevards, We had a big problem with air conditioning We had two rooms and in both the air condition was not working They told us that there was a problem and they will fix very soon but they were not telling he truth Every time we consulted with the reception they were telling a different story and it was obvious they were trying to buy time We asked them to change he room and this did not happen until after two days of non sleeping because of the heat and humidity I asked to speak to a manager but they said she were busy Very un professional staff It was a big disappointment I wonder how did they got a high rating,No Positive
