420791,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Lack of good size reception area room cost was expensive as was breakfast cost Most staff were pleasant and helpful but sadly a couple let the rest down , Location was convenient 
420792,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Breakfast was underwhelming at 17 50 per person friends we travelled with saw a mouse in the breakfast room, Really good location room was cozy and overlooked the canal
420793,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, the rooms were large with nice seating area and good facilities mini bar coffee machine iron etc Great view of the canal Lovely breakfast with delicious omelet and pancakes Very polite and helpful staff 
420794,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Leaving the key with the front desk each time you step out though I can see the benefits does detract a bit from feeling independent I d prefer not having to check in with someone at the desk to get my key everytime I came in from a stroll , Very comfortable bed the comfort queen rooms were great I did not have a view but had great light in the room The location is perfect for walking historic amsterdam with nightlife and necesseties banks pharmacy coffee right at your front door A beautiful 10 minute walk up the canal gets you to the Anne Frank House 
420795,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The room had a carpet so dirty fresh vomit on it would have had no effect In dire need on a gut job this skanky and filthy hotel capitalizes on its location but is horrible and absurdly overpriced , Only the location 
420796,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Breakfast was expensive so we went to nearby cafes instead , We had a lovely big room and huge bathroom with a great view of the canal It was really well situated we could walk to all the sights including the Van Gogh Museum and Ann Frank s House within 20 minutes 
420797,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Light on the ceiling A C unit was quite bright so we covered it with tape , Fantastic location basic but inviting comfortable room It s our go to property when in AMS 
420798,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Unable to open windows Slight noise from street but not unacceptable , The room we had overlooked the shops and tramline great for people watching The room and bathroom were large with adequate storage There was a very well stocked minibar and also tea coffee making facilities Lots of plug sockets Breakfast was in lovely dining area and very plentiful with good choice Heating control in room was great Great location near to lots of attractions both walking and using tram Staff were very polite friendly and helpful Room was cleaned and tidied daily 
420799,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, If you want basic and clean there is nothing to dislike, Excellent location in a busy area but heard no noise due to double glazed windows perfect hotel for a weekend getaway
420800,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, At the beginning we got a room in the old building which is not recommended Always ask for the new building, Staff is amazing helpful and cooperative Room 304 superior canal view is unbelievable great with view to the canal and to the street Location is superb the leidsplain is 50 meters away and the tram station with the most important lines is just below the hotel
420801,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Hard to find your room Get off on 2 go up a stair around the hall Up a steep flight of stairs and around the building carrying luggage, Friendly staff Wonderful meal
420802,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Bathroom needs an upgrade including hairdryer for this price point , Staff breakfast size of room and location were terrific Very convenient to the beautiful sights of Amsterdam 
420803,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Not much really, Great service from the front desk Comfortable room and nice bathroom Room was quiet at night Delicious breakfast downstairs where you can have the buffet or order off a menu 
420804,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, No issues , Excellent location with friendly young staff who knew their business The breakfast service was first class The room we had was wonderful with a view of the city and the canal outside the door of the hotel We would return and highly recommend this hotel 
420805,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The lack of elevator all the way to our floor was a strain on my injuries , Location near transport and eateries Central to many sites we wanted to see 
420806,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Weather was cool so we were not able to enjoy the outdoor pool area But the inside bar was just fine Morning breakfast was more than satisfactory , Property was conveniently located on a busy canal with public tram transportation at the front door Lots and lots of restaurants within a 5 minute walk in any direction Great coffee house one minute away and a pastry shop across the street 
420807,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, While it is in the quaint and central Grachtengordel or horseshoe shaped streets along the canals the hotel is a few blocks away from the upscale restaurants and stores It is in a neighbourhood that almost verges on seedy Further the rooms are quite noisy at night on the first and second floors The fourth floor is quieter Finally the rooms and bathrooms are serviceable but not attractive The rooms walls are painted a stark white that shows the many scuff marks that guests and service personnel have left behind The furniture is a matching set but that is all that can be said about it The rooms and bathrooms lack charm and look like they were done up in the eighties The hotel dining room is quite chic they ought to get that decorator to design the rooms , The hotel is conveniently located near the 2 and 5 tram lines and within walking distance of the Van Gogh museum and the 9 streets 
420808,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The only down side is that the bar is not the busiest place in the world and once people leave it is all locked up for the evening This means that you are unable to get a drink after hours even if you are a resident There is no separate lounge area for residents and this would be a brilliant addition to the hotel, The hotel location is fantastic Really close to all the attractions The tram stop is right outside great for getting around The canals are beautiful and you step out of the front entrance onto the canal Loads of bars nearby The Penthouse suite was lovely and well worth the extra pennies Would definitely visit the hotel again
420809,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We were in Room 205 and recommend that you replace the mattress It was soft and felt that it had reached the end of its life span , Great location nice hotel friendly staff excellent lunch 
420810,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Amsterdam has to be the dirtiest city I have ever visited Bins were overflowing and no sign of any refuse collection being done , Lovely location beside the canal but close to restaurants 
420811,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Didn t have breakfast but sounded a bit pricey didn t see other options but hadn t planned to eat at the hotel anyway as was a short stay But happy , Great staff I like that they didn t wear a uniform so less formal 
420812,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, It s a bit noisy but that is to be expected for being in the middle of everything and located on a busy corner with tramway at the door , Location is fantastic walkable distance to everything restaurants and transit at the door Museum district very close by lots of shopping options 
420813,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We were in room 204 which although it was right on the corner and overlooking the canal and street was very noisy and bright They had very heavy drapes that did help some The bathroom was so bright that you needed no light at all at night and we had to keep the door closed against the light The main problem is that the large lights that were shining on the hotel also were shining into the room I d suggest a higher floor , This a great location and we had a superior room that was very large and comfortable with a nice sitting area 
420814,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Nothing I can think of , We had the suite on the top floor and the view was just amazing over the city It was perfect to celebrate Mother s Day and a birthday Public transport is right outside but not too noisy and breakfast is served fresh We enjoyed our 6 days there 
420815,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Horrendously expensive could get luxurious room at the Ritz London for same price Here rooms were faded and modest but beds were really comfortable and we had big rooms Guess it s the price of staying in the heart of Amsterdam with a canal view It s on a busy junction right near lively Leidespkan very noisy at night trams clanging horns blaring car alarms going off I didn t mind too much it was all part of the atmosphere and I still slept well but would not suit everyone , Loved the staff fabulous central location lively area pleasant canal view bar and breakfast It really contributed to our holiday Handy for main trams Hop on hop off canal boats stop right outside
420816,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Would have given it more stars if the bed was not so uncomfortable It is springy and mattress is too soft My husband pulled down the mattress and slept on the floor as his back was aching after the first night Requested a wood base to be placed underneath the mattress the next night and it was promptly attended to , Stayed 5 nights Great location as there is a tram stop outside hotel Nos 1 2 and 5 takes you directly to Amsterdam Central Train Station 20 mins and several tourist stops along the way Many restaurants and shops in the area Hotel staff were excellent and with great attitude and smiles when attending to guests Air conditioning works very well Room was surprising big and clean Great water pressure in the shower too Great view from top floor
420817,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, If I was being picky I would say the only downside was the view from our window had not paid for a canal view so got what we expected which was not much Aside from the view the room was awesome , Great location easy to walk everywhere Stylish decoration and pleasant helpful staff Did not have breakfast so cannot comment although the smells from the resturant were tempting 
420818,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, , Excellent location and large room near tramp line near many interesting attractions and most important very friendly staff The restaurant bellow is really good including personnel
420819,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Give information about the bus 197 transport from AirPort to Hotel beforehand Encellet choice instead of expensive taxi , Airy Room and comfortable beds 
420820,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Breakfast buffet selection could have been slightly larger but it was fine , Canal view suite Friendly staff Ideal location Close to major tram lines in all directions
420821,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Whilst the facilities were ok I was expecting a bit more for the money Sound proofing could be improved , The 5th floor room with canal view was excellent and the hotel is in a perfect location The tram stop is directly outside with trams every 2 mins The gentlemen who checked us in could not have been more helpful for the whole stay 
420822,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Refusal to provide me with any full or partial after the documented death of my father eleven days before I was due to be there The room could have easily been rented Both Booking com and the hotel rate as ripoff artists in my book, Nothing
420823,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Morning coffee came from a machine Not the best tasting Seems the bean the machine used wAs changed after 3 days Then the coffee was a disappointment , Large room for European standards Friendly staff and access to public transportation was excellent 
420824,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Did get a little noisy at night on the street at the weekend , The room was spacious the view was great the staff were friendly and very helpful It was nice to be close to the action but not too close The restaurant downstairs was also very pleasant 
420825,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Most staff seemed friendly but the daytime reception staff were a bit cold Maybe it was cultural but it definitely wasn t welcoming The restaurant staff and night staff were all wonderful ,No Positive
420826,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I liked everything Not one thing I didn t like , The front desk help was wonderful A true delight to stay at The morning brekfast was a delight every morning 
420827,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, 1 Seen a rat twice in the breakfast room The staff explained that it s because it s cold nowadays and there is an old building next to it But surely there isn t anything in the room it was very clean 2 The breakfast is abit expensive Might consider lowering the price to about 15 Also it s very limited and always the same things 3 MAYBE you get annoyed with the noise at night For me I didn t find difficulty sleeping I could hear sound from the street but it wasn t too loud , 1 The rooms are big you have everything you need 2 Alber Hijn is very close which you can buy whatever you need 3 Many restaurants and dessert shops just opposite to the hotel 4 Very friendly staff 5 Requested halal food and got some turkey chicken 5 We were lucky and got a canal view 6 Good typical breakfast Would recommend trying it once and then consider if it s worth it 
420828,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Comfortable beds Friendly reception staff especially Camiel Stunning location on the canal close to Metro major sights Close to negende straatjes for the best cafes and restaurants
420829,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I thought it was great , Very good breakfast plus having a bar restaurant down stairs always meant we could get food and drink without having to go out also really helpful staff nothing was too much bother 
420830,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Even though we were on the fourth floor it was a noisy at night We had to close the windows , The bed room had a great view with wonderful windows It was very light and airy Great bathroom 
420831,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The bad is a little bit too small for 2 adults But no such a problem , Very charming and cosy hotel The location is excellente it is within a short walk from all the attractions It is good connected to the airport you take the train sprinter to Lelyaan station than tram no 1 and in 15 minutes and for 8 you are in front of the hotel the station Prinsegracht that is one of the three famous canal All around there are good restaurants and cafes Anne Franks house is 1km away The hotel is clean the staff is nice and polite the breakfast has a great variaty of very good quality The rooms are not too small as I expected for the thiny houses there are and if you get the one that looks the canal the feeling is complete We will come back for sure All compliments to the management and the staff of the hotel 
420832,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Trams a little noisy, excellent location on tram and boat routes Still within walking distance of centre and attractions Had comfortable double room on 5th floor with small balcony and view of canal and the roof tops of Amsterdam 
420833,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, It would be good to know that there were other options for breakfast rather than just the 17 50 euros per person per night I thought that was the only option , The room we stayed in was large and spacious with all the amenities we needed The location was right on the road but quiet The staff were excellent and very helpful 
420834,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Nothing , Absolutely fantastic hotel Very friendly and helpful staff great breakfast gorgeous and clean rooms brilliant location I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough 
420835,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The building is a bit old, The location is superb near the tram station the stores are around the corner walking distance to museumplein Eventhough the building is a bit old but the room size and the view are awesome Definitely will come back to this hotel 
420836,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The room and hotel was very dated Except from the lobby and restaurant hotel needs a refurbishment throughout Pillows too big would be nice with a choice even in premier inn you get that I think we paid too much for what we got , Our room was spacious bright lots of windows and clean Beds were comfortable Location of the hotel was central several trams stopped just outside and good walking distance for most attractions Staff was friendly and helpful Food in restaurant was excellent 
420837,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Located in an area that s up all night not bad but it s quite noisy throughout the night, Employees were nice rooms were big location is convenient
420838,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Although the view from the window in our room was fab it was rather noisy as not double glazed we ended up buying ear plugs , very friendly and helpful staff breakfast was ok 
420839,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Decor needed updating Our room was very noisy We didn t get to sleep until 4 30am This hotel was overall not what we were expecting It felt quite soulless , Very helpful staff As we had a free upgrade the room was better than expected Location was good 
420840,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Poor value for money Bath is old fashioned the shower was leaking all the time out of the bath tub I fixed it myself but kept leaking Booked a comfort double room and asked for a room with a good view a month in advance I was told I should have paid more to guarantee a canal view one so I decided to not going fo it but ended up in a small double with an awful view something like and internal courtyard I paid around 400 euro for two nights and unfortunately they were not worth it for having a room like that Only 2 small shower towels are provided and 2 face ones if I haven t visited other hotels of the same range price in other countries this last month I would have probably rated the hotel better but i think it s too expensive for what it has been offered Friendly staff at least , Location is perfect friendly staff
420841,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The location is near some of the better known nightlife and it may be noisy from outside on weekend nights That s not a fault of the hotel at all just to be aware , Staff welcome and restaurant bar was genuine the food was seriously good and the location is perfect for getting around on foot or tram This is a really nice unpretentious small hotel 
420842,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Our room was relatively smaller than expected however we only requested a canal view and didn t go for extras The rooms was all perfectly suitable for our needs and comfortable bed fantastic however really quite small if your happy for a nice place to just put your head down then its spot on , Location great easy proximity to all areas you want to see Our friends had a small problem with there room air con dripping they were upgraded to an amazing room that would have easily cost them double very lucky customer service spot on no questions asked 
420843,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location Great breakfast lots of choice Room large comfortable with great view Helpful friendly staff Tram right outside Couldn t have got a better hotel Good value too 
420844,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Supplement for a canal view when the downside was a very noisy street environment that often disturbed sleeping , Friendly staff and very good breakfasts 
420845,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Breakfast was too expensive 17 50 pp a night so we did our own thing , The hotel was conveniently located beside shops pubs and restaurants The room was very homely with beams on the roof We loved that there were tea and coffee facilities in the room too 
420846,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Watch out for the well organized taxi mafia at Schipol airport They have official badges etc and stand at the official taxi rank Ignore them and just get in a taxi at the official rank , Good restaurant bar below the hotel Super location lots of bars and restaurants nearby plus an excellent whisky bar Easy to get to the RAI conference centre by taxi not too bad by tram 
420847,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The promised large bed was ultra small if u can call it a bed It was more like two mattresses one on top of each other The fitness room is only a room but no fitness facilities inside If u ask me it is 2 3 stars hotel definitely not 4 I wouldn t come back to this hotel unless I am looking only for a location , Cleen rooms Ideal location nice staff
420848,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Only one key that had to be handed in every time we went out Very thin walls loud noises throughout the night , The staff were friendly and the location was very good with a tram stop pretty much right outside 
420849,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful Everything that we needed was in the clean room apart from an extra blanket if needed It is central and easy to get to on public transport and close to museums and restaurants 
420850,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Only location the hotel may be good for young people lots of stairs and no body to help for carrying luggage I was supposed to stay one week but I stayed 3 night coz I have toVery bad hotel not convenient for middle age No service to carry luggage plus found rat on the breakfast area which they said this is normal , Norhing
420851,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Staff were somewhat less than enthusatic and add little to offer when asking for help Friendly just not more , nice room with a very nice review The room was plenty large and comfortable also quiet for a good rest Ar te at the restaurant and it enjoyed it Overall this a good value hotel 
420852,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I will never be happy for the double duvet nor for these too big and hard pillows which many hotels obviously we think guests like , Location View Tram the doorstep
420853,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The carpets and furniture seems quite old still yet acceptable , The location is excellent You can easily reach the place with public transportation from Schipol it takes less than 30min from Centraal Station app 10min All interesting places are actually in a walking distance and if you would like to party the best clubs are within 5min walk The room was spacious and comfortable We stayed on the 1st floor with a street view but still it wasn t noisy Breakfast is really good Overall we enjoyed our stay and we are satisfied with the level of comfort provided 
420854,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, state they have a gym but they have three pieces of cardio equipment so kinda feel like it s false advertising, Fab staff fab location clean and welcoming would recommend to anyone 
420855,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, It was very noisy We had a room tucked away out the back so were protected from the noise of the teams but sound within the hotel really travelled eg from the bathroom next door guests moving around in the lobby etc , Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was immaculately clean and location excellent for accessing all key sites 
420856,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, There is a need for a proper lobby area where customers can relax and chill and meet up with friends , The hotel is in a really good location close to many restaurants and shops It also has good accessibility to public transport and walking distance to many popular places in Amsterdam The staff are very friendly and helpful If we are to visit Amsterdam again this hotel will be our first choice 
420857,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, The location was perfect Tram stop nearby with trams direct to Centraal Station and within walking distance of everything too Very clean and comfortable rooms Lovely hotel

420859,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Great location staff were really helpful and friendly at all times Room was clean comfortable and quiet Tea and coffee making facilities in the room which is essential for us Great value for money and will stay here again when we next visit Amsterdam
420860,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The way when I booked hotel it said it was 290 and when I got there it came too 303 they already took 140 off me before I got there and took 303 off me as I left so I basically spent 443 on room wasn t a where of price, The room over looked the lake and was a very good view are room had TV as well which was nice for been out all day

420863,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The carpet and the curtains in the hotel are really old with obvious stains , The location of the hotel is great the room was clean the breakfast excellent and the staff very friendly and efficient 
420864,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We simply loved everything about this Hotel, The location perfect Easy to reach by bus to and from Schiphol airport The extremely friendly staff We were there at 9h30 the morning and our room was ready The huge room and bathroom 
420865,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I didnt like that a card pre authorisation may be taken although this was pay nothing till you get there with free cancelation 3 weeks before I arrived they took 1 nights payment 158 without warning When I challenged this I was told they had not taken it in a couldnt care less attitude it was just put on hold and if I wasnt happy I could cancel and the money would be realeased back to me in 7 10 days I had booked well in advance and could not risk cancelling in case another hotel did they same thing before I got my money back They told me they would release the funds back into my account the day I arrived if I didnt cancel 2 weeks later the money appeared in my account The superior room was a waste of time space and money Although there were 2 chairs with a table there was a large space unoccupied that was useless I would reccomend you go for the comfortable double and to watch out for money taken out your account without warning The Gym was what I would describe as a single room , The hotel was central with nice breakfast and 24 hour consierge Bed comfortable although the superior room had twin beds together that didnt stay together causing a gap Nice toiletries including conditioner that were replaced once used 
420866,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The noise outside hotel was not acceptable There was rioting by locals on the Friday night in the street and Police were dispersing the trouble between midnight and 5 am , Room was really good and staff were very friendly Couldn t fault the facilities in the room and the bed was really comfortable 
420867,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Great location friendly and helpful staff Excellent breakfast Staff noticed that it was my wife s birthday from the registration form and took the time to leave birthday greetings in the room together with a gift of some Dutch biscuits A greatly appreciated touch Thank you 
420868,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The noise from the street below could be heard till early morning , Excellent location on the canal with restaurants shopping Riijks Museum all within a short walking distance The room was very spacious with an old world charm 
420869,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Our first room a junior suite was very disappointing It was a dark room with a small view to the canal and more expensive than the second room we got which was amazing The hotel did not answer our email they ignored it We had a problem with our shuttle to the airport and it left a bad feeling , Our second room at the corner with big windows was great Breakfast was not very rich but everything was very good and fresh 
420870,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, At times the breakfast buffet was down very low before things were topped up I got the last slice of cheese and the muesli was almost empty However a few minutes later it was topped up , Location was excellent would definitely return Tram right outside the door 
420871,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Helpful staff large comfortable and quiet room We d planned to go out for breakfast but the range and quality of breakfast at the hotel meant we never felt the need to look for breakfast elsewhere Tram stops outside 
420872,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Great location canal view room was large very comfortable Staff were lovely so helpful Had brunch in their restaurant which also was very good
420873,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, TAXI SERVICE FROM HOTEL We have never felt so pressurised to use someone s service with whom we never made any contract or agreement not even verbally as I did not place the phone call to the taxi company the receptionist did After asking for taxi at the reception I immediately requested to cancel it as it would take more time to get there than the uber and we had to rush to the airport The taxi ordered showed up at the same time as our Uber driver I was verbally attacked by the taxi driver who shouted WHO DID YOU ORDER FIRST THE UBER OR TAXI He was unfortunately happily backed up by manager or supervisor of the hotel who decided to get her claws out saying it was illegal and that I made HER ring a cab and so was Required to use his service for christ s sake please check EU consumer law and have a good read about the right of cancellation You should be ashamed of this havoc you created in your street you blocked your busy road for a good five minutes you shouted at a customer who spent 800 for 3 nights at your hotel and most importantly who had no time to waste being a victim of this appalling scene when in a hurry to get to the airport You are only accommodating when it is for your own interest That pathetic behaviour only appeared to us as utter disrespect to my partner myself and the Uber driver on our last day I do not recommend using the desk service as despite amsterdam being very liberal you may feel deprived of your basic customer rights, I wanna say first and foremost that I thoroughly enjoyed the presence and customer service offered by Camiel the more than helpful face of the hotel that helped us on our first and second day 
420874,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, A bit noisy as beside trams and party zone , Staff were exceptionally helpful as I required an emergency referral to a dentist Camiel from the front desk helped arrange it 
420875,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, For guests staying on top floor staff can be a bit more helpful proactive in helping to get luggage up very steep flight of stairs , amazing room great hotel restaurant accommodating staff 
420876,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Wish we could have had a bath , Staff were really friendly and we felt that the staff treated as an individuals The restaraunt food was amazing and I would recommend the apple cake Yummy 
420877,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, A bit noisy not too much But you can hear the road from the rooms with all windows shut Not too much , location is excellent even though our room was not technically canal facing we could see it and we had a super tiny balcony which we thoroughly enjoyed The staff is absolutely amazing They made us feel very welcome and comfortable I highly recommend this place Amsterdam is all about location You need to be in the heart of things to get the most out of it 
420878,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, The location is great for shopping and sight seeing Tram stop 1 2 5 right outside If coming from schipol train and tram gets you to the hotel in under 30 minutes Staff very friendly Hotel is cosy and quirky great change from big hotel chains where everything looks the same Super comfy bed
420879,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We were surprised that there was no lounge to sit in somewhere to relax at the end of the day , The room was large with a lovely view of the canal It was clean The breakfast was good with a good buffet choice 
420880,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Did not like the fact that as residents could not get a meal in the hotel on night of arrival apparently restaurant fully booked albeit this could be construed as a positive sign Also were unable to get a drink upon our return to hotel on Sunday night about 10 45pm as we were told till had been counted and closed when reminded that we were residents we still were not served basically bed time Restaurant serves as bar and vice versa so not ideal if restaurant busy Breakfasts were disorganised staff were not attentive food options were slow to be topped up if at all when running down generally lacking Conversations and noise from other rooms can be clearly heard from within own room which was strange and intrusive For what you get pretty expensive , The bed was comfortable and the room clean Location was good 
420881,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Bathroom very small Bedroom quite small Shower very slow to drain electrical points didn t all work problems with phone charging very dusty on top of wardrobe suitcase storage ,No Positive
420882,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, No complaints Maybe add to the breakfast choices e g rye bread , Quiet spacious clean room on 5th floor overlooking city rooftops and Prinsengracht for a premium Next to main tram routes Good breakfast Friendly helpful staff If you want a decent hotel room such as this one located in downtown Amsterdam you have to pay that bit extra 
420883,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, No negative comments at all , The breakfast selection was amazing The rooms were spacious and clean The staff were very friendly and accommodating It was excellent we will return 
420884,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We thought the bar and dining facilities were a little dreary so we did not eat there Also this is in the heart of a big city so it is not always quiet , We asked for a nice double room with a canal view and paid 25 euros a night extra We did get a lovely room overlooking the canal and away from the busy street I did not see the other rooms for comparison but we thought it was worth it Also the staff was very friendly and helpful It s a great location we walked everywhere we wanted to go 
420885,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The hotel is located on a corner where it faces both the canal and the return side faces just the street The rooms facing the canal have big windows that open which is great The rooms on the street side have all the windows sealed off on the inside with a layer of plexiglass only because the hotel was forced to due to the number of people who complained because of the noise Too bad My advice to those who complained would be Don t book a hotel in the heart of a big city if you are expecting silence When in a big city enjoy all it has to offer The hotel was very accomodating and moved us , The rooms that we had were very nice and the staff were excellent The breakfasts were very good We ate at the restaurant on our last night only but were wishing we had tried it earlier as the food was very good The soup Cream of Celery was excellent 
420886,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, At breakfast supply often could not keep up with demand I could not manage the series of steps in the corridors This should be mentioned in advertising Carpets could do with either replacement or a very good clean , The location was brilliant Staff were great Our room on the fourth floor was very quiet 
420887,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The pillows were too soft Lack of free drinking water in rooms Staff could have been more hospitable Larger bathroom towels , The location The shower The room and the view The gym was adequate and offered free water
420888,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Mini bar was not cool Basin plug leaked Scrambled eggs were hard but it is difficult to keep them soft over a long breakfast serving , Breakfast generally and service Location but it would have helped if I had discovered there were 3 tram service to the door step before I arrived was it clear on the website The larger twin room was very good the basic double a bit cramped Shower worked well TV excellent Bed comfortable 
420889,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, it looks like an old american hotel of the 80 s with damaged dark carpet and wood furnitures extremely noisy I could hear my neighbours flushing At the breakfast I was asked to sign even before I was sitting on the table I even did a remark to the guy there the paroxysm is that I forgot my electric toothbrush there I called them to ask if they could send it back to me They were friendly on the phone and of course said yes Surprise when 2 days after I receive an email saying that they couldnt use my credit card to pay the mailing to my address crazy stingy poor service and furnitures nothing to recommend definitely not , nothing
420890,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Pillows where a bit to puffy for mine and my partners liking other than that it was a lovely hotel, The staff was very friendly and welcoming when we got there and throughout our stay And the fact that we was very close to shops and food places like mc donalds just round the corner Pandora my favourite shop and other shops to get every day bits if you ve run out or left it at home so very handy to have them just down the road
420891,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Way overpriced for what you get Over 800 for 3 nights in a room with mildew stiff bed and loud malfunctioning air conditioner Charge you for phone calls in which you can t even connect with the place you re trying to reach , Location was about the only pleasant aspect of this hotel 
420892,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The Windows didn t open and so no fresh air Noisy air conditioning particularly noticeable at night , Spacious room with large windows overlooking busy street so plenty to see and ideal for people watching Despite trams going by there was very little noise to be heard in the room Central location with short walk to museums dam square and the shops 
420893,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Rooms are dated Perhaps premium rooms are better but standard rooms are basic, Excellent staff Gave us a gift for my girlfriends birthday Very helpful and professional 
420894,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We arrived late but having to walk up 3 sets of awkward spiral stairs was a bit annoying , Excellent restaurant that we ate in twice for lunch and dinner Comparative to the good restaurants in our city Vancouver Very comfortable beds much more than our boutique hotel in Barcelona 
420895,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The hotel has policy rules which are not published at booking com neither written anywhere in the hotel premises or document They just claim that a verbal rule expressed by the staff post factun is enforceable The argument guest is not allowed because I say so now seems really strange I had to argue for 30 mins and I rented the best room the penthouse in the hotel Another inconvenience was the fact that you can t enter the hotel when the receptionist is out They simply lock the entrance and make you wait until the receptionist is back The reason they provide is security One would wonder what kind of incidents they might faced And if the hotel is not secure hire a security guard or implement a security system When the room costs 350 a night it seems a reasonable investment , Location the view from the penthouse
420896,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The bed was much too hard for our liking , The location was perfect Away from the congestion of the central area but perfectly situated for restaurants and shopping The front office sat were always smiling and incredibly helpful with any questions thrown at them the breakfast was a great addition something for everybody s taste in breakfast

420898,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Only negative would be 15 euro for breakfast per person but it is average for most of amsterdam as breakfast not usually included in booking price , Fabulous location Tram right outside the hotel and cheap to get bus from airport to 2 minutes from hotel Beautifully decorated inside and out Lots of restaurants nearby next to beautiful houses and area Staff are so helpful Rooms are bigger than expected lots of walking space And cleaned every day Great additional extras like gym and ice machine Quiet inside hotel also The hotel made our stay even more incredible And great value for money I will definitely be staying here again if im ever in amsterdam and will be recommending it to all 10 out of 10
420899,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Breakfast selection could have been more varied suggest making robes available given the cost of the rooms suggest bottled water given cost of the rooms, Location is excellent easy access to tram helpful staff quiet rooms 
420900,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Despite asking for a room on upper floor when booking they claimed that they did not have one After arguing with the manager a room was somehow found I felt that they try to cheat me The room needs a lot of upgrade Nearly fell because of p broken shower Frame , Location was perfect Breakfast was excellent
420901,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Windows are not double glazed Noisey all hours of the day and night due to foot and tram traffic , Location walking distance to many places of interest and on three tram lines My room was large airy and bow window bright with seating area and lamp for reading

420903,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Our adult daughter was the very top room I can t remember the room number above the restaurant and when we checked in we assumed it was near our room as the numbers were very close The check in staff member should have explained where the room was AND how to get there It was very confusing , The location the size cleanliness of our room and the staff were excellent 
420904,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Run down hotel The room view was horrendous overlooking the back service entrance Thin walls could hear the neighbors and some construction going on early in the morning Did not like the fact that I had to leave my key at the reception I was told it is for security reasons and was provided a card with which to identify myself but was asked only once for it and the other times there were people at the reception I have not seen before that did not bother asking for it Security I think not , The maid service And the location

420920,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Hotel staff were quite unhelpful at times when we asked where things were Construction work woke us up early on one of the mornings which we were not made aware of before our stay Expensive , Excellent location right in the city centre surrounded by several eating places Only a 10 15 minute walk to major attractions such as Van Gogh museum and Anne Frank house Clean and comfortable room Restaurant staff very friendly 
420921,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We paid almost 700 for 3 nights and it felt like it was a lot of money for what was a nice but not excellent hotel The bed linen had holes in it the sink had a crack there were some spider webs at the ceiling Nothing major but just little things that you notice once you pay a lot of money , The location is excellent the view was great 
420922,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Street noise through the whole night on weekend but this also provided a fascinating insight into life for the young people in Amsterdam , Extremely helpful and friendly English speaking staff including the lady organising the excellent breakfasts Good central location Able to open a window to obtain fresh air and the view over canal

420928,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Some rooms should be illegal to sleep in The noise of the street is terrible both day and night I checked in at 11 00 pm exhausted after a long flight and had to wait for another hour so that the staff will try and fix the key that didn t work After a long hour of waiting I was asked to go to the staff every time I wanted to enter the room because the key still doesn t work They fixed it only the next day The sheets and the carpet were torn and stained The sink was broken The whole floor was smelly Even though there is an elevator you still have to take too many stairs There were dead bugs on the curtains that probably have been dead for a while Flies and sorts of bugs in the room Staff weren t very nice and even a bit rude , Location is good

420947,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The room was cold there was no heating at WC the WC didn t have a sink the bathroom was seperate The stairs are too narrow and not convinient for carrying a large suitcase , The location was good

420954,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The nice location near to the tram has its downside with the noise occured by the traffic What can be improved is avoiding the noise made by the vacuum cleaner at 7am I would have appreciated to sleep a bit more this morning , The localisation is perfect in Amsterdam to walk around the nice things to visit It was as well very convenient to take the tram and go to the professional meetings I had The breakfast offers various products of good quality I really appreciated it 
420955,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Great location Large rooms Friendly staff Good breakfast The area is very busy and noisy but we were on the 4th floor and heard no noise at all inside the room
420956,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, It was a little difficult getting to the room with our large suitcases with the odd sort of spiral staircase and a few steps up after taking the elevator , Room was very spacious and bed was comfy concierge was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport Location is great right along the canal 
420957,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Very noisy at night stag and hen groups I think , Central location we could walk to most attractions Nice position overlooking the canal Very comfortable bed and excellent shower

420959,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Very noisy area We had a room on the top floor facing the canal but despite that it was very noisy from the street Avoid rooms on the lower floors and avoid any room facing Leidesstraat , Spacious and comfortable room We upgraded to a superior room with a view to the canal Many nice restaurants nearby 
420960,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, There was a water leak in the bathroom above us and we had to move room We were very tactfully moved to the Junior Suite room 308 which was lovely as it over looks the canal and it s a beautiful room but there are steps to go up to the room so with lots of luggage it might be a problem for some However if it wasn t for this there would be nothing to complain about , Great location with easy tram just outside the door extremely helpful and polite staff and very comfortable and spacious room Definitely recommend 
420961,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, This isn t a dislike but worth mentioning The inroom dining hours were from 5 30pm to 9 30pm It would be nice if it offered some food during other times However this was not a problem just something the hotel might want to know , Location was amazing tram at the door which takes you to everywhere you want There is a tourist activity booking centre across the road which helped us decide on what to do and where to go in Amsterdam The staff were very friendly courteous and attentive to our needs Although the in room dining menu didn t have a big variety of food it had enough tasty dishes to try There were many restaurants bars and cafes around the hotel which made it easily accessible It was a great pleasure to stay at this hotel as it has exceeded our expectations

420969,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, No room service restaurant is open only for dinner Not a huge issue as the hotel is in the middle of the city but as everywhere else in Europe it is hard to find a good restaurant opened any time of the day they usually open for dinner and some are even stay closed on weekends which is strange , Stayed on the top floor penthouse room on the roof Loved the view Staff is friendly and helpful Breakfast is small but I guess it is enough to start with a day Location of the hotel is the best almost center of everything and with tram just downstairs easy to go anywhere 
420970,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Nothing , Brilliant location was only about 10 minutes from Museumplein 2 minutes from Leidseplein where the airport shuttle drops you and only about 15 minutes from the Anne Frank house etc The staff were friendly The room was very clean and comfortable 
420971,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Bathroom could use updating Had to lean back to get under shower , Very nice location right on 5 tram Walking distance to museums and city centre Loads of nice restaurants and cafes nearby Windows are double double glazed so outside noise is minimal if you listen you can just hear the tram rumbling past but it won t keep you awake Rooms are very clean

420979,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I thought the room would be a little bigger from the photo s but for the price I can t complain Just a headsup, I loved the surroundings just look out the window and you see the canals beautiful Also the bars are right around the corner If you want to get to the hotel quick take the tram by foot it can take long from Amsterdam central station 
420980,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, There is nothing I can really think of Just avoid the rooms that have view on Leidse Straat as they are very noisy at night , The location can t be better This hotels offers great value for money Staff is excellent they printed many free copies and were helpful and efficient for larger taxis and things like that The rooms are clean the bed comfortable Maybe there could be some more storage space 
420981,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The streets can be a bit noisy Friday Saturday night but thats the advantage of being central The building is old so some noises from pipes and other rooms however that also adds to the charm , Location is perfect Near the sights restaurants nightlife but not too near History and old charm of the hotel feels more personal than big modern hotels Good breakfast not a huge buffet but a good enough choice Helpful reception
420982,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, No double beds , Attic room was far more charcterful than a standard hotel room It was nice to be in a relatively busy area close to puclic transport and cafes

420986,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The hotel is in need of renovation the hotel reception area is lovely unfortunately the rooms are very tired and not as clean as I would expect for a 4 star property the telephone didn t work in the room and the restaurant bar was closed for the duration of our trip , The staff were friendly and our request for a room with a view had been taken on board 
420987,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, The staff is fantastic and if there are any problems they fix it We have stayed there three times and once our shower did not work After trying to fix it they let us in another room and gave us 100 Euros off The location is fantastic with lots of good entertainment nearby The rooms are clean and quite nice for being near the center 
420988,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The neighborhood is active It s not a quiet place to go for a walk , Great location if what you want is to be in the middle of Amsterdam nightlife Nice staff the rooms are great particularly those looking out over the canal 
420989,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Rooms are not soundproofed and neighbours are easily heard rummaging around Breakfast is ample but expensive for what is offered at the buffet , Lovely housekeeping staff and very professional Close to Leidseplein with lots of entertainment options albeit much of it is catering to a younger public and on Amsterdam s famous canals Good public transport options for going anywhere in the city by street car 
420990,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Only thing I didn t like was breakfast was 14 euro so we chose not to eat breakfast there , It was clean beds were very comfortable Great location walking distance to many museums and shopping and also a very nice area of town We booked the night before and we were able to check in at 830 in the morning Was very helpful in allowing us an early start to explore the city 
420991,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I did not get any sleep for my three night stay due to the street noise that must have come from a bar below my street facing window it went on until five or six A M How could anyone give this hotel four stars It rates one star People must read this review It was HELL , The buffet breakfast was very nice Also the deep bathtub 
420992,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, We had a canal view room and it had a beautiful view and balcony Room was very large and comfortable and bathroom was updated The location of the hotel was excellent close to public transport great shopping restaurants and key sights Staff was very friendly and helpful Would highly recommend this hotel 
420993,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Actually nothing that I can put my finger on , As I stayed only about 12 hours it is somewhat difficult to sya what is good and what is not good After I rather turbulent day for me it was great to find yourself in a cosy hotel room able to relax and get som well deserved rest A god breakfast to start the new day off re energized me and turned the visit to Amsterdam to something of an overall positive experience 
420994,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, There was airco that kept buzzing throughout the night and the curtains did not block out the outside light both of which made it difficult to sleep well , Location is great and tram station very close nice breakfast area nice room and not too small given central location late breakfast and late checkout on Sunday WiFi in room included actually good enough to stream video 
420995,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Corner location was busier than expected which meant some noise from the street as trams and late night people went by , Friendly staff clean spacious comfortable room convenient location for walking all around Amsterdam
420996,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Ground carpet is awful Room bad smelling not clean and fresh , Location and junior suit channel view excellent But room and furniture old design and not good enough 
420997,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, There was not a single negative , EVERYTHING Location View from the room the room size the features This place has everything you will need and the rooms are generous It is so easy to access the parks the Rijksmuseum The bars cafes and restaurants of Leidseplein 
420998,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, All double rooms are not alike although priced the same There was a big difference in the rooms and were not together with friends Interior rooms with small high windows should not be in the same category as those overlooking the streets , Great location Only 15 min walking distance to main attractions Anne Frank Heineken Rijksmuseum Van Gough Canal cruises Vondelpark etc Also Tram stops at corner of hotel Shops and restaurants of all kinds within a block Don t miss the Delft shop next door great selection good prices 
420999,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Elevator did not go to every floor This left numerous and tight stairs to manage with luggage Staff had told us certain rooms would be available and some in our party got good ones while others got poor rooms , Location
421000,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Noise from street in early hours of the morning from party goers going home from pubs in area Room needs some soundproofing , Location staff easy access to everything in Amsterdam tram stop outside entrance shuttle bus to airport about 150 metres away
421001,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Really nothing bad some people may be put off by the dated decor in the hallways but we personally quite liked the style , The hotel staff were very welcoming and very helpful The hotel is in a fantastic location spitting distance from the stop on Leidesplein where we got off the 197 bus from the airport Beautifully clean and luxurious linen heated towels and lovely toiletries made it feel that little bit more luxurious 
421002,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Higher price for not as nice a room as I normally have, Perfect location for shopping Good service and staff are helpful Prices have increased over the last year quite a lot though 
421003,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Carpet was stained Dried milk instead of UHT sachets , Brilliant central location but not noisy Large room overlooking canal tea and coffee making facilities in room Good range of bathroom products 
421004,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, whilst it s a lovely old building it could do with a bit of a refresh new carpets for eg , excellent location next to Leidseplein Large comfortable room with a canal view 
421005,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, First floor windows don t open and supply of fresh air via the central system is relatively poor So ask for upper floors , Very good location indeed nice old building with a stylish restaurant and a good breakfast Very friendly and professional reception staff 
421006,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, You have to leave your key at the door when you go out Prefer to keep my key , Great location and friendly staff Very good breakfast too although pricey You re 3 minutes from Starbucks and FEBO though 
421007,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I had guests to my room to relax for an hour or two before going out to meetings and was told by the hotel staff this was prohibited and that we were only allowed 2 people per room at any given time Had I known no guests were allowed I wouldn t have booked this room The room had 3 seats and two beds ample space for people to sit , Nice large rooms clean prompt service Location was very good close to everything 
421008,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Some of the staff are nice but some are very cold I don t like the fact we can t keep our room key And the staff have to verify you each time you ask for the key , The location is perfect in the heart of Amsterdam 
421009,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, One might say it is a bit pricy and that a bit more attention could be put into cleaning , We had a 4th floor comfortable and specious room facing the canal it was very nice The hotel has excellent location and you can practically walk to most of the city s attractions the staff was very nice and professional willing to help with anything We didn t use any of the hotel s facilities or dining options other than the wifi which was fine one bus takes you to the airport and back no 197 which was also very comfortable We enjoyed and will be happy to come back all toilet products are made in the EU 
421010,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, This is a charming hotel which is well located the passage to room 408 is labyrinthine but well worth it when you arrive there The staff were friendly and very helpful 
421011,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, The room was large compared to European hotels in this price range and clean The staff was very friendly helpful and spoke excellent English The location is hard to beat There s a tram stop literally right out of the front door The line it s on places you about equidistant between the Museum district and the Central Station Plus if you drive to Amsterdam as we did there s a parking garage a little over a block away It s a bit pricey 48 day but if you re just there for a few days it s a secure parking spot And one of the best points of this location there s a great little bakery right across the street The sausage rolls were our daily breakfast In fact even if you don t choose this hotel make a trip to the bakery As for us we d likely stay here again on our next trip to Amsterdam 
421012,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Lovely location by the canal and the room had a small balcony with views over the roof tops where you could watch the sunrise Well located within easy access of both the museum quarter and the centre of town and conveniently by a tram stop 
421013,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The rooms could do with a make over The furniture is quite old , Fabulous location Walking distance to all main sites Very friendly and helpful staff 
421014,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Very bad experience with this hotel It says that all rooms have air condition and that is why we booked it We ahd three rooms two had air and ours did not It had a blowing air system that does not cool When we complaind about it they said that the first floor had not been finished with new air conditioning Will never recomend it 
421015,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, A little noisy coming from street and adjacent rooms , Very large room overlooking canal Fantastic location right off the tram easy transport from train station airport and between the North and South sections of town Nice tea and coffee available in room Wifi worked great 
421016,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Dreadful mattress felt like we were sleeping on planks of wood , The size of the Room and Bathroom was v good Looking onto the Canal was lovely and was v quiet 
421017,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Nothing, I have stayed here before and the hotel is in a great position All the staff are very nice friendly and helpful Would definitely stay here again
421018,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The hotel needs a major renovation carpets are dirty rooms smell bathroom stinks furniture is beyond old and sad staircase inconvenient overall gloom Will not return ever , Really just about nothing 
421019,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Small lobby only one and a very slow elevator very small and uncomfortable luggage room a little expensive, Location is amazing staff are great room 504 superior with canal view is very recommended tram below the hotel and everything is in walking distance
421020,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I was hoping the triple room for families would have a separate bedroom for the kids but alas no luck , Perfect location for cruising the city and doIng some sightseeing 
421021,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, Hopeless free WiFi meant we had to go 100m down road to McDonalds where we ended up having breakfast for a fraction of cost of hotel but reason going there was for Internet access not breakfasts If you can t stand McD then a couple hundred metres further is the Apple store with free fast WiFi , Location is perfect for sightseeing comfortable large rooms 
421022,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, The beds in room 308 are dreadful twin beds in a junior suite Really Rock hard rubbish duvet and the pillows felt old and well used The towels in the bathroom could have been made for Michael Jackson s waist They are tiny and thin I expected better , The location of this hotel is great right on tram 1 2 and 5 lines I had a room overlooking the canal which was perfect Staff were friendly and helpful and I personally like the noise of the trams but some might not and if you don t like a bit of noise at night don t stay so close to Leidse 
421023,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, May have been noisy but with white noise app on phone we heard no street noise at all , Very near tram stop Beds were so comfortable Location very good for sites we wanted like Anne Frank house flower market 
421024,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, I found the bed quite hard although my husband thought it was fine , We had a lovely spacious room which had French doors opening out to a marvellous view along the canal The room was well equipped and all staff were both friendly and helpful
421025,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel, We did not pay for the breakfast since it seems very costly , Location is great Tram stops right by the hotel Our room was on the 4th floor and has a door that opens out to a small balcony which looks out to the canal 
421026,Dikker en Thijs Fenice Hotel,No Negative, Great location for sightseeing but as it is on a busy corner some guests might not find it quiet enough Excellent room with a view of the canal we d booked a superior room and it was spacious very comfortable and tastefully decorated Only had breakfast once but it was good All of the staff at the desk were helpful
