201809,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, The hotel is really tiny the elevator cannot fit more than 1 person the reception is non existent do not take the breakfast option as it is located in an underground cave with very poor food options Finally do not be fooled by the pictures as the rooms are extremely small we had to pack our stuff in the wardrobes because you can t fit one open suitcase in the room and still be able to walk The bathroom is also very very small although it contains everything you need , The bed is very comfortable and the location is amazing right at the start of the champs elysees
201810,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Breakfast was disappointing Very small breakfast area Only 1 person to wash dishes lay tables prepare breakfast No bread had to wait for delivery from bakery Receptionist had to leave the hotel to go collect bread No croissants as bakery was closed Breakfast lady was very stressed Had to wait 15mins for her to wash up and lay a table for us Although hot breakfast was on the menu nothing was on offer She did her best but couldn t cope with maximum 2 tables To much to do by herself Cheese yoghurt and cold meats were not kept in a cold area but at room temperature Decaf option in coffee machine but not available Reception was small Checking in was a slow process , Rain Shower Complimentary mini bar Cleanliness Toiletries
201811,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret,No Negative, We were just staying there for one night Perfect location in Paris Clean rooms comfort bed Have to say that this hotel has one of the best showers 
201812,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, The water from upstairs shower came through the light fittings in my bathroom I couldn t get a connection to the wifi and the air con only circulated the air it did not cool it down I asked for a room change but they were full They could not find me an alternative they were willing to cover available in the area I didn t sleep well for fear of a fire or electrocution Very disappointed in their lack of consideration for their guests well being , I like that bathroom was modern and the bed comfortable
201813,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, room too small not able to move no reception area very tight elevator and stairs, good location modern room decoration friendly staff nespresso machine in the room
201814,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Room so small there was little storage space for clothes When booking it states there is tea and coffe making facility in bedroom but not so when we asked we were told there was a nespresso machine in public room We did find this but didn t really getting freshly boiled water for tea , Bed very comfy very good powerful shower good central location
201815,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, There wasn t a tea coffee maker in the room despite being given nespresso capsules and tea bags The suggested machine on the first floor never seemed prepared to work The morning drink was a disaster Also didn t like the fact the hotel charged me again during our stay despite having paid for the room two months prior In future I would like to be asked if I want to pay the city tax in person and not find out I have been charged everything again when returning well after checkout to collect our baggage form left luggage , Really enjoyed the location Perfect proximity to the champs elysee and surrounding tourist sites and there were bars and restaurants a stones throw away Staff seemed helpful 
201816,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, There are bugs in the towles and the bed sheet you keep itching all the time the location is a disaster full of drunk people and clubs who shout all the night the elevator is dirty Rooms are more then dirty the room service never clean our room they just do the bed staff are so rud they keep the door of the hotel lucked all the time in terms of security and somtimes there is no one there to open the door they let us pay for the mini bar for 5 nights and they didnt told us that its already paid they charge us for city tax and didint told us about it before Whats wrong with the housekeeping women is someone forcing them to clean for free they are doing nothing Is clening or buying new towles and bed sheets cost you a lot You should close this branch cos its really giving bad image about your name, Its a nightmare the most disgusting place I ever seen in my life if you want my advice its not even worth 1 pound I dont know how booking com deal with this kind of hotels Very bad experience I will never stay in any of best westren hotels as long they except that this branch to be part of thier chain whtever I said could never express how dispointed I was I spend 650 Euro on a pease of garbage
201817,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Lounge was more of a dining table with no music tv or bar but so much on doorstep it s not really needed, Great location comfy beds lovely spacious bathroom
201818,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Didn t like the breakfast area it was very small but that is more personal preference , The staff were very friendly the location was outstanding for the price The bedroom was small but fine for a couple bed was a lovely size Bathroom was clean fresh towels everyday The receptionist gave us great tips on where to eat and printed us maps etc Lovely customer service 
201819,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Room size was absolutely tiny and the hotel on the whole was small therefore there weren t any facilities to speak of Our wifi ran out at midnight on our last night and so we didn t have access to it on our last day , Location was excellent room was very clean and housekeeping was great 
201820,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, NO airconditioning despite clearly stated Rooms too hot with window closed extremely noisy when open Was informed that aircon was switched off in hotel and they wouldn t switch it back on No British channels on satellite tv No iPod dock as stated No bath , Good location Rooms well decorated Clean bathroom Good wifi
201821,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret,No Negative, Bed split because it was 2 singles made it uncomfortable Cleaners always left stuff in the hallways and on the stairs Front desk was helpful expect one lady but mostly good their
201822,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Some of the towels weren t replaced when taken away although very minor issue for us , Amazing staff who were extremely helpful with giving us tips for sightseeing booked us tickets to visit Versailles and transport for our return flight home couldn t fault them always friendly and helpful Room was lovely clean spacious enough and more importantly quiet Excellent location with perfect links to all the tourist attractions and brilliant restaurants and patisserie opposite Would highly recommend 
201823,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, The hotel entrance lobby rooms and stairwell are very small Our initial room was very cramped and it flooded due to a shower drain issue So I would recommend the suite which was quite roomy We did not buy the hotel breakfast so are unable to comment But the breakfast room in the basement is very small , Because our first room had an issue with the shower drain which caused the bathroom to flood we were upgraded to a suite The staff was very helpful and accommodating The suite was quaint roomy and had a lovely small balcony window on the roof Bed was comfy bathroom large and clean The location was great one block off the Champ Elysees and the FDR roundabout Close to metro station cafes and to a bench on the roundabout with a partial view of the Eiffel Tower 
201824,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Everything was good during the stay nothing to complain about , The location was perfect next to Champs Elysees There are three places next to the hotel for breakfast or just to have some food during the day The room condition was neat and clean The hotel is situated in a narrow Paris style building which has a unique charme The hotel staff was very friendly and helped me out in different issues 
201825,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Our rooms had cigarette smoking smell Our window view was a wall No arabic or english TV channels No water kettle , Location overall clean and tidy 
201826,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, The room was tiny compared to how the picture made it look the TV only had French channels despite according to the room information leaflet having 2 English channels The telephone in our room Did not work we could not phone receiption or anyone and reception could not phone us meaning the receptionist had to come and knock on our door The reception was left unmanned and we walked in with no one to question us making it seem unsafe and anyone could walk in and use the lift to the rooms The stairs on The first floor had no carpet and I understand there to be some work happening to them however the smell of what I assume to be alcohol based solvent ran through the while hotel The receptionists were friendly and spoke good English ,No Positive
201827,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, internet is free but restricted to some usual sites y should put that in your booking for me that have Bridge trains by internet i have to go to go to the coffes to train against other contries, location
201828,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret,No Negative, The staff were really friendly and we felt really welcomed To add on the location was extremely good Within all the major attractions including Eiffel Tower Arc de Triumphe and Champs elysees

201830,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Nothing, The staff were outstanding Always friendly and keen for a chat also extremely helpful making dinner reservations and assisting with tracking down luggage lost by the airline Handy having the communal coffee machine Rooms were very comfortable 
201831,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Pricing is confusing On the website we booked on though we were paying for a room with breakfast included when we got there that was not the case ended up paying more that I bargained for However I would stay there again The room was really small but that was ok with us , The staff and location were ideal and the hotel is very clean 
201832,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, We need somebody in the hotel to help us with luggage The mini bar and the fridge is empty not even water for when you arrive the rooms are small for the money you pay, It was clean and I like the location 
201833,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Parts of room looking tired Also after talking to a lot of friends stayin at different places I feel we were over charged and a continental breakfast should have been included in comparison to other rooms available and prices paid, fantastic accommodation staff first rate always had a smile nothing was too much trouble A wonderful experience
201834,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Very small rooms hardly any place for luggage Boutique type hotel almost pension type style Not the same caliber of other Best Westerns but they ve done well in limited space , The location of this hotel is excellent in that it is a very short walk to the champs Elysees being one little road back The staff are friendly and very helpful Minibar of soft drinks and water included Clean apart from marks on carpets Despite being small with limited space they kindly stored luggage due to a late flight 
201835,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, No issues at all , Great location with lots of cafes and bars on the door step Very quiet and the staff were fantastic to deal with and extremely helpful King size bed was great too
201836,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret,No Negative, The staff were excellent the young lady who checked us in was most helpful helped us find book a restaurant for dinner Sadly I did not take her name Perfect location just off the Champs Elysees ideal for sightseeing dining Would stay here again with pleasure
201837,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Walls were a little thin could hear the guests in the next room clearly But they were being loud, Comfortable bed good air con free minibar nespresso machine great shower breakfast everything you could want
201838,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Rooms are too small You cannot have breakfast in the hotel because there are only 2 tables And there is no AC in the breakfast area I never go that hotel again , Location is good 
201839,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Too small Regarding the quality the price is high We have booked this hotel because it is 4 and close to the metro station but it was not so close There is another BW hotel closer , Staff Shower Confortable bed
201840,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, I asked the hotel to book a taxi to the airport and without being advised the taxi is a VAN with no taxi authorization and no meter and a fixed rate of 70 euros no comments , Upgrade 
201841,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Our room faced a small street and I was worried about street noise During the day yes honking cars trucks mainly traveling to local businesses At night it calmed down considerably The 2 twin beds room Boudoir was SMALL No drawers just some shelf space here and there We basically lived out of luggage the whole time irritated me at first but after a day I got used to it Good that there was an expandable luggage tray to make it easier and 2 plastic chairs to put stuff on Smaller rooms are common for hotels in a convenient location at a decent price in a touristy European location Simple but quaint view from 5th floor seeing terraces mini roof garden BUT opening windows during day just brought in hamburger smells from restaurant across the street not really ideal Teeny tiny sliver elevator seemed modern but SMALL It only comfortably holds 2 adults MAYBE 1 bigger carry on luggage or 1 adult 1 big checked in bag You get used to it Or you can take the carpeted spiralling stairway for daily up and down travel Interesting that there s a motif of Marie Antoinette on mirror inside if you look closely , Very helpful staff I can t thank them enough for their assistance mainly for advice and how best to navigate around Paris Since it was my first time in France I had multiple questions each day of my 10 day stay They answered politely and professionally in perfect English The manager Florian and his team and Lucille especially were very kind and patient despite having to work in a tiny little hub by the front door But that actually made it feel more personal approachable to me than a big front desk at a larger hotel ADDITIONAL GOOD STUFF Free soda water Beds were more on the firm side but not hard I prefer plush and these were still comfortable Mini fridge safe in room Stylishly decorated mirrors walls Google the hotel s recent remodeling the design firm that they hired it s intriguing The washroom was medium sized and very clean with interesting decorations style Breakfast was simple but tasty in small but cozy stone walled basement dining room Friendly cooks served mainly eggs done made to order with tasty soft cooked bacon or bland sausage links like mini hot dogs Great variety of coffee in espresso machine Also yogurt fresh breads croissants plain chocolate pound cake various tea bags milk orange juice peach apricot juice my favorite misc fruit spreads fresh fruit basket granola corn flakes oatmeal But I found out too late that direct booking via website gets you free breakfast reg 19 Euros a bit overpriced but still very convenient for similar room rate as through other sites Yet we were offered a discounted rate because we stayed longer 10 days and we agreed to pay breakfast up front for entire stay We didn t use it each day but it was still cheaper overall than full price In mid September it was chilly raining half of the time so it was worth the price for the convenience of not getting bundled up to go 
201842,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret,No Negative, Location is perfect Hotel staff is very accommodating and flexible The pantry provides for free coffee water and soda which are essential to travelers 
201843,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, The room was extremely small It would appear that this was an attic that was converted to additional rooms as an afterthought Extremely small with very little usable space It had large sections of the side walls that one has to bend down to get in and out The bathroom was good The lift could not handle more than one person and two suitcases at any one time , Proximity to tourist and shopping area 
201844,Best Western Plus Elys e Secret, Nothing , Absolutely disgusted with handling from the team there no solution because person had no idea to call for assistance This was the most dreadful experience ever and I do work in this industry myself
