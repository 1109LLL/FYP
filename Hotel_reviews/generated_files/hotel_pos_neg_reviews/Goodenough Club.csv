116272,Goodenough Club, Hallways felt a bit like a maze , Lovely big bed Helpful staff View would have been lovely but there was a scaffold The hall where we had our breakfast made a interesting and delightful change 
116273,Goodenough Club, No temperature control for the room Only option was having balcony door open which I didn t feel comfortable to do Getting around the annex was confusing as there are no sign posts to point you towards reception lounge area You just had to follow fire exit signs which I don t think is adequate , Good location Good size room Good breakfast 
116274,Goodenough Club, The breakfast was poor No butter Just one coffee machine and so a long queue for coffee , I was upgraded and so had the beautiful suite for one night which was lovely 
116275,Goodenough Club, My Mews room was merely functional and was tucked away with no view except of other rooms If I stayed again I would request one of the older rooms in the townhouses themselves which had some charm and character , Very quiet location clean and comfortable room
116276,Goodenough Club, Nothing, Everything was perfect from the moment Ahmed checked us in to the moment we left It was a straightforward walk to the hotel from Russell Square underground once you ve figured it out Hotel are more than happy to help navigate if you need it though Check in was fast and easy and so was check out The rooms were clean and well furnished exactly as the pictures showed Ahmed said breakfast would include veggie options and I was not disappointed Given a hotel in another city recently told me when I stayed that the veggie option was the normal breakfast with the meat products taken out I was sceptical about what it would include This place got it spot on Not only were veggie sausages available they were kept away from the meat products along with the beans and mushrooms etc to avoid people using the same handle across both veggie and meat options I m not a vegetarian who moans about these things but it is nice to see a hotel put this much thought in and appreciate how problematic this can be Also noticed they had halal chicken sausages for those who wanted them so clearly thought through again Eggs made to order to your preference along with an excellent selection of pastries juices cereals and breads for toast All the staff were beyond friendly and helpful and the buildings were so beautiful and the service throughout so good we didn t even mind walking across the square to the Goodenough College for breakfast In fact we loved it Would definitely stay again as it s worth what you pay and the area is decent and safe from our experience I wil always look here first before considering anywhere else from now on 
116277,Goodenough Club, Dining Breakfast was ok in Hogwarts Dining room but a short walk from the hotel Evening meal was a pizza in a cafe type of common room , Clean and comfortable 
116278,Goodenough Club, Nothing although it is is quite pricey but this is London , Quiet location few tourists mainly students and locals Everything close by such as pharamcy grocery store florist dry cleaners hair dresser restaurants Underground buses 
116279,Goodenough Club, It was very expensive for a large but not terribly luxurious room No air conditioning But the real disappointment was that The car company that the hotel booked us on to the airport cheated us I suspect He forgot perhaps deliberately the machine for credit cards We were out of cash at that point and had only US dollars for which we were charged a very high rate of exchange And the driver was nice but kept taking us off the motorway along little streets Very odd, Huge room although not cheap Very quiet part of town Near the underground 5 10 minute walk to the British museum Very comfortable beds 
116280,Goodenough Club, The UK was in the middle of a Heat wave as was the rest of Europe this made the room a little warm at night because it had no air con We were also not made aware of the communal room that you could use when we checked in and discovered it by chance , We had to leave early for a train connection to France The hotel supplied us with a lovely take out breakfast I would recommend this hotel for a good quite nights sleep in London and for location to St Pancras station 
116281,Goodenough Club, Our first room ground floor was dark hot with stuffy smell Next day we got a room on the 2nd floor The distance from underground was longer than expected , Our second room was nice Breakfast was ok 
116282,Goodenough Club, Shower is a bit complicated took me a bit to work it out how to get hot water , Really nice hotel makes you feel like you are staying in a real English house Room was good and bathroom was lovely Very clean There is a full breakfast in a separate Hall near the accommodation or you can get a light breakfast in another room near reception 
116283,Goodenough Club, Nothing, Always comfortable clean and beautifully decorated Staff knowledgeable and helpful A quiet corner of London but close enough to major attractions 
116284,Goodenough Club, Bathroom a bit small but excellent shower , Leafy peaceful central London location Fabulous bed Amazing breakfast experience in the great hall Spacious room 
116285,Goodenough Club, Very hot with no chance for ventilation Room very sparse and basic To get full breakfast need to go across street to college , Room was clean and staff very helpful 
116286,Goodenough Club, Staircases with no carpet and dust everywhere Cleaner in my room before I checked out had thrown away all I d left in the bathroom Confusing location and breakfast Uncomfortable bed Very expensive for a poor experience,No Positive
116287,Goodenough Club, They had the guest name listed instead of mine so couldn t find booking for 15 minutes when we returned later we realised the room which was hot had no windows and the only ventilation was going to be sleeping with the door open They did however move us to two single rooms when we complained , Nice quiet street good location the breakfast was good and in a lovely great hall
116288,Goodenough Club, The cold shower The hot water wasn t working in the shower and I didn t have time to get them to fix it hopefully it was just a one off problem Goodenough Club is usually totally perfect , It s in a great central location but tucked away in a beautiful and quiet tree filled square The staff were very efficient and friendly 
116289,Goodenough Club, Our rooms were right at the top and all those stairs were wearisome But I guess it s impossible to install lifts in beautiful old buildings like those , Goodenough Club is a haven of peace in hectic central London and having the use of the lovely garden in the square is an extra bonus Our rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms spotless 
116290,Goodenough Club,No Negative, The room and bathroom were extremely clean comfortable and quiet The bedding was luxurious and very cosy The bathroom was as new refurbished and spotless Breakfast is the best in London The location feels safe and is very pleasant I have stayed in a number of hotels in London and Goodenough Club remains my absolute favourite 
116291,Goodenough Club, No air conditioning It was very warm the days we were there so a bit difficult to keep the room not too warm , Great location close to King s Cross nice neighbourhood marvelous breakfast 
116292,Goodenough Club, Didn t like the fact there was no air conditioning and the view of gardens was non existent , I liked the location as central and unusually quiet and the free breakfast at Goodenough College 
116293,Goodenough Club, The only criticism as it were was that in order to get to our room we had to walk down stairs and then up stairs again instead of being able to walk on one level to our upstairs room It was fine while we were there but a little tricky getting in and out with heavy suitcases , The hotel was amazing great central location on a quiet street and easy to get to King s Cross St Pancras station The staff were amazingly friendly and willing to help whenever asked excellent wifi and free printing services available The rooms were set well back from the road so it was peaceful and quiet and there were tea and coffee provided in the room and biscuits 
116294,Goodenough Club, We were initially put in a room underground where the wall paint was falling off the bathroom was so small that a full grown adult could hardly stand under the shower Barely any light entered the room and overall it definitely did not meet 4 star standards At a request with the manager we were then relocated to another room which was much more okay However be aware that quality might greatly vary between rooms ,No Positive
116295,Goodenough Club, The connection between the room and en suite was a bit unconvenient since they were connected by the entrance and both had separate doors There was no way of leaving the room door open it was quite a heavy door and no light switch in the entrance either The ventilation is not that great really one morning I was woken at 6 am by a fire alarm that turned out to be a burned toast from the cellar little dining room My whole room smelled of burned toast for several hours and not only that day but every monring really just usually not as strong The served breakfast in in another building which on a first day is a bit tricky to find The breakfast in general was allright , Since I was on a business trip and had to commute to Kings Cross daily the location of the hotel was perfect for me took me 15 minutes walk The hotel itself was located across the street from a private park and on a quiet street My room was clean cleaned every day and the bathroom was freshly renovated with a great shower Bed was very comfortable The staff is nice and helpful 
116296,Goodenough Club, Goodenough Club is a great place to stay if you have as I often do work to do in the Bloomsbury area The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable BUT prices are high much higher than they were a few years ago for something that is rather less than a hotel It s good that a basic continental breakfast is now being offered in the basement area where there is also a computer for guests use but seating is limited I can never quite face the Goodenough House refectory across the road which does offer a cooked breakfast , The room was quiet spacious and comfortable Very good shower 
116297,Goodenough Club, No lift and I was on the top floor Was offered a hand with my luggage though by very pleasant receptionist , Very relaxing situation with helpful staff Choice of continental breakfast items was very good 
116298,Goodenough Club, No tea coffee making facilities in the room , Room was large and the bed was very comfortable Modern en suite bathroom Breakfast in the morning was served in The Great Hall inside Goodenough College building just like being at Hogwarts 
116299,Goodenough Club, Loud between the rooms, Very nice hotel to be in London Ok breakfast in the same building as the college The breakfastroom must be seen Clean an good comfort 
116300,Goodenough Club, Would be great if there were some fresh vegetables and wholegrain bread available at continental breakfast buffet , Very convenient suprisingly spacious room v comfortable bed v clean modern and newly renovated bathroom lovely toiletries with essential oils wouldn t mind body lotion among these 
116301,Goodenough Club, We were in the mews area and the walkways and stairs had a tendency to reverberate throughout the building There was a smell from the drains in the room on arrival this is normally due to poor drainage from the shower a common problem but nothing that a bit of cleaning product wouldn t solve Having to walk over to another building for breakfast was novel and luckily it wasn t raining the cooked breakfast was pretty poor to be honest but the continental selection was fine , Great location in a hidden square in Bloomsbury a short walk to the tube Russell Square with local facilities close by Nice quiet location with tennis courts in the square Comfy beds good wi fi and a natty wi fi phone device at your disposal handy bit of kit 
116302,Goodenough Club, no elevator but this was mentioned in advance needed to go to 3rd floor but good for the condition , the room itself on 3rd floor is rather old but clean totally different when you open the bathroom door which new and modern with rain shower 
116303,Goodenough Club, Lack of a bidet British breakfast lacked of different type of cheese a bit of noise from the staircase and when opening the hot water in the shower too soft mattress , Hotel in a very quiet place nearby the Coram Park no cars not so far from Russel Square or St Pancras underground station our room was in the old mews under the stairs they were recently refurbished so there was no moquette large shower The breakfast was continental in the hotel and british in a separate building of the Goodenough College 
116304,Goodenough Club, Breakfast was served in different building in Goodenough College Great Hall The building itself is nice but the breakfast experience was a little more towards a diner not a nice cozy place we would of liked Breakfast itself was included in price so not complaining , Location is superb direct line from Heathrow Piccadilly line to Russell Square 5 minutes walk to hotel and you can walk everywhere from there Covent Garden Leicester Square etc We found a nice note and a box of chocolate in our room hotel noticed that we had an anniversary and this was really nice surprise Bathroom was laconic but nice and clean overhead shower though makes it a bit more complicated to have shower without washing your hair There is access to private garden just across the club that looks really nice Possibility to make tea and coffee in the room is really a bonus 
116305,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Always get a good welcome from the staff and this is our first choice when staying in London Sometimes though better deals are available elsewhere Setting is fantastic and breakfast is good We like the genuine college atmosphere 
116306,Goodenough Club, The telephone in the room did not work but I managed to get a wake up call on my mobile so no real problem No lift but help is offered with luggage up the steep windy staircases , The convenient location close to St Pancras International station the characterful buildings with history attached the opportunity to have breakfast and dinner in the historic college hall across the street the packed breakfast which was provided as I had an early Eurostar train to catch the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff the location in a quiet leafy square 
116307,Goodenough Club, no ironing board in the room but I m nitpicking , The room was excellent and a great place to rest after a long journey The bathroom was fantastic with rain shower and an extra large towel Breakfast was perfect 
116308,Goodenough Club, A little bit far from tube maybe is not a problem anyway this is a good place , Big room quiet and comfortable staff are warm welcoming and helpful 
116309,Goodenough Club, Breakfasts not as good as they used to be but the dining room is a great experience , excellent welcome comfortable room in a Georgian town house good facilities and very handy for King s Cross
116310,Goodenough Club, Just felt a little rushed by reception on the Sunday morning to check out 11 a m , We really liked the classic characterful d cor with a really spacious interior 
116311,Goodenough Club, The bathroom with no place for putting things room dark no view from the window view on a building very close, The staff is very Professional and kind The park area outside
116312,Goodenough Club, The bed wasn t very comfortable and the room was too hot with the window closed but too noisy with it open there appeared to be a party going on behind the hotel til after midnight , The staff were friendly and the location was great close to shops and restaurants The bathroom was very nice and the free wifi was excellent It was good to have a mini fridge in the room 
116313,Goodenough Club, It s an old building so squeaking ceiling on every footstep move of other guests, Big room clean up market furniture and finish and a very comfortable bed
116314,Goodenough Club, Our room was on the ground floor with windows facing a small back yard with a modern extension At night we were woken by noise made by some guests returning to their rooms in the extension The noise was as loud as if someone was talking in our room , The breakfast was very good with a wide range of options 
116315,Goodenough Club, The room has a slightly cheap feel with laminate floor but was perfectly comfortable with a nice bed I was in the mews and was worried about noise from the wooden stairs but in practice this was not a problem and it was a good night s sleep , Very very good price for the location very nice staff room perfectly adequate nice breakfast
116316,Goodenough Club, The room and surrounding rooms were i slept was no more than outbuildings in a back court yard as there was glass around the two walls i felt unsafe as it on a ground floor it felt stuffy and to say i payed 161 pounds i truly think it was not worth the money Very disappointed That day there was no hot water when asked an explanation was given but not mentioned with an apology before hand Almost as if one had not noticed the shower was cold , On a positive to be true the location was the best part and it was a quite street 
116317,Goodenough Club, Breakfast bar in Club itself was crowded in the morning esp as is also the lounge so I suggest as in room guide suggested you walk over to breakfast in the Great Hall at the college where there was plenty of room and papers to read 3 mins walk , Helpful staff carried my case up the 3 flights to my room which was much appreciated It had been a last minute booking btw Calm atmosphere and nicely quiet at night The location suited my visit plans and it was close to Kings Cross 
116318,Goodenough Club, Nothing , Fantastic room we were upgraded to a suite which was absolutely beautiful Very comfy bed and an excellent rain shower Location is also lovely on a quite square in easy walking distance to shops restaurants 
116319,Goodenough Club, No lift and we were on 3rd floor requested another hairdryer but did not get one Hallways and carpets were a little tired and needed repainting, Location was great and we received an upgrade Quirky breakfast in the Great Hall on Sunday
116320,Goodenough Club, It was hard for me to find reception no signs which door that is Double bed is actually 2 single beds Ironing facilities were not in the room , Room was cleaned very thoroughly every time during my 3 day stay Great breakfasts and coffee As a bonus you can find in your room special device mobile phone with pre installed local guide system and 4G internet access 
116321,Goodenough Club, Housekeeping need to be more attentive to replace the things found in the room like toiletries etc , The staff were extremely helpful and ready to solve any problems that come up Very clean and quiet hotel It was great to have breakfast and dinner in the Great Hall The food was very good 
116322,Goodenough Club, Neighborhood could be too quiet for some people no shops no people in the streets I couldn t find a women hairdresser It wasn t clear that the breakfast was included in the room rate and that it was all you could eat My room was in the courtyard not on the courtyard but in it literally in a kind of glass bunker that was recently added on I would have preferred a view out on the street where there is a garden but something about that being a downgrade something I was not really left with a choice I would have been happy to pay the same price Whatever happened to showing people different rooms so they can choose , Such an easy location if you are coming from the Eurostar Although the neighborhood is very quiet and so walking there at night is strange But harmless in the end I thorughly enjoyed two museums a few yards away The Charles Dickens museum the Foundling museum They both have tea rooms I had a delicious banana caramel cake slice at Dickens They had savory food that looked amazing also quiche and or gluten free sandwich I was thrilled by my stroll inside the private garden by borrowing the key from the Frontdesk Crocuses and daffodils just starting to bllom February At night I partied at the Pianoworks only 15 minute walk away wonderful atmosphere great live music audience suggestion for songs non stop dancing and delicious cocktail especially the mandarine lychee cosmopolitan Food was quite nice also 
116323,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Bathroom was fantastic and brand new Room was huge and very comfortable Breakfast excellent in grand hall Quiet but excellent location for walking and transport 
116324,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Was upgraded to a suite which was extremely spacious huge living and dining room with floor to ceiling windows very comfortable tastefully decorated Wish I could have stayed longer 
116325,Goodenough Club, My only negative would be that the breakfast wasn t quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel It was OK but nothing special , A great location room lots of hot water in the shower The 2 reception staff were very helpful and told me about the history of the place 
116326,Goodenough Club, My breakfast wasn t as hot as I liked but the location and variety made up for this , My room was amazing The location of breakfast was grand and there was a lot of choice for my breakfast including vegetarian options 
116327,Goodenough Club, Nothing really if you don t mind going out for breakfast Caf Or is around the corner and serves a mean flat white , Great location with plenty of cosy bars and good restaurants within walking distance yet on a very quiet street so no noise in the room I slept perfectly well with the window open The privacy of the place it is like your own private apartment in the middle of the city And very tastefully furbished with a personal style 
116328,Goodenough Club,No Negative, There was a slight issue with my room on check in The staff solved the problem perfectly The access to the large garden in the square is nice reminded me of the movie Notting Hill Also the quirky breakfast in the Goodenough College was a bit surreal but tasty and different 
116329,Goodenough Club, Booked a double room and got 2 single beds pushed but not locked together made up with single sheets and single duvets not great for the romantic weekend planned the mousetrap under the bed also wasn t positive ,No Positive
116330,Goodenough Club, Weather kind but if not crossing to another building for breakfast would be difficult This is not clear in the information on the web site, Comfortable and staff very helpful
116331,Goodenough Club, Value for money is not good payd 155 170 a night for a not very big room with not so special furniture breakfast is in another building and is inclusive just of the basics if you want a capuccino latte or a homelette or sausages ecc you have to pay extra , Slept well quite clean rooms for london standards nice bathroom
116332,Goodenough Club, room could have been a bit bigger, The room was very nicely renovated and clean The quiet location close to King s Cross was perfect and I loved the breakfast in the old Harry Potter style college mall
116333,Goodenough Club, Minor thing a shower cap to be provided other than that there s nothing to improve, Booked a twin room then got a free upgrade to a junior suite which was amazing lovely period features in a lovely location Watched the nye fireworks on Victoria embankment which was a 25 minute walk away so great location for that
116334,Goodenough Club, The English breakfast is cantine rather than hotel style by the time you collect your food on a tray in the Great Hall and get out of the queue to the cashier although you don t pay the food s rather cold returning for second servings is probably not possible The duvet smelled unwashed although the bedding on top of it was immaculate so I m not convinced about the longer term cleaning Small rooms the bathroom door could only open half way for lack of space A tad overpriced , Good location In a college in case you d like to see one Reasonably comfortable warm tea coffee facilities good bed good daily cleaning renovated bathrooms 
116335,Goodenough Club, No lift unfortunately If you had large suitcase and if given room in upper floor it would be difficult , Great location Very easy access to main tourist locations 
116336,Goodenough Club, Not a problem for me but stairs and breakfast in another building would be a problem for anyone with poor mobility A little too far from the tube at night , Loved the peaceful setting and the breakfast in the college dining room Short bus ride from Kings Cross stop at Eastman dental hospital Good discount rate for a Sunday night 
116337,Goodenough Club, There was a short walk to the college refectory for breakfast which was in reality a novelty , The room was comfortable and staff very obliging and friendly Very good help yourself breakfast good quality food all round well cooked and presented 
116338,Goodenough Club, A lift would have been useful as we were on the third floor , Good continental breakfast with plenty of choice Very comfortable bed Very quiet We particularly liked the Handy 4G mobile which was free and greatly helped us navigating the streets of London 
116339,Goodenough Club, The room was freezing and it took some fiddling to get the heating to work One of the window latches was broken which meant that the window could not be properly closed I normally like to sleep with the window open but not when it is cold outside the window is three feet from the end of the bed and that it is the lower part of the window that won t shut I would happily stay again but I d check everything first and make more of a fuss with the staff to get things sorted out , Nice staff decent room 
116340,Goodenough Club, No lift but was aware before I booked, Breakfast was really varied and plentiful Rooms quaint but well equipped Staff very friendly and helpful Great location for Kings Cross Felt secure being female solo traveller
116341,Goodenough Club, Absolutely nothing, We loved our room didn t want to leave we were upgraded to the suite wow it was fab As we were there at the weekend the parking is free on the road just outside which was a bonus as we were going to use the NCP car park plus the dinner hall namely the great hall looked liked hogwarts
116342,Goodenough Club, As it is an old building the floor above was creaky when people were walking upstairs, Location quiet but central very comfortable bed recently furnished bathroom
116343,Goodenough Club, A lot of stairs and no lift Little dis jointed as breakfast was served in another building but overall well worth the price payed for London , Large comfortable bed Modern and clean bathroom everything provided for a comfortable stay Staff were very polite and helpful Would stay here again 
116344,Goodenough Club, No control over the heating in the room, Extremely friendly and helpful staff Nice quiet location for London not far from Euston King s Cross 
116345,Goodenough Club, My room was located in a dungeon like setting in the underground level of the external rear of the building within a group of independent little blocks A permanent and loud noise from some conditioned air machine I supposed ruined my sleep It felt like I was on a cruise On top of that the room had wide windows and apart the feeling of lack of privacy the curtains were not sufficient to retain artificial light to come in at night Overall I did not feel comfortable The Wi Fi signal was really bad absent in my morlock room Breakfast was served in a different building across the square but once there no signs lead the way ,No Positive
116346,Goodenough Club, The banister down to the room was steel which when wet was slippery Also if you gripped it as you went down you caught your fingers on sharp corners on the brackets, The quirkiness including breakfast in the collage great hall with the floating candles
116347,Goodenough Club, The person in the reception did not bother to explain where the breakfast is served it s not the same building on the other side of the square is not a decent explanation had to ask 3 additional people There was no hair dryer in the room , Good location close to metro short ride to city center renovated and good looking rooms nice surrounding Very nice breakfast room Great Hall also serving delicious breakfast 
116348,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Interesting place But different being a college We were grateful for wing allocated a suite which was lovely Sitting room great with first floor garden view Staff great Breakfast in the student great hall couldn t fault
116349,Goodenough Club, Light shining through curtains made sleep very difficult Luke warm water for shower not good at all But clean and spacious for London great breakfast ,No Positive
116350,Goodenough Club, My shower screen exploded and I had to push a little to get a full refund no compensation offered even though there could have been serious injury with fragments scattered widely in the room , The location is good easy walk to St Pauls etc The room decor is a little dated and lacks wow factor for me Lots space A really good interior designer could make this place spectacular 
116351,Goodenough Club, The price was high for a small room although for the location and a Saturday night at this time of year December I guess that s just London for you , Excellent location friendly staff clean rooms free wifi good breakfast 
116352,Goodenough Club,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite having been before and there was availability Superb accommodation spacious well fitted out view over the garden square
116353,Goodenough Club, problems with a hot water in the morning breakfast in completely different building in university campus hard to find, very friendly and helpful staff
116354,Goodenough Club,No Negative, excellent place quiet comfy and the collage over the road for meals is just fab you get to eat in the collage great hall I felt I was being spoiled and in a harry potter film set ill be back
116355,Goodenough Club, A shelf in the bathroom Proper drainage from the shower it took ages for the water to drain away from the shower tray suggesting a blocked drain, Breakfast in the Great Hall lovely environment Comfortable beds and pleasant room Location was good for our purposes as it was in walking distance from Kings Cross station close to a bus route and to Russell Square tube station Very quiet despite being in the heart of London
116356,Goodenough Club, Wifi didn t work most of the time eventually I gave up The room had two glass walls so curtains had to be drawn to avoid exposure there were quite a lot of steps to get to the room and no elevator Staff were helpful with the cases upon arrival but when I left I had to carry the suitcase by myself , Location was convenient for my purpose breakfast was good 
116357,Goodenough Club, Room and bathroom were small but good enough D cor curtains were getting a little tired , Loved the location Very quirky Visiting our son at university and it was just around the corner Very peaceful and quiet The most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the shower was the most powerful 
116358,Goodenough Club, Complimentary shower gels being removed on the second day and not being replaced , The room was exceptionally clean and the staff very helpful Loved the breakfast and eating in the Great Hall of the college 
116359,Goodenough Club, Communal shower bath room in the corridor near our room we could smell someone smoking in the morning which was a bit annoying , quirky place old uni halls very helpful staff 10 15 min walk to St Pancreas several houses with rooms in a beautiful tree lined street and delicious fresh breakfast served in university breakfast room across the road Bathroom excellent standard and lovely and clean found a nice Italian restaurant nearby after we arrived or you can purchase light meals snacks from the hall across the road 
116360,Goodenough Club, Thankfully I only had hand luggage as the 75 steps to the top would have been difficult with a suitcase Staff offered to help though , What a treat to have a portable phone that s online as you walk the city and allows for free calls First time I come across this Very friendly staff and a nice size room Quiet at night 
116361,Goodenough Club, There is no lift in the property but this did not bother us, The Club is close to Russell Square tube station which is on the Picadilly line directly from Heathrow airport It is a short walk to Oxford Street the West End and major tourist attractions We had a lovely room overlooking Mecklenburgh Square You can get a key for the square from reception A full English breakfast is included which was delicious The Wi Fi connection was excellent
116362,Goodenough Club, Tepid shower Cold cooked breakfast stale pastries on Sunday Understood there was a lounge in the Club, Location Clean Tea and coffee making facilities
116363,Goodenough Club, Lots of stairs , Wonderfully helpful and friendly staff Excellent breakfast including good fresh fruit salad Dining in the great hall Handy location for St Pancras 
116364,Goodenough Club, Although the room looked like it had recently been refurbished I think the fact that it was in the Mews area a modern extension to the rear meant that it smelled and felt damp difficult to open the windows I d go for the main building next time , Great quiet location friendly helpful staff 
116365,Goodenough Club, Tea and coffee facilities within your room even though there is a common room in the basement offering lounging and tea coffee facilities and if you want a decent selection for the English breakfast arrive early otherwise the selection is scarce , Excellent staff warm and friendly welcoming extended our check out time from 11 to 12 free of charge for being so central to the city its an extremely quiet area the room was lovely stunning view over the adjacent park extremely comfy bed lush ensuite 
116366,Goodenough Club, It is more like collage accommodation than a hotel My room a courtyard view was 1 5m from the next window Sleeping with an open window in a poorly ventilated space was like sharing a room with another person It is totally over priced for what you get and the service is reactive It was a really bad experience I will not recommend the place to anyone The rating is probably obtained from tourists that might think it is a historical site but it is definitely not comfortable business accommodation The way it is represented on booking com make it as if it is on a garden with a old style charm but this is nothing like the perception they create with the photos , Nothing
116367,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Hard to believe that this quiet peaceful carless precinct is in the heart of London just 5 minutes walk from Russell Square and Kings Cross Loved the experience of breakfast in The Great Hall 
116368,Goodenough Club, I need a training course on smart tv s , Good reception helpful and clear Met cleaning staff and that was also delightful Room was wonderful clean comfortable very quiet great internet excellent bathroom with nice fittings rainshower always nice The breakfast taking place in the college great hall is unusual in a gorgeous setting and a really good breakfast too And just around the corner is a citybike rental stand so I had transport easily as well 
116369,Goodenough Club, There is no air conditioning and had to ask for a fan Thankfully they brought one to us would have been quite uncomfortable without , Location was good for our purposes but London is a big city so it would depend on what you want to see The breakfast at the college was very good The room was nice very high ceilings and with the park across the street and college nearby felt quite safe and quiet 
116370,Goodenough Club, the breakfasts have deteriorated in quality and range , I have stayed here several times usually on my own over many years and love the location I ve had a variety of rooms over that time Ours this time was on the ground floor and was spacious and comfortable and quiet except for a few rowdys in the street at night The street light outside was very bright but the curtains if strategically arranged kept out the light 
116371,Goodenough Club, It was a very warm week and there was no way to move air within the room It did however cool down nicely at night , Very clean and conviently located to kings cross and several universities 
116372,Goodenough Club, It was further away from the station than I expected Had to take a taxi there And the room somehow smelled , Breakfast was good People are really nice
116373,Goodenough Club, Space on site for the very nice continental breakfast was very small with too few tables for comfort , The rooms are very well appointed with execellent ensuite facilities and very helpful staff The location is first rate very quiet despite being a few minutes away from major transport links 
116374,Goodenough Club, room furniture aged look and feel could not meet the high level the bathroom set Window to the courtyard diesel exhaust in the morning , room size acceptable bathroom comletely new over average in size perfect water preassure in shower Perfect breakfast location at the college s grand hall across the street 
116375,Goodenough Club, No air conditioning and no lift elevator and lots of stairs Main full breakfast in a separate building , Character Property convenient location Generally quite location Staff are wonderful 
116376,Goodenough Club, As the weather had been hot the room was warm as there was no airconditioning I had thought to have a classical room in a Georgian mansion but the room was modern with a compact bathroom Windows and open doors on two sides on an outside corridor which echos noise from other travellers , The hotel is connected to Goodenough college and breakfast can be taken in a grand hall in the college itself 
116377,Goodenough Club, no elevator for those who need one general toilet on the ground floor, The classic ambiance but a large renovated room Fantastic twinn size bed The fairly new bathroom Good breakfast Friendly staff who carry your lugage up the stairs
116378,Goodenough Club, For a 4 star hotel very small room and even smaller bathroom Shower drainage did not work noisy no airco no safe saggy bad my side very average British Breakfast , not a lot Organization of party was good 
116379,Goodenough Club, A safe secure guest accomodation minutes away from great eating places and transport Hot breakfasts served in the big hall of the college Large room comfortable bed good shower , This is not a hotel
116380,Goodenough Club, we booked months ahead and specified the room they assured us that would be fine I have stayed here many times over a 20 year period in my case before but will never do so again When we arrived we were told that because our flight arrived late we were there by 5pm we missed out on the room that we requested and were put in an unsatisfactory room after paying top dollar I was travelling with a young child and we were put on the 5th floor with no lift on a heat wave night in a room that was because there is no air conditioning uninhabitable ,No Positive
116381,Goodenough Club, Ground floor room was very noisy because windows open in summer means you hear conversations on the street Very noisy cleaner too Woke me up with very early cleaning on Sunday morning , I asked for a fan and I got one Nice clean and modern shower wet room 
116382,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Check in was brilliant The room was beautiful although could have done with a fan as no air conditioning Breakfast was extensive Only downside was that the milk that we asked for for coffee in the room never arrived small niggle
116383,Goodenough Club, Customer service at breakfast could be better and we did not like having to drink out of paper cups , Good quality en suite room The Great Hall for breakfast Free parking after 1 30pm on a Saturday should be promoted
116384,Goodenough Club, View from room 202 was of a white wall with two sliding doors either side Because the weather was tropical when we visited it made sitting in the room or lying on your bed a little uncomfortable knowing your neighbour can look in I didn t mind crossing the street to have breakfast but felt the quality of hot food wasn t great Some of the fried eggs looked like they were sitting there for about an hour before hand Scrambled eggs were too watery Settled for boiled egg that was only lukewarm when i cracked it open , Bathroom spotless Bed very comfy quiet area great night sleep 
116385,Goodenough Club, Loved everything about it , The staff could not have been nicer We were upgraded to a suite so no idea what the other rooms are like but it was absolutely wonderful 
116386,Goodenough Club, No air con At the back of the building so overlooking another building just a little noisy , Very comfortable excellent facilities and superb location Great breakfast and place to eat it too 
116387,Goodenough Club,No Negative, The suite was huge and well appointed The breakfast was everything we wanted and the location was well worth going out for My wife and I are already making plans to come back 
116388,Goodenough Club, The house keeping lets them down a four star hotel with 2 star house keeping After the first day no bottles of water or tea coffee biscuits top up despite stating the sheets are changed every 3 days 5 days in and no changes made only towels changed cups and glasses not changed or washed surfaces sink not cleaned Poor standards which is a shame this lets the hotel down big time , The location and room light and airy On suite a little small and claustrophobic Breakfast in the great Hall unique within easy distance of most areas 
116389,Goodenough Club, We were told that there was no parking available and would have to book an ncp car park luckily we didn t book as there was off road parking right outside the hotel So given wrong info there Then we were given a ground floor room as 2 female guess we didn t feel comfortable and asked to change at which the guy at reception said to go look at the room did not want to change our room for us Though the room itself was clean it had a terrible musty stale odour We asked reception staff to call us a taxi he said they would be 5 10 minutes and it would be a black cab a private taxi pulled up and tried charging us twice what a black cab would charge so don t bother asking for a taxi at the hotel walk up the road and hail a black cab there We were told breakfast brunch would be available upto 2pm not the case breakfast finishes at 11am Breakfast is served in a completely different building a 100 or so yards away weather was good so walking across was ok inconvenient if it s raining Whilst the choice at breakfast is good we didn t appreciate having to share this space with rude students when you pay for a 4star room you don t expect to be sharing a canteen with rude students who push in front of you whilst you are in the queue breakfast was cold no waiter waitress service Wrong info given to us consistently and truthfully we wouldn t stay here again or recommend it for the price there are better hotels , Quiet residential road there is off road parking opposite hotel available after 1 30pm 
116390,Goodenough Club, The breakfast was HORRID It was an English breakfast which I like except that it was TERRIBLE The food was cool in temperature and the staff rude there The breakfast is across the street Will never return , The bed was amazing and the room was very very clean Clearly amazing housekeepers The room was also posh in style 
116391,Goodenough Club, Basic facilities and small room we had the standard one and you have to spend ages trying to find the hall to have breakfast in staff seem unable to direct you there as it s too complicated and they genuinely seemed uninterested and it turns out to be a student Uni building down the road so be prepared to have a buffet breakfast surrounded by students Not very good buffet breakfast unsurprisingly and no staff are around to help because presumably they just see you as another student The most bizarre and disappointing experience We got this place for a last minute big discount and that felt like poor value for money If we d paid full price we would have been very very disappointed , Good location and really quiet 15min walk from Kings X and Russel Sq
116392,Goodenough Club, nothing, Everything about the hotel was excellent the staff were very friendly and very helpful nothing to much trouble our room was absolutely superb spotlessly clean and so comfortable I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
116393,Goodenough Club,No Negative, It was great to be able to check in at 10 30 pm after a seminar and dinner in South Kensington and a very welcome surprise to be upgraded to the Bedford Suite with a great view over the square Staff were very friendly and helpful 
116394,Goodenough Club, The only very minor negative was the fixed shower head, Comfortable spacious and sunny room with a fridge looking out onto the square and gardens Conveniently close to both Kings Cross St Pancras and Euston Stations and very near Charles Dickens House the Foundling Museum the British Museum and St George s Gardens Good breakfast available across the road in Goodenough College La Cigala a few minutes walk away in Lamb s Conduit Street offers a pleasing take on classic Spanish cooking 
116395,Goodenough Club, The breakfast room is a little snug but an alternative is available across the street, Stepping back into a previous era Huge comfortable room remarkably quiet location for London Close to Kings Cross and St Pancras stations and the underground
116396,Goodenough Club, We would have preferred a room with a garden view as we had requested during booking Instead we were given a room in the lower ground floor , The room was very clean Bed linen and towels changed daily Bathroom very clean and fully renovated Breakfast was absolutely fine Bed was very very comfy 
116397,Goodenough Club, The food at breakfast is poor overheated quality My room assignment for a 69 year old woman with arthritis and a regular customer was not satisfactory Room 320 , Location and Stefan at the desk 
116398,Goodenough Club, TV rather old but worked I slept near radiator and was lovely and warm my husband on the other side was cold , Very comfy bed quiet Staff very helpful Allowed my husband to check in at 9am as he arrived to leave his luggage Spacious room for the price Walking distance from Euston 
116399,Goodenough Club, A few narrow stairs to the top floor so glad we only had small bags , Location very good convenient for central London yet quiet Happy with the room and facilities 
116400,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Good location Nice neighbourhood Easy access from King s Cross by bus or walking Superior single room was spacious in London standards with modern bathroom You can have your English breakfast at the college which was nice The club is more a residency than a hotel 
116401,Goodenough Club, Full breakfast was only available from 0730 on weekdays which I had to miss to get to an 0830 meeting A continental breakfast was available from 0700 but it was served in a tiny room with only two proper dining tables Ended up having to eat breakfast in my lap , The double room was actually two rooms a separate bathroom and a large bedroom Unheard of space and roominess for this price in London 
116402,Goodenough Club,No Negative, A really exceptionally renovated grand old property It was our first visit and were upgraded to a suite as a special welcome So nice Breakfast in the great hall of the college next door is a treat Lovely quite neighborhood but walkable to our favorite the National Theatre Gracious friendly front desk staff added to the enjoyment 
116403,Goodenough Club, Breakfast at the college dinning hall was odd though not bad , Location was perfect for British Library British Museum and walking into Soho The room was nice but in particular the bathroom was very modern and well fitted with an excellent shower 
116404,Goodenough Club, It s seriously not a 4 star hotel it s basically a cramped travelodge in an architecturally nice location I ve literally stayed in better Premier Inns and if I d payed full price for the room I d have been livid Indifferent staff directing at breakfast made me feel like I was constantly in the wrong place and liable to be charged extras at any time not a nice feeling , Nice quiet location 10 minute walk to the tube That s it I guess the mirrors in the bathroom were clean 
116405,Goodenough Club, A single room meant a single room just a single bed , Really well located room and bathroom were spotless reception staff were friendly and helpful plenty of choice at breakfast in a building across the road 
116406,Goodenough Club, Quite basic no interior flare whatso ever Definitely not 5 star Pricing policy is eratatic not consistent so can t always afford to stay there , Lovely reception staff
116407,Goodenough Club, We stayed at the roof level The room was small but confortable The problem was the old wooden windows the thermal isolation was very poor allowing cold air to go inside and made a lot of noise due to the wind , The breakfast is good The bathroom was new Everything was remarkably clean 
116408,Goodenough Club, I don t think that it merits being classified as a 4 hotel and I do think that it is overpriced It is essentially upgraded student accommodation , I love its quirkiness The staff are very friendly and helpful The breakfast options are great 
116409,Goodenough Club, Climbing up stairs , Good accommodation and a lovely place to stay especially overlooking the beautiful square gardens Very quiet Nice full breakfast in the college dining hall which is of historic interest 
116410,Goodenough Club, we had to go to Freddies for breakfast there was plenty of selection howevwr the plates for breakfast were cold and the hot food only warm, the accomodation was good clean and quiet with plenty of space
116411,Goodenough Club,No Negative, The setting in historic college buildings and having breakfast in the Great Hall with oak panel walls flooring and oil paintings is stunning Staff were extremely friendly The breakfast was very good indeed the room was very comfortable with very modern bathroom and excellent hot shower and the location is really quiet at night and max 10 minutes walk to St Pancras railway station Really enjoyed my stay
116412,Goodenough Club,No Negative, I loved the staff and the room itself It was big clean and tidy The location is amazing and close to the Kings Cross station Staff are just so friendly and make you feel welcome Definitely will go back 
116413,Goodenough Club, No view in our mews room which was not a problem as we were on business and arrived in the dark 1 night and it was more about comfort and location This might not have been as acceptable for a weekend away with the bride , The room was clean and tidy although on the small size I expect many of the other rooms are bigger looking at them from the street The full cooked breakfast across the road at Goodenough College was excellent with a huge choice and it was a spectacular building Location was good as only a 5 minute walk to KX and on a quiet street 
116414,Goodenough Club, An earlier check in time would help I walked the streets for nearly an hour The door seemed to be locked but I don t know if it actually was , Lovely breakfast good ambience
116415,Goodenough Club, Way to the breakfast in the Great Hall in London House could have been signposted better , Been there twice and note that the en suite bathrooms in the Goodenough Club are exemplary Very well designed Staff also very friendly 
116416,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Great welcome nothing was too much trouble bed was really comfy dinner and breakfast in Great Hall excellent value for money quiet location yet close to King s Cross Russell Square 
116417,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Beautiful peaceful setting in a typical London Regency square The hotel is in a set of Regency town houses each with a separate front door The rooms are beautiful and I had a lovely room overlooking the square If you have mobility problems make sure you let the hotel know when booking as there are no lifts but don t worry about carrying your baggage the staff on reception couldn t be more helpful There is a choice of breakfast location either full English across the road where you can also dine or a lovely continental breakfast in the basement of the main building the pastries are superb Great stay 
116418,Goodenough Club, 2 single beds together was ok but replacing tea bags would have nice , The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient great location spacious room crossing the road for the great breakfasts in good company along with newspapers etc was lovely 
116419,Goodenough Club, Nothing Everything was perfect , From the First e mail received till we said Goodbye all we received was excellent service I will highly recommend this establiment 
116420,Goodenough Club, no iron board no mini bar and not much space in the double room was very warm in the room even with window opened and air conditioning and it was winter , well located near a metro station but still quiet
116421,Goodenough Club, 1 Awkward shower no hot water 2 Outdoor walk for breakfast not in same building 3 Locked minibar fridge in room 4 No tea coffee facility in room, 1 Good central location 2 Free stable wifi
116422,Goodenough Club, No bar so would have to go out if you fancied a drink but this is not what this place is about , Excellent affordable luxury suite Would have stayed longer Highly recommend
116423,Goodenough Club, Room was a box in the back garden poorly sound insulated I was disturbed by footsteps on the path outside and banging doors Had to walk outside between main reception building and my room also the Breakfast is in another building across the road and round the corner not great in winter ,No Positive
116424,Goodenough Club, Nothing, The rooms were lovely spacious the beds were very comfortable and the shower was pretty awesome also The hotel is set in a fantastic location very close to St Pancras good bars clubs and restaurants and walkable to most of the main attractions in central London The breakfast was fantastic and that goes for both carnivores like myself and my vegetarian GF Also breakfast was in a beautiful and quirky hall which looked like it was straight out of the Harry Potter films Breakfast was also served till noon on Sundays a nice touch especially if you are hungover from the night before Had a truly wonderful stay here 
116425,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Lovely friendly staff Spotlessly clean with endless hot water Brilliant location for bars and restaurants of central London will definitely go again 
116426,Goodenough Club, what does any business traveler want in a hotel A working wi fi B a hot shower and most important C great bedding the goodenough club has A and B but fails miserably on C with the cheapest hardest beds and pillows imaginable you might as well sleep on the floor why do hotel owners do this why spend all this money to remodel the try to save a couple of quid on cheap bedding when really that s all we want because as a business traveler i m rarely in the room other than to sleep completely stupid will never stay there again , location is perfect for my use between st pancras and my client s office at chancery lane 
116427,Goodenough Club, At the price there is nothing at all to complain of , Most unusual especially the breakfast hall But very interesting Much enjoyed the architecture so much so that we looked who the architect was 
116428,Goodenough Club, There is nothing to dislike , It was a quiet location The breakfast was excellent Attractive bathroom with a powerful shower We appreciated being able to leave our suitcase on the last day of our holiday Thank you 
116429,Goodenough Club, The shower head needs changing and the regulating device for hot and cold is very tricky It is an old building so the sound proofing is not so good but that is to be expected in a conversion , Location and very pleasant room with good facilities A really nice place to stay 
116430,Goodenough Club, Dirty smelly room had no window bed at 30 cm from bathroom door so that one could only open half of it and had to squeeze through to go in Bathroom new and clean but that is about the only good thing that one can say about the hotel Definitely not worth the money , First room they gave me had no window Terrible 
116431,Goodenough Club, Sort your parking first there is an RCP nearby at a short walk and not expensive ask at reception for discount voucher and instruction , Pleasantly surprised for a chance booking in London A spacious clean and very comfortable apartment with a grand feel Way above our expectations and quirky with the college feel and dining hall breakfast Excellent A comfortable walk into busy bustling London 
116432,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Excellent in every respect staff location room room servicing view breakfast A great find Thank you all there so much and I look forward to coming back 
116433,Goodenough Club, Open shower with bad drainage expect a flooded bathroom when you take a shower Meals and hotel facilities spread out over different buildings , In London terms very big room and new bathroom
116434,Goodenough Club,No Negative, this accommodation was immaculate spotless and very comfortable The staff were considerate and welcoming and it was so quiet You would never believe that you were in the centre of London
116435,Goodenough Club, Only stairs but wasn t a big issue Room was nice and clean but I expected a bit more for the price Breakfast made up for expensive room , Staff were fantastic very friendly and professional Full english breakfast was delicious and served in the college dining hall that is full of character Room was clean and bathroom recently renovated Decent size room 10 15 minute walk from Kings Cross Station but close to other tube stations 
116436,Goodenough Club, Eating in the Great Hall is essentially a university dining hall not for everyone Plus access to the rooms in the main building might be problematic for anyone unsteady on their feet , I love the location and the building Plus the wonderful Great Hall is a fabulous place to eat Very Harry Potter 
116437,Goodenough Club, Rooms a little tight for space and over furnished but it s normal for London , The warm welcome The club does not have a hotel or hostel feel It s very calm polite safe for solo travel The dining hall is indeed huge a wonderful plus Complementary tea coffee and bottle water in doom daily The location is a haven in central London very quiet peaceful situated on a beautiful old square Great shopping and restaurants very close too Russell Square Tube and buses only short walk Wifi excellent old buildings very well refurbished without losing its charm 
116438,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Location is perfect opposite a quiet park and in walking distance of Covent Garden Hotel with lots of old english charm ideal for our children who loved the Harry Potter breakfast room College atmosphere gives a special feeling Great choice for families with children 
116439,Goodenough Club, The earliest breakfast was 0730 which was too late for us We were offered a continental breakfast to take away which we had but it was completely unusable Milk cereal but no bowl The room was ok but nothing special and very noisy when other guests entered the hotel No restaurant so really overpriced , The staff were helpful
116440,Goodenough Club, The room was outside the main buildings like being in a chalet Bathroom tiny but spotless Lacked the atmosphere of a hotel , Very clean The Great Hall and buildings interesting Staff nice 
116441,Goodenough Club, We expected an hotel and we were quite disapointed The staff was nice and changed our 3rd floor room with no elevator to a first floor Still not what we expected , It was a nice setting but we thought it was an hotel and it was not It is a nice graduate student residence No lobby sitting area or lift 
116442,Goodenough Club, Old school windows let in the noise but the it is a listed building and a lot of people had just been turned out from a party Doesn t happen every day , Great location near central London
116443,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Great room in a very quiet London street with a view to the park opposite Loved going across the road to the college great hall for dinner and breakfast Catering was excellent 
116444,Goodenough Club, My room had no windows and although freshly decorated had a musty smell , Liked the choice of breakfast at the club or hall and the comfortable lounge with newspapers
116445,Goodenough Club, at weekends it can get noisy at night with students gathering and drinking in the street mixed experience with the staff ordering a taxi for instance proved sometimes impossible then on departure I had left something valuable behind which was not returned to me so I cannot recommend it to anyone, The location is central not far from Kings X it is not a hotel but college accomodation so more intimate if you like that
116446,Goodenough Club, you need to be aware that at least some parts of the hotel have no lift so there may be some stairs to climb But help is at hand for your luggage , Excellent location for central London close to subway and walking distance to Covent Garden Soho etc Only a short walk from St Pancras Super friendly and helpful staff Great room
116447,Goodenough Club, The room was rather bland with cheap modern furniture although very clean and in good condition The lack of a lift would be a problem for some , Quie location convenient for Kings Cross and central London It is in a series of townhouses that create a peaceful atmosphere Breakfast across the square in the great hall of Goodenough College was atmospheric and the food was good 
116448,Goodenough Club, Breakfast in the Great Hall could have been a little warmer but plenty of choice , Excellent value if you can book for about 120 Very clean rooms Good bathrooms and showers 
116449,Goodenough Club, Breakfast served in college hall too far from the rooms and looked and tasted too much like school catering Very old hairdryer which died during use so some poor attention to detail , Location
116450,Goodenough Club,No Negative, I was really pleased with this booking The room was spacious well equipped and very comfortable The staff were welcoming And the small details like the lounge with complimentary tea and coffee added to the homely feel I had no previous awareness of the hotel and chose it for location I was delighted to discover the buildings the hotel occupies 5 adjoining town houses had such character and that the square was so quiet i e almost no traffic This isn t your typical London hotel instead it offers a much more interesting option at very good value particularly with the included breakfast We only stayed one night but I suggest it would be a great base for a long stay 
116451,Goodenough Club, the breakfast being served in different places on different days was a little confusing , close to tube very good bed and lovely room the square was very quite the breakfast was very good 
116452,Goodenough Club,No Negative, I was delighted with every aspect of the Goodenough Club I have to say that it was better than good enough The location the warm welcome and customer focused staff the towels were the best I have ever come across in all my hotel stays 
116453,Goodenough Club, It is a beautiful building and I did love being at the top of the house but it would have been good if it was clear you could get help with getting your luggage up to the top , Location ambience quality of room and breakfast and dining facility 
116454,Goodenough Club,No Negative, An historic property in an interesting area with comfortable and modern facilities Breakfast in the Goodenough college was an enjoyable experience The staff at the hotel and the college were extremely friendly and helpful 
116455,Goodenough Club, TV and wifi connections rather erratic, Very pleasant modern room in new block at back Staff exceptionally helpful Nice continental breakfast very helpful member of staff
116456,Goodenough Club, Single bed No lift though staff both quick and happy to help with baggage Rooms at front can be noisy from passers by rather more than vehicles, Very helpful friendly staff Good location Value for money this close to central London
116457,Goodenough Club, We couldn t make out any of the much touted college feeling Rather everything and everyone seemed reserved if not a a little uppish With leaky windows heating was below comfort level even with relatively mild weather , We liked the quiet surroundings near a park and close to the British Museum Also for London hotel standards room size was very generous 
116458,Goodenough Club, Slightly odd layout we were in a newly built mews room connected to the main heritage building by a series of external staircases The double bed was small more like a single and a half , Friendly reception staff Decent shower Good breakfast 
116459,Goodenough Club, The price of course , Very conveniently located surprisingly quiet from the street Large window our room was on the ground floor Comfy and super large bed Simple and modern bathroom A strange yet not unpleasant experience to have breakfast among students in their own cafeteria 
116460,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Very clean excellent value for central London lovely breakfast in the Great Hall of the nearby college and a nice walk in the private garden Very close to Gt Ormond St Hospital Extremely helpful staff 
116461,Goodenough Club, I have been to this hotel on numerous occasions The hotel opened up a series of new annexes which are far below the standard of the rooms in the main body yet cost the same which is not little In short they got greedy and made a great and unusual venue into a modest and common one Not really worth the money now Too bad I really liked it before I will have to look for alternatives now , Personnel was kind thogough and caring as always 
116462,Goodenough Club, I liked everything but should have been prepared for the fact that there wasn t room service and picked something up on my walk from Kings Cross to the hotel, Lovely staff on reception very polite and helpful Great location for conference at Royal College of Surgeons walking distance of Kings Cross Lovely room with modern ensuite
116463,Goodenough Club, Nothing , I got the room for 120 reduced It was excellent value Everything was very new clean and comfy I would definitely go back and recommend 
116464,Goodenough Club, The room that we initially got does not look at all like the one on the photos while booking Room was small and looking at the wall of the building With surcharge we ve managed to get a room that was much nicer , The location It s 7 min walk to Russel Square station and very nice and quiet The breakfast is in college complex and quite nice experience not a standard hotel breakfast The staff was helpful and kind 
116465,Goodenough Club, Would be much better if there was city view from the room , Friendly and efficient staff Particularly like front office staff Ahmed who had rendered professional services 
116466,Goodenough Club,No Negative, The room was tastefully decorated and had a lot more character than the chain hotels in the area The building was also very beautiful and it was nice that they made a bit of a play of the history 
116467,Goodenough Club,No Negative, The location of the hotel is within walking distance of the West end it is set in a lovely quiet road The room was clean spacious with a fridge and tea and coffee making facilities The bathroom was lovely with plenty of towels and hot water we would definitely use this hotel again 
116468,Goodenough Club, Stayed 4 nites Room was not completed by housekeeping most days Forgot to make the bed one day Replenishing amenities was spotty Breakfast chaotic staff seemed willing but perhaps not well directed porridge was curious but not good and coffee access required much patience No How was your stay at checkout leading me to surmise that my criticisms would not be helpful Also suggest hotel closer to an underground station if that matters to a potential guest , The name 
116469,Goodenough Club, Heating was a little too high for me , The hotel was lovely It was unusual in that it is part of a college so breakfast is served in the main college building Great atmosphere Perfect location for seeing the museums and being close to Euston Beautiful part of London would happily stay here again 
116470,Goodenough Club, Breakfast was provided and would have been great but it was cold and there was nowhere to sit as it was so busy, Location is great for Kings Cross and St Pancreas You d never think you were in central London 
116471,Goodenough Club, The hot water broke in the room this may have been a one off incident so not putting too much on it , Lovely quiet location helpful staff lovely facilities
116472,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Well appointed room recently refurbished Options for dinner and breakfast in College Hall across the street in the amazing Great Hall Staff friendly and helpful
116473,Goodenough Club, There was nothing to dislike We even enjoyed the breakfast in the Great hall just like being back at collage tray and all loved it , Everything was perfect we have found a gem in the middle of London
116474,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Nice quiet room at the back and excellent shower and bathroom though the designer sink trough wasn t very user friendly Very close to my meeting location 
116475,Goodenough Club, The toilet paper was substandard for a hotel of even 1 star There was a lack of clarity got the breakfast arrangements maybe a simple piece of paper detailing where to go and that you can help yourself to anything and the student prices do not apply to you , We liked the fact the room was very spacious The location was good Bathroom a little small but perfectly serviceable 
116476,Goodenough Club, A bit too expensive for personal trips to London and so contradicts the ethos of being a charity for students and alumni This was a business trip but I d like to return for a personal stay but it s difficult to pay so much , The Staff were so welcoming and friendly and I was treated like a King A real haven in a busy city a home from home Will definitely return for business Shame the prices are so high these days re private use Special thanks to Sam Ahmed and the other lovely people on reception 
116477,Goodenough Club, Noisy guests arriving late at night but not sure that is the hotel s fault , Having breakfast across the road in the Great Hall Not gourmet but quite an experience that took me back It was a very quiet location The square across the road has wild parakeets 
116478,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Great central but quiet location to St pancras spotless room and good carry out breakfast as we left early would have no hesitation in staying here again
116479,Goodenough Club, No real problems other than a poorly fitting window that made a banging noise from time to time, Good sized room modern and clean Coffee tea making facilities Efficient staff 10 minutes from King s X St Pancras
116480,Goodenough Club, The Asian staff in reception in the morning is quite nice but the one who is in charge of the reception in the night is bad both in facial expression and attitude We only have a luggage But the moment he saw the luggage he gave us a obvious white eye and started to murmured about his backache We even not asked for any help If this is the attitude goes with a so call 4star hotel I think the full score must be ten star , Room is clean 
116481,Goodenough Club, Pity there is not a lift, Location is an oasis of quiet yet so central Staff were helpful and friendly Didn t have time to go to the Hall for breakfast but buffet in the building was fine
116482,Goodenough Club,No Negative, Great location in a quiet square close to Euston and St Pancras stations Pleasant old town house building with plain but attractive rooms Single room is not huge but perfectly adequate Breakfast can be simple option in the same building or wider choice over the square in the college s Great Hall Good value 
116483,Goodenough Club, No lift and steep stairs Building works at moment Aug 2015 Neither of these things were problems for us and there was no building noise while we were there but other guests might want to be aware , Brand new rooms Very friendly and helpful staff Breakfast included over in the Great Hall of the College was a real surprise not fabulous food but a nice experience
