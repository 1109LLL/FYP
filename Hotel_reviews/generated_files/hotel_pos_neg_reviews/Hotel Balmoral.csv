471302,Hotel Balmoral, Very bad wi fi connection Very expensive breakfast with not much choice , Good value for money Central location Good amenities in the bathroom Spanish brand Ritual Comfortable pillows
471303,Hotel Balmoral, The airconditioning in the room was very bad Also the breakfast buffet had very very limited options even more so for my wife who is a vegetarian So we didn t go for the breakfast , The location is key to this property Could just jump on the bus right in front of the hotel and it will take you to almost all of the key attractions 
471304,Hotel Balmoral, Hearing doors slam from across the hall , I enjoyed my time at HB Tiny but acceptable room bathroom was nice and clean Easy location to walk around from 
471305,Hotel Balmoral, nothing every thing was best only break fast was good, it has an excellent location very clean excellent wifi if it had a better breakfast i would rate it exactly 10
471306,Hotel Balmoral, The hotel wifi was patchy and kept disconnecting , Location was excellent room was large modern and clean and bathroom was nicely sized Perfect for our 3 day stay 
471307,Hotel Balmoral, Had a room on 1st floor and every 5 min the room was shaking due to underground trainracks all the day between 06 23 Hard to sleep Bugs in toilett both nights Wouldnt go back , Wifi ok
471308,Hotel Balmoral, It was not really in the city center You need to walk either 25 mins or you need to take the subway and 2 stops from Catalunya But if you go in the summer and you want to go to sea regularly it is very far from Barcelonata , Clean big room big bathroom
471309,Hotel Balmoral, Due to proximity of busy streets metro tram we had a LOT of vibrations and noise in our room located on the 1st floor Bathroom wasn t clean when we arrived brown spots some kind of product all over the toilet We never managed to book a spa appointment there was is only one masseuse and she manages her agenda herself Basically if she s with a client the service is unreachable , Nicely located Staff was friendly enough 
471310,Hotel Balmoral, Window of the very dark room was facing the pipehouse of the hotel, Very good bed and sufficient room unfortunately no view OK breakfast and coffee Excellent parking in garage Good value for money in good central location with Ramblas and all amenities nearby For Barcelona reasonable quiet 
471311,Hotel Balmoral, Room service food does not have many options When we got to our hotel after waiting in customs for 3 hours after a 12 hour flight we just wanted to relax in our room and not have to go explore for a restaurant The food was eh but it fixed our hunger problem This was not a problem for us though we were not in Barcelona to eat hotel food There is a McDonalds across the street around the corner that would have been a better option just for the night But again this was not a problem We were just hungry and needed something so their food sufficed , PERFECT location if you plan to use the metro 2 blocks away from Diagonal Metro which took us to all main attractions Rooms were very clean staff is super friendly The hotel itself is in nice area with nice streets unlike other towers where there is graffiti everywhere Felt safe Would 100 recommend this 
471312,Hotel Balmoral, Wi fi acess needs to be reenginereed Having to register is time consuming and plain annoying , Second time Balmoral Good quality hotel well located a few meters from Av Diagonal a short stroll from La Rambla Excelent breakfast Not cheap but in line with other offers 
471313,Hotel Balmoral, Breakfast was rather expensive would have expected coffee tea facilities in the rooms , Good location close to a number of restaurants within walking distance of the city centre Also close to Hop On Hop Off bus routes 
471314,Hotel Balmoral, All was all right , Great breakfast served by profi staff The nearest metro station just behind the corner The room was well equipped by minibar missing red white wine a little bit Very comfortable beds The top was Ritual brand in bathroom 
471315,Hotel Balmoral, When we opened the window we looked at a wall However that was not a big inconvenience it was probably because we had one of the cheaper rooms , Breakfast welness room was very nice
471316,Hotel Balmoral, Small elevators for claustrophobic person , Nice and helpful staff good variety of breakfast good location clean room with big comfortable bed nice view from my room I had a room with a big terrace which made it more than 4 stars 
471317,Hotel Balmoral, The standard rooms have small beds but after an upgrade we cannot complain about anything because it was fantastic , The breakfast and large terras were great also the spa is really nice and massages where good Location is perfect for a city trip and easy to walk to touristic buildings and shops 
471318,Hotel Balmoral, The air conditioning didn t work very well as it was quite old so room got very warm very quickly hotel is located right by the Main Street so noise level too high to keep window open all night , The location was amazing 5 minutes walk to the diagonal metro station or 20 minute walk into the centre and las ramblas Loads of unique bars and restaurants Hotel was very clean and helpful staff on reception Would definetly use the hotel again 
471319,Hotel Balmoral, Room too small interior so was dark Breakfast set up is too spread out Not easy to access , Location cleanliness Althouugh somewhat dry thr Staff is there for you 
471320,Hotel Balmoral, The room was a bit warm at times but we did not reside a lot of time in the room so it was not that big of a problem , Excellent room at a very convenient location The staff was very friendly and were very helpful when we had to arrive late at the hotel 
471321,Hotel Balmoral, The jeating system was not working when i asked to the staff they said that it was not that cold thats why the turnes it off it was 2 degree in the night and we were with our 16 months baby girl , The locatipn was cool it was close to each important places

471324,Hotel Balmoral, Our shower didn t work properly so we had to hold the shower head we also had to wait for our room on the first day and then each day had to wait for our room to be cleaned , The hotel was trendy and modern very clean and great value for money
471325,Hotel Balmoral, The staff on the reception desk didn t speak unless spoken to They carried on chatting to each other and didn t look up to say hello or anything With the exception of a younger man who was polite and helpful The older man was very dour and dismissive to the point of rudeness The bathroom door looked as though the bottom had been hacked with a blunt blade two tiles in the bathroom were hanging off , Location
471326,Hotel Balmoral, Nothing, Nice place nice breakfast nice people etc Barcelona is very nice country Street Bar cafe gauidi picasso tapas sangria etc Everything is great Everywhere is spectacular 
471327,Hotel Balmoral, In true European tradition there were no wash clothes However they do provide one bath sponge not a poofy per room It would have been nice to have two because there were two of us , The room was a good size The terrace made it feel so much more spacious We had great maid service every day Our last evening there we asked for a taxi to be there at a certain time for our departure and it was very timely The hotel had great service and is a beautiful hotel

471331,Hotel Balmoral, Having to advise staff exactly what type of reservations that was made through Booking com and being able to show the arrangements that had been made without staff stating something different , Communications between Booking and Hotel needs a little improvement This will allow the clients to know up front what to expect Assistance by Bell Man was Outstanding
471332,Hotel Balmoral, Elevator is a bit small for big luggage A bit expensive but acceptable for this location , Staffs are friendly and helpful Great location and clean room 
471333,Hotel Balmoral,No Negative, The location of this hotel was perfect for us we were only staying one night We had no issues and had a pleasant stay it was a very quiet hotel and is perfect if you want to be close to Passaig de Gracia and La Rambla There is also a metro station very near by 
471334,Hotel Balmoral, The double bed was two singles pushed together which was a bit inconvenient kept slipping down the middle, Really good location and lovely hotel clean and modern
471335,Hotel Balmoral, The bed was very uncomfortable every movement causes noises that woke me up The shower tab was not very well regulated either too cold or too warm water I had , Cleanness mini fridge in the room 
471336,Hotel Balmoral, That we have to pay extra the Breakfast , The location of the property is ideal as many of the Buss lanes stop just outside to from the property to from any other location in the city

471338,Hotel Balmoral, Beds a touch firm lift quite small for anyone claustrophobic About 25 minute walk to Las Ramblas more closely situated to shopping areas , Great breakfast selection leaning more toward the continental style Lovely contemporary hotel Great staff little bit of a language barrier with all but one receptionist but we got by Nice small gym sauna sun terrace on the 9th floor We got a free second round of drinks in the bar when we arrived Ask about this if reception forget to mention it it s noted on the little hotel map folder they give you The barmaid feigned no knowledge of the deal then said its just one drink we stood our ground and sent her to check 22 euro round of drinks gratis Thank you very much
471339,Hotel Balmoral, No hot water kettle in the room that was a problem the location is good if you want to shop but it is far removed from the more interesting sights of Barcelona ,No Positive
471340,Hotel Balmoral, Location is not the best ok commuting by metro to e g Plaza Catalunya but by walking it s a bit far Standard rooms have basically no windows or they face the next building just a few meters away so opening the curtains is not an option Difficult to adjust water temperature in the shower And you can hear everything from the hallway so bring earplugs Feels expensive for what you get , Clean hotel 
471341,Hotel Balmoral, They didn t have family rooms so we had to put the 3 year old in the grandparent s room , Easy feel to the neighbourhood Good quality breakfast Short walking distance to Sightseeing bus 
471342,Hotel Balmoral, A couple entered our room They stated the front desk made a mistake Later the front desk stated they did not have knowledge of the incident , Great location Many great places to eat and for people who like to walk we were able to get everywhere we needed Staff was great 
471343,Hotel Balmoral, Nothing This is a great hotel to visit , The room was simple but fantastic The hotel was nice and centrally located to many tourist attractions and not too far away from the Gothic quarter Expect to walk a little bit though 
471344,Hotel Balmoral, Almost everything about this hotel was bad Staff were rude especially the lady who is serving in the morning The room was tiny not even having room to put my luggage The window was facing an ugly inside wall The price was exhorbitant for this type of accommodation The room hardwood floor was dirty and left that way I would not give this hotel even 2 stars I will never go back to this hotel , Location
471345,Hotel Balmoral, The bed was harder than we liked and room was warm but all of Spain tended to keep warmer rooms , The staff were excellent and the facilities awesome Close to double decker bus lines to see the things we wanted to see and yet far enough away from all the tourists 
471346,Hotel Balmoral, No restaurant to speak of only bar snacks , Location was excellent and the wifi was blazingly quick Lots of excellent facilities available I booked for three nights but arrived very late and they only charged me for two nights which was greatly appreciated The staff were helpful and attentive and responded to requests quickly 
471347,Hotel Balmoral, The bathroom needs some renovations It looks not fresh enough and hairdryer is too old It is also not very clear when you book a room that it can be a room without window So I recommend to doublecheck if it is important for you We changed the room when arrived It is good they had some other available rooms so we were happy , Good location and quiet neighborhood A lot of nice restaurants around beautiful Gaudi architecture streets and the main shopping streets are very close Friendly and kind staff We arrived very late and were very welcomed Clean and comfortable room Very good value for money 
471348,Hotel Balmoral, Nothing a great experience, I got help with my luggage from front desk There was chilled water available in the foyer The room was very spacious and sheets were crisp The fruit at breakfast was gorgeous fresh and varied Cappucinos were available self service and lots of freshly sqeezed orange juice The staff were very courteous and professional It s in a quiet location but just minutes from several metro stops and with the Placa de Catalunya a pleasant stroll away 
471349,Hotel Balmoral, Our room shakes every 20 mins when we assume the subway goes under the hotel Also lot of noise in our room from pipes etc in ceiling , Good location for walking to things Helpful staff
471350,Hotel Balmoral, View from the room was awful see photo Actually the window has smoked glass Curtain cannot be moved Very strong and annoying the noise of the air conditioning system in the room , Very good location Lady at reception desk was very helpful and friendly She provided us with useful information 
471351,Hotel Balmoral, Misleading room type while booking Booked interior room which means windows face the wall but for the hotel apparently interior room means super tiny bed not suited for 2 people Tried to change but staff was very rude especially the old guy on the reception Did not sleep the whole night as the bed is too small and it s too hot to breath in the room The next day apparently there were no free rooms changed for last 2 nights and were charged extra It s not the first time staying in this hotel plus recommended to our friends Will never go back, Location is good In general hotel is good
471352,Hotel Balmoral, Window into airshaft did not give much light although it made for a nicely quiet room bed rather narrow, Lovely breakfast We enjoyed the sauna with roof terrace The location is great not exactly touristy but still in the city with restaurants and shopping 
471353,Hotel Balmoral, When we arrived the receptionist was not very helpful even though one of us speaks fluent Spanish We d reserved breakfast and a parking place and the receptionist struggled to give us either On the other hand when we checked out on Sunday the great receptionist was able to refund us the breakfast we missed due to sleeping too late She also made sure we could leave our car in the parking for a bit longer , Great location good room with a good double bed not twins placed together We were on the first floor so we could hear the subway rumbling under us but the double glazed windows kept out all street nice We d come again 
471354,Hotel Balmoral, I like this hotel and always stay there as it is a good business hotel and close to where I work but I was truly disappointed last time I stayed at Balmoral we had booked three different rooms for me and my colleagues and arrived at 11h00 am they wanted us to pay an extra amount for early check in knowing that the rooms were already available As a regular customer I will reconsider staying there from now on,No Positive
471355,Hotel Balmoral, It is a pity to get such a dark room and quite noisy WC Drainage from the rooms on floors above we were in the 2nd level , Location very good Nice and kind staff
471356,Hotel Balmoral, View from our room was not so nice but it was quiet at night No traffic noise Also our room was rather small for 3 people Third bed was squeezed into a regular two beds room , Good location Safe and close to metro and restaurants 
471357,Hotel Balmoral, the room was pretty small but good size for a solo traveller the only things is that the windows is looking in the internal court so you can t open it , internet staff location cleaness
471358,Hotel Balmoral, We were quite disappointed with our stay at this hotel The room was not as it was pictured on this website the original room we were given had torn sheets and was much smaller than described then upon moving rooms to a bigger bed and room it left much to be desired from a four star establishment The cleaning lady walked in our room at 8am despite a Do not disturb sign and honestly for the price it was a disappointment with lacking facilities such as a sauna and steam room that weren t turned on and a sun deck with only a few deck chairs I was really disappointed because it was the low point of a great trip , The staff was quite helpful and the location was very nice

471361,Hotel Balmoral, The rooms weren t soundproof at all Inside our room there was a door connecting the room next to us We could hear everything We requested for a double bed but instead there were two single beds attached one to the other The construction of the beds was really light as a result whenever we were lying down they were moving and separating Not appropriate at all for a couple S, Nice hotel location
471362,Hotel Balmoral, Nothing to complain about , The location was excellent WiFi worked well The fitness center and sun deck was an added bonus The room was very comfortable 
471363,Hotel Balmoral, A pool would have added to the experience The gym was very small but adequate for a quick fix , Staff couldn t have been more helpful going the extra mile helping with tourist advice car parking even telephoning the post office when my passports were lost in the post Good location near la Pedrera in Diagonal area handy for metro to all other tourist attractions
