88644,Montagu Place Hotel, Our room was a little small and there is no lift , The hotel is cozy comfortable clean and quiet The location is very good and the staff is very helpful friendly and efficient 
88645,Montagu Place Hotel, The walls are very thin and we were constantly disturbed by people walking past stomping in the room above at 7am creaky floorboards and especially the group of people in the reception area until at least 2 30am loudly having drinks I would have thought the hotel either would ask them to leave or have some way of containing the sound The hotel did give us a 50 refund for the inconvenience but it ruined a good night s sleep My general feeling of the place was that although it sells itself as boutique and yes it s very well presented tidy clean and the staff were wonderful it just didn t have the quirkiness I imagined for a romantic weekend especially at that price It s a very expensive area too The room was awkwardly laid out in an L shape with a sharp corner jutting out right next to the bed This made it difficult to squeeze by with your suitcase and made it difficult and a bit annoying to get ready to go out The mirror above the desk dresser is placed too high My partner is average height 5 8 and couldn t see her face properly in the mirror when doing her hair and makeup and this is the only place where she could plug in a hairdryer , This hotel is without a doubt beautifully presented The decor is lovely in this listed property The bed was comfortable It has a nice selection of toiletries The filter coffee in the room is a very nice touch The staff were very friendly helpful and polite 
88646,Montagu Place Hotel, The bed was too small, The location of the hotel was perfect If I was being extra picky the size of the bed was a little small for us both my husband and I are tall and used to a queen size bed we kept waking each other up when we turned over 
88647,Montagu Place Hotel, Not many additional facilities like a gym or pool , I enjoyed my stay at Montague Joao had great customer service and created a comfortable environment for us The decor of the hotel was very well done 
88648,Montagu Place Hotel, Breakfast was very nice but slightly high at GBP 15 pp, Lovely staff Was the perfect hotel for my first trip to London small boutique quaint Had been an old townhouse Great location 
88649,Montagu Place Hotel,No Negative, Incredibly kind and accommodating staff Was able to check in early Room was great Breakfast is really copious and good A little gem in Marylebone I will be back 
88650,Montagu Place Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is well positioned not a far walk from Marble Arch as well as a block away from Baker Street Good area Each person on reception was helpful with directions or taxi and any other needs that we required Patient too Comfortable beds 
88651,Montagu Place Hotel, As a town house hotel Montagu Place has restricted space to work with Whilst they ve definitely made the most of it there isn t a lift and the bar may be a little tight if too many guests get thirsty at the same time , The staff were not just attentive but genuinely friendly The building and the room itself were beautiful It s in a great location to access central west and south west London and surprisingly easy to get to East London via Old Street It s a little tucked away from the main thoroughfares so it s peaceful during the day and quiet at night Ground coffee and a cafetiere in the room was a much appreciated touch 
88652,Montagu Place Hotel, Nothing, Staff were amazing especially Voila They couldn t do enough for us Clean hotel lovely Molton Brown bathroom products Lovely breakfast Brilliant location

88655,Montagu Place Hotel, No hot water and 1Mb mobile so if you want just a bed for 140 I would recommend Z Hotels just around the corner better value for money and hot water , Good location well mannered staff and presentable 
88656,Montagu Place Hotel, Nothing, We both absolutely loved everything about the room the staff and the location It was an amazing weekend which was made perfect because of the hotel The only reason the price didn t get excellent is because I do think it s expensive for one night But that s London in general The man who greeted us was fantastic And definitely will be stopping there again 
88657,Montagu Place Hotel, My only slight disappointment during the whole stay was a smoothie this was probably down to my taste I was expecting a very fruity mango drink but it was made with milk yoghurt and I could only really taste banana , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and made us feel very welcome The breads and pastries at breakfast were very good 
88658,Montagu Place Hotel, The stains and dirty carpet , The location worked very well for us The room was very well equipped and comfortable The only negative was the carpet was fairly dirty and stained

88671,Montagu Place Hotel, I think the pipework from the upper floors must have run through the boxing in our basement room subsequently it was very noisy with sounds of running water meaning I hardly slept for the two nights we stayed , The staff were very pleasant the decor was nice and the location was great

88680,Montagu Place Hotel, Just a couple of things that would have given top ratings all round a bath robe Sky tv 10 Manchester street hotel provide these the other hotel I often stay at nearby Most importantly having doors that are well fitted so don t let the bright light from the landing shine in all night long Such a shame when they ve gone to the effort of fitting superb blackout curtains Also the mirror in the rooms is at a poor height for doing hair and make up Too high if seated and too low if standing , Love the room I stay regularly and they always give me my same favourite room The staff are exceptional too
