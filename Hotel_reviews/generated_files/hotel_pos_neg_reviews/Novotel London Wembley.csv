199865,Novotel London Wembley, Bit stingy with teabags milk but could get extra at reception On our last night I was kept awake all night I m not kidding all night There were doors banging shouting to one another in the corridor in out of lift area It stopped when they left at about 5 45am but I was too anxious to sleep by then I went out to them at 2 30ish asked them to be quiet that was when I realised they were in room next to us She said What quite abruptly I asked again please be quiet she said ok then carried on doing the same I think they were leaving flying home to India or the like but they kept us up all night I rang down three times when they got to our floor it had all quietened down for about five minutes but the duty manager was gone when it started again When he came the last time the women from next door the man in the room opposite were going back into their rooms I went out this time voiced what had been going on all night in front of them I think the ma must have said they were leaving then I watched through my peephole as they went about ten minutes later When I asked for an extra hour the next morning so that we could shower pack as we had been up all night the night staff hadn t even left a message about it I was too upset dumbfounded to complain again That really was unfair completely spoiled our break So the hotel was great but in the scheme of things it doesn t matter , Easy to get tube very close there s a lift to the left of the steps if you can t face the climb Breakfast was good though I would have liked poached eggs or fried or boiled Hate scrambled tasteless Room was clean comfortable 
199866,Novotel London Wembley, Nowhere to park outside whilst sorting access to parking bays Glass doors to bathroom toilet little privacy , Friendly and accommodating staff Proximity to Wembley stadium Onsite parking 
199867,Novotel London Wembley, The only thing is the glass toilet door which is not quite safe for children using it , Location staff and cleanliness are all good Good value of room in London 
199868,Novotel London Wembley, I could not find the softer pillow on the first night was packed away in the room and I could not turn off the air con did not help my sleep Also as I moved the bed I found dirt under the bed , It is a fair place for a fair price The restaurant improved a lot Really lovely staff breakfast is excellent and I was in Central London in minutes 
199869,Novotel London Wembley, I didn t find the staff to be particularly helpful and thought they were a little abrupt I was pleased to have a mini fridge in the room but then discovered it wasn t very cold , I found my stay pretty average 
199870,Novotel London Wembley, Service was quite poor and was completely over priced for what was on offer but due to the weekend Adele the prices were put through the room 745 for 2 nights Keys didn t work in lifts or stairs leaving us unable to get to our room several times Then when finally reaching our room we were unable to get in due to the keys not working in the door Reported several times to be told they worked each time having to be reset Got a little tedious , Great breakfast options
199871,Novotel London Wembley, Shower still required fixing even after it was seen to by staff member Quite noisy during day as hotel is adjacent to several building sites but that will be temporary I expect , Near a Tube Station Designer Shopping Centre Hotel room modern clean spacious Pleasant Dining area Emphasis on environmental sustainability

199875,Novotel London Wembley, Adele Concert Being Cancelled , For the price we paid initially and the extra for upgrade breakfast should be included The Hotel is clean and modern and has a superb view of Wembley Stadium and convieniant for Wembley Matches Concerts it is within walking distance and shopping and dining are easily within reach The front desk staff were friendly and helpful 
199876,Novotel London Wembley, Not much to do nearby unless you are attending an event at Wembley, A fresh new hotel building a stone s throw away from Wembley Stadium Stay here to avoid the hassle of traveling to and away from the stadium Bright large well equipped rooms Friendly efficient and helpful reception staff

199879,Novotel London Wembley, Booking com told me this hotel has car parking it has 22 spaces For a hotel of this size you have to be early very early to get a space I would never have paid a premium event day price for this hotel had I known Booking com should be ashamed of themselves I do not trust Booking com after this after my final trip this month I will no longer do business with Booking com After event bar service in hotel AAAwas terrible Gave up after 20 minutes waiting Ordered room service and received mediocre food still waited for drinks as room service forgot them ,No Positive

199881,Novotel London Wembley, Nothing to complain about but very pricey despite location , Extra door staff on concert nights Able to leave bags at reception after checking out Comfortable beds 
199882,Novotel London Wembley, At times the restaurant seemed chaotic They got our lunch order wrong and we had to wait ages for our food Ling queues for the bar in the afternoon but better in the evening Breakfast was bought 2 of everything despite only ordering one , The location is great for Wembley and also for the outlet centre 
199883,Novotel London Wembley, glass en suit doors were unusual no mini bar in room cheap toilet paper a small but significant gripe combined bar dining area could get very busy these are minor niggles that for a short visit do not really matter for a longer stay they might become more of an issue for some people On the the whole an enjoyable short stay , clean bright reception area friendly welcome great location for Wembley stadium king size bed air conditioned rooms safe in room usual tea coffee facilities in a large clean well furnished room Staff were all friendly and very polite and helpful would use again for a short stay 
199884,Novotel London Wembley, Nothing, Great location friendly staff comfy bed Perfect for visitors to the stadium and arena It was so satisfying not to be in the queue for the tube at the end of the concert 
199885,Novotel London Wembley, when i checked out i seemed to have been charged 11 for water we didn t have anything from the mini bar when i said so the lady removed the charge but how did that happen the same two bottles that were in there when we arrived were still there also we booked without breakfast i think it was 16 on the website so i considered that too much when i arrived we were offered it for 11 that s a bit odd , comfy bed very pleasant and friendly staff grooviest carpet in the corridors where can i buy it 
199886,Novotel London Wembley, We were supposed to check in by 2 our room wasn t ready till 5 were were standing outside our room whilst they were making our beds that first impression spoilt it a bit for it, Close to all amenities 
199887,Novotel London Wembley, Nothing, Everything was perfect Actually it is quite far from Central London but the hotel is sooo close to tube station so it doesn t matter And there are market coffee shop as well And room was really clean wide and cozy Also they were really kind people Honestly I kept my wallet in safe and I knew it after checking out They collected it for three days It was my fault and i tried to call them to make sure it so it might take their time but they were really kind When I arrived there to turn back it even they are soooo kind Breakfast is also good point in here You can eat all fresh and delicious british breakfast in the morning 
199888,Novotel London Wembley, Only slight niggle is with breakfast you can have your eggs how you like with breakfast but you have to order them this system isn t very clear and takes a long time for them to be cooked and bought out to you When they finally did they gave them to the wrong table and the couple just took them and ate them , The rooms were lovely and spacious excellent buffet breakfast with lots of choice for everyone including vegetarian options Great location with a shopping centre and tube station in walking distance 
199889,Novotel London Wembley, Three minor complaints The TV remote control handset needed new batteries the shaving socket in the bathroom didn t work and the toilet did not flush well I reported these faults at check out after having repeated them a note was eventually made on a scrap of paper for maintenance to look into I m not convinced this will happen The two staff members seemed to find them amusing , Fabulous comfy bed good pillows and lightweight duvet modern bathroom with complimentary shampoo bath stuff etc Secure quiet bedroom no noise from the corridors or neighbouring rooms good temperature control coffee and tea supplies provided Excellent breakfast choice kept well topped up despite two large tour parties descending en masse at the same time causing seating issues and being rather demanding on some of the staff 3 minutes walk from the tube station
199890,Novotel London Wembley, Beds were twin but very narrow and uncomfortable Mateess protector did not fit too so uncomfortable Always thought we would fall out Had a plumbing issue in that after flushing the shower did not work for sometime , Early checkin
199891,Novotel London Wembley, Non English speaking staff breakfast not included in price expensive paid 169 for 1 night room only no view as requested very basic room and no hotel facilities The Hilton is far better for the same price stayed there many times but thought I would try Novotel would not stay again , Distance to rail station
199892,Novotel London Wembley, There was a 20 minute queue to get a drink from the bar at night more staff needed, Reception staff were very friendly and as we were attending an event at Wembley Stadium they allowed us to check in early which helped massively 
199893,Novotel London Wembley, We kept using the key the wrong way and think an arrow would benefit some as you would not automatically place the picture on top of the key card upside down , We were greeted very warmly on arrival and thought the room was lovely
199894,Novotel London Wembley, Had to keep getting my key card changed for the room 5 times to be exact that s a lot of trips up and down the stairs because couldn t use the lift without it very annoying, Fabulous location and clean comfortable rooms
199895,Novotel London Wembley, Trying to order room service for my tired daughter holding for half an hour leaving her to go and order myself and being told they d sent staff home before the event as they weren t that busy Barman s exact words I ve told you we ve sent staff home so what is it you d like me to do For such an expensive hotel not the service I expected , The closeness to the Stadium
199896,Novotel London Wembley, The hotel charge 5 for any room service order which is just ridiculous We contacted room service to ask for a bucket of ice only to be told we would be charged 5 for it needless to say it was down to the bar to get our own , The location was brilliant to attend a concert at Wembley Stadium We travelled from London Euston to Wembley Central then had a 20 minute walk to the hotel It was easily located The room was very clean and comfortable beds

199903,Novotel London Wembley, The bed and pillow not too comfortable The room card logic was stupid it cannot be put near mobile phone or inside the wallet as the phone or other credit card will cause the room card to malfunction So in a span of six days stay I need to reactivate the card at the reception for more ten times , Location was convenient close to Tube and train station shops outlets 
199904,Novotel London Wembley, Luckily there was disabled parking but none other 30 spaces first come first serve we were told by email Bar only open until 11 so not quite enough time to enjoy post event visit , We had a very comfortable stay The hotel was clean comfortable and service was just right Process Environment Bar Restaurant and room all were terrific Loved the rain shower and excellent water pressure very soothing Location was excellent and we were happy that car could be driven up to pick up disabled passenger and suitcases 
199905,Novotel London Wembley, My internet rerouted me I thought we were staying close to Heathrow but were 15 miles away Internet did not indicate reroute which was annoying , Quiet even with soccer match
199906,Novotel London Wembley, Grotty neighbourhood Room service arrived quickly but of poor quality No decent dining options found in the area Some bad smells could be related to some of the football fans , Quiet 4th floor room despite the location Clean modern efficient

199914,Novotel London Wembley, Parking Even though I called to book parking and was assured it was done got here and was told it s first come first serve basis Parking a nightmare , Facilities location nice and friendly staff
199915,Novotel London Wembley, Most hotels give complementary water in the room but they were 2 25 a bottle Werent explained about using key card to operate the lift luckily another guest explained But truthfully there wasnt anything really not to like , Location was the reason for booking and close to other amenities Staff were friendly and basically it did what it says on the label 
199916,Novotel London Wembley, The hotel television transmission is via the internet The signal was such that it was impossible to watch the television for the duration of my stay as the sound and picture quality were poor very frustrating as I felt out of touch with what was going on in the world The reading light was faulty and kept flickering so it was difficult to read in bed and by the time I found this it was too late to try to get it resolved, Comfortable room with effective air conditioning and in a good location

199920,Novotel London Wembley, Unknowingly I arrived on an event day at the stadium and the hotel has a strict local policy for parking on these days that was not really guest friendly especially when you have kids and lots of luggage But was eventually sorted out after speaking to the duty manager , New hotel building so room standards and set up was naturally expected to be clean and modern Front desk staff friendly and helpful McDonalds for kids Lidl Tesco and many local restaurant within walking distance 
199921,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, The property is extremely good value for money and we had a great experience throughout our stay The staff were really nice during the check in and check out process 
199922,Novotel London Wembley, We had to report a fault with our bed but that was dealt with swiftly The only thing is that they had a match day menu on not the full restaurant menu I understand the reasoning behind this but I was just a little bit disappointed not to be able to look at the whole range of food , Nice and easy to get to a couple of minutes walk from Wembley Park Underground Station Handy for Wembley Stadium as it is situated on Wembley Way Easy check in comfortable quiet room Would stay here again 
199923,Novotel London Wembley, Lack of provisions per person in room Housekeeping knocking door at 8 30 on a Saturday morning wanting to know when its convenient to refresh room wasn t appreciated, The location is ideal easy access to trains

199934,Novotel London Wembley, There was an adjoining door to the next room which let in a little bit of noise from the guests there It also did not feel very secure Perhaps a lock could be installed The door to the hallway was not soundproofed so one could easily be woken up by people talking in the coridoor Finally it was hard to work out how to turn off the fan in the bathroom and it was noisy at night when trying to fall asleep , The room was very well furnished Clean new and I really liked the armchair and footstool It made a nice change to lying on the bed and made the room much more relaxing Usually hotel rooms at this price only have a bed and a desk and basic chair so it was a real plus I also liked the fact that you could open the windows and let fresh air in

200096,Novotel London Wembley, Concerts mean this hotel has a captive audience so they can charge you through the nose and give very average service knowing full well that the client has very little choice but to comply The hotel has the potential to be very good but the reception staff and particularly the bar breakfast management was abysmal The hotel was full after the Springsteen concert so it is obvious that those clients will want a drink after a 3 and a half hour performance How many people did the hotel put on bar duty that night two The result was a 20 minute wait to get a drink with the hotel s own rude security guards not allowing guests to drink anything they had bought elsewhere even outside the front of the hotel same goes for breakfast a full hotel a stupidly narrow period for breakfast to be served finishing at 10am means guess what all the guests arrived for breakfast at 9 30am result Absolute mayhem with staff rushed off their feet queues food drink constantly running out and loads of people complaining The worst breakfast experience I have ever had in a hotel It s not rocket science the management need shooting terrible value for money, Location is great for Wembley station and stadium literally just a couple of minute walk to each 
200097,Novotel London Wembley, After 8 am cleaner came to my room without knocking my door with her key I had to woke up much more earlier then I want to be After an hour her manager came to my room using her key without knocking Bye bye rest This attitude is highly unacceptable in fours star hotel , Location wifi quality of the room

200110,Novotel London Wembley, so near Wembley this hotel should have been better at accommodating the huge amount of people arriving back at the hotel after a concert It was impossible to get even a drink when we returned to the hotel , Plenty of variety in the breakfast 
200111,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, Despite the staff being very busy they all remained polite and helpful This hotel is ideal if you are attending any event at Wembley The breakfast was also delicious with a wide range of choices

200115,Novotel London Wembley, No account was made to deal with the number of guests that were staying at the hotel The wait for service was ridiculous Does the hotel not realise that it s near a venue which generates a large amount of business high occupancy leading to large numbers of people requiring service, Location and room
200116,Novotel London Wembley, I didn t like the glass doors on the bathroom would have preferred a solid door There was also some building work going which woke us up at 7 45 Would have been nice to have been pre warned about the work given the cost of the room or given discount due to the distruption , Staff were very welcoming and friendly upon check in The room was very nice and spacious and the bed was really comfy

200130,Novotel London Wembley, The breakfast was exceptionally poor After waiting over 15 minutes for a table we waited a further 15 minutes or more for teas and coffees and that was after I chased down the waiter The cooked breakfast was just about edible we waited 10 minutes for the bacon to be cooked very poor The staff were polite in particular the gentleman who was front of house I visit and eat at the Novotel in Cardiff on a very regular basis and the food is far superior to the food served at your hotel , Very comfortable bed and pillows 
200131,Novotel London Wembley, Breakfast poor and overpriced queues food being left off order after paying for it at bar rude overworked staff poor management, Location for stadium
200132,Novotel London Wembley, We stayed at the hotel as we were at Wembley for the Bruce Springsteen concert the hotel could have more staff in the bar and restaurant area as there were long queues for the bar on the event day, Friendly and efficient staff Comfortable Great location for Wembley Stadium

200134,Novotel London Wembley, shower was very weak room 1009 and we were allocated a room for disabled which we did not like also seemed to have lost our original 2nd room booking so our colleague was on a different floor level , location excellent
200135,Novotel London Wembley, Some staff were friendly but on the whole they seemed pretty indifferent towards customers, Perfect location between the station and the stadium Breakfast was delicious and loads of choice Room was lovely and spotlessly clean Would definitely book again

200141,Novotel London Wembley, Typical new Ikea style rooms functional but nothing special Carpet in room was badly stained bedroom doors really noisy when people just let them bang to so maybe a problem if you re a light sleeper or want an early night , Stayed here for Championship playoff final location perfect for Wembley I booked in advance got a good rate so I was happy but like any hotel in this area as event gets closer prices become extortionate 
200142,Novotel London Wembley, The breakfast had a good selection but sadly the cooked food was cold good hotelon good location staff friendly and helpful , The room was clean and comfortable the bed lovely and good linen 
200143,Novotel London Wembley, Not a fan of glass bathroom doors as they lacked privacy Restaurant menu could use more options We weren t tempted , Loved the view from our West facing window overlooking wembley way and the stadium Loved the proximity to Wembley Stadium Very clean and modern mostly a great hotel Prices of hotels around wembley during a final are inflated but Novotel was a superior hotel for only a little more 
200144,Novotel London Wembley, Lots of choices for breakfast but if you re just after a cooked English then it s a basic offering only Considering the high cost compared to other hotels this seemed a little odd , The hotel is about as perfectly located for Wembley as you can get Wembley Park underground station is a 3 4 minute walk away Wembley is 5 minutes away and there s a Lidl McDonalds across the street in case you need supplies The room itself was excellent Really liked the space the power shower and the bed Plenty of storage a window you were allowed to open a rarity these days and air con that actually worked and fast Parking was 15 day but well worth it considering the cost of other options No hesitation in recommending this hotel if you re visiting Wembley particularly if you re driving 
200145,Novotel London Wembley, The price of the breakfast buffet is pretty steep at 21 EUR per person We opted to walk 2 minutes and had breakfast at Costa s for less than one third of that price Starbucks and Pr t Manger branches are also just round the corner There is no complimentary water bottle in the room The minibar carried only water but had a charge of over 2 GBP per bottle The range of beers on offer at the bar was not very good , The location was superb a 200 m walk from Wembley metro station along a traffic free quiet pedestrianized area near the stadium and lots of dining opportunities and shops The Metropolitan Line takes you to King s Cross in 20 minutes The Jubilee line also stops at Wembley station Our superior room was very spacious for London standards The bedding pillows and mattress were of excellent quality We slept like a dormouse The rooms are sufficiently sound proofed The bathroom was spic span and again spacious All typical amenities were present No bath tub only shower Towels were of good quality Wifi was free and fast The lobby has two iMac computers where you can print out boarding passes ticket vouchers etc The aircon worked like a gem

200150,Novotel London Wembley, The few drunken football fans in the bar but at least there was security keeping an eye on them Just not very good when I have my 7 yr old there to watch Disney on Ice , Staff very friendly and helpful Fab location Room service was very swift and my daughter loved the pizza 
200151,Novotel London Wembley, Only problem was they could not check in us a couple of hrs early room was available at 2pm as stated so please plan accordingly as mostly it gets full specially during these times, Amazing hotel loved the suite in which we stayed also a superstore just attached to the hotel which is very convenient Location also very convenient just next to Wembley park station 
200152,Novotel London Wembley, The rooms carpet could have been cleaner There were a few stains on the carpet which were quite large and looked as though they had been tried to be covered with the table , The location of the hotel was perfect Was seeing Disney on ice at the O2 which was within walking distance Plenty of shops and restaurants near by 
200153,Novotel London Wembley, Bigger room Clean room close to the lift, On arrival we have been given a room at level 2 that was good when we enterred the room it stincks of smoking the smoke detector was covered up with a sock we had the room changed to level 7 too far from the lift my wife is finding hard to walk and the room was smaller than the first one we had always to ask for things to be done to the room as hoovering the carpet etc 
200154,Novotel London Wembley, The bed was too soft I could tell it was a good quality bed but unfortunately it was too soft for me and I ended up with sore back and hips after sleeping on this bed for a few days , The staff were very kind and professional The location is excellent right between the tube station and the stadiums The rooms are very quiet clean stylish and spacious The lighting in the rooms is beautiful Good quality bed linens 
200155,Novotel London Wembley, Worst NO PARKING FACILITY Was promised big queen bed room it was a ordinary room limited shapoo shower gel Not enough for 2 people , the best was staff location 
200156,Novotel London Wembley, Check in very slow only two desks open when I arrived around 6 pm Used room service for an evening bottle of wine snack and waited a long time and I when it finally arrived it was not with a smile Queue for breakfast next morning was so long we cancelled our breakfast reservation Loads of empty tables but not enough staff on hand to direct guests No idea if it is always like that but odd that they could not cope with the numbers given how close they are to Wembley arena Room was comfortable glad we were on first floor as lifts were as slow as the staff They were happy to look after our luggage until the evening Overall a mixed bag , Location is fabulous less than 5 mins from Wembley Arena 
200157,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, Everything was spot on will be going back Location was great for going to London City Centre with the underground station being a 2 minute walk away shopping near by in wembley was also great 
200158,Novotel London Wembley, The pillows were very uncomfortable why can t there be a variety of pillows to choose from like they do at Premier Inn s My keycard needed to be reactivated 3 times during my stay as I couldn t get into my room very annoying , The rooms had everything that was needed and the location of the hotel for Wembley Stadium was a 2 minute walk away which was great

200161,Novotel London Wembley, If room 608 is anything to go by the queen rooms are dingy and dirty scruffy carpet and chairs and a tiny window We negotiated an upgrade to an excellent queen suite The wifi is very insecure and my server refused to connect The hotel isn t in an attractive area but the rail tube station is right beside it , The staff were very helpful and friendly and the room a queen suite was great value and very comfortable well equipped and clean 
200162,Novotel London Wembley, Too few tea bags for an English lady I usually bring my own to be honest but quite a small thing to complain about , Room was lovely clean fresh and tastefully decorated Loved the toiletries too 
200163,Novotel London Wembley, We visited the day of an FA Cup game at the stadium we weren t attending the game and were dismayed to see that the hotel was fenced off the lobby area was full of incredibly loud football fans and even after our event had finished at 10pm even though the football game had finished at 7pm the hotel lobel was still full of rowdy football fans who were all eating Dominos pizza on the lobby tables The staff did not have any control over these visitors , Good location for Wembley Arena Modern building with modern decor in rooms

200178,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, We did not eat breakfast at the hotel because our travel agent did not include breakfast in our booking We think that breakfast should be automatic as in other hotels even if we had to pay a bit more

200180,Novotel London Wembley, Bar prices and breakfast was over priced with the cost of the room was very high even for London prices, Bed very comfy shower amazing and staff friendly
200181,Novotel London Wembley, The queen bed was two beds pushed together my partner kept sinking in between the two One morning we put the do not disturb sign on the door while we were at breakfast we d left in a hurry and left clothes on the floor which I wanted to tidy up before the room was cleaned but we came back to the room and they d been in to clean anyway with the sign thrown on the floor behind the door , Great location for concerts and stadium events and good transport links for central London tourist attractions Nice clean rooms with a lovely bathroom and toiletries are restocked everyday if you use them Staff are very friendly and committed to making your stay as pleasant as possible Always plenty of people around if you need anyone even late at night Breakfast was lovely and was included in our room rate but we would have happily paid the extra had we decided not to have it included when we originally booked There were lots of continental options and cooked options were kept warm and very tasty LOTS of fruit juices Everything was restocked quickly when it was beginning to run low There was an event on at the stadium one day and the street outside the hotel got very busy The front of the hotel and its outside benches were fenced off with bouncers supervising the gate although there didn t seem to be any trouble it was nice to know that they were there just in case

200185,Novotel London Wembley, The breakfast was very disappointing it took ages for food to get replenished on the buffet and when it did it was cold and I gave up waiting for the pot of tea I ordered I can appreciate the hotel may have been busy and the staff were doing what they could but this needs to be addressed , We were visiting Wembely for a football match at the stadium and the location is excellent 
200186,Novotel London Wembley, I just wish the Reception phone to room was more audible I wear hearing aids and have never had this problem but this would never never put me off staying at this sparkling engaging Hotel, The amazing staff and the exceptional overall design of the Hotel every single employee cared and with a smile

200190,Novotel London Wembley, No free parking but this is being very critical in that we found parking nearby for 24hrs at the cost of 3 50 , Location was ideal for the North London Half Marathon Literally put my kit on and walked out of the door to the start line 
200191,Novotel London Wembley, The view from our room wasn t great we had a view of another building as well as a car park The maids weren t great they made our bed but we had glasses we drank from the night before been left in the room and the bin wasnt emptied Made our room feel dirty , The bed was really comfy the room was nicely laid out as well as the bathroom Staff were really nice and very helpful when we were checking out allowed us to keep our bags in a secure room while we went out 
200192,Novotel London Wembley, Strange high pitch noise at 6 30am for an hour which woke us up , The staff were all very friendly and professional a nice new clean hotel Location was excellent for the tube 
200193,Novotel London Wembley, There was a roof terrace but no one we asked knew how to access it so we could only look at it from our window which was ok because it was cold in London , The bed was incredibly comfortable we both slept like babies for a solid 13 hours 
200194,Novotel London Wembley, Only one window but not a huge issue , The bed is fantastic So comfortable that I slept better then at home almost Breakfast is great as well as its all you can want 
200195,Novotel London Wembley, Room was a disabled room which I did not request which had a connecting door with NO LOCK to the next room Also the Air Conditioning may be wrongly calibrated it s very difficult to get the room nice warm even when set to 24 degrees This was the case last time I stayed here too one year ago , well appointed hotel comfy bed great location for Wembley Arena Stadium
200196,Novotel London Wembley, The room was cold as they often are in February ans the ventilation did nothing to improve that they have offered a portable heater which was effective but noisy so overall the experience felt slightly improvised A room exchange was offered but not an upgrade , Excellent breakfast nice albeit small room helpful staff within 2 3 minutes from the tube station and 20 25 minutes to the city centre good WiFi connection
200197,Novotel London Wembley, My only gripes were only 20 car park spaces gets very busy at breakfast so bit of a wait for table and some food to be restocked option of a bath rather than just a shower even a small sit in bath after long day walking round London, It was very good for my purposes nice room Comfortable bed clean
200198,Novotel London Wembley, The staff are not the friendliest folk The hotel says there is parking but it is limited and becomes full very quickly We were left to find our own parking with very little help from the hotel , The room was very comfortable and the location is fantastic
200199,Novotel London Wembley, There were a few dirty marks on chairs and in hidden places which seemed to be like stains The fridge has a horrible smell of gone off milk but apart from that it was good, The bed was extremely comfy and it was local to the Wembley outlet train station and stadium We left to grab some food for about 20 minutes and by the time we arrived back our room was spotless we was so pleased 
200200,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, Excellent hotel very impressed staff were lovely and polite and even got checked in early couldn t do enough for us Location is brilliant right near the tube Hotel is spotless rooms were really big

200202,Novotel London Wembley, But we booked a room with a double bed when we got there it was two single bed put together couldn t even sleep in the middle because you could feel it , Place looked clean
200203,Novotel London Wembley, Coming home , The staff rooms location etc were all fabulous Our room was spotless and we took advantage of paying reduced rate in advance for breakfast plenty of choice for everyone Nice bar area too 
200204,Novotel London Wembley, Didn t try the breakfast but at 16 45 seemed a bit pricey One of the lifts was out of order for a time leading to large wait times for lift but these things happen and it was repaired same day, As a location for Wembley Stadium couldn t really get anywhere closer Nice clean hotel Bar not too expensive given the location and London prices
200205,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, My daughter and I stayed here We loved it The location was great breakfast was great the room was great and we loved sitting in the bar for a drink and having room service was fun too 
200206,Novotel London Wembley, Staff where good but breakfast staff where a bit short on the ground to clear tables for the amount of people waiting one guy was doing everything when management stood around could have helped out , Perfect place to stay to the Wembley arena and Stadium Hotel is great value for money and large rooms good shower rooms
200207,Novotel London Wembley, The mini bar with 4 bottles of water at 2 75 each The price for breakfast at 16 and anything else listed in the room service was ridiculously overpriced , Comfortable bed good size shower Smell of Lillies at reception

200212,Novotel London Wembley, Maybe it could be a little cheaper as its not central London , The rooms were really lovely Plenty of space and lovely and clean The breakfast was excellent 
200213,Novotel London Wembley, The toilet paper was cheap not very soft even Tescos basic t paper is better than this seemed penny pinching considering the cost of a night s stay is over 100 I could not care less about having a large LCD TV it s the little details that make the difference especially regarding physical comfort The bed felt a little unsupportive and the pillows were too firm for my liking There was also grime in the centre of the shower head The main thing I noticed was the poor sound insulation between the room and the main corridor the door and the large gap underneath it let through too much noise The noise from other guests doors banging loudly in the early hours of Friday night Saturday morning meant I only got 2 hours sleep When I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Wembley I found the room much quieter with no percerptible noise from other guests in the corridors Based on my limited experience of the two I would choose Hilton next time unless price was significantly cheaper at Novotel That being said the Novotel has a more friendly feel to it Overall however due to quieter room I would choose the Hilton given the choice , The free wifi was good Also the lady who came to clean my room was nice and friendly

200220,Novotel London Wembley, Not enough staff on bar to cope with demand often a long queue just to get a drink Not enough seating in combined bar and restaurant area to cope with number of people staying at hotel , Great location only 2 min walk away from Wembley stadium and SSE Arena Lovely clean comfortable rooms Great value for money paid 125 per room 1 night Staff friendly and professional but were run off their feet in bar and restaurant area all the time 
200221,Novotel London Wembley, Would have appreciated a few more tea coffee milk sachets in room Air con heating was a little loud and the quilt seemed to be attached to the bottom of the bed making it impossible to Snuggle up Did get quite cold during the night , Fantastic location polite and friendly staff Clean spacious hotel room would definitely stay here again if visiting Wembley

200243,Novotel London Wembley, All the public areas have huge vases of lilies The smell is intense and overrides the taste of food and drink I m sure the hotel could use other flowers , Very good value for a comfortable stay in London The rooms are good bathrooms clean and the bar and restaurant area delightful except for the lilies

200255,Novotel London Wembley, Had no on site parking if your headed down and need to park your car somewhere do your reasearch first as parking on the day can be quite expensive , Great hotel right next to Wembley

200257,Novotel London Wembley, Lift didn t work we were on 9 floor Fire door was locked Restaurant food was awful and service VERY slow Room poorly serviced with tea and bathroom accessories , Situation was excellent and it was clean 
200258,Novotel London Wembley, The only thing that made me worried was the glass bathroom door it feel uncomfortable u could see through I would not stay in a family room with family , I like about the view at the window and the room was warm and comfy Loved the breakfast I would still go back with family again

200261,Novotel London Wembley, We understand the room would have a mini bar but all this contained was water Also the view was a building site and Currys , Located centrally to Satadium and Arena
200262,Novotel London Wembley, Not such a bad experience but both my husband and I travel a lot and we felt that 16 25 was a bit steep for breakfast An app lead us to an excellent cafe within 5 min walk for a fraction of the price, Very pleasant staff Very comfortable room with good facilities
200263,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, The location was great Very close to the underground and also to Wembley where we were going to watch a concert The staff were very friendly upon arrival and when we left The room was clean and comfortable

200266,Novotel London Wembley, The carpet was very dirty marks and stains all over The worst thing was there was a used sanitary pad in the bath room bin which I ve never experienced before in any hotels or even b bs I didn t complaint at the time because it was only one night stay after a late concert but I won t really choose here other wise , Location is best for staying over after a late concert 
200267,Novotel London Wembley, Not a bad experience but I would have liked a room with a bath Shower was great though, Easily accessed from Wembley tube felt safe walking to the hotel late at night comfortable and quiet room temperature just right bed to die for I really didn t want to have to get up in the morning and I don t usually sleep well when away from home Excellent breakfast unhurried and very good choice Helpful receptionist at check in thank you Letitia

200269,Novotel London Wembley, No, The room with tea coffee and water Dressing gown and hairdryer When we checked in on Facebook to say we were at the X factor and they put on Facebook have a good time from Novotel hotel
200270,Novotel London Wembley, There was no microwave and just one pot although it was later provided upon request , My husband and I were here for 6 nights and the hotel was exceptional rooms were spacious and clean location was excellent close to the station 
200271,Novotel London Wembley, Not a major issue but I wanted to just use the desk lamp to do some work at the desk without disturbing my Wife who had gone to bed but the only way to have the desk lamp switched on is to have ALL the main lights in the room switched on a very odd light switching arrangement not sure if deliberate for some reason of if incorrectly wired when the system was installed I could not move the floor standing lamp stand over to the desk to plug into the socket behind the desk because the lamp stand has an old fashioned 1950 s stle round pin 3 pin plug which won t fit the square pin socket behind desk again very odd electrics , Pretty much everything but most particularly all of the staff were incredibly helpful and courteous even remembering our names in some cases when there were lost of other people staying there Nice personal touches 
200272,Novotel London Wembley, Only minor complaint was when we rang room service they didn t answer but it wasn t a necessity we were just being greedy But thats being really picky would definitely recommend to anyone , We stayed the first weekend in December Friday Monday Hotel room was immaculate and everything was of fantastic quality Having the fridge in the room was a nice touch Bed was unbelievably comfy Bathroom was immaculate towels were fab Always hot water and no problems with water pressure Tube a short walk away and trains to London where consistent throughout the day and night The shopping park opposite was good lidl and mcdonalds are always handy We decided to not have breakfast because we don t eat a lot in the morning 
200273,Novotel London Wembley, Initial confusion when we checked in and someone else was able to get in to our room but this was quickly sorted out The bed was too soft for me but my back doesn t like soft beds , Location efficient and friendly staff very clean and tidy Really nice hotel
200274,Novotel London Wembley, This is now the second time I ve stayed at this branch and I ve never witnessed good customer service from the receptionists Not friendly at all they always look miserable Just very awkward, Room was a nice size with a comfortable bed and a decent sized TV The gym on the 8th floor was very convenient as you can let of some steam if needed 
200275,Novotel London Wembley, The shower bracket was broken and the bed was really uncomfortable especially the pillows , Bar parking food furniture and fixings staff were friendly 
200276,Novotel London Wembley, The fact that after paying 130 for a room they took 170 as a preauthorisation which left me stuck in London as I couldn t afford to get home to Manchester I also couldn t afford to pay my bills and they bounced and then the bank charged me They are refusing to give me a refund or pay anything towards the debts they have got me in so spending 1 night in a hotel for 130 has actually turned out to be more around 400 500 which isn t good at all , The hotel itself was nice and clean the air con didn t quite work but I guess it was alright 
200277,Novotel London Wembley, The 24 7 room service menu was poor as only 4 things to choose from When it arrived it was stone cold curry We got the last space in car park very limited parking , Clean and comfortable New and modern Great location for gig at wembley or 20 mins to Centre on tube Lidl 2 min walk away very handy as well as Mcdonalds 
200278,Novotel London Wembley,No Negative, All the staff we met during our staff were friendly professional and extremely helpful and accommodating to our needs I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family 
200279,Novotel London Wembley, I did not it mind but my husband was really upset with the glass door of the bathroom it is not good if you pay attention to your privacy there are no bathrobes or slippers in the room i did not like the open wardrobe and there were no shelves to put your folded cloths like sweaters tshirts , I love the breakfast free daily papers being close to Sainsbury s Wembley Park Shopping Center and Wembley Park Underground Station which has both Jubilee line and the Metropolitan line But you should also keep in mind that getting to the city center takes app 30 to 40 minutes by tube The day we hung dnd on the door the housekeeping lady sent a letter to our room and offered to clean the room in the evening that was also nice and thoughtful the hotel is brand new and very clean 
200280,Novotel London Wembley, Would of liked a view but maybe on my next visit I ll ask personally for one , The beds are wonderful breakfast was delicious and the staff were wonderful xx

200285,Novotel London Wembley, The second receptionist was short with us borderline rude when our card wouldn t work We had not deliberately put a mobile next to it It was very unfortunate that the alarm system evacuated us on Saturday morning with a false alarm While we are not upset with the staff having woken to the tragic Paris news this was terrifying An in house tannoy system could have let us all know that we were safe Maybe have one installed , The warm welcome when we arrived The location was perfect Room was excellent
200286,Novotel London Wembley, Security alarm in room went off at 8am asking us to evacuate the building immediately Not the usual fire alarm and was instead a automated voice saying something along the lines of a serious incident has happened and we need to immediately evacuate At the same time the electricity in the room had stopped working so we were in darkness terrified and unsure of what the hell was going on Eventually we found out that it was due to someone having a shower in the hotel and the steam had set this alarm off I was very nearly standing outside in my underwear So this in summary was not the best experience The staff didn t apologise either Housekeeping arrived about 20mins after they were called to fix our broken electricity , Location amazing Clean hotel and modern
200287,Novotel London Wembley, Nothing any problems were compensated for more than generously , Staff were lovely location was amazing with a great view and we had everything we needed right at the hotel or within a few minutes walk 
200288,Novotel London Wembley, N a, The staff were polite and well presented helpful and the room was clean No shower towels but we made do Not enough milk for coffee but we made do Was not sure how the air conditioning worked but got by

200291,Novotel London Wembley, Bar closed at midnight TV Football Match turned off at midnight would have liked to be able to relax a little longer after a long drive in the car , Location Room
200292,Novotel London Wembley, I became trapped in the underground garage for over 20 mins because the intercom did not work after many attempts I felt scared down in the garage as there was noone around I did not feel safe Eventually someone came through the door and let me back in I did report it to staff who sent a maintenance man down to check , Room was lovely and clean and bed was comfortable The bathroom was nice and clean with a very large shower Staff were very helpful and helped us to find the hotel after we got lost 
200293,Novotel London Wembley, Could do with more milks and a free bottle of water rather than charging 2 75, Handy for Wembley Arena and the stadium Very comfortable bed and pillows Bathroom facilities were great with plenty of towels 
200294,Novotel London Wembley, No parking but the lovely security guard let me park my motorbike right in front of the entrance , Perfect location for Wembley events Clean comfortable and spacious rooms

200297,Novotel London Wembley, Only slight problem was that the air conditioner seemed to turn on seemingly at random including at 4am , Very clean and was fantastic value for money even without the included breakfast We couldn t have gotten much closer to Wembley Arena too
200298,Novotel London Wembley, Breakfast in the hotel is a bit over priced and not really that exceptional for 16 95 Game day rates for the rooms are quite steep but I guess that is to be expected , Comfy beds super clean and excellent location for Wembley events Hotel staff are friendly and efficient There s a nice bar that serves pretty good food 
200299,Novotel London Wembley, Many of the staff did not speak very good English Breakfast was very disappointing not at all appealing we paid for breakfast in our room rate , Proximity to Wembley Stadium and the Tube Cleanliness and new feel 
200300,Novotel London Wembley, Interesting pancake machine at breakfast Not really sure why it is still in use Perhaps another lift would be good , Very comfortable room with a decent sized shower Extremely close to nearest tube station and to wembley arena No noise from other guests 
200301,Novotel London Wembley, No bad experiences Water pressure not high enough Did not like the frosted glass door to the toilet shower it did not feel very private , Nice big room nicely decorated Excellent bed Nespreso coffee machine Lots of TV programmes Close to underground station Close to shopping centre Enjoyed our stay and would stay again 
200302,Novotel London Wembley, although the hotel is in an excellent location Intially I found it difficult to find from the central Wembley tube station as It wasn t sign posted very well on such a large Wembley Park complex Also I didn t purchase breakfast as I thought at 16 45 per person this was expensive for a continental breakfast , Has amazingly comfortable beds And is in a fantastic location for Wembley stadium and arena just a few minutes walk away Very well organised hotel extremely clean and lovely bedrooms and bathrooms 
200303,Novotel London Wembley, Very slow checking in waited for an hour and a half Arrived at hotel at 2 o clock and didn t get our room until 3 30pm even though check in is 2pm , The room was beautiful
