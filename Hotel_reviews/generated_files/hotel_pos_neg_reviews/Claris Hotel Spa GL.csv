402016,Claris Hotel Spa GL, There was no sun umbrellas by poolside quite hot in city sun it would have been nice for each sun lounger to have an umbrella , The bedroom was perfect so clean Loved all the extra touches fold down bed cover every night with a chocolate fresh bottle of water every day fresh rose in bathroom cumfy bath robe and slippers friendly staff the best was been given a phone so you ve wifi everywhere you go in city COOL My stay was splendid and worth the price 
402017,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Only 1 main bar and it s in the roof not good for me who suffers from virtigo, Good position away from the busy parts but stilll walkable Lovely hotel 
402018,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We booked well in advance and yet were assigned a ground floor room ooking out into a dark and unattractive utility area We went back to front desk and attendant was so kind thank goodness they were able to move us to a sixth floor room with lovely view of square There was some foot traffic noise from restaurant above us At night but was worth it to be in nicer room , Loved the rooftop pool and gorgeous guest rooms Wonderful greeting with champagne and strawberries The use of cell phone for hotspot was a huge bonus 
402019,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Rooms were small and the furnishings tired not worth the 275 per night price tag There were drainage problems with the bathroom too The hotel failed to tell us that on the Saturday night they had a private party using the Roof terrace bar and restaurant facilities from 7pm 2am Given this was a feature of the hotel it was poor that we were not noted on arrival of this We were even turned away from using the restaurant at lunch because all the staff were preparing for that evenings private event Staff were un applogetic for any short comings and there was inconsistency in service and treatment amongst our group Would not recommend this hotel and it s not worthy of a 5 star rating It needs to up it s service and attention to detail , Location was good
402020,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Bar closed at 12 30 Never received smartphone as advertised Window faced onto an internal square wall so view was poor Room wasn t ready for check in for 45 mins after advised time of 3 Overpriced in my opinion , Room was nice and staff were friendly Decor was nice 
402021,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Wifi connection is poor and unstable We managed to connect only one device Waiters in restaurants are very slow and majority of them are unfriendly , The location is just perfect very close to the city center clean and quite rooms friendly staff on reception 
402022,Claris Hotel Spa GL, If I had to nit pick I would say they could offer more coffee pods refills for the Nespresso machine and perhaps a couple of English television stations that are not news driven , The front desk staff was exemplary The location was perfect The rooftop bar was really convenient and the staff there were wonderful as well Loved the mobile hotspot every hotel should offer that feature I really just had the best experience 
402023,Claris Hotel Spa GL, No carpet in the room very dark room some broken things like lights obstructed water pipe I was disappoonted because it was a genius deal but for this money i would have got much comfortable rooms in other hotel , The location was excellent very friendly staff and nice scent in the hotel
402024,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Barcelona was very crowded , The room was decorated very carefully There were unusual paintings and a piece of sculpture The golden ceiling had recessed lighting in the perimeter Though the room was small it was elegant The staff was personable and helpful The final price was less than expected At breakfast the yogurt and fresh fruit were wonderful Hot food was waiter serve and well prepared 
402025,Claris Hotel Spa GL, No door in bathroom Would really recommend adding a door Room was a little bit dark Bathroom did not have great light for putting on make up Would recommend having more water in the room and a kettle with tea , Wonderful pillows Excellent sangria and wine Great food Terrace on roof is beautiful 
402026,Claris Hotel Spa GL, They don t offer coffee machine in the room Lobby is small Room service dining is limited to few dishes, It s quite and nice hotel Location is good Staff is very friendly and helpful
402027,Claris Hotel Spa GL, They needed more bars lounges, The attentiveness of the staff without even asking they upgraded me they are always smiling and helpful especially the doorman and reception staff Overall fantastic stay
402028,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Our espresso machine stopped working after the first day but they gave us complementary coffee every morning which was great , The room was gorgeous and the bed and 10 pillows made it hard to get out of every day The rooftop bar has an amazing view and we went up every night for the sunset The staff was extremely friendly and gave us recommendations daily They were spot on for their resteraunt suggestions We didn t use the pool but it looked very inviting 
402029,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I didn t like the mistake the hotel did by taking the money in advance twice and gone over my credit card limit , Liked the phone idea but wasn t working 100 
402030,Claris Hotel Spa GL, absolutely nothing, The location is perfect We stayed here before departing on a cruise This was our first time in Barcelona and we were blown away with the property The staff was super freindly and helpful making the best dining recommendation I cannot say enough about the beautiful room the bed was so perfect The views from the pool area are spectacular 10 stars 
402031,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We went for a meal on the Friday night and had to hail a taxi The doorman concierge that night was not very helpful He got us a taxi but on the other side of the road and it was pouring with rain So I had to sprint across the road to get the taxi whilst my partner got stuck on the other side in the rain for a good couple of minutes The hotel has loads of umbrellas I saw them in the luggage storage room when we were collecting our bags on the last day but no one offered us one to borrow for the evening so we got soaked going to Abac so that wasn t the best start to that evening , The hotel was in a great location for walking around the city The rooms were very nice and modern with good facilities and the hotel smelt amazing I know that sounds weird but they had incense burning which was a really lovely smell 
402032,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, The hotel is outstanding in terms of decor and facilities It s a little further away from all the main sites than we would have liked approx 30 40 min walk to the cathedral lots of shops and cafes close by but not many restaurants for a main meal 
402033,Claris Hotel Spa GL, There s no possibility to have a coffee or a drink on the ground floor and sit along a cosy table with each other , Very good location nearby Pass de Gracia Very nice doormen And the staff at the reception are always very helpful try and think in solutions 
402034,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Restaurant in 7th floor by pool Need more variety and not at good as the breakfast food More mid day snack choices would be good too, Nice variety and excellent service
402035,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Gloomy hotel tacky style We were told it was recently renovated although it didn t really look like it , Great staff Good breakfast Perfect location 
402036,Claris Hotel Spa GL, insense burning in the hallways Allergies flared Hallway noise loud High heel noise from room above very loud , Staff was very accommodating Clean rooms 
402037,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The decor feels a little dated and old fashioned The gym was extremely small and would fit no more than 4 5 people comfortably It feels more 4 star than 5 in my experience , The location is unbeatable the staff very friendly and attentive We asked for a good view and were duly granted a wonderful one so we were super happy 
402038,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, We use to visit barcelona regularly We always had e problem in finding a convenient hotel This the best we find The bad note are To many pillow in a small room Boiling water in the shower Price expensive No breakfast included Livio Marisa
402039,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Did not feel the restaurant associated mr Kao was value for money , Hotel staff very pleasant and helpful Clean and in a good location from my perspective Not too far to walk to centre or to other main tourist attractions 
402040,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I expected to be able to make myself a coffee in my room but there was no kettle Eventually after a request one arrived but with an English plug It came without coffee rather nasty Nescafe packets milk and a teaspoon The milk was not replenished each day so had to keep asking Small thing but very irritating and poor service in a rather pricey hotel Asked for a quiet room but still had to use earplugs on the 4th floor Not a great experience Room was small and dull although the shower was good , The terrace is lovely and food good if you can afford it Location is great 
402041,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Not the Hotel s fault but it s situated in a fairly upmarket area for shopping and restaurants head down the hill for great quality food if you re budget is a little tight , Very helpful reception staff with great local knowledge Perfect location for seeing the sights in a weekend 15 min stroll in one direction for the Gothic Quarter and Port same in the other direction for Gaudi s La Sagrada Familia 
402042,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, The room was a good size for Europe they had a really good coffee maker in the room bathroom was awesome and they even came by with water and chocolate at night The rooms have good art in them as well We enjoyed the rooftop restaurant they had a very good breakfast The staff was very professional and friendly They speak English The location of the hotel is two blocks from the Passeig de Gracia which keeps things quiet 
402043,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Ordered a breakfast for the next morning which never arrived but we weren t terribly hungry so it worked out for the best as we weren t charged for it in the end , We were given one of the better grand suites in the hotel and the room was perfect the bed and bathroom were especially beautiful Greeted with a complimentary glass of cava and a bottle of water and chocolates The staff were courteous and friendly throughout the concierges were especially helpful with directions and taxis Excellent location 
402044,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Hotel was expensive and for the price I would have expected breakfast to be included There was no attention to our needs for the last night of our stay eg no chocolates on bed no floor mat at sides of our bed no complimentary water We felt we were being ignored on our last night , Lots to see in the city Location of hotel was central and well positioned Transport was good and not too expensive
402045,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Mistakenly charged for mini bar Refunded as soon as I pointed it out, Very unique style Front desk staff extremely helpful Gave us a map and directed us to the beautiful sights of Barcelona
402046,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, We loved everything about Claris Hotel The staff were exemplary The Mayan exhibit and access to the Egyptian Museum were very much appreciated The location was close to everything The 7th floor terrace was lovely 
402047,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The pool did get a little dirty towards the end of the day but was cleaned exceptionally well every morning We managed to find a comfortable space every day but a few more loungers could have been fitted in around the pool area , Really friendly and helpful staff and wonderful bedding and towels The restaurant food was delicious 
402048,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Room is not well protected from noises from other rooms and floors External curtain was out of order We complaint but ignored At the time of checkout room rates were charged even it was prepaid Minibar and others were charged but not used at all Poor administration , Staff are kind and friendly 
402049,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, We went there for our honeymoon Staff was sooo welcoming and caring Everyone spoke different languages and were very helpful in guiding us to our desired destinations Rooms are big and quite equipped always clean Breakfast is rich 
402050,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Nearly everything about this hotel was bad The staff were unhelpful and quite rude When calling concierge to ask for help with booking restaurants etc they wouldn t even bother calling back to confirm and hadn t even booked Rooftop restaurant staff were rude and very unaccomidating wouldn t make us the food we asked for Glasses of fresh orange juice from the first day were left in our room all week to grow mould and smell Constantly having to ask for clean towels Over priced Very disapointed and would never stay again or recommend anyone else to stay here , The location was ok
402051,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Generally the hotel was excellent except the noise that could be heard in the morning coming a back of house room above Hotel staff didn t seem interested and the hotel have not responded to any emails regarding the complaint ,No Positive
402052,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Price Toilet and shower doors dont close properly AC too cold but controllable, Location decor and originality all rooms are non smoking
402053,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We booked for 3 persons and extre bed was very short and uncomfortable No coffee machine ironing board and no complimentary bottle water in the room , Very comfortable large size bed Twice a day room cleaning service Excellent air condition Excellent location with a lots of good restaurants around the hotel 
402054,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, Issues with room actually quickly resolved Rooms were clean and comfortable Lots of pillows location was awesome Staff helpful in getting transport to airport 
402055,Claris Hotel Spa GL, There was a strange odor maybe plumbing coming from the toilet , Lovely lobby with free refreshments inc Cava orange juice coffee and water Beautiful atmospheric room junior suite with amazing toiletries and fluffy towels and robes Wonderful rooftop terrace to chill out A real 5 star DESIGN hotel 
402056,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Our only complaint was ordering room service at 3 AM was a little slow , The rooftop terrace was a fantastic way to end every night The breakfast was great way to start and the location is perfect
402057,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Only six loungers yes six on poolside roof terrace Lots of disappointed facesas they came to the roof in the sunshine , Rooftop terrace bar great in the evening Bathrooms very good
402058,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Booked a room for 3 which was way too small and had the most uncomfortable sofa bed ever Dirty walls in the room Complimentary bottle of Cava didn t compensate for my friend s back pain , Great location beautiful rooftop
402059,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I would have liked to have an iron in my room , The staff were very friendly in particular the restaurant manager at breakfast and the reception staff Our room was lovely I would recommend the duplex room The hotel was in a great location and the hotel was very clean Also try Mr Kao s the Cantonese resturant it s very good 
402060,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Breakfast was reduced to 16 euros but only if we had it for three consecutive days That was very wrong By being forced to have it we didn t have it at all We would have had it perhaps once or twice but not by being blackmailed into it , Staff excellent We changed our room because I had asked for twin bedded but problem sorted very efficiently 
402061,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The air conditioning in the room was extremely poor the room they gave me was 203 beware it s really noisey from the house cleaning staff who park their trollies outside the room Not very 5 star experience Additionally the room service is also really poor , Room design and location of hotel
402062,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We had two superior rooms and one junior suite The superior rooms were not fully sound proof We were fine with this given it is a city break in a central location in a beautiful historic building , The staff were outstanding nothing was too much trouble They went to great lengths to accommodate our requests including a late check out Rooftop pool and terrace weed amazing The hotel offers class and a unique high end style 
402063,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The hotel room was very comfort I guess if there in one thing that can be provided is lower pillows The hotel offered me three different types of pillows but all with the same height, Location Decoration Staff
402064,Claris Hotel Spa GL, They should give complimentary bottles of water daily but really this is such a minor suggestion, This hotel is exceptional and deserves to be a five star hotel unlike the other two five star hotels we have stayed at on this trip Hotel Claris is way ahead comfort convenience style cleanliness and service 
402065,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We had a junior suite which I felt focused more on style than convenience A sliding door arrangement for the wardrobe meant you could get to the drawers or to the hangers but not both at once And there were far too many giant pillows on the bed However there was nothing to actually spoil our stay The worst thing I can say is they didn t replenish the milk and coffee in our room , Staff were extremely helpful especially those in reception Rooftop terrace was a good place to finish the day and the waitress who served us the first night was very efficient and attentive The location was very good for visiting La Pedrera and La Sagrada in particular and we walked to other places quite easily as well 
402066,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The bed could be more comfortable , The location is great just a two minute walk from Passeig de Gr cia and five minutes from La Pedrera Casa Balto The staff were always helpful with giving directions and tips about Barcelona The suite we booked was modern in great shape and very stylish I would highly recommend Claris GL Was a memorable stay 
402067,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Loud rooms could hear people above us in the halls and the traffic outside Definitely not soundproof We also had a bad experience the first night we were there the staff did turn down service and didn t close our room door so we came home at the end of the night with our room door wide open , Good location and rooftop pool had a nice view 
402068,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The room did not have a view but We loved every bit of our stay Thank you, Excellent food at hotel Location great for shopping and gaudi architecture Staff were friendly and accommodating Rooms were clean comfortable and decorated tastefully Roof top bar and restaurant was lovely to unwind in 
402069,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I do like to make a cup of tea in the morning and there was just coffee making facilities but that might be me being British , Amazing bed and pillows So very comfortable Very calm atmosphere and decor excellent 
402070,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Complimentary bottle of water left in room on arrival It would have been nice to have a further complimentary bottle left in the room each day of our stay considering the star rating of the hotel Only a coffee machine in room which did not work satisfactorily tepid temperature coffee only no tea making option The fabulous large bath was very slippery and awkward to step into and out of would benefit from grab handles being mounted on bath and or wall , Very helpful friendly staff nothing ever too much trouble Central location within walking distance of most tourist attractions Gothic area Las Ramblas and port area Rooftop area with pool bar and restaurant fascinating Egyptian relics museum within hotel Breakfast was extra but offered an excellent selection of food both hot and cold Breakfast overall good value at the reduced rate which you receive if upon checking in you opt to take it for each day of your stay Superior bedrooms were very spacious and comfortable with minibar safe sofa etc please see comments below 
402071,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The plumbing our bathroom a suite was very poor the bath would not empty without manually pulling out the plug electronic system failed and the water would not drain away in the shower When we called only the previous day we booked dinner for 8pm in the Chinese restaurant we checked this when we checked in and then when we arrived they said they did not open till 8 30pm We complained at reception but the manager was not interested We managed to get a table on the roof terrace where the maitre de was more interested in having his photograph taken with a scantily dressed girl than in looking after us The corridor to the room smelt overpoweringly on Joss sticks Overall an unsatisfactory experience , The breakfast was very good and the staff member serving on at breakfast was very accommodating and helpful
402072,Claris Hotel Spa GL, the price for saturday night was very very expensive for a junior suite with only one window the sitting area had no natural light and was so dark it was too depressing to sit in as a result i never used it i felt 1000 euro for effectively a double room was too steep even for el classico night ,No Positive
402073,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Too noisy in the room above me Hotel is dull No place to sit at the bar indoors Staff promised newspaper but did not deliver High room price and bkfst not included Not enough people at reception when busy, Staff I dealt with are friendly and helpful Location is good 
402074,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, The location was perfect the hotel was very clean and tidy and staff were excellent they could not have done any more for us The complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in the room was a very welcomed surprise after a long day of sightseeing The terrace bar was great for an late evening drink overlooking the city 
402075,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The gym is not good enough A real shame for a 5 hotel , The rooms are epic and a great location I love staying here often do The staff are very friendly and accommodating 
402076,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Nothing important Only suggested improvement would be for the lounge area seating to have been more comfortable that would be achieved if high back seating was available , Hotel was quiet and beds were comfortable There was a long time period in which to have breakfast which was convenient Staff were efficient and friendly 
402077,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, We arrived early morning around 10 30am Greeted right from the taxi door by the lovely doorman who kindly took our bags into the reception We were offered a complimentary glass of Cava each which we enjoyed in lobby before we headed out as our rooms weren t ready yet as explained in the check in check out times Well all I can is WOW We booked a Superior Room and can t put into words how impressed we were honestly So clean so quirky so perfect D Amaaazing large beds and the best part were the pillows Never felt anything comfier and just to add there were 12 haha I could go on and on the food was lovely the drinks were fabulous roof terrace is beautiful room service was great rooms were cleaned daily staff were great and really helpful location is brill All in all I would completely recommend Claris We will be going back 3
402078,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Not enough staff at times leading to long waits Off season I guess I would still stay again , Although a little small the room was lovely The staff were very friendly and helpful 
402079,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The hotel accepts dogs which I think it shouldn t for such a nice hotel it ruins the experience The Wifi was not very good at all , The staff at the hotel couldn t do enough for us they were so helpful and nice We were given an upgrade to a suite which was fabulous The wine and chocolates in the room and all the little extra touches were really appreciated The decor and cleanliness are excellent
402080,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Nothing it was perfect , We loved everything about the Claris from the complimentary upgrade to a fab suite to the welcoming glass of champagne and then the lovely bottle of wine in our room The room was so comfortable and clean the products in the bathroom were amazing Every member of the staff were friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs and nothing was any bother Even when we went across the road for a coffee while waiting for our airport transfer the doorman came over himself to let us know it had arrived and not to worry he would load our cases and call us when it was time to go While it was too early in the year for sunbathing the roof top terrace is really lovely and affords great views of the city We will definitely be back and would recommend the Claris to anyone travelling to Barcelona 
402081,Claris Hotel Spa GL, For 5 stars hotel breakfast below expectations Cleanliness and complementary services are really below the expectations , The location of the hotel Nothing else 
402082,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, The location of this hotel is fantastic a block away from Paseo de Gracia Room was nicely decorated Pillows were great Terrace has great atmosphere Staff were very attentive Service outstanding
402083,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The room didn t have a view and it was very noisy in the early morning we used to wake up to a sound of furniture being dragged on the floor above us The room doesn t contain an Iron so I had to use the laundry service to get my clothes ironed which is not cheap , The room is well furnished and decorated we also found a red flower and chocolate in the room that really put us in the mood for Valentine s The hotel is located in the city center a walking distance to most attractions and sightseeing Staff were very friendly 
402084,Claris Hotel Spa GL, You dont feel you are in a five stars hotel when dealing with staffs all even the manager I had an emergency and he was making fun of me He tried to make it up but it was late Staff and services bad matress dont expect a five stars service Just good in decoration , Arcticture in hotel 
402085,Claris Hotel Spa GL, the gym was very small but still usable for a quick small session, Very welcoming staff and an amazing room was welcomed with a lovely bottle of wine in the room the bathroom and room itself was unbelievable very nice 
402086,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Room 617 junior suite was directly below a dining room off the Terrace restaurant Staff insisted on re setting the table and room between midnight and 2 am Horrible noise all night Great room but terrible location Front desk assured us it was a one night occurrence Not so Happened Thurs Fri and Sat night during our 7m night stay Disappointing for what we paid for the room , Excellent location Lunch on the Terrace was outstanding Anna was a perfect host there Boutique sized in the center of everything 
402087,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The acoustic so so bad heard the fushing of toilet of neighbour and the shower Bad expierince didn t sleep of that noise and the noise of the neigbour whom had several orgasmes Not a nice sound Some orther rooms on the same floor had the same problem , Staff very kind nice hotel good location 
402088,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Poor Internet connectivity, Excellent bedding Very tasty breakfasts Perfect chocolates Welcoming drinks and flowers Picturesque interior Helpful staff 
402089,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Bathroom was awful A huge shallow sink that splashed water everywhere and meant ZERO bench space The hair dryers a disaster Small shower small toilet huge bath that you really dont need No good for women travellers who need to SEE themselves in the mirror and lay out products We requested a proper hairdryer but nothing was available Might sound small but a 5 star hotel needs to offer better , Beds room location welcome 
402090,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The rooms were described as completely soundproof but I guess what the hotel means is that you don t hear any sounds from the city Because unfortunately I had to complain about the noise levels from the rooms next to us Maybe the soundproof description should be specified to reflect that , The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location is excellent 
402091,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Noises you can hear other poeple from room next to you very small gym not even a three star hotel gym Small pool also Breakfast is a four star hotels breakfast not 5 star , Amazing room nice view helpfull staff good room service Fast check in Good location
402092,Claris Hotel Spa GL, When coming in from an evening out it would have been nice to be able to have an evening nightcap cocktail in the Reception lounge area It was possible to get drinks on the roof terrace but late at night this wasn t the warmest or most comfortable way of relaxing at the end of the day , Loved the location and friendliness of all the staff They gave us some great tips on places to eat The welcome glasses of Cava when booking in and the Nespresso machine and bottle of Rioja in the room where nice touches Ideally situated for the best shopping areas Felt very spoilt to be staying in such a lovely room and hotel We ve stayed in a number of Barcelona hotels including more expensive ones We didn t feel uncomfortable venturing out at night which can sometimes be the case in some areas of Barcelona This is by far the best we ve stayed in and we would happily return 
402093,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We didn t like that the room was placed next to the cleaner lift cupboard so got woke up earlier than expected , The room was well presented had a really comfortable bed and a great selection of pillows plus the room would be in complete darkness once the electric blinds down Excellent roof top restaurant with excellent service would definetly recommend this hotel 
402094,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Fitness centre was very limited and the food on the room service could have been better especially night menu No iron in the room too so iron your shirts before , Loved the hotel loved the staff and absolutely loved my room Love the decor and the two floors Great location and value for money 
402095,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, 2nd time we ve been to the Claris great place to stay in a pleasant district The management and staff really try to make the stay a special experience We had a lovely bottle of wine and a hand written welcome letter delivered to our room which was a wonderful surprise The Claris is in central location the staff are very helpful and attentive the bar on the roof is relaxed and intimate Will stay again the next time we are in Barcalona
402096,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Nothing at all , The staff was very friendly and cooperative Initially there was a problem with plumbing in one of the rooms but as soon as we highlighted the problem to the Reception they immediately upgraded to us to a much superior room This is what you expect in good hotels and they didn t disappoint us at all 
402097,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I was asking for a king bed and I got a 2 beds which I don t like, Great location and this hotel is like a museum Room was really nice with free wifi and even a bottle of wine 
402098,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I had an unpleasant incident initially I booked a room with 1 large king bed However they provided us with a twin bed So I had to upgrade the room to get the bed I wanted for extra charge of course The room had just one small trash can in the bathroom Simple yet annoying thing , Excellent location near the passeig de Garcia Near to subway station Freindly staff 
402099,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Room is not quite And someone open the door at midnight , Perfect Location QUITE and ACCESSIBLE for everything Had check in early and upgraded our room deluxe to suite at no extra cost 
402100,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Upon taking a shower an odor of mould were lingering around the bathroom At first I tried to ignore it Second time the smell was even stronger I leaned down and saw lots of mould under the edge of the bath tub Disgusting and not acceptable for a so called 5 hotel I want to clarify that this has nothing to do with the cleaniness as the cleaning team did a terrific job and there s no way to clean and hide mould anyway ,No Positive
402101,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I love everything Nothing to complain , I love the professional service and the hospitality of the team The location is great everything within walking distance During the stay my baby slept in his own personalised baby bed really comfortable My baby was happy and enjoyed his stay The staff is very helpful and kind they were always there to be at service 
402102,Claris Hotel Spa GL, It was a very disappointing experience we were looking forward to a 5 star experience and instead were shocked to find out what it was like Firstly one room we requested was a double bed instead of twin beds even though we booked almost four months ahead and ironically we found out later our friend got a twin room when she requested a double bed We were shocked to discover the pictures do not represent the rooms at allll the rooms are way smaller than they appear all those additional sections in the pics are nonexistent even the junior suite my friend booked turned out to be half the size not to mention the constant noise from the housekeeping all day Secondly we requested smoking rooms and found out on arrival that it s a nonsmoking hotel even though I called to confirm my booking the day before none of my requests were said to be unavailable The staff did little to nothing to accommodate our stay excluding the doorman he was a sweetheart , the location of the hotel 
402103,Claris Hotel Spa GL,No Negative, Superb hotel in excellent position a one minute walk to Passaige De Gracia Staff very friendly and attentive without being pushy or overbearing Rooms are wonderful beds very comfortable pillows perfect All round a first class hotel 
402104,Claris Hotel Spa GL, This hotel was very congested with small lobby Rooms very decorated in such a manner that it reduces illumination and it was difficult to find some thing in room All black paint Portraits placed in the room were not very good , The hotel was located in the centre of city of Barcelona The staff was cooperative Staff communication was good Breakfast was ok You can walk around to see some historical sights 
402105,Claris Hotel Spa GL, I paid over 400 euros for a boxy badly designed room You couldn t see the tv from the sofa The cava they gave complimentary was undrinkable Better to not offer anything than give a 5 euro bottle The pool was thick with chlorine which burned your eyes Altogether not a good hotel , Nothing
402106,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The shower leaks and toilet doors are not private enough Not music Chanel or Hilo musical Some decorative and furniture need some care , The staff my Congratulations they are insuperable they are great service providers and gently the separated areas living room bedroom 2 toilets at the suite 
402107,Claris Hotel Spa GL, The restaurant was expensive, We loved the location It was central to lots of facilities We walked everywhere from the hotel The bathroom was great and was a safe and secure place to stay 
402108,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Thin walls we could hear what was happening in the other rooms and hall, Really friendly staff great location neither too far away from Sagrada Familia nor Ramblas
402109,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Executive rooms not very executive but pleasant enough , Perfect location close to everything rooms were quite with an easy walk to main shops and bus routes Staff were nice and helpful Highly recommend Restaurante 9 Reinas just next to hotel 
402110,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Nothing, Great location in a lovely area of Barcelona The hotel is modern with excellent facilities and very stylish d cor The staff were extremely helpful including providing us with transport to the airport and obtaining concert tickets 
402111,Claris Hotel Spa GL, Difficult to use and get in and out of shower the room had a step down which could be unsafe if unaware at night no coffee machine in room high price of breakfast, Great location interesting visual effects in rooms and public spaces nice finishes to room friendly and knowledgable staff 
402112,Claris Hotel Spa GL, We asked for a 12 o clock check in and had to wait until 2 00 o clock when we arrived in the room it was 2 single beds and we asked for a king size Bed on the booking this was asked 4x to staff on arrival and the 1st night we slept apart the day after my partner went down to reception and they pushed the beds together we should only have to request this once as this was what we had booked in the first place The breakfast Is also overpriced , Hotel was absolutely lovely staff were friendly close to the shops and restaurants
