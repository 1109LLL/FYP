325013,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I honestly can t think of anything that I didn t like , The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel felt safe in terms of security and entrance The room was always clean and I got everything I asked for The location is great and there s everything you need around you 
325014,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The hotel needs to develop services and rooms I asked Sleeper for the bath 4 times and they got my order two days later Any time call on Reception no answer Bed has a bad smell, No think 
325015,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, It was a little bit frustrating having to have suitcases searched on arrival because we were so close to the football ground but I suppose it could be a positive security wise , The room was absolutely lovely and so clean Fantastic location for our short stay in London The staff couldn t do enough for you they were amazing 
325016,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The cost of everything the fact that you have to pay 36 00 to park is a joke, Nothing The whole place felt very cold and unfriendly The receptionist would have been more at home being a border guard Felt dated expensive tacky soulless Usually a reason if a hotel always has rooms just one step up from a Travelodge
325017,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, My review is only a 3 3 ad it was close to the stadium I would rate the room 0 5 out of 5 The bathroom was terrible no where near value for money The shower was in tiny bath with a shower curtain when a shower screan is expected The shower pressure was best described as a dripping tap The bathroom door had a hole in it The basin had stains in it and the toilet paper holder would pop off eveytime it was used Carpet and chairs in the room were stained and disgusting , The bed was fine
325018,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The coffee in the room, Me and my mum were upgraded to two double beds which made my mums London treat even better the location was excellent as I had booked tickets for under the bridge and with my mum needing a walking stick the location was spot on
325019,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Our club upgraded room wasn t particularly big but adequate Could be noisy if lower down in the building , This good hotel is in a great location for Queens or Wimbledon tennis as well as Chelsea football club and Kings road shopping Easy bus route or tube straight into the west end Our club room was comfortable with good air con and all expected facilities for a four star 
325020,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, No plug sockets by the bed so have to move across room to desk to use iphone Hardly any plug sockets in room Staff kindly offered extension lead but not long enough When you wake up you want to look at phone computor in comfort Not have to move to dexk , Staff very helpful warm nice
325021,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, My bedroom door was knocked on twice on the morning of checkout between 9 15 and 9 30 I felt I was being hassled to get out so that the cleaning maintenance team could get on with their day Checkout was at 12 , Great sized room
325022,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Breakfast was confusing buffet in the lounge area and serviced in the restaurant pricey as well We used the cafe across the road , handy for visiting London Liked the fact that it was next to Stamford Bridge football ground 
325023,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Breakfast items were not well stocked up so had to ask for a couple of items and there were no glasses for a little while to have fruit juice in Staff were a bit slow clearing plates bowls etc also had to ask for tea coffee Also I personally don t agree with the automatic 12 5 service charge added to every bill , We apparently got a room upgrade for free Which was a nice touch Really impressed with the security outside and around the hotel All security staff were very polite
325024,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, When booking it is not clear which hotel you will be staying in The Millennium hotel where I stayed felt like the poor relation There are no facilities that I saw it is all in the other hotel Copthorne The mattress was uncomfortable Didn t take breakfast as it was horribly over priced and not in my hotel , Excellent location A decent sized room clean Good wi fi 
325025,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Being on the flightpath is outside everyone s control , Excellent friendly staff all very helpful A short walk from Fulham Broadway where there is a wide selection of places to eat to suit all tastes Being on the District line is always handy for getting out and about 
325026,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Cost of parking I had to park away from the hotel and walk to the hotel having experienced the parking expense , Location Cleanliness Comfort Services including restaurants
325027,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, View from room was a brick wall and air conditioning noisy , Excellent location home of the premiership champions 2017 Very convenient for the celebratory event I was attending with a fellow Chelsea fan 
325028,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, No mushrooms available on any morning , Sausages amazing and bed very comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful and the security both inside and outside of the hotel was excellent Service in the 55 restaurant was very efficient Only two minutes walk from Fulham Broadway tube station 
325029,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The airco broke on our last night but they moved us quickly into another room , Hotel was clean fast to reach from the underground stop and staff was very friendly The standard room was a good size but we got upgraded and the club size one was very spacious Both rooms had a fridge which was very handy considering the outside temperatures and the airco worked really well 
325030,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I didn t like the fact that you had to pay to park if you are staying in the hotel it should be free of all the hotels I ve stayed in I ve never had to pay for parking , Rooms were adaquate for our one night stay and beds were comfortable I would stay here again
325031,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Air conditioning was not working and it was one of the hottest days of the year so far , Very good breakfast which unfortunately was not included in the price and the price was different if the breakfast was pre booked or not
325032,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Everything was fine no breakfast included but places to eat locally, We were attending a wedding at Chelsea town hall so it was just a short taxi ride away 
325033,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Changed rooms because of the noise from the railway at the back Shower attachment was broken hotel was okay but at the price we paid we expected a better quality , Location is excellent a few minutes walk from the underground station
325034,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, reception in the upmarket part of the hotel didn t answer the phone on two attempts also unco operative without some persuasion when I asked for more milks Neither breakfast place could provide milks which would saved everyone time , Checked in midnight Was given a room a notch up on our booking which was both sensible and pleasant
325035,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Bathroom could have been cleaner hairs in bath Also felt a bit rushed out in the morning housekeeping called a few times even though check out was not until midday Constantly getting stopped my ground security coming into hotel and bags searched not a very welcoming feeling, Very comfy bed Great location
325036,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, VIEW FROM ROOM, WE LOVED THE BED IT WAS NICE AND COMFY GREAT PILLOWS GOOD STAFF VERY FRIENDLEY AND HELPFUL FELT VERY SAFE DUE TO SECURITY ON SITE ALL IN ALL NICE CLEAN COMFY HOTEL WITH GREAT STAFF
325037,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, Omg melted into the bed the room was maculate it was our second time it hasn t bothered us that it has been single beds because we were there for the football
325038,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, My friend drinks alot of coffee and the cleaners didn t fill up on this so we had to call down for them to come ut Also there is no conditioner but shampoo and showergel in the bathroom The sink was clogged til day two but we didn t mention this No robes in room , We though it was a really good hotel for the value of money since we booked in advanced and the are is actually nice not far off at all It takes like an hour to walk to Notting Hill and to Hyde park 30 min U can take the bus right on the street outside or go down the rd to underground There are a Wholefood store and others stores in the area The hotel had comfy beds We also asked for 2 glasses of wine as we checked in that was no problem We did not have breakfast included there was an option for a breakfastplate but it seemed to cost more than what we would want for breakfast or there was a breakfastbuff served and that alone cost too much and there was a line so we went to Megans and The Imperial a few minutes away that I can recommend and also to caf es closer to the underground in Fulham that had open for breakfast as well as in Chealsea were we stopped for coffee on our walk to innercity Good showers with pressure Quiet room nr 712 wo totally ok view 
325039,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, tv did not work called reception no one came until I called again an hour later to say shower was not working making one hell of a noise , the location was good for what we wanted breakfast was good but needed to be hotter 
325040,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I feel the millenium hotel could have more to offer rather than having to go over to the copthorne for amenities especially if a wet day Also I found the superior room not to feel superior at all felt more like a standard double as was no perks to us having upgraded to this room slightly disappointed ,No Positive
325041,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I booked this as a gift for my daughter On arrival the hotel insisted on having the booking card Despite the room being in her name My daughter had to pay again as obviously she did not have it Ridiculous , Location 
325042,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, The staff were excellent we stayed there as it was my partners birthday weekend and we went to a chelsea game the room was decorated lovely as id asked prior to arrival
325043,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, My booking did not indicate which of the two hotels my room was allocated More information regarding breakfast options prior to arrival For instance our room was based at the millennium hotel and when I came to add breakfast on check in i was not able to book a full buffet cooked breakfast and a continental breakfast as guests of 55 bar restaurant The only option was 2 x full cooked buffet breakfasts with breakfast invitation vouchers I do not see why a 9 continental breakfast voucher can t be made available 12 was alot for a yogurt small bowl of cereal 1 tiny buffet crossiant and a small glass of juice , The bed was extremely comfortable and the cooked breakfast very tasty 
325044,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Could do with nets at windows as you can see into the rooms opposite Could do with coat hook on door as well Also I don t know why hotels never put toilet brushes in rooms any more , We got a really good deal on 3 night stay The hotel was spotless and rooms were great Really quiet and peaceful as well Comfy beds and good size Friendly reception staff and security guards as well Rooms were cleaned every day as well although they didn t replenish the bisuits 
325045,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Breakfast too expensive at 16 didn t bother perhaps should be mentioned the pending 30 on you card on check in although I half expected this, The location was fine and beautiful looking hotel excellent value deal for west london
325046,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The staff at the fronrdesk was rude The only form of ID they didn t ask me for upon check in was a urine sample Good luck contacting the concierge he she was never there Actually they were there once during my 7 night stay and as soon as I started to ask I was he pointed at the main desk and dismissed me There is no place to hangout in the hotel the lobby has about three small couches in it very small and there is no bar There s a Delta Lounge like you re at the airport and just like being at the airport you re unsure who s allowed access to said club I did inquire with the front desk and again they were rude and dismissive The official restaurant that provides room service is across the street Frankies and the good news is their waitstaff and bartenders are so miserable and rude they make the hotel frontdesk staff seem friendly , Great location if you re aeeing a gig at under the Bridge or anything at the football club Disappointing though because there s nothing actually within the hotel no restaurant no gym no business center Definitely expected more from the description website and price 
325047,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, Check in was quick and efficient booking info well handled hotel location was fabulous Great view from our window over the London skyline Excellent value 
325048,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Small complimentary bottles of water would have been appreciated , Comfy beds Great breakfast with excellent service Friendly reception Good facilities in room with fridge and a safe Seating area in room and kettle with complimentary tea and coffee Will stay again Housekeeping good fresh towels and toiletries topped up each day 
325049,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, first room badly stained carpet amongst other things no way was it superior room complained and was moved not impressed having to walk outside and across to Copthorne part for breakfast thankfully weather was dry doubt if we would go back , breakfast was good 2nd room comfortable clean staff friendly 
325050,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, My problem was when l was going to bed there was a stain on the bed sheets and the bed and had to put a towel over the top of the sheets You have to pay for parking in the facility s even though you are staying there you don t even get a discount you have to pay full price as if you were visiting , I like the way Tian welcomed me and my partner to the hotel He was very polite and funny and made me feel at ease coming in to the unknown It s good value for money 
325051,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Bed too hard noise from aircon even when room control set to off, Excellent location close to Fulham Broadway and only a 20 minute ride to Westminster
325052,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The doors to the room were stiff so late at night you can hear doors closing The shower curtain was black with mold or something at the very bottom You had to hold down the kettle switch to get a cup of tea Stayed in cheaper and better hotels,No Positive
325053,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, We had some Problems with the aircondition it was too warm in the room and aircondition didnt cool the room Frankies Sports Bar next to the Hotel is quite expensive and the food not a good value for money , The staff was nice and the location is close to the tube Station The Hotel is right next to the Chelsea Stadium There are some restaurants Bars and a supermarket in short walking distance The room and the bathroom were clean 
325054,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The hair dryer is one of the old fashioned on the wall hose type contraptions from the 1970 s May be ok for men but utterly hopeless for a woman getting ready to go to a business meeting unimpressed in 2017 Does the hotel cater only to men coming to the football Don t woman accompany them , Bed was comfy
325055,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Breakfast was a bit robotic very polite but staff just going through the motions , safe and secure accommodation the receptionist at check in was FAB very good at her job

325058,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Food room service, Food was awful sent burger back Breakfast not value for money not even fresh ingredients Room not clean Towels like sandpaper
325059,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, i didnt like that the air con did not work and it was too late when we got back to tell staff i didnt like the fact that my Lamp did not work and the fact that my daughters tv did not work and when i adv staff the answer was oh we couid get someone to fix it if you told us well it was too late when we got back and we were leaving early to go out the next day but they did upgrade my room AT A COST, nothing
325060,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The first room was awful dark small and really grim We upgraded as that was the best The furniture was bulky and the room badly laid out The sink became blocked and we had to use a coathanger to un block it I would not want to return to this hotel every again , The lady on reception was very helpful she had bright red hair not sure of her name 
325061,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, surprisingly no hot water in the shower And heating did not work in the room and even more shocking the staff did not seem to care on complaining Never going to stay here again , Location
325062,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, There was nothing I didn t like, The location of the hotel was great for the Chelsea Westminster hospital There was nothing I would change about the hotel room or the service from the staff it all succeeded my expectations 
325063,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, We found food crumbs on the desk and blue greenish dried up soap scum on the bathroom tile so we were moved to another room and the staff didn t even bother to double check the room as we found little hairs on the corner of the bath tub and the bathroom tile When the housekeeper came to clean and when we told her she said to us it had nothing to do with her and that she was a night staff and to tell reception no apology from her That is not what you want to hear as a paying customer very disappointed she made us feel like we were being fussy room was cold at night no hotel booklet or guide in room mushrooms during breakfast time was not washed properly, Manager upgraded our room to club room when we had problems with previous two dirty rooms and apologised 
325064,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I was surprised at the scarcity of savoury food at the continental breakfast cheese and hams , The staff were extremely obliging The location just right because the area has meaning for us 
325065,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I felt the food options very limited Our room service was cold and not very nice , It is very close to night life lovely Thai restaurant Walking distance to tube station 
325066,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Prices my child could not use the swimming pool Key card was faulty every time I got it fixed it was faulty again I had to walk up and down 5 flights of stairs Got stuck in the lift number of times resulting in my child is now afraid to use 1 food was cold and way to pricey, The fact it was beside Chelsea fc
325067,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Having time to spare between meetings I missed the conventional hotel sitting room also there is no doing room meaning either meals in the bedroom or in the adjoining resturaunts, East access to where I needed to go It was fairly new and built and fitted to a reasonable standard
325068,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, To be honest it was okay but floor was very dirty on arrival I was asked for a deposit of 37 euro which they have taken but I have not received into my account yet but the other couple travelling with me never had to pay a deposit , Right next to stadium
325069,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, NA, The staff were excellent polite friendly and assistive The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect if you are there for a live football match 
325070,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, no hot water in room 217 i woke up in the night between both beds they were 2 singles pushed together just a bad experience and disappointed for our first time staying there ,No Positive
325071,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The breakfast was disappointing and poor value for money even at the reduced amount of 12 per head There was very little choice just the minimum of everything Breakfast at the local bakery or cafe would have been better value and a better experience, The staff were very good particularly the concierge The room 1201 was a good size and well equipped
325072,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The room I had was near the Shed End and seemed VERY noisy throughout the night and early morning with banging and deliveries or bins Parking on site is pricey at 36 per day, Reception Staff were super helpful and courteous with a room upgrade thank you 
325073,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Traffic being quite bad in London meant getting to theatre show in an evening was a long trek from the hotel We knew hotel was a distance from the main tourist attractions but if you have a young or old family and want to tour centre of london a more central location may be better That said we could only make trip to London at such short notice because the hotel was so affordable Swings roundabouts , Comfortable clean and great value for a 4star London Hotel
325074,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Room was a bit dated due to dark woodwork Lighting not the best Enamel in the bath chipped and bathroom dated Pillows not the comfiest , Fabulous for Chelsea football fans being attached to the very impressive stadium and surrounding area around the ground Very Friendly staff at all times couldn t fault any of them we were always greeted when entering or leaving the hotel Hotel very welcoming and decor in the reception and corridors very nice and modern Room facilities offered were very good in tea and coffee making facilities hairdryer and full size iron and ironing board which is something we really appreciate and look for when booking a hotel Room was clean and tidy the bedding was very good quality and fresh as were the towels and toiletries in the bathroom as standard 
325075,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The fact that I couldn t get a room size I expected I Wendy back to this hotel having really enjoyed my last stay 3 years ago only to fiend out the room type I can Back to has been refurbished and now collapsed into a family room No drinks at the bar about disappointing I think they tried to reduced the rating for the hotel to 2 starts With the basic facilities and services Breakfast was a whopping 18 not worth it as I don t eat pork expected to find vegetarian option , The staff were exceptionally helpful and always willing to provide information
325076,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The bed was very soft uncomfortable it felt very old For this type of Hotel the breakfast was of very poor quality food , The staff were nice friendly very helpful 
325077,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, Excellent customer service Beautifully clean and well kept This was our first visit we were upgraded to a delux room which was perfect for our needs Very quiet for a city hotel The breakfast was delicious lots of choice We will definitely return to this hotel 
325078,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The wardrobe was directly in front of the beds and it was a difficult manoeuvre to open the doors There was plenty of other wall space where it could have been sited it had not been thought about , The courtesy shown by the security guards who checked your bags etc before you entered the hotel The extra security on the lifts to prevent casual visitors accessing the bedroom floors 
325079,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The bed was a bit uncomfortable and the bottom pillow quite hard The temperature of the room was higher than I like but it was easily adjustable , The room was bigger than I had expected and had a sofa in it for watching TV and just relaxing The hotel is in a very good position and not just because it s part of the Chelsea Football Ground Complex 
325080,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Noise of air con ventilation was very noisy It could not be turned off kept us awake Informed staff but nothing they could do Would not recommend this hotel for this reason , Good location
325081,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The bath room towels seemed older than normal for a hotel at this level , Great atmosphere location and eating options helped by attentive and informative staff
325082,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Not enough afternoon restaurants open to have a healthy meal late lunch except frankies which is overpriced for fast food The carpet in our room was stained and the toilet did not have a long enough flush the water drained very slowly in bathroom basin, Breakfast was lovely plenty of choice Staff were friendly
325083,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Although i never like to pick faults i felt let down given the fantastic check in The first floor had a slight foul smell when leaving lift bedding had lipstick or nail varnish on duvet on the inside Tea stain down the side of my bed on wall bathroom floor wasnt clean and the drain under the toilet flooded in the morning Brought these to attention when we checked out as we checked in quite late and was tired At the time kind of accepted a few minor things as was a great price However i think its a case of once you notice one thing its a downward spiral Housekeeping definately needs a word Aside all this was a great location and reasonable price , Welcome very attentive Very knowledgeable and friendly 
325084,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Staff very rude Waited 10minutes to check in Asked for a knife and fork at reception was told to go to my room and call room service I was charged to have a knife and fork brought to my room When I was more than willing to get it myself A absolute joke of customer service for the price paid Also try not to drink all the water in your room as you aren t allowed any more and will be left drinking from the tap just like me and my pregnant girlfriend was as we was refused to have more water , The location 
325085,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, I was not aware that you must register your car before arriving if on match day It all worked out but security was not happy at first with a parked car with its hazards on out front before the game , Friendly staff Must for anybody going to a Chelsea home game Can t beat it Thank you 
325086,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The only think I didn t like for the price a paid for the room a breakfast could have been included , Our view to the room was really good Very nice people and the location is great 
325087,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, The hotel was excellent The staff were friendly and helpful at both the desks and the bar The facilities were without fault Definitely worth the money and would add to the experience of anyone staying for a Chelsea match 
325088,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Water ran very slowly and not as hot as it should be plus the sinks took AGES to drain At first I thought it was because the bath was not really cleaned efficiently when we arrived as I could see hair in the plug but then the sink also drained slowly, Great location comfortable rooms quiet
325089,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The room temperature was too hot and the air con didn t seem to cool it down Opened the window all night but was noisy in early morning outside Would have preferred a shower screen to a curtain , Very comfortable bed great location near to the station etc Very good and helpful staff 
325090,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Corridor was very noisy late at night with doors banging and people knocking regularly on the next door room it disturbed our sleep No breakfast was available in the executive lounge as it was closed and we had to go across road to the other hotel This is a disappointing experience They charged extra for an expresso coffee and the cooked breakfast is not fresh We have been coming regularly to this hotel on business for a few years but will not use this hotel again Front of house staff when we checked out were not interested , Front of house staff member was very helpful when we checked in as we had to change our room as it had a cracked sink We paid extra to upgrade to an executive room 
325091,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, We had to walk outside in the rain to get to breakfast as it was in the other hotel but this was a minor issue , We were upgraded so this was a pleasant surprise
325092,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The breakfast was not worth 12 The meat tasted off and those eggs looked worse that cat food Our heating wasnt working so we were provided with a fan heater which we obviously couldnt keep on all night as it got too hot So the night was cold Apart from that the room was really nice and spaced out Bed was comfy too But both me and my partner were very disappointed with the food It did not live up to the Millenium hotel standard I m afraid , The bed was comfy Room layout and furniture was really nice Toilet was nice and facilities good too Lovely room with 2 windows So lots of natural light Tv channels were great And kettle in room with tea and coffee very nice 
325093,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, We added breakfast to our booking at the hotel and were advised it was 9pp but on departure were charged 12pp Breakfast was also only warm and not hot , Very spacious rooms extremely polite staff excellent location and great price
325094,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Nothing, Great location on site at Chelsea FC Lovely quiet room and the room was very large The bed was so comfortable Very nice breakfast The staff were friendly helpful 
325095,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The rooms are a bit like no atmosphere about the place hence modern but insipid , Breakfast is more than good excellent We re found of the venue location next to Stamford Bridge and Chelsea area as well as South Kensington
325096,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, 30 00 pound added to my card to cover potential damages it could be included on the small print as I was on a tight budget Other than that it was perfect and my son loved it there There was also a tube strike which messed up our plans to visit the city and meant a lot of walking not planned for , Location excellent for Chelsea match and museum tour the following day Ideally located for tube and bus stops outside too 20 mins to history museum 
325097,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Bed wasn t comfy or pillows bathroom was nice but was looking old as the bath has parts missing off it but for 70 was good, Lovely staff always happy to help good to go to when football is on instead of fighting for train
325098,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, A perfect weekend break away Could not fault this hotel at all Ignore negative reviews Go see for yourself Will definitely be back Thank you again for a lovely stay Mark and Debbie Hazley
325099,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The mini bar was empty and house keeping let themselves into the room at 9am when we were asleep having been told check out was 12 we opted for a lie in With these in mind I suspect our room wasn t meant to be stayed in that night but we were allocated the room for one reason or another , The bed was very very comfy and the room was spacious and modern 
325100,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club,No Negative, The hotel it s amazing the location it s unbelievable inside the Chelsea stadium and only 3 min from the tube Good stores around one of the best areas of London 
325101,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Hairdryer was a joke for a 4star hotel the bathroom facilities were not good at all we went out new years day and no one had made up the room Someone knocked our door at 7pm and asked did we want it made up What did the hotel want us to do take a walk , Location
325102,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The noise from the pub restaurant was very loud and obviously some of the people dining were on our corridor and partied which wasn t great for work the following day, If it hadn t been for the noise I would have slept well as the bed and room were very comfortable
325103,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Surprisingly enough I felt the room was too hot and there didn t seem to be any way of turning the temperature down , Excellent location for our needs The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful The hotel is comfortable and clean 
325104,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Water seemed very hot hard to regulate in the shower Would have preferred mugs to the small cups supplied , Good location have stayed here 3 times before
325105,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Twin beds rather than double Shower not very powerful and too low for anyone over 6ft , The booking com transaction had apparently not been pushed through meaning we had to wait while the friendly receptionist sorted it out He kindly upgraded our room to Superior but I m not quite sure what the difference was as it wasn t very apparent 
325106,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, The beds were not comfortable at all the shower in my room didn t work so you had to have a bath not ideal when you need to get ready quickly Staff on check out were useless I d paid for the room on check in and they tried to charge me again when I was checking out took about 15 mins for them to figure out what it is they were doing , The location of the hotel was great 
325107,Millennium Copthorne Hotels at Chelsea Football Club, Scrambled egg was v poor for an 18 breakfast , Standard fayre lean enough and comfortable enough good location have used before and will use again
