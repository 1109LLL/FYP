62296,Le Tourville Eiffel, One day I came back to the hotel the front door is locked and no one in the reception desk Had to wait outside for about 15mins to get in Luckly it wasn t a rainy day , Superb loaction 10mins walk to metro station 20mins walk to Eiffel tower Nice treat in the lobby with free soft drinks and snacks 
62297,Le Tourville Eiffel, Nothing to complain , Changed our view of the french hospitality in a positive way altogether Its a hidden gem in the city Great location and great staff We will go back again 
62298,Le Tourville Eiffel, I had big expectations being the second time to stay at this hotel I was not impressed by the hospitality this time to be quite honest , Location was awesome Waking distance to the Eiffel Tower the Sein River and the ecole militare train station which can get anywhere you want 
62299,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, Absolutely fantastic hotel all the staff very friendly and welcoming especially the excellent reception staff and the delicious chocolate buns in reception were very well received by myself and my daughter Was also great to find somewhere my slightly fussy eater of a daughter enjoyed breakfast We ll definitely be back 
62300,Le Tourville Eiffel, Can t think of anything , Beautiful small hotel right around the corner from the Eiffel Tower and only about 100m from the metro station Lots of restaurants nearby Wonderful staff very tasty breakfasts drinks and nibbles in the afternoon nothing was a problem 
62301,Le Tourville Eiffel, There was no parking for the hotel there was a parking lot near by that was offered but was almost 40 a night , The staff was welcoming friendly and knowledgeable about the location 
62302,Le Tourville Eiffel, The room that we stayed a little smaller for two of us to move around Breakfast selection too little choices, Location was great Hotel did provides some pastry and drinks at the corner of the lobby whole day I think that was really impressive for the price that we paid Their staffs always very pleasant and helpful regarding day or night shift Really felt comfortable staying at this hotel 
62303,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, Very friendly staff Bottled water in room and free soft drinks available in lobby Good breakfast Excellent location 5 mins from metro In a nice street Felt very French 
62304,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, The room was extremely comfortable staff and facilities were excellent use of a mobile phone so didnt have to use ours roaming and the location is central to everything with a metro stop 2 minutes from the hotel
62305,Le Tourville Eiffel, Window view from our room was not really good it was just a wall of another building which is normal for the center of city though if it s important for you take care of it when booking and also it was pretty wet in the room so I would recommend to work on ventilation air conditioning , Location is great just 3 minutes walking from Eiffel Touer and the taxi station is almost infront of the hotel Very nice room good service and friendly stuff 
62306,Le Tourville Eiffel, Housekeeper took the robes one by one as they were used and didn t replace , Jackson was extremely helpful and cheerful always greeting us with smiles 
62307,Le Tourville Eiffel, Room classic double room on the very small side typical for Paris just about ok for one person, Complimentary coffee and juice at the lobby nice interior design friendly staff
62308,Le Tourville Eiffel, my credit card was used for check out here the credit card info was stolen there after one week someone was using it for online shopping in France when I was not in there anymore It s fraud ,No Positive
62309,Le Tourville Eiffel, Absurdity Nothing, The hospitality was exceptional We really enjoyed the worm welcome we received upon our arrival The Hotel staff specially Mauirizo was very accommodating and the room was very compatible and pleasant 
62310,Le Tourville Eiffel, The wifi was only for one device would have been nice to have two or three but we did not inquire It was not as close to the Eiffel Tower as we thought No view to speak of , The staff was very nice and accommodating The breakfast staff was friendly and helpful 
62311,Le Tourville Eiffel, Breakfast had very limited options Almost everyday I had to ask for fresh bread and eggs as the ones that were served didnt look fresh There was even an instance where I asked the lady to get me fresh bread as the corners of the bread slice were too hard all she did was cut the corners and presented the same bread again Food wise 0 score , Everything was really good Superb staff service room bathroom views 
62312,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, We had a great stay where the rooms are cleaned bit smaller that does matter as we are most of the time outside The location was perfect near to metro station as well as Eiffel Tower 
62313,Le Tourville Eiffel, We have zero complaints , Staff was excellent knowledgeable welcoming and eager to make stay comfortable There were free snacks and drinks everyday Hotel is 10 minute walk from facility and 5 minute walk from train station Arrived by train from Germany to Gare l est easily took the 7 subway to opera and 8 subway to ecole militarie You can see Eiffel Tower right outside of building Area has plenty of great restaurants and grocery store near by We have been to Paris more than once and by far the best accommodations We reserved two adjacent rooms Rooms were clean and comfortable Bathroom was standard with awesome water pressure Internet was great especially since we all had devices that required it 
62314,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, Everything was superb staff were really nice free drinks and snacks in lobby great location to catch all the sights will be coming back here in the future
62315,Le Tourville Eiffel, better selection of meals required on menu eg vegetarian Meals were very good but expensive at 22 euros for room service , Amazing staff who go beyond there normal line of duty Great local shops and restaurants Very close to metro and Eiffel tower 
62316,Le Tourville Eiffel, I needed a late check out i was willing to pay for the extra hours but they wanted to charge me a complete night for 3 more hours so inflexible and unhelpful If you travel with a pet I do not recommend this hotel , When we arrived we were received by a very nice reception lady but the following days the personal was unhelpful 
62317,Le Tourville Eiffel, We booked a room with a view online when we got to the hotel the receptionist told us they upgraded us to an executive room I thought wow great bigger room AND a view Apparently that was just a trick and they gave us a really small room facing a wall The tub drain in our bathroom wouldn t drain after I took a shower I was up to my ankles in dirty water When I called the reception to fix it they told me the technician won t come till tomorrow so my brother had to take towels and SHAMPOO from our room and go shower in another room way down on the ground floor next to the reception That was unacceptable The breakfast is less than mediocre and it was always empty after 9 30 even though they serve breakfast until 10 30 11 on weekends and holidays We didn t get to eat a decent breakfast our whole stay The last day was better because there were 2 french girls serving breakfast but the 2 days before the buffet was empty and we had to ask for eggs and bacon The breakfast room was so small we and other people had to wait for 15 min to get a table to sit at and have breakfast In short less than 3 stars masquerading as 4 stars and way too overpriced , Beds were comfortable and location was excellent 10 min to the Eiffel tower and 1 minute to a metro station 
62318,Le Tourville Eiffel, If you want to be close to nightlife this isn t really the location for you Nearby restaurants are good but not the best in Paris , The bed and room were comfortable and the location was convenient to metro and Eiffel Tower 
62319,Le Tourville Eiffel, Rooms are of standard Paris version but we hardly stayed in the room so it didn t bother us at all , Best place to stay in Paris 5 minutes walking to Eiffel tower Have travelled around the world but have not seen such customer service ever Each and every individual is amazing especially Stephani and Maurizio who treated us like a family They give mobile to guests with internet and calling facility which you can use outside the hotel and i found it really useful They have 24 hours complimentary coffee soft drinks and water in the lobby Conclusion Dont look further and book this place only 
62320,Le Tourville Eiffel, Worst lighting it was horrible I had just 2 bedside lamps The room was also very tiny Nobody picked up my room service dinner left outside the door when I came out in the morning despite of reminding them at night , Great location staff is very friendly Nice washroom and shower Breakfast was good too 
62321,Le Tourville Eiffel, Eating out in this area is way over priced but you can get around that by using the nearby grocery stores fruit stands and bakery to pack your own meals , The location was good with convenient access to the Tower Rue Cler lots of cafes and even a bakery a laundromat and a late night kiosk for snacks and drinks 
62322,Le Tourville Eiffel, Nothing , Everything Really the best most friendly welcome I ve ever had at a hotel Room was lovely Everything and everywhere was spotlessly clean I ll definitely return to Le Tourville next time in Paris 
62323,Le Tourville Eiffel, Everything was perfect Nothing to add , That is one of the best four star hotel I have ever stayed The staf was very frendly and flexible Brekfast was awesome Salmon eggs sousages and all different kinds of sweets mmm yammy Pet friendly Beds were wery comfortable and big We are fammily of five The yongest lady is only one year old So it was very important for us to have a silent room And gues what we have got it I recomend this hotel for everyone who is traveling with kids for couples and Especyally big thank you goes to Maurizio and Stephane THANK YOU 
62324,Le Tourville Eiffel, The douche kit in the bathroom was broken the handle for switching between the bathtub and the douche was missing additionally water was coming out of the douche handle The thermostat was also not working properly and it was difficult to fix a comfortable temperature level The staff said they will transfer us to another room or fix it neither happened The breakfast was poor for example the salmon was turning brownish some of tomatoes were rotten Overall I wouldn t go back there , The location is awesome 
62325,Le Tourville Eiffel, Poor water pressure in shower mattresses were very hard No cork screw Staff did not give a lot of information unless asked, Great location a short stroll to the Eiffel Tower nice snacks in the foyer staff helpful when asked for information Best boulangerie just around the corner
62326,Le Tourville Eiffel, The staff was not very friendly and the checkout process was extremely poor They retain no information and I was later to the airport than I wanted to be with the staffperson not caring that I needed to get to the airport He just wanted to argue with me about 15 Euros when I had already paid 600 USD The internet also was not working 2 out of the 3 days I was there which was extremely inconvenient , The room was nice for the price and the location was the best part 
62327,Le Tourville Eiffel, This was an excellent hotel No complaints except that we didn t stay longer , Excellent location Very helpful and attentive staff Buffet available throughout the day with drinks and snacks 
62328,Le Tourville Eiffel, Nothing , Great service from Agatha Stephanie and Jackson Maurizio is the finest friendliest and most helpful concierge ever seen Great hotel location facilities comfort safety and breakfast Will definitely stay there for our next visit Have been to Paris at least 20 times 
62329,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, Wonderful room Very attentive staff Breakfast was very good with multiple offerings and everything was fresh and good Staff especially Stephanie Natalia helped us with arranging tours and other requests 
62330,Le Tourville Eiffel, I didn t get the laundry and dry cleaning service I was promised as it was closed and this was on a Monday I had a rude staff member who insisted that the wifi in the second room was not working because of my laptop and not because of a hotel issue I went out on the street to demonstrate my laptop was fine and had instant wifi as soon as I did Except for that one staff member all of the staff members were amazingly helpful and friendly I made a complaint about the dry cleaning service which was replied to after I had left the hotel not during my stay I could have made other arrangements as for me this was urgent and I was promised ahead of my stay , I would like to especially praise Agatha for all of her hard work as I had some issues with the rooms When I arrived I decided the room I had booked was too small so I asked to upgrade to the executive room which was much better Unfortunately something kept tripping the electricity The wifi also wasn t working in the room Agatha made further arrangements for my being upgraded to another executive room which was much better Agatha is a star because since I was new to Paris I came with a list of questions and she patiently answered them all for me as well as helping me with the changing of rooms 
62331,Le Tourville Eiffel, The terrace is divided between 2 rooms so it s not very secluded as presented on the photos, Super friendly staff afternoon tea for free and complimentary drinks location of the hotel right next to Ecole Militaire in the 7th district of Paris
62332,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, Perfect Location close to Metro cafes Laundromat around the corner We were up graded our rooms were lovely and spotless they were cleaned every day Breakfast was great Wifi was great never dropped out we had the use of a mobile phone to call back home which we did everyday and used the internet while we were sight seeing and it didn t cost a cent Reception staff were awesome very helpful We loved it would highly recommend youstay here 
62333,Le Tourville Eiffel, Genuinely can t think of anything, Room was excellent and upgraded at check in Staff were extremely helpful and go the extra mile to help you enjoy your stay Transport links from Gard Nord really easy

62338,Le Tourville Eiffel, such a small room smelled cigarette smoke coming into our room even though the windows were closed we requested no smoking room But for the money we paid the value was excellent could not ask for nicer staff , staff went above beyond to be helpful to us with directions recommendations for restaurants would definitely recommend this hotel On a quiet side street with easy walk to public transportation restaurants Eiffel Tower

62340,Le Tourville Eiffel,No Negative, It is a quiet clean and centrally located hotel The staff was beyond accommodating and with three kids that was really helpful I would recommend it to parents with children 
62341,Le Tourville Eiffel, The hair dryer is the old style one stuck to the wall and not very powerful It is most probably not a big issue just keep it in mind and maybe take your own hair dryer with you like I did , Super good location just a few steps from the metro and from Champs de Mars Staff is very welcoming and helping I came 3 hours before the check in and they gave me the room within 20 minutes Almost no noise surprising for Paris clean room very good bed Quite good breakfast 
62342,Le Tourville Eiffel, The bath was a little small for my boyfriend who is 6 3 but that s a pretty common issue for him Room was a little small , The free buffet that was open 24 7 was excellent and a really lovely touch The shower was fantastic Our room was always warm when we arrived in Paris was very cold Having a fridge for our use was brilliant and a really good idea for water and snacks Breakfast was gorgeous there was good variety of items and drinks We were never left waiting for a seat to have breakfast The staff were very nice and very helpful and the Eiffel tower was just around the corner 
62343,Le Tourville Eiffel, Room was a bit small , Very clean and tidy 0 7 miles from Eiffel Tower 200yds from metro station Plenty of eating houses nearby Free refreshments available in lobby 
62344,Le Tourville Eiffel, There just wasn t any power outlets easily availible in the room Also I had to turn off all lights in my room to turn off ceiling lights It was not possible to keep just a bedside light on witout any other light in the room , A complementary snack bar availible all day in the reception The free Internet connection works well but does sometimes slow donwn quite a bit at peak hours in the evening 
62345,Le Tourville Eiffel, , The little coffee and snack bar was great the location is amazing 10 minutes to the Eiffel Tower 2 minutes to the nearest metrro Maurizuo was friendly and extremely helpful

62350,Le Tourville Eiffel, The only negative during the stay was the lack of hot water for showering If you did not get up very early to shower the hot water was gone , The hotel staff are very pleasant and the hotel is in a very good location close to numerous good restaurants and a metro stop 
62351,Le Tourville Eiffel, Only one chair in the room would be better to have two if two people are staying , Very conveniently located clean and comfortable hotel Friendly staff Complimentary drinks in the lobby including freshly squeezed juices 
62352,Le Tourville Eiffel, Nothing all was perfect, 5 minute walk to Eiffel Tower and 30 Minute walk to arch de triumph Amazing location and extra friendly staff Cute hotel with free amenities such as Coke water and various finger foods Had a free upgrade which is also a bonus which meant we got a balcony 
62353,Le Tourville Eiffel, Not a particularly bad experience but room service was sporadic sometimes didn t happen at all We would leave our room at 9am come back at around 4 and my room still wasn t done It was hit or miss Not a deal breaker for me though Not enough lighting especially when 3 lamps in the room aren t functioning , The location was perfect I liked the size of this hotel Enjoyed the snacks in the lobby Nice touch

62358,Le Tourville Eiffel, I arrived to be told that the suite I d booked wasn t available which was very disappointing considering it was a treat for my 40th birthday They did try to accommodate by providing an extra bed but it was a squeeze with 3 in a classic room However when we checked out they tried to charge us for the suite price but with a free breakfast for the inconvenience an extra 200 , Good location in Paris and comfortable beds
