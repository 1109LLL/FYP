495282,Grand Visconti Palace, The hotel rooms don t have clocks I had to rely on my phone for the time, The hotel staff were wonderful very friendly and helpful with my touristy questions 
495283,Grand Visconti Palace, Arrived at the hotel at 14 00 for check in but our suite was not available until 17 30 very bad managed by the reception staff Me and the family had to sit and wait at the hotel for 3 1 2 hours to get our room with only a excuse as compensation Hotel concierge later offered a fruit basket which at least the kids loved , Nice hotel rooms garden and pool Close to the subway which makes it easy to see the city Hotel concierge Bernie Gallotta made our stay excellent 
495284,Grand Visconti Palace, It cost 15 for two of us to use the swimming pool Pool was quite cold and the jacuzzi was like a bath 29 per night to park , The service over all comfort level cleanliness 
495285,Grand Visconti Palace, The hotel is not a cheap one and they charge extra for using the Pool Free Wifi is so slow you can hardly use it They offer a faster option but against additional payment , Coffee services during breakfast Underground parking garage Only 2 min walk from the metro station
495286,Grand Visconti Palace, The swimming pool didn t open until 10 am We were travelling through milan and an early morning swim would have been great for the kids but it did not work out that way , It was fancy the staff was nice good breakfast The concierge helped us by recommending an great restaurant 1 block away we had a great meal 
495287,Grand Visconti Palace, The price of hotel is not so higth but not cheap either We just get disappointed because of we must pay 15 extra per person to use the pool , Nice location room is comfort staff is friendly
495288,Grand Visconti Palace, Jacuzzi in spa wasn t that great , Hotel was really nice and ideally located to Lodi T I B B metro Room was nice and bed was comfortable Rooms were soundproofed too so I had a great nights sleep The pool was lovely to use and quiet and benefitted from a sauna and steam room Staff were helpful 
495289,Grand Visconti Palace, Product quality at breakfast can be improved It was very hard to get the iron machine in the room Seems was the only one available in the whole hotel The bed was juge but was made of two single beds joined Once in the middle it was easy to split them apart , Thr staff was very kind Metro is nearby Rooms are cozy 
495290,Grand Visconti Palace, Breakfast is sub standard for this price class What you would expect in a 70 holiday inn most fruit from tins bacon not enjoyable no fresh juice eggs boiled to death scrambled egg from the bucket Official breakfast time until 10 30 At 10 20 gardeners started mowing the lawn very noisy and completely ignoring the many guests still having breakfast Everyone was a bit shocked not used to this in a hotel of this price class Felt like comedy, Nice building Good coffee
495291,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, The SPA area water in the swimming pool pleasantly warm and even warmer in the whirlpool the SPA experience was super relaxing and reinvigorating Also the restaurant had very good dishes and excellent service 
495292,Grand Visconti Palace, The pool area is not included in the price of the room 15 2 day The pool is verrous The deckchairs are vetuste The jaccuzi does not work properly The hygiene of the cloakroom is completely to review The staff comes with shoes in the pool area This is really disappointing More can send emails requesting an explanation but no continuation Do not expect a quick return This is not a 4 star hotel at all The rooms are pretty good Small bemol when has space that is too small Perfect breakfast , Room and breakfast
495293,Grand Visconti Palace, Nothing to not like, Absolutely fantastic experience of luxury From the first moment we entered the hotel we had such a great personalised experience Staff were attentive and facilities second to none 
495294,Grand Visconti Palace, The staff wasn t very friendly helpful or even welcoming Front reception people avoided eye contact and I stood there for a long time while he was busy staring at a computer screen I dropped laundry at reception early Monday morning 3 guys there doing nothing and one was annoyed because I was supposed to call for pick up , Hotel is a short walk to metro for easy connections Very large rooms and well maintained 
495295,Grand Visconti Palace, Health Leisure Centre Pool should be open in broader schedules so people in business trips can take advantage of it as well 06 00 to 22 00 would be a great pool schedule , Really enjoyed my stay with the Hotel Staff was super nice and friendly and the hotel facilities were great 
495296,Grand Visconti Palace, The rooms looked a little worn out Chipped bathroom door toilet lid was broken The bathroom was not very well thought out Bathtub was very slippery and to make things worse the bottom was round The towel hangers were on the wall opposite to the tub The light wss not enough for shaving We wanted a bed for two persons with one mattress Instead we got two joined one person mattresses For a hotel that was 373 per night I would expect more This seems to plague most hotels in Europe, The staff was very friendly Very clean rooms Nice looking hotel and rooms 
495297,Grand Visconti Palace, wifi is a ridiculous free version is hardly able to send mails proper internet access is 10 24h attention you pay for every device After complaining the receptionst only replied in Italian , Direct connection to subway quiet rooms nice breakfast
495298,Grand Visconti Palace, Check out schedule was a bit early for us , Facilities were incredible staff very helpful The view from the living room balcony was magnificent We loved how it felt like home and not an hotel there was also a dog called Zeus walking around the cutest thing We had a welcome gift sent to our room and in the night you can stay in the palace living room when no one is around Breakfast was really good too Impressed 
495299,Grand Visconti Palace, I wasn t impressed with the immediate surrounding area but the hotels interior certainly made it worth it Still very close to the centre of Milan duomo area , The suite was amazing Nicest we have stayed in We didn t even go out our second night as we wanted to enjoy it Beds were so comfy and breakfast was beautiful Especially the scrambled egg Would love to stay again it was perfect 
495300,Grand Visconti Palace, Hairdryer was difficult to use especially for anyone with rheumatic or arthritic fingers , The room was clean spacious and most comfortable Housekeeping was excellent Linen changed every day Bed turned down every evening The Spa facilities were top class as was the swimming pool 
495301,Grand Visconti Palace, We did not realise there was a charge for using the spa facilities pool sauna and steam room It is a spa hotel so you would think using these would be included in the cost of the room especially as it was not cheap Book treatments in advance of going as they get booked up really quick , The hotel was amazing with staff who were couldn t do enough for us The breakfast was really good and set us up for the day the choice on offer was just wonderful The rooms were very plush and comfortable The metro was nearby so there was good access to the Duommo and the shops 
495302,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, Very good stay The staff in the reception dest is very nice and they had upgrade the room for me In a word it s very worthy to stay and the subway just in 2 mins walk Strong recommened 
495303,Grand Visconti Palace, We booked the hotel based on its lovely pool and spa and it wasnt until after we checked in that they told us we would have to pay 15 euro each extra to use it We didnt bother Booking com should make this apparent BEFORE customers confirm thier booking not in the smallprint of the confirmation email afterwards Also they were going to charge us 30euro for breakfast so we went to a nice clean cafe globe across the street and had a lovely croissant and coffee each for 4 euros in total I would recommend all guests do that , Cleanliness geandeur comfort
495304,Grand Visconti Palace, We appreciated the bargain rate we got for our stay At full price the hotel lacked the real character and style we so much loved elsewhere in Milan Pool and spa were under renovation and disappointing , Breakfast buffet was generous and varied Location great for central Milan and staff on the door helpful Central garden area must be wonderful in Summer 
495305,Grand Visconti Palace, A shuttle service to the city center would be good since the hotel is located a bit away from the heart of the town , We had a very comfortable stay at the hotel The concierge was very helpful and overall the service was good 
495306,Grand Visconti Palace, The bed need to be changed and we were really surprised by the poor quality of the wifi If we want to have a decent wifi we need to pay for it Same with the use of the swimming pool We have to pay for the entrance to the swimming pool and this is not what you expect from a hotel which carries the word palace in the name , Very nice hotel Very clean The breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed it very much 
495307,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, Unfortunately we didn t have enough time to enjoy facilities like wellness indoor pool and restaurant For the rest it is a really good choice for a leisure stay in Milan 
495308,Grand Visconti Palace, Which I didn t like to pay the parking fee because it was very expensive I accept to pay the parking fee but would be nice if the price is normal , The room and breakfast was really good 
495309,Grand Visconti Palace, A lot of signatures required at check in really looks like you re giving them permission to suck all your bank accounts Wifi connexion is also long, Great location great standards Great breakfast
495310,Grand Visconti Palace, Don t recommend the bar menu If you want a light snack go out, Breakfast was excellent Good coffee Location is for metro stops from Duomo Metro is easy to use and the ticket menu has options for English French Italian and others 
495311,Grand Visconti Palace, The only bad thing is the surroundings it s a bad area for such a nice hotel , The room and breakfast were very nice The night receptionist very friendly and professional Beautiful building 
495312,Grand Visconti Palace, Bed was very hard and uncomfortable Spa is not a spa as I would expect especially for the money but rather a pool with a small steam room and sauna oh and a warm not hot hot tub if I had paid the 15 euro per person charge plus another 5 for a swimming cap I would have wasted my money The reception staff were indifferent to any request no matter how simple and the concierge actually gave us false info re the duomo when advised so they could not make the same mistake again the reaction was once again indifference The ladies at breakfast were very pleasant as were the housekeeping staff though turn down service was only Carried out on 1 of 3 nights Though a kettle was provide there were only bog standard coffee sachets x2 and only 1 yes just 1 tea bag provided with a plastic spoon that melted when placed in hot water that for me sums up the hotels real quality standard , Quiet location in a residential area with some very good restaurants within a few minutes walk Easy to reach central Milan either with a ten minute metro journey or a pleasant 30 minute walk Hotel and room was very clean and having a safe was useful as was the kettle in the room along with the dressing gowns though this is only available if you get a deluxe room My wife said the cleanser provided was excellent and clean towels were provided every day 
495313,Grand Visconti Palace, Hotel in fairly quiet residential area not too much local choice of restaurants or bars, Staff were very helpful and friendly Nothing seemed too much trouble Within easy reach of Metro 
495314,Grand Visconti Palace, Some of the staff were a little casual but one or two more than made up for it , The breakfast was excellent as was the location only a 10 mins tube ride to the centre of the town and if that fails the tram plus trolley bus returns you from the centre The car park was good and spacious and well supervised 
495315,Grand Visconti Palace, price very high notwithstanding a room rate of EUR 190 night access to the swimming pool is not included in the rate and has to be paid extra, perfect position clean nice room good breakfast
495316,Grand Visconti Palace, A little out of the way but perfect if you have a car No tea coffee making facilities in the room , Lovely modern hotel with 2 pools and relaxing gardens Free parking and large rooms with balcony Very enjoyable breakfast and friendly staff 
495317,Grand Visconti Palace, The room had a lingering smell of stale tobacco Poor sign posted to facilities Average wifi Shouldn t to pay for broadband these days, Friendly staff
495318,Grand Visconti Palace, Residents in rooms facing the front of the hotel had to put up with some noise when there was a music event across the street , Staff were a delight to deal with and the room we stayed in was kept immaculately clean 
495319,Grand Visconti Palace, The only bother we faced is that it may be a little be away from the city s center but with available public transportation right opposite the hotel we did not let this matter affect us , We were so comfortable during our stay with both the treatment we received from the hotel staff the services of the hotel and the General Amenities it offered we really would recommend it to any one travelling to Milan
495320,Grand Visconti Palace, Did not like added charges for pool jacuzzi jacuzzi water temp was luke warm NOT HOT photos of facility highlights pool area extra charge on arrival NOT GOOD, Facility is clean comfort roomy
495321,Grand Visconti Palace, Nothing , Bernie Gallota the concierge was wonderfully helpful and engaging The breakfast buffet on their outdoor terrace overlooking their beautiful gardens was the perfect way to start our day We liked being close to the city center but not in it and away from the crowds 
495322,Grand Visconti Palace, The restaurant for dinner was disappointing and overpriced, Suite was fantastic Staff friendly and helpful The location was convenient for the center as just a couple of stops on the underground and you are at the Duomo
495323,Grand Visconti Palace, Spa pool needs revamping A little out of the way not many shops bars restaurants in area, Free room upgrade large Lovely building Nice staff Close to the metro
495324,Grand Visconti Palace, Some more information about the hotel to be provided in the room Room service could have been slightly more helpfully served rather than a stack of plates delivered and left with caveat I could no doubt of asked the friendly person Would prefer the phone not to ring on the hour each hour , Nice room s 
495325,Grand Visconti Palace, Carpets were filthy and air conditioner didn t work at all on the 1st night Property was okay but it didn t match the online descriptions and reviews ,No Positive
495326,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, The hotel has a really friendly and helpful staff Facilities are good the only drawback is that the spa area is not available for children after 5h30pm but it is specified on the hotel description 
495327,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, the room excellent very confortable and clean very nice breakfast perfect parking too ideal if you don t want to use the car during your stay in the city metro Lodi very near
495328,Grand Visconti Palace, lack of option to get sun very impersonal bar No English TV, very good size room nice pool but we were not allowed to go outside to get some sun You need to pay to use pool and saunas nice breakfast Car park great Metro 3 min away straight to DUOM 
495329,Grand Visconti Palace, The bar area for food and drink is limited There is very little food available for a light meal and room service stops very early Would expect 24hr availability in a hotel of this standard We were also disappointed that the hotel could not arrange a taxi for us when we became a little stranded on the outskirts of town We contacted a different hotel and they had no problem in doing so on our behalf , Really comfortable room the hotel is well decorated and maintained Staff were all helpful within what they were allowed to provide checking in and out and concierge help was all very good 
495330,Grand Visconti Palace, wifi is not the greatest in the hotel , Amazing place to stay We keep going back Very close to the metro Breakfast is so delicious and well worth it 
495331,Grand Visconti Palace, The hotel suffers of a common disease in Milan hotels panorama it feels business all around The main clientele is clearly business which means you have groups of business people buzzing around from one conference room to another outstanding the number of signals pointing to conference rooms and the like This takes away a lot from the charme And that s the main issue of the Visconti Palance it lacks any charme If you are looking for a romantic stay it delivers so so Position is not the best if your plan is to explore Milan however there is an underground station very close by which is good The room was rather small but still comfortable Wifi is free only in the slow version if you want fast connection you pay on top In 2016 this is quite anachronistic Parking is outrageously expensive but in line with other hotels to be fair , The hotel is overall quite fine The facilities are good it s clean and the staff is prepared and professional For the price it s definitely a fine deal especially compared to other 4 stars hotels in Milan that don t deserve the ranking and are more expensive note I ve paid 220 euros for two nights in a standard room So in general if you are looking for good service at the right price and you are not looking for a romantic gateway Visconti palace is a fine choice 
495332,Grand Visconti Palace, Nothing , The hotel is verz luxurious verz well furnished the rooms are spacious the breakfast is great We absolutely loved it we couldn t believe we are paying so little for this nice hotel 
495333,Grand Visconti Palace, furniture a bit old Pillow wasn t comfortable Nothing else , The staff were good and very helpful The hotel is near by shops restaurants Only half an hour walking to the Duomo

495338,Grand Visconti Palace, On the second evening we stayed there there has been a very long power outage during which the customers were left alone and with no information but more important is that no emergency light was on The emergency exits were not indicated and the backup power did not start confirmed the morning after by the hotel personnel This is a huge security risk If I were the manager I d send at least someone with a torch on each floor to guide and reassure the customers in case of need it was pitch dark with no emergency lights I wonder how security checks are done in this hotel We had to read the security exits map on the room door with our mobile lights to get to the ground floor as we had planned the evening out with friends On the emergency stairs there were any sort of stuff piled up from chairs to black big sacks the ones usually used for the garbage what would have happened in case of a real emergency The morning after when we checked out we complained at the reception but they seemed totally uninterested and told us some clich excuses and that s all Also the wellness area is not like in the pictures the walls in the jacuzzi area are peeling off and have cracks the sauna and the hammam are so small that it would be uncomfortable to be there in more than 2 persons , The rooms are nice and clean the position is near the metro station and the breakfast buffet is good 
495339,Grand Visconti Palace, Spa facilities are poor costly Changing rooms have a bare concrete floor Mens changing room only has 2 showers one was out of order Hot tub is more a home version can only really fit 2 people in Tried to charge me for breakfast when it was included Shower head in room was leaking badly very expensive bar , Huge comfy Bed friendly staff Near to public transport

495342,Grand Visconti Palace, I didn t like the noise factor in the hotel I was constantly being woken up at night and in the morning as the walls were thin and I could the whole corridor activities As I was on a business trip I didn t mind that much but it would have really been annoying staying there for holidays , Staff was amazing and very polite so was the service in the hotel The cuisine was great as well 
495343,Grand Visconti Palace, American coffee at breakfast ie instant You can get an espresso if you ask but have to wait for this Why not make up a large jug of decent filter coffee no free bottle of water in the room Staff won t book taxies ahead of time you just have to ask when you need it and wait , Comfortable and spacious room Decent location nr the m3 metro line so an easy ride to the Duomo and central Milan Breakfast decent selection Inc Italian sausages and good scrambled egg Decent choice of pastries and breads as well 
495344,Grand Visconti Palace, there was a gay next to our room very noisy and we could hear what was he talking over the phone By the way the was american so he was talking in a middle of the night all night , renewed rooms are very good and very well designed 
495345,Grand Visconti Palace, I was staying on 4th Floor and the noise from the restaurant above every afternoon and evening was irritating and prevented me from sleeping one evening until 11 30 pm, Very pleasant and helpful staff breakfast good lovely coffee
495346,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, Great location for commuting to city centre A nice gym on site and a good boxing gym nearby with English speaking trainers Boxeursus Hospitality of staff Spacious rooms Good room service The place smells nice I travel to Milan almost every week on business and almost always stay at Visconti 
495347,Grand Visconti Palace, I ordered room service breakfast bacon and scrambled eggs Two plates arrived one with over 12 rashers or bacon and another with a mound of eggs I love generous portions but this was idiotic and ridiculous for one person and I hate waste but had no choice but to leave most of it Just can t understand the thinking behind it What would I have gotten if I d ordered poached Twelve poached eggs , A lovely looking hotel very comfortable and a great location for my purposes Prada Foundation though I m not sure whether it s convenient for much else 
495348,Grand Visconti Palace, Some of receptionists were sooo uneducated and not brilliant for sure Long story short i lost my credit card somewhere else but didnt cancel it to be able to use it in the hotel and flights etc The receptionist accused me to use stolen card even he has my name and i have my passport with me He still couldnt understand how a card can work after being lost After 10 min argue thank god an experienced woman probably manager came and apologized quiet alot , Location clup sandwich 
495349,Grand Visconti Palace, The steam room was in need of serious repair dark mouldy and smelly with wires hanging from the wall However the pool jacuzzi and sauna were fine Some of the restaurant recommendations given by the front desk were slightly disappointing best do your own research , Friendly and very efficient staff excellent breakfast buffet attractive decor and comfortable rooms semi luxurious feel Good spa facilities on the whole Located only a short metro trip from the centre We enjoyed our stay felt safe and comfortable well taken care of for a good price 
495350,Grand Visconti Palace, Nothing, Staff well trained and very helpful Excellent accommodation Very clean Only 200 metres from metro so very good for sightseeing but not in centre so not hard to locate in traffic

495352,Grand Visconti Palace, The room could be cleaned more thoroughly The wifi connection wasn t that great , the hotel is great we loved it great SPA location is good the surrounding area is very peaceful and relaxing It s great value for money 
495353,Grand Visconti Palace, They had a lovely garden with fountains but I wish they would have had some heaters in the garden area under the tent where they had tables and chairs As it gets cold this time of year it is not possible to enjoy the greenery without proper outdoor heating , The breakfast was amazing They had a large spread from scrambled eggs yoghurts cold cuts cereal croissants a variety of breads and a variety of jams 
495354,Grand Visconti Palace, Opening hours of SPA pool and fitness 10AM 8PM and it is very uncomfortable because we want to use it in early morning or and late evening, Really excellent hotel very modern we are absolutely satisfied 
495355,Grand Visconti Palace, the whole branding just doesn t fit the hotel anymore it is very clear that the hotel has seen its best days a decade ago example in the hotel brochure it will tell you how detail oriented the staff wants to be etc truth of the matter is that they haven t even changed their clocks everywhere yet over a week after the time change Reception staff need to learn to smile and breakfast staff need to pick up its drinks service and be more friendly the hotel decor and furniture is in an urgent need of renovation it seems nothing has been replaced since it was opened a couple of decades ago this was also very noticeable in the lobby and gym walls are very thin so you will definitely hear your people in the room next to you when they take a shower etc, Generally good breakfast buffet Fair location close to a M3 station a few stations away from Duomo Nice bathrooms and good room servicing
495356,Grand Visconti Palace, Use of the indoor swimming pool is not included in the price unless you take a junior suite They charge EUR 15 for the swimming pool EUR 15 EUR for breakfast EUR 15 EUR for parking the hotel room was also cold , Very elegant lobby and hotel room Room was silent and dark which made it easier to sleep 
495357,Grand Visconti Palace, No locker was available to store clothing when I wanted to use the pool and no alternative storage was offered so I could not use the pool as had planned I could not return to my room as the cleaner was cleaning the room so it was rather disappointing , Beautiful room with lovely decor Great breakfast and dining room has nice views out to garden Very conveniently located with easy access to Metro for trips to city centre Was great to have parking on site as it made travel to and from the hotel much easier than it would have been at a city centre hotel Staff at reception and dining room were friendly and helpful 
495358,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, This is a really lovely luxury hotel we had a spacious room en suite bathroom overlooking the garden The hotel is quiet and situated 5 mins walk away from the metro station only 4 stops and you re at the Duomo Best of all were the staff all very helpful and pleasant I had mentioned when I booked that it was my husband s birthday celebration and we found a complementary bottle of champagne waiting for us in our room when we arrived Perfect 
495359,Grand Visconti Palace, Expensive and not necessarily a great location need to depend on taxis to get to key sites , We arrived early before normal check in time and were in an extreme hurry to make it to a tour on time The front desk staff did a fabulous job taking care of everything Also Bernie in Guest Relations is a gem taking a moment to get to know us then making a spot on dinner recommendation within a short walk 
495360,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, Location near Lodi metro station Short ride from there to Duomo heart of historic center Large nicely appointed room overlooking attractive courtyard so it was quiet at night Generous breakfast buffet Within walking distance of some pleasant restaurants Friendly and helpful staff especially the concierge 
495361,Grand Visconti Palace, I had to pay to use the facilities this is crazy I have never heard of this before and you should never have to pay for these it is an absolute disgrace Whatmore it is smelly there are people smoking in the corridors outside the bedrooms , The location is very good and easy to access by tube The beds are comfortable and it is in a quiet are

495364,Grand Visconti Palace, Had several different interpretations of final bill to the tune of hundreds of euros Resolved this issue but front desk seemed very disorganized and accounting practices there leaves a lot to be desired Water from mini bar exorbitantly overpriced should have been provided gratis Spa should have been included for the rate we paid , Ease of the Metra to the city center 4 short stops to the Duomo Room was large and comfortable Staff all very nice

495366,Grand Visconti Palace,No Negative, I was traveling with my two young children from Canada had been to several hotels across Europe and Italy never had anything to complain about until I got to this hotel The staff was rude super cold and loved to argue with guests I witnessed at least 3 times the reception staff would raise voice on guests in the lobby Wifi is not free please watch out They abuse guests with an overpriced Wifi as a surprise item on final bill They would precharge you for the rooms then use wifi as an excuse to charge you a huge amounts before you leave the hotel Got charged 200 euros for wifi usage and they leave you with no option to dispute it I still feel I was ripped off and I intend to call my bank and dispute it so please as a friendly advice don t go to this hotel

495371,Grand Visconti Palace, Bed is a bit uncomfortable and the breakfast can be a tad boring especially after 5 days But these are only minor points , Generally a very good hotel in a good location Very near to the metro so the centre of town is a 10 12 mins journey Staff are very friendly and are always happy to help
