221867,Sofitel London St James, As many hotels in London its price is high compared with other cities particullary breakfast but you can find options at walking distance , The hotel is very well located at few blocks from Picadilly circus Trafalgar square and many other interesting places in a quiet street Staff is really superior everyone at the hotel work to do your stay as nicest as possible Congratulations for staff actittude 
221868,Sofitel London St James,No Negative, The staff was amazing but in particular our Conciege Joe was such a professional in helping to book dining reservations all outstanding experiences 
221869,Sofitel London St James, The usual annoying London hotel behavior of chasing one even for the payment of a tea coffee if one hasn t left a deposit The client is always a potential freeloader even if the whole stay is prepaid A bit pricey but hey this is the hearth of London , Very nice quiet clean rooms Fast Wifi Internet connection Perfect location 
221870,Sofitel London St James, Son slept on a roll a way bed as the additional room we had reserved for him was unavailable We were still charged for that bed Concessions were not offered , Beds were comfy as were the pillows Staff was nice and very helpful with accommodations 
221871,Sofitel London St James,No Negative, The bed was so comfortable and the room was very quiet Perfect for our one night stop over wish we could have stayed longer Location was excellent and close to some key attractions 
221872,Sofitel London St James, After traveling three weeks in Ireland Northern Ireland and Scotland where we were happy with all our accommodations we were disappointed with our Sofitel experience The room we were assigned was not adequate Too small too dark and on the sixth floor when we specifically requested a lower floor After complaining we were offered a fourth floor room that had a strong musty smell In general for almost 500 night 355 pounds night we expected much better We stayed for two nights in a room that was too small and had a view of a cement wall Furthermore the toilet didn t flush properly and the shower in the tub has a movable glass panel meant to keep water from going on the floor but the panel doesn t stay in place making the floor slippery We felt that here we were treated as second class citizens which certainly was the opposite everywhere else we stayed The person we primarily spoke to at reception was much too apologetic but offered no solutions ,No Positive
221873,Sofitel London St James, Cleaners still in our room when we arrived, Superb location Staff were helpful and friendly throughout the hotel they really make you feel at home Rooms very comfortable Fantastic breakfast with excellent coffee Restaurant has a lively relaxed vibe with good food and wine choices Bar staff knowledgable and helpful You can also practice your French for free 
221874,Sofitel London St James, We had breakfast one morning and were not impressed There was loads of choice but the cooked part of the breakfast which we mainly chose let it down the bacon was awful either barely cooked or very well cooked hash brown was over cooked one choice of egg scrambled Toast left in the toaster which was nearly impossible to remove without a knife or burning fingers no butter although plenty of jam Sausages were nice though, The hotel was immaculate and the staff really helpful The location of the hotel was great for the theatre where we went and also transport access and food places The angus steak restaurant was really nice 
221875,Sofitel London St James, Service in restaurant was weak the first night but it was just a fluke Everyone has a bad day sometimes Another time in restaurant was quite good , Great location to many points of interest in London Staff was very helpful and attended to our needs very well The head concierge Mr Joe Rodriguez was asked by one in our group if he could ID the location of a picture of his father during WW2 time A large hotel was in the background but nothing more was known Well he and a college found the hotel and it s location was not London as was thought but instead in Brighton He quoted the name of the hotel and I fired up Google Earth on the cell phone and I couldn t believe it it was the hotel in the background of the picture taken in 1944 I was very impressed Over and above the call of duty 
221876,Sofitel London St James, Breakfast was delicious but overpriced for what you get , Fantastic location amazing service and a very high standard of cleanliness and attention to detail Room was superb Cannot fault the hotel and staff in any way 
221877,Sofitel London St James, Our room was the last on the hall It was to have 2 beds but the second bed was a portable temporary bed Quite small for 3 adults , The staff was so attentive and helpful Tea was lovely and room service was beautiful and good 
221878,Sofitel London St James, Food and drink extremely expensive Out of control expensive Breakfast was average Room was an odd shape and felt so cramped Lamps and things jammed onto every surface No proper space for our suitcases so the room felt extremely cramped , Lovely staff at arrival Good location 
221879,Sofitel London St James, Terrible room My father had birthday so we booked the room in advance But he was given room on the first floor with stinky carpet and small dirty window The room looked like rabbit hole The type of the room was delux So it was more expensive the standard Father strip to Londob was spoiled We used to live in this hotel before best type of the room on the 3rd floor with the few to St James BUT the sanitary and carpets were old and stinky old furniture small room I do not suggest the hotel Stuff is unfriendly and rude , Location
221880,Sofitel London St James, Delay on phoning through to Spa I changed my mind about the massage I appreciate they must have been busy It s a lovely hotel but for top money it s not up there with The Savoy or The Langham , Great location
221881,Sofitel London St James, Not used to London prices for drink but it s the same all round the area I m not complaining , Our holiday wasn t the greatest for us as my wife hurt herself badly and ended up the last couple of days between resting and attending the hospital I cannot praise your staff enough especially Marie and Oliver I asked but didn t really expect our time for vacating our room to be extended as our flight wasn t until late in the evening She done this twice for us and said if we needed longer or anything just to ask Please make a point of letting your top management know this 
221882,Sofitel London St James, really hard to tell, located in walking distance to Picadilly Circus and St James park comfortable lush rooms very quiet fantastic Spa very friendly staff delightful champaign easy on late breakfast various theatres trafalgar square near by british lifestyle and shopping opportunties english craftmansship just one block away
221883,Sofitel London St James, Surprised to find out the mini bar is automatically charged once any item is removed even a little But a kind receptionist has removed the charge once I called and explained , Very close to Trafalgar Square but very quiet and posh area near Backingum Palace Wonderful stuffs with old fashioned and well cared services 
221884,Sofitel London St James, the breakfast was the only thing that was very disappointing we didn t receive our drink very quickly after we had been asked what we would like we had what they classed as a full English but to us it wasn t and it was cold as it was help yourself when drinks finally came there was no milk and even when I asked for milk it didn t arrive, the room was nice and the bed was very comfy and the location was great
221885,Sofitel London St James, There was really nothing not to like , The Sofitel was a perfect location for our trip as it was centrally located to all of the venues we needed to visit including our dinner at St James s Palace The staff were extremely attentive the full breakfast was delicious the afternoon tea in the Rose Lounge was fabulous and the beds were so comfortable My niece and I truly felt like two princesses throughout our stay The Two Canucks Toronto Canada
221886,Sofitel London St James,No Negative, Quiet rooms friendly staff located close by to the underground I enjoyed my stay there I had originally booked at another hotel was not happy there so I moved over to the Sofitel St James which was just lovely 
221887,Sofitel London St James, The tv did not work most of the time Also the phone between rooms didn t work so I had to call my daughter in her room via my mobil which is an international call , The location and hotel interiors
221888,Sofitel London St James, The hotel suited us very well but I can find some downsides The breakfast arrangements with three different prices were annoyingly complicated A pre theatre meal in the bar was very poor and very expensive We had a slightly awkward room with a view overlooking what seemed to be ventilation shafts and air conditioning but it had good double glazing and was very quiet The shower head the TV and the blind required attention rather too many problems within the three days we were there even though they were dealt with promptly As we were staying for several days not overnight visitors I was surprised that I had to ask for the room to be cleaned as late as lunchtime , The staff who were so helpful always available and always smiling The provision of a wheel chair and a lot of help with arrangements for the plans we had made Prompt attention to matters raised with them Very comfortable and quiet both bedroom and public spaces Perfect central location near Trafalgar Square and St James Park with easy access for a wheelchair close to theatres exhibitions and restaurants

221897,Sofitel London St James, one of staffs at the reception she was pretentious Her phoney smile made me uncomfortable , Hospitality Breakfast Location Beautiful Lobby nice restaurant and Bar 
221898,Sofitel London St James, Bathroom was a bit tight for space but well appointed , This is a wonderful oasis in a quiet place at the bottom of Regent Street just moments from Piccadilly Circus Trafalgar Square National Gallery and theatres which could easily be missed Most places you want to go are within 5 10 minutes walk Warm welcome from very friendly staff Beautifully appointed hotel We were in a superior Queen Room which was very good Bed was very comfortable air conditioning good and windows opened allowing fresh air We liked the bar downstairs where we got an excellent post theatre supper We ran out of time to use the decent sized gym which had a good range of equipment 
221899,Sofitel London St James, We didn t like the setup of the rooms The bathrooms are very close to bed and if you are a couple it could be a little inconvenient , Location is great and the staff was very helpful 
221900,Sofitel London St James, Everything was perfect, Fabulous charming and attentive staff gorgeous room though not that large sumptuous bathroom wonderful amazingly comfy bed the best cocktail I ve ever had My daughter mentioned in passing that it as my birthday and they delivered a beautiful cake to our room 
221901,Sofitel London St James, They made me stay in an awful room which could not even be called as a double room The bed was adjacent to a window which does look at the internal halls tin roof and extreme cold was coming from the window I had to push my husband to the side in order not to be effected from the cold with no success As mys ide of the bed was adjacent to the wall I had to get out of bed from the end of the bed I had no reading lights or a table to put my water on the side They made me pay for an awfull room I asked for a discount and nobody even cared about it If this is what they call Sofitel quality I doubt it , The location is perfect

221905,Sofitel London St James, I would have preferred some extra room to hang clothes in the hallway cupboard The lighting inside our room in the hallway was poor No drawers next to the bed , The room was attractive the bed was comfortable and the room was overall clean and tidy The efficiency and follow up by house keeping and reception staff was impressive The complimentary daily water bottles and unexpected gift of sweets and biscuits The restaurant at the Hotel has an excellent menu and the food and staff were professional and friendly The Bar had a great vibe 
221906,Sofitel London St James, I did not like the quality of the croissants and petit pain au chocolat for breakfast For a hotel with french tradition I would have expected a lighter puff pastry , Everything was perfect except see below
221907,Sofitel London St James, Had some problems with accessing minibar fridge and getting TV to work both issues speedily resolved , The breakfast selection was wonderful and civilised times up to 11am 
221908,Sofitel London St James, Pricey we had to pay for breakfast as supplement Booking com Genius here failed to give me a the perfect deal but never mind Everything has a price , The perfect location 2 mins walk to piccadilly circus station Always smiling and helpful staff Exactly what we would have been expecting for what we paid for

221913,Sofitel London St James, Hard to say Perhaps the bigger variety in the Balcon restaurant menu and more healthy light dishes would be welcomed , Very good quality of everything from bed to breakfast Fantastic service genuine interest of the staff members to make you feel comfortable at home and make you wish to return Having stayed in many top class hotels around the world I can say that this quality of service is rare to find nowadays I think Sofitel stands out Good value for money balance 
221914,Sofitel London St James,No Negative, This is a fabulous hotel Perfect location excellent breakfast beautiful accommodations and outstanding service The staff is amazing very professional and helpful I would like to transmit special thanks to Ms Marine for her kindness and efficiency in dealing with our requests 
221915,Sofitel London St James, Basically the only drawback was the view from our room situated on the 1st floor inner courtyard We recommend spending a tad more on a room upgrade go for Luxury King or above In other words you want to get a street view as the location is very nice , Being returning Sofitel guests we chose Sofitel St James for our short weekend trip to London We highly valued the excellent location 2 minutes walk to Picadilly Circus 8 minutes to Buckingham Palace friendly and helpful staff and the overall comfort and feeling welcome Also the Herm s fragrance is always a nice touch 
221916,Sofitel London St James, Everything met expectation and we totally enjoyed our stay The hotel was well located and very comfortable , The ambience and the locality which was so central to sights theatres and transport 
221917,Sofitel London St James, It did not turn out to be a problem but be aware that there is an automatic daily charge for the minibar which they will take off if you tell them you didn t use anything from the minibar They took it off without a problem but just be aware to watch your bill , The location is great The rooms are clean and comfortable if a bit small The onsite restaurant is quite good and there is a comfortable bar with a good snack menu So overall a comfortable place to stay and sightsee We would return and recommend it 
221918,Sofitel London St James,No Negative, The staff was wonderful and accommodating going out of their way to make our stay fantastic Being minutes away walking distance from Piccadilly a definite delight 
221919,Sofitel London St James, This time my experience definitely was not as good as before Although I booked similar room to my early stays I was initially given a very small dark room I asked the reception for another room as I would not be possible to spend he next 7 days in such room and then they made me wait till 3 pm to get the right room The evening service was also poor , personally I used to like this property and stayed here before

221927,Sofitel London St James, Room was adjacent to another building under construction 10 away Noisy and not a very nice view , Location was extraordinary super friendly and helpful staff wonderful amenities a very classy place overall 
221928,Sofitel London St James, The triple room cost 835 for 2 nights and I was given an uncomfortable folding bed with no headboard or bedside table The room was too small for 3 with only 1 chair and no coffee table for drinks The view was a brick wall with workmen looking in They changed the room to a brighter room with a good veiw but the furniture was the same Very dissapointing Reception staff cool and not helpful , The bar was lovely with great food and drinks The lobby and lounges were beautiful The location perfect

221937,Sofitel London St James, Had a very bad experience at the spa it s a 5 star facility and I would expect a top notch massage My therapist was very inexperienced and it felt like she was always working an inch or 2 away from where the pressure was supposed to be She failed to change anything despite me asking 4 times to adjust the pressure and on top of that was sniffly all the time and wouldn t blow her nose when I asked Instead of enjoying it I kept thinking I should stop the treatment and leave without paying because it was just unacceptable It was truly a horrible experience I gave this feedback to the management but have not heard anything back , Strong wifi I could work with no problems Good location right by Piccadilly Circus Fantastic beds main reason why I return to Sofitel The room was very comfortable the bathroom very large Generally helpful and courteous staff 
221938,Sofitel London St James, the bathroom could be more comfortable The TV set is in a odd position toward the bed and a little far from that There is no plug in the bathroom for the hairdryer making difficult to use it , The suits on the counter for the guest The toiletteries from Hermes The iron works wonderfull and the bedding is very good 
221939,Sofitel London St James, That we couldn t use the small spa facilities sauna jacuzzi without paying 10 and booking a slot , We weregreeted by very friendly reception staff and a refresh drink After checking in we came back to the room in the evening to find we had been left some lovely slippers and a sweet treat each it was a lovely gesture

221946,Sofitel London St James, Nothing, I love this hotel not because it s in the perfect location and not because of the most comfortable beds ever and even not because they have kedgiree for breakfast It s because of the staff everyone is helpful and cheerful 
221947,Sofitel London St James, I did not like leaving so soon , Staff was excellent We lost our cell phone at a local pub The concierge staff was able to retrieve it and mail it back to our home in Florida KUDDOS to them for such a high level of service Sadly that would never happen in the states Concierge was excellent in assisting with planning tours Be sure to ask for Daniel or Jeff
