241169,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast price was exorbitant went elsewhere each morning had amazing food and spent less , The room was clean and comfortable easy check in and check out processes 
241170,Mercure London Bridge, Our window wouldn t close and we were on the first floor on the main road Did report it but nothing was done Didn t spoil our stay though, Everything Especially the parking massive bonus Fantastic location Will def be back
241171,Mercure London Bridge, The checkin area is aweful and that no one was English and they knew little about London etc , The breakfast staff and breakfast The location is close to the river 
241172,Mercure London Bridge, Smallness of the room, Cleanliness and facilities were excellent I am picky when it comes to bathrooms in particular and they were immaculate The downstairs lobby area was super comfy to relax after work before we went out Would definitely recommend and stay again
241173,Mercure London Bridge, We were very happy with every aspect of our stay Could not fault the hotel at all, The room was comfortable very modern well equipped with every necessity and a few luxuries The bathroom was excellent the best shower I have ever used Breakfast was delicious the scrambled egg was perfectly cooked and the croissants were flaky Staff were very helpful No view but didn t expect one We stayed in the hotel as a central base for a meal on the South Bank Will definitely come back 
241174,Mercure London Bridge, There was nothing we did not like, Was close to where we needed to be at festival pier staff very pleasant room very nice service presentation and welcome at the hotel 10 10
241175,Mercure London Bridge, Don t think we got value for money as far as the room we were moved to was concerned , We liked the location as it was close to the Tate Modern and the Thames There was a good selection for breakfast The room originally allocated to us was of a higher standard than the one we were moved to as we complained about a door banging every time someone went through the door in the corridor 
241176,Mercure London Bridge, Honestly I don t know the best way to describe this hotel It s neither a truly business hotel nor a family friendly hotel reasons are 1 There was no Television channel for kids No cartoon channel s available for kids I had to entertain kids with YouTube cartoons 2 No international news channels, 1 Location Not too far from tourist areas 2 Staff very friendly and helpful 3 Nespresso in the rooms 4 Internet very reliable and fast 5 Good restaurants very close to hotel
241177,Mercure London Bridge, We were very disappointed with the Marco Pierre white restaurant the food was no better than a local pub We had travelled to London as we had been given a voucher to experience the fine dining Mmmm not fine dining , Breakfast was good 
241178,Mercure London Bridge, Our room was very dark There was no mirror above the seated table Mirror was a long one attached to the wall with nowhere to sit or set down makeup and hair products etc The bathroom mirror had no light and only two dull spotlights so impossible to get ready there I appreciate the eco friendly nature of the hotel but the toilet paper was very very poor quality The hotel stated 24hr room service but at 12 30am we were told this was not available to order a drink and snack for the room Fri and on Saturday night we asked for two diet cokes and again told no but after a few requests this was finally given I wanted to get out of the hotel on Saturday night but was told no by a staff member as they were closing the doors so no drunk people could get in after the awful terror attack Not great policy from the hotel when locals who were stranded needed a place to just sit , The main reception area was well designed with a relaxed feel 
241179,Mercure London Bridge, The lift was very small , Well appointed room that was in tip top order Great staff comfy bed great bathroom Hotel is in a great location close to all the action OK perhaps not located on the river front but at the price paid this was excellent 
241180,Mercure London Bridge, coffee pods not replenished in room , Staff were very helpful and couldn t do more for us My wife is disabled and they made sure they were there with the perfect accessible room The food is outstanding and well priced for what you receive The location is great for bus taxi and only 7 minutes slow walk to the tube 22 minutes from the city centre made for a great place to stay I would recommend this hotel to everyone Don t judge the inside by the fairly bland outside it doesn t do it justice The inside is plush with plenty of comfy seating with a relaxed ambiance and great attentive staff The room was perfect and so large with accessible services throughout The only thing I might pick up on was the coffee pods weren t replenished during our stay but this is such a minor thing I would stay again in a heart beat Thank you to all staff 
241181,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Really comfortable beds excellent shower and a great location for exploring London Boris bikes if they re still called that right outside the front door and only a 5 minute walk to Borough Market and the underground 
241182,Mercure London Bridge, in a business neighborhood a bit far to touristic areas , Perfect breakfast 7 24 smiling personal daily room service cleaning opportunity to print out Not the best but good location 
241183,Mercure London Bridge, All of the cooking clocks to be used when boiling your egg during breakfast were broken Even after alerting the staff I found that the broken ones were once again on the counter the next morning still broken , Very nice hotel conveniently located The rooms were recently refurbished and looked great Nice sized bathroom as well this is definitely not standard in London hotel rooms The lobby was cozy and breakfast was very extensive 
241184,Mercure London Bridge, We had to pay 1p which was returned in order to confirm our credit card which isn t hard but was rather strange We were also asked to give our email after which the spam started to arrive I doubt those things were necessary of articulated in the terms In a room for two guests we only had 1 pair of slippers One soap one shampoo etc No toilet brush that s a first There is only one outlet in the bathroom which is for shaver so we had to use blow dryer in the room Breakfast was good but it was the same kind every day Their coffee is extremely bad If you want a decent cup ask specifically for an espresso or cappuccino otherwise you ll be server with an instant coffee beverage The location isn t bad per se but it s a bit far from a tube station that one might be expecting , The bed was perfect as was coffee in the Privilege Room The staff was helpful as always Borough market is just around the corner The Wi Fi was excellent 
241185,Mercure London Bridge, Room a little small Almost impossible to draw the chair out from under the desk because the bed was so close A problem as I had to get some work done , Comfy bed excellent bathroom 
241186,Mercure London Bridge, went back to room around 2 30pm and room hadn t been cleaned so reported to reception on way out again on return was done but no replacement of coffees after asking reception desk in morning Also had ring up to ask for showercap Reception staff provided me with clean towels and replacement coffee sachets Thought bathroom could have been cleaner and pillows not that comfy for my comfort, Friendly staff and handy for either London Bridge or Southwark tube stations
241187,Mercure London Bridge, Need ramps for luggage instead of stairs at the entrance In room menu could be improved with more options , Rooms were spacious and clean Staff at the reception desk was kind and helpful Sophie was very kind and helped us with our luggage too 
241188,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Location is great pretty close to metro and to amazing view from the bankside Food stores and small restaurants around Breakfast was very tasty good variety and excellent welcoming service from hotel personnel Clean rooms 
241189,Mercure London Bridge, We were a little bit disappointed as even we booked a stay for two night we could stay for one night only We tried to reach an agreement with the hotel up front however there was not room to negotiate We weren t offered any options Some credit to a restaurant or for a next stay in London would be nice and would cause us to return to this hotel as all the other things were very good , Good location very nice rooms great staff and great breakfast 
241190,Mercure London Bridge, Tea tray was filthy with left over remnants and rubbish from previous guests Real shame that this had been overlooked as everything else was perfect, Facilities and comfort
241191,Mercure London Bridge, Room too warm for is, Lovely hotel very friendly staff Room was a little warm and we could not work out the air con Did not have breakfast so not able to comment on that
241192,Mercure London Bridge, More info on additional parking if the hotel parking is full But this wouldn t change my choice of hotel as there was nothing to fault, Great location comfy welcoming and relax vibe Marco restaurant a great added bonus
241193,Mercure London Bridge, I booked the room for 2 people however when checking in the hotel had it down that I had booked the room for 1 person The receptionist advised this was not a problem however when going for breakfast the next day it was down as only 1 person for breakfast too Again this was easily sorted so a big thank you to the staff for this I double checked online to make sure it wasn t my error but I had definitely booked 1 room for 2 people , The staff were very friendly and helpful the size of the room was excellent and the general feel of the hotel was exceptional 
241194,Mercure London Bridge, The bed was a little bit firm , There was a good selection of gluten free items on the breakfast bar which was lovely to see Very close to the Shard which was the purpose of our stay Very relaxed atmosphere and lovely helpful staff who were very willing to get directions to our restaurant 
241195,Mercure London Bridge, Understaffed at breakfast so food options weren t kept topped up Lift far too small Shower not as good as it looked , Stylish reasonably priced drinks for a London hotel easy walking distance to the Eye and National Theatre 
241196,Mercure London Bridge, You pay for what you get and this stay was very good value , We had a clean spacious room with a good en suite The reception staff and breakfast room staff were extremely friendly and supportive The location was ideal for visiting tourist attractions 
241197,Mercure London Bridge, Can t fault it , Excellent staff very helpful and friendly catered to our every need Clean hotel in a very good location 5 10 mins walk to the nearest tube or 15 20 mins walk to the London Eye along the river 
241198,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Absolutely everything about this hotel was perfect staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful room was very spacious clean and comfortable reception lounge area was very cosy and relaxing and the dining area breakfast superb Well deserving of a 10 out of 10 
241199,Mercure London Bridge, The hand towel has a piece glass and when using it I cut my hand Nothing serious but annoying and unexpected , Good rooms fast check in comfortable bed Good cooked breakfast and fast service
241200,Mercure London Bridge, quality of cooked breakfast was dreadful awful sausages and very poor bacon quality of breakfast defo gone downhill since we stayed last, staff brilliantly helpful room quiet and great location we have stayed before and will stay again
241201,Mercure London Bridge, Well over priced Staff were all foreign and found it hard to understand what we were saying Our room was tiny and shelves dusty was nothing like on the photos Glorified premiere inn look Our reservation wasn t correct they tried charging us 100 more than our 258 price and our breakfast wasn t included on their screen Luckily I Had our email as proof so they sorted that out This was a break away from our four children for my hubbys birthday so we were so looking forward to a bit of luxury And we were very disappointed as we previously stayed at a mecure hotel in Exeter which was stunning Wish I d of payed the extra 40 and stayed at the Hilton around the corner , Bed was comfy and location was great Plenty of shops and restaurants around the hotel 
241202,Mercure London Bridge, The front desk made us wait for about 40 minutes to check in Then they offered us a complimentary drink but when at the bar the bartender waiter kept on saying that we could not have any of the drinks I wanted because they were more than 9 pounds Bed cushions had terrible stains on them really bad ones , Location was not bad 
241203,Mercure London Bridge, It took an age to check in because the software was down The staff left us standing there for about 15 minutes without communicating what was happening I suggested that we sit in the bar until the checkin was sorted at which point the staff realised the impact of focussing on the machines rather than us and made us feel welcome , Bed is was comfy 
241204,Mercure London Bridge, The hotel is a bit tired They have stated to redecorate though The room was cleaned and large but the air conditioning did not work and was very warm Staff were really friendly and welcoming , Great location to the office and also a stones throw from borough market 
241205,Mercure London Bridge, The coffee at breakfast could have been stronger but I am probably just being picky , Very comfortable bed and black out blinds meant I had the best nights sleep I have had in a hotel It was also v quiet but I don t know whether that was just down to luck The staff are very friendly and helpful The room was very clean and the shower was fantastic There was a good selection of food at breakfast 
241206,Mercure London Bridge, Staff generally miserable They couldn t serve any cocktails as they do Not have a bar tender When questioned the bar staff were fairly rude and dismissive Told us that this is how it is rather then expected be polite and humble , Location good 
241207,Mercure London Bridge, Could have given a wifi code in the room without having to phone reception for it , Very friendly staff able to park on site and fantastic breakfast 5 min walk to Borough Market
241208,Mercure London Bridge, The shower could use a bit more hot water Otherwise I really would not change a thing The room rates vary significantly from day to day and often are high even for London , The location is superb The one person rooms are small but contain everything you need The beds are comfortable with plenty of pillows The staff is friendly but not overbearing 
241209,Mercure London Bridge, Wi fi disconnects constantly Asked cleaner if we could have only still water in our mini bar but wasn t understood and we continued to have sparkling There was no sugar in our room for tea s for a couple of days until we went to reception to ask for it , Stayed in a privilege room and was a privilege to stay there Bed was lovely pillows were great Mini Bar is a nice touch Location is absolutely perfect for visits to London Bridge The Shard and the O2 Hotel is lovely and clean Has a nice restaurant with good deals unfortunately we never made it therefore can t comment on the food Would recommend this Hotel
241210,Mercure London Bridge, Perhaps milk and water in the fridge Although we only had to ask for some milk and we were given some , Room was very comfortable Bathroom clean and had a good shower Although on main road room was quiet and heard no traffic noise Lounge and bar area very comfortable 
241211,Mercure London Bridge, I was very unhappy with one particular member of staff at breakfast her manner was unwelcoming cool distant and dismissive So surprised by this attitude as the front of house staff are outstanding ,No Positive
241212,Mercure London Bridge, n a, the staff where very friendly After being out for the evening my wife and I returned to the hotel and decided to have a night cap We were pleasantly surprised to find a good buzz in the bar with lots of people about don t let this put you of as they were by no means rowdy 
241213,Mercure London Bridge, Dusty glass shelf where glasses are kept in the room Top of bathroom mirror was also dusty Cleaner opened our room door without knocking before to see if anyone was inside the room which I thought was very rude , Comfy bed and friendly staff
241214,Mercure London Bridge, I paid a lot off money to stay for three nights The room was lovely but the aircon system was always on hot and wouldn t adjust I faced the bank entrance and was rather noisy which caused disturbed nights sleep , Room was stunning and had a minibar hair dryer and plenty of room to store clothes out of the way Staff were lovely too 
241215,Mercure London Bridge, There was no bath the tv would not connect to the internet for Netflix Very little sugar in the room to say it was booked for 2 occupants , Breakfast was brilliant The staff were friendly The room was very clean

241218,Mercure London Bridge, I did not like that the fridge was empty and you only had an option to pre order sets of snacks drinks e g VIP set champagne chocolate etc I checked in late and would love a bottle of water or a snack without having to go down to the bar or having to order a full set of drinks snacks ,No Positive
241219,Mercure London Bridge, Nothing, Very comfortable hotel Good Shower Staff helpful Great Location for Bankside Tate Modern and the Globe Theatre Good bus service to Waterloo Southbank and Covent Garden 
241220,Mercure London Bridge, The basin overflow was full of bacterial growth and the shower cubicle was similarly unclean These problems are only visible when cleaning teeth or having a shower The shower tiling was also showing signs of coming away directly below the shower taps I would suggest you review your monitoring methodology and instigate a periodic deep clean I wonder if you will actually act on this information , Yes the croissants were flaky and the bed was comfortable Your staff were polite and friendly I would suggest a review of management policies 
241221,Mercure London Bridge, The only negative was the first day housekeeping were knocking on our door at about 9 when we were just getting ready but they were understanding and came back later They didn t come to our door that early again so it wasn t bad at all , Location was perfect a 5min walk to borough market is in between two the underground stop can walk to any where central too if you fancy it The staff were brilliant we showed up at 8am to see if we could check in early we couldn t but they were more than happy to hold our bags for us which was all we really wanted Tried the restaurant one night the food was brilliant defiantly a must if you have had a long day sightseeing and need a good meal close by Have stayed in other hotels in the same area this was easily the best value for money 
241222,Mercure London Bridge, The bar did not have any sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio Beers on tap were Peroni Stella and Guinness No bitter or ale Air conditioning not effective window worked though , Very quiet room comfortable bed Walking distance to Southwark underground and the RV1 bus to Covent Garden stops outside
241223,Mercure London Bridge, We could not work out how the air conditioner worked We were surprised that there were no dressing gowns and slippers in the executive room We had a coffee machine but no coffee capsules calling the reception was a challenge as they never answered so my husband had to go down and then wait until they finally brought us the capsules And tea cups were a bit old , Location was great very close to underground and to the river and all cafes restaurants Bed was very big and comfortable although pilows were too hard Space of the room and bathroom was good 
241224,Mercure London Bridge, King size bed had a join down the middle which was uncomfortableft No extract ventilation working in the bathroom although reported to reception on 1st day Towel trail also not woring , Size of room Location Easily accessible from Southwark and Tower Bridge tube statioms 
241225,Mercure London Bridge, The only niggle is we had to ask for a bin as there wasn t one but it s minor in reality , The room was amazing Free soft drink mini bar in the privellige plus room and only 130 a night as I got an early bird deal Bank holiday weekend too The room itself was almost two rooms I stayed there with my mum and would stay again 
241226,Mercure London Bridge, A little expensive but competitive with central London market , Friendly knowledgeable staff Excellent breakfast and good value if booked the day before 
241227,Mercure London Bridge, Pillows were uncomfortable even when we asked for a replacement one Towels weren t changed We booked a small double room just be aware that it is very small , Great South Bank location Quiet area Good black out curtains Nice to have tea and coffee Window opened but traffic noisy Good wifi Lovely staff greeted us each day and there were fresh biscuits in the foyer 
241228,Mercure London Bridge, The room had no view There was no bath and i expected more of a superior deluxe room , The location was really good Just behind the Globe theatre On the same street as the Shard 
241229,Mercure London Bridge, The air con in the room wasn t great but I m not sure if it was us not using it properly We opted to keep the window open instead The bar closed early 12 midnight so our usual night cap had to be taken in our room with an annoying 3 tray charge added on to it , The bedroom was newly decorated and really nice we had paid for a privilege room The breakfast was delicious with lots of choice and was served until 11am at the weekend which suited us really well Staff were good and dealt with our queries promptly in a friendly manner 
241230,Mercure London Bridge, Second morning of our stay breakfast had obviously been busy had to go to staff and ask for tea and coffee and not a lot of food left Also had to ask for milk for room more than once which was never replaced after first day , Good selection of food at breakfast 
241231,Mercure London Bridge, Toilet paper could have been plusher and hair conditioner could have been supplied Minor faults , Bed was comfy The whole ambiance of the room was pleasant 
241232,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, The staff at breakfast were genuinely welcoming and very efficient and good food makes all the difference making a Ok stay to a great stay We will use the Hotel again for our next visit 
241233,Mercure London Bridge, Ability to turn off the air conditioning or instructions on how to do so Towels were well used should be replaced, Great Location easy check in and out

241235,Mercure London Bridge, Extremely poor disabled facilities poor access for wheelchairs end result was unable to have a shower we were offered a drinks voucher to apologise guess what the voucher didn t cover our drinks so we had to pay we only had a gin and tonic 200 a night per room really sad such a hotel chain has such poor facilities staff did make up for it as they did try so it wasn t their fault not sure id like to try mercure again as we telephoned 3 times to check the disabled facilities yet no one told us it was a high sided bath and wheelchair access was via back entrance for goods deliveries with very uneven surface and no door holds not sure how lone wheelchair bound people manage this thank goodness we had two able bodied friends travelling with us , helpful staff refurbished rooms lovely
241236,Mercure London Bridge, There was insufficient space to either side of the bed As with other hotels there was little effective drawer space for clothes , Room had been recently re furbished and was very acceptable and was very clean with a number of useful facilities Breakfast was fine 
241237,Mercure London Bridge, Water flow from shower was on the low side , Room was well laid out for the travelling Businessman and you could work at the table provided the sockets were above the table top so no grovelling around on the floor to find one 
241238,Mercure London Bridge, Would be nice to have a small fridge in the room I needed to prolong my stay but there were no standard rooms available It would have been nice if the hotel had proposed a reduction on the family room they had available As they did not I had to go to another hotel for the rest of my stay , Very welcoming modern relaxed living room atmosphere to lobby Friendly staff Lovely rooms Very convenient location 
241239,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast was not worth the price Eggs are over cooked and grainy all eggs , The shower was amazing Bed was comfy Room was clean and well appointed for what you need

241241,Mercure London Bridge, Lack of shelving in the large wardrobe or chest of drawers No safe in the room , The location was ideal for our planned trip to the Globe and South Bank and Borough market The Mercure hotel had all the facilities we are used to from this brand and the superior privilege room was bigger than other London hotels we have used in the past The bed and shower were excellent The service was very good throughout the hotel and all our requests were dealt with very efficiently The buffet breakfast was good though the retro toasters took ages to heat 
241242,Mercure London Bridge, No clothes hangers no wash cloths cheap thin toilet paper had to get coffee machine replaced on first day , For the money we were paying I would have expected clothes hangers and a coffee machine that worked
241243,Mercure London Bridge, Attitude of a couple of staff but the rest were excellent , Most staff excellent and great cocktails Great location near Hixters Borough Market London Bridge
241244,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Location is excellent Close to the Thames and plenty of bars cafes and restaurants on the door step Great extra touches such as cookies and flavoured water in reception Reception lounge area was a lovely place to sit and relax Room on the small side but fine for the one night It was very clean newly refurbished
241245,Mercure London Bridge, poor breakfast poor nreakfast service had a hair on scrambled egg no sauce when i asked for it no tea pffered or received reception staff excellent however,No Positive
241246,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast plentiful but not great quality Coffee machine in room a nice touch but mugs that don t fit under the nozzle and a lack of a nearby plug socket is a bit daft , Clean well laid out modern room Bus stop just outside Nice bar area Five minutes to South Bank Borough market Booked breakfast on check in and got a discount Supermarkets and cafes two minute s walk 
241247,Mercure London Bridge, We initially paid on credit card and presumed the payment had gone through as confirmation was received via booking com Only for us to arrive and be told the balance was outstanding not ideal No email or correspondence to say there had been a problem when processing payment which I found frustrating as pulling out a substantial amount of money on the day of arrival had not been accounted for in our budget which as you can imagine caused problems Notice from booking com or from the hotel themselves advising of problem would of been a lesser nasty surprise Only other thing to note is the breakfast was very very pricey at 16 95 per person per night which I thought was ridiculous otherwise can t fault , Beautiful hotel with idea location for all London attractions Tube easily accessible 5 minute walk from hotel Staff friendly and helpful Room immaculate and finished to a very high standard we had a prestige suite Room cleaned and towels changed daily as well as complimentary tea and coffee being replenished for the duration of our stay Bed very comfortable and huge Would most definitely stay again and recommend to anyone wether it be for business of pleasure

241252,Mercure London Bridge, The service in the Hotel restaurant fell away when the restaurant filled with customers The food was great and the early attention was excellent but when the restaurant filled we were forgotton , Check in and Check out were completed within minutes with the staff very friendly and professional The bed was large and comfortable The shower had great pressure good towels and plenty of hot water The bathroom was large The room was quiet tidy and clean and on the 7th flr we had a good view that included Big Ben and a partial of the London Eye There was also complimentary free use of a computer Very close to Southwalk Underground 5 10 minute walk London Bridge Underground 10 15 minute walk restaurants retail shopping supermarkets and major tourism precincts

241257,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, The rooms were spacious bed was very comfortable and the bathroom very modern and clean the air conditioning was excellent and having a fridge in the room was a bonus Staff were very helpful whenever we had any queries Location was perfect very near the river 
241258,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast Requested poached eggs were overcooked on 1st morning 2nd morning asked for soft poached eggs as previous over cooked They were overcooked again and I saw them come out and get left on side so collected them myself Staff were not very helpful, Room facilities very good and comfortable reception and bar staff extremely helpful
241259,Mercure London Bridge, Only had enough teabags to make two cups of tea in the 24 hours and limited on the milk portions , They recognized my hubby s birthday The bed was very comfortable and great a shower The breakfast was amazing quality and so was the evening meal 
241260,Mercure London Bridge, It was very hot in the room and we could not figure out how to turn the air conditioning on We turned the thermostat down but it didn t work Had to open a window , It was very nicely renovated Loved the modern decor fixtures and style The non traditional check in area was cool and easy no standing in line Breakfast was delicious and the bar area was lovely too 
241261,Mercure London Bridge, No hot water in the morning for a shower apparently boiler had broken Not happy Also alarm call on phone in room still set on old time hotel had not put clocks forward so although I set it for 7am it woke me at 6am I was really not amused and then no hot water Not a good stay ,No Positive
241262,Mercure London Bridge, The reception area was a tad confusing when we arrived and also we did not have any sweetner or t bags given after day1 even though we were there for 3 days , we like that the rooms were quiet and that people were not slaming doors or making noise we like the location and the bar near the reception
241263,Mercure London Bridge, Only one thing for us that we didn t get on with and that was the beds too hard for us , Staff very helpful and friendly Checking in and out very easy and unique
241264,Mercure London Bridge, Unable to book a taxi through hotel reception, Comfortable good sized room with good breakfast Excellent location for accessing Tate Modern Globe Shard Borough Market and other Bankside amenities
241265,Mercure London Bridge, The travel cot was really hard and I would assume uncomfortable An extra travel cot mattress would solve this problem , Perfect location great restaurant lot of space in the privilege room for kids 
241266,Mercure London Bridge, Everything was good, This was the second time my sister and I stayed at the Mecure London Bridge and we will be back again next year This should say everything about our experience and we both highly reccommend it Choose one of the top floor rooms 
241267,Mercure London Bridge, Room was very small the towels could look cleaner only two power sockets behind the tv very far from the bed Lots of noise from the roadworks on the street even on the 7th floor Bathroom tiles could be cleaner Wifi very unstable I had to disconnect and reconnect every 15 minutes , Nice breakfast big TV
241268,Mercure London Bridge, The coffee machine didn t work the toilet blocked and almost flooded the bathroom extractor fan in bathroom wasn t working , Room nice size and the bed good location
241269,Mercure London Bridge, The first room we got was extremely tiny and looked very run down In the second room we couldn t figure out how to turn off the heating air con and as a result the room was too warm through the night The radiator in the bathroom was also on high which made the whole room warm and sticky The room itself was still very small and nothing about it looked like any of the photos from the website , The reception area was lovely and spacious The staff were very helpful and friendly The second room we got was nicely decorated 
241270,Mercure London Bridge, The room was far too hot and we were told the air conditioning was controlled centrally so I don t see the point of having a room controller , Helpful staff location bar room and help with parking Quiet too
241271,Mercure London Bridge, the restaurant was painfully slow and did not listen to what we were ordering food was mediocre and after dinner I ordered some drinks at the bar which sat there after they told me to sit down they would bring them over I got up myself and got them still awaiting my invoice as I do not know what I paid for and they have taken over 600 00 for one night with food , Very nice
241272,Mercure London Bridge, toilet set too close to wall and toilet roll very uncomfortable There was plenty of room in bathroom so there was no need for this piece of bad design Not many power points in room Shaver point would have been way too high if I had needed to charge it , Staff bar general ambiance
241273,Mercure London Bridge, No drawers in the room smallish room very poor quality loo paper considering class of hotel , Comfy bed friendly staff good deal in restaurant Good check out time 
241274,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, We have stayed at this hotel many times the location is great The staff are generally good The facilities are now looking tired and part of the hotel was under repair renovation Our in laws another couple on my booking had no hot water and an odd bathroom door layout the hot water was fixed later in the day Bit more focus on overall presentation required going forward 
241275,Mercure London Bridge, Heating didnt work as we couldnt lowever the temprature when we opened the window it was cery noisey from the traffic below even with being on the 6th floor, The was comfortable and the room was clean Tea making facility with biscuits Iron and plenty of plugs and large mirror The shower head was lovely and the water was always warm 
241276,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Rooms were modern high standard and clean It was an Anniversary weekend and the room was great and a slice of cake with Happy Anniversary written on the plate which my wife loved recommend staying there 
241277,Mercure London Bridge, Worst pillows ever They are like foam gym mats I wouldn t return just based on this There is no air circulation as well Pizza at night tasted like air no flavour to the sauce or dough Breakfast was nice though , New bar tender Juri I think that s his name is so friendly fun and happy Meri is also lovely And I forgot toothpaste so thanks for the nice Colgate 
241278,Mercure London Bridge, Couldn t fault Just sorry we couldn t stay longer , We stayed at the hotel for two nights and I cannot fault it from the moment we arrived to the minute we left We was able to have an early check in at 11am and they kept our luggage for us on checking out until 4pm so we didn t have to carry it around with us The rooms where excellent nespresso machine and tea facilities the shower was a dream very powerful We also paid for the breakfast which I would defiantly recommend The location was excellent a few minutes walk from the tube and just around the corner from the heart of borough market the pubs where great especially on the night on the way back from the tube 
241279,Mercure London Bridge, Still waiting for the deposit we paid for extra expenses, Lovely room welcoming staff and lovely reception area ran out of milk it arrived as I put the phone down 
241280,Mercure London Bridge, The fact we were only made aware of renovations taking place after we checked in There quote banging and movement in our room as a result , Nice reception and bar area and friendly staff members
241281,Mercure London Bridge, Gutted that I upgraded our room for my Fianc s 30th and the room was outdated After reading reviews after our stay I wish I had asked for a newer room It s a shame the hotel didn t do this automatically as they knew it was for a special occasion , Staff very friendly and welcoming Wonderful Birthday cake surprise for my Fianc s 30th Great location Beautiful breakfast 
241282,Mercure London Bridge, We did have some difficulty with the air con try as we might to adjust it to warmer air and it would have been handy to have conditioner as well as shampoo in the bathroom However these are VERY minor points , The location was quiet although very good for rail connections London Bridge and Blackfriars and for bus journeys into the city Service in the hotel was excellent and despite the fact that building works were in progress the hotel was spotlessly clean Our room was spacious and very comfortable with bath robes slippers and unusually free cold drinks When we asked for extra tea bags and milk they arrived within minutes We would not hesitate in staying there again 
241283,Mercure London Bridge, I could not get the wifi to work, I love the location facilities at the Mercure fast becoming my first choice for staying in london Have stayed before standards consistently high staff create a relaxed friendly helpful atmosphere I love Iit will return
241284,Mercure London Bridge, Small lifts can get crowded at breakfast buffet at peak times , Picked hotel for location close to Menier Theatre South Bank Despite location on main road excellent double glazing meant very quiet night s sleep Lovely personal touch of birthday cake left in room We d upgraded to a Privilege Room which was spacious had a huge bed 
241285,Mercure London Bridge, Good breakfast plenty of choice but croissants were not fresh every day , helpful staff excellent comfortable room good facilities minor problems quickly dealt with 
241286,Mercure London Bridge, There wasn t any tea in the room or any milk for the morning , The bed was comfortable and the shower was one of the best I ve used in a long time The staff were super friendly and gave us a better room 
241287,Mercure London Bridge, The room was in need of decorating and the bathroom needs updating but I believe the hotel is in the middle of renovations , The service from the staff was excellent
241288,Mercure London Bridge, The hotel was undergoing some renovations and as such there were some occasional noises as a result of this Also I had booked the superior privilege room with king bed however the king bed turned out to be two single beds put together , The staff were really helpful for example they let us check in at noon rather than 2pm which was useful in dropping our luggage off before sightseeing 
241289,Mercure London Bridge, Prior to coming I was a little apprehensive due to some negative reviews It is true the rooms do need a little refurb but for us it wasn t a big deal as we literally just needed somewhere to sleep There was also a little note in the room stating that refurb is taking place The room was OK Nothing special but fairly clean The shower was either very hot or very cold a bit difficult to get a hold of Wasn t much to choose from mini bar Also upon arrival were given the wrong room but that got sorted out fairly quickly , The hotel was very modern and the staff at the reception were very friendly The location was perfect as we were eating at the shard that night The room wasn t massive but was perfect for us Even thought we didn t use it I liked the fact there was a coffee machine available All in all good shout for what we paid especially the location Also didn t need to pay for parking as we found some free spaces round the corner 
241290,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Staff was amazing and so helpful Misunderstanding with the room that we booked but staff immediately resolved the issue and got us a different room I didn t get the name of the woman that helped us but she was fantastic 
241291,Mercure London Bridge, Reception wasn t easily recognisable to find as it only consisted of a pc and a member of staff couldn t see a sign so ended up in the bar and had to ask Hot water wasn t very hot for a bath , Room comfy and was situated where we needed to be in London 
241292,Mercure London Bridge, The beds were comfy but for what i am paying i really dont want 2 beds put together that dont quiet match in height The room was a bit dated for the price you pay There were stains on the carpets and just generally a bit tired There was building work going on so all felt like you were just put in any old room because the privilege room certainly didn t look like it was advertised Breakfast was aweful i am sorry to say , The staff were so lovely and really helpfull The deserts were so good and the location was so cenral It was nice and quiet 
241293,Mercure London Bridge, The hotel is undergoing refurbishing but not finished yet Though when booking all the pictures of the rooms where the new version However nothing was mentioned about refurbishing I consider it cheating Our room was so cold that we were heating it with that old style hair blower on the bathroom wall We were forced to go to the lobby to warm up there We left several messages at the Front Desk but nothing changed The bathroom felt very warn off and it was impossible to take a shower as the water wouldn t go away , Location is perfect Amazing breakfast As one of us was vegan it was impressive with loads of fresh fruit and fruit salad Veggies Lovely staff so helpful and always smiling Not that it always gave a desired result though 
241294,Mercure London Bridge, Narrow corridors bed was 2 twins pushed together so very uncomfortable in the middle reception area was just member of staff at a table with a laptop which was a bit strange about 10 mins walk from nearest tube station , Spacious rooms good room facilities clean rooms friendly and helpful staff 
241295,Mercure London Bridge, Builders swearing everybody knows Russian polish swear words nowadays breakfast staff seemed to be quite clueless and very slow kept disappearing so people kept coming and there was nobody to great them , Good location nice and clean room Lovely lounge Lovely breakfast good selection on the buffet
241296,Mercure London Bridge, I expected a lot better for the price The bed was uncomfortable the mini fridge did not work there were hardly any essentials such as no hair conditioner etc the hairdryer pipe attached to the wall was archaic and ineffective Also the staff bordered on rude partially ignoring us and talking infront of us in another language while we waited without an apology Other personal issues due to cheap facilities which I won t include I ve stayed in London every December for 14 years and this was the most I have paid for a hotel and it was the least satisfactory Very unhappy with our stay unfortunately ,No Positive
241297,Mercure London Bridge, A bit tired a c not functioning window locks broken bathroom needs refurb Only a good location if you want to get to City area very expensive by taxi to West End with current traffic, Lovely big comfortable room Reception area informal and a useful meeting place Lots of nice extras Price very competitive 
241298,Mercure London Bridge, Small rooms Very modest choice of toiletries just soap and shampoo , Good location Comfortable beds Helpful and enthusiastic staff Nice lobby bar 
241299,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast was a bit pricey so we either went to Pret a Manger opposite the hotel or The Breakfast Club up the road , The location was excellent for where we needed to be Cleanliness Efficiency of staff The weekend deal was very good value for money 
241300,Mercure London Bridge, Nothing at all , Reception staff were marvellous especially Noelia who really took care of us Nothing was too much trouble for her Loved the Nespresso machine and pods in the room Nice touch Great location for the Menier Chocolate Factory Theatre and 3 underground stations nearby 
241301,Mercure London Bridge, The room wasn t that great I booked a queen size bed and it wasn t the state of some of the facilities in the bathroom was poor There was mold on the silicon filler on the bathroom There was no way to adjust the temperature in the room and generally not that great , The overall look of the hotel is nice and he staff were helpful and attentive 
241302,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast expensive but there is a great place next door Rooms slightly tired , Surprisingly convenient Comfortable beds and room Relaxed atmosphere 
241303,Mercure London Bridge, The shower wasn t obvious to operate and it was impossible not to get wet while figuring it out so very cold initially then burning hot We took wet clothes home after I asked my husband to help out after burning my arms Breakfast was appalling although we weren t charged after complaining Apparently meeting rooms that were far from the kitchen were temporarily being used supplies ran out with quite some delay before top up bread orange juice bacon brown sauce and tea was stewed and cold , The room was adequate in size and the bed was very comfortable 
241304,Mercure London Bridge, The room was tired Very shabby round the edges and in need of some updating We were put in an easy access room on the ground floor which was right on the main road and opposite the breakfast room which was a little noisy , The location is fantastic 
241305,Mercure London Bridge, Had to boil kettle from socket on floor by the door Plug would not fit other sockets , Comfortable room and bed for a short stay Easy access to city center 
241306,Mercure London Bridge, The room was extremely hot and I was unable to reduce the temperature as according to dial it was already off I opened the window but than had traffic noise This is the only negative about this hotel , Friendly efficient staff relaxed atmosphere attractive decor Well appointed hotel with umbrella available at reception waffle robes and dental kit magazines in lounge Good location with some tasty restaurants nearby 
241307,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Everything was OK Spacious room quiet clean excellent breakfast location very good walk distance from the Shard City the Monument the Sky Garden We stayed here for the second time and we ll come again 
241308,Mercure London Bridge, breakfast room was very warm cooked breakfast was excelllant sausages maybe not for everyone too packed with herbs A plainer sausage maybe better and smoked bacon , hotel room excellent but for 220 a night it should be very comfortable bed good facilities in room hair dryer etc Milk not provided for tea coffee so had to pop to reception sunday morning but minor point note its 20 to park overnight for 24 hours it is london though 
241309,Mercure London Bridge, Very poor and expensive breakfast served in a windowless oppressive meeting room Luke warm bacon only scrambled eggs and soggy and cold potato cakes All served up for 16 95 If I stay again I won t be having breakfast, Nice room and public spaces Efficient check in Good location near to all the bars and restaurants of the South Bank
241310,Mercure London Bridge, The room we had was on the ground floor and we were woken by construction and traffic noise on the adjacent street , It s locality to cafes restaurants and the tube
241311,Mercure London Bridge, Bed comfort was not too good Felt the springs of the bed against my back whilst sleeping , Staff were really helpful Hotel room was very clean Tube was close by Value for money 
241312,Mercure London Bridge, Arrived late due to airline and train problems Wrong name inside room Carpet awful marked and wrincled not up to Mercure standard, Location on South Bank
241313,Mercure London Bridge, For the price I paid the condition of the room was shocking The bathroom was dirty years worth of dirt caked around the bath taps and outlets mold growing on the tile grouting The mattress on the bed was very old sagging with a metal bar in the middle that woke me up every time I turned in my sleep The carpets were dirty and stained , Staff was friendly The hotel was well positioned relative to where my meetings were
241314,Mercure London Bridge, Our room was supposed to be privileged yet our view outside of window was of HVAC Duct which was noisy and kept me awake Also bed sheets had marks on them and pillows were very hard not comfortable at all Check in was a farce no desk just computer s work if only small groups book in but anymore and it just become a free for all twice people jumped in front of us to book in as there was no form of queueing ,No Positive
241315,Mercure London Bridge, No complaints , The staff were very welcoming and helpful Our party was 2 couples traveling with my inlaws who were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary We asked if their room could be upgraded and it was ours too 
241316,Mercure London Bridge, How hard would it have been to put two small bottles of still water in the mini bar Most hotels of this quality provide these free these days It was noticeable by it s absence , Check in is quick and efficient
241317,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, We came to see a show in the aldwych which was easy to walk to It has a good location on the south bank approx midway between westminster and tower bridge so if your reasonably fit there is a lot to see within walking distance 
241318,Mercure London Bridge, Location a bit odd Old area Food options in the vicinity limited esp on a Sunday when many joints close too early Be careful to take only the main road if approaching from Southwark station else the inner lanes may confuse you , Good functional room reasonably spacious and well equipped for the price Excellent wi fi speed Staff very helpful 
241319,Mercure London Bridge, Happy with the whole experience , Location was superb Bed very comfortable Fresh fruit flavored water in the lobby was nice touch Staff very friendly 
241320,Mercure London Bridge, We booked a 2 night stay at this hotel 3 months in advance for the opening game of the Rugby World Cup With 3 weeks to go we were told there had been an admin error and they were moving us to the Novotel for just the opening night not very helpful who wants to move hotels on a 2 night stay They then decided we were allowed to stay but removed the complimentary breakfasts we had been offered which considering the amount of stress and phoning other hotels I had to do following their admin error I didnt think was great customer service , Guiness in the bar 
241321,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, arrived at 12pm and they managed to fit us in for an early check in we had booked a privilege room which was just what we needed on the last night of our holiday Really comfortable and relaxing 
241322,Mercure London Bridge, Fan goes in bathroom all the time with or without light on rooms were very small , Location friendly staff parking 20 per day large towels clean room very quiet with good double glazing
241323,Mercure London Bridge, Dirty bathroom with peeling mastic around shower and bath Tired and grubby was the overall impression We often stay in this hotel when I am attending my exhibition at the Menier Chocolate factory and this time we were given a bedroom on the 3rd floor where as we usually are up on the 6th I know these have been refurbished but certainly the 3rd floor hadn t ,No Positive
241324,Mercure London Bridge, Did not want to serve us a night cap at 1 45am had to press the point to get served but they did in the end , Clean and functional with a bit of style
241325,Mercure London Bridge, Nothing just wish we could of stayed longer , We liked everything the staff were very helpful and very informative The privilege room was fantastic Absaloutley loved the bed so big and the fact the room had a bath instead of just an up standing shower was a luxury Location is amazing and rather central 
241326,Mercure London Bridge, I paid extra for the privilege room it was a bit bigger than standard and did have a Nespresso machine However the bedroom and bathroom were in need of redecoration I The free minibar had 2 bottles of water and a tiny can of coke and I wasn t given any replacement coffee pods even though I stayed for 4 nights , The staff were friendly and helpful 
241327,Mercure London Bridge, The reception no one to greet us and when she did the young lady was pleasant enough did not like the open desk Nothing was explained about breakfast and no direction was given to us to our room at breakfast everything was confusing as we attended to get our hot food our table was being laid for someone else The front of house at breakfast was not very well organised , The convenience of the hotel clean and pleasant area 
241328,Mercure London Bridge, The breakfast room was on two levels which would have made it difficult for less able people , We liked the good value for money that this hotel provided and its location 
241329,Mercure London Bridge, It took over 20 minutes to check us in The rooms are in dire need of an update The inclusion of a nespresso machine in a room filled 80s decor and electronics do little to detract from the aged property Its a pity the hotel is so centrally located but the rooms need to desperately get on par with the lobby , Its brilliantly located 
241330,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, This hotel is excellent location for Buses Tube travel to the west end etc the area is very accessible to Borough Market and all local eateries The Hotel has all you need if you require on site restaurant although I used the bar only 
241331,Mercure London Bridge, The breakfast was a little disappointing We went down at 10 20 and it was supposed to finish at 11 Everything was very low on the buffet and we ordered some poached eggs but they took 30 minutes to arrive In hindsight we should of come down earlier but it was a Sunday so we wanted to make the most of a lie in , The staff were really friendly and helpful The room was excellent and very clean and tidy It was so comfortable 
241332,Mercure London Bridge, The room was a bit basic considering the money paid but it is in central london so understandable We stayed in a privileged room The breakfast wasn t worth the cost as they only had small selection Me and my partner paid 20 pounds to have a yogurt and a bit of toast Location wasn t that great as quite a walk to london bridge but there were lovely restaurants around that area , This hotel was so friendly Lovely and clean and the staff were fantastic They even had home made cookies in the lounge with a note saying help yourselves A very welcoming hotel and have a italian lovely restaurant across the road 
241333,Mercure London Bridge, The blinds in the room were damaged and let in a lot of light The television was not optimally positioned for viewing from all areas of the room , Good clean facilities with excellent staff
241334,Mercure London Bridge, The air conditioning was freezing regardless of whether the temperature was adjusted , The bed was comfortable the room was large and the location is great 
241335,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful comfortable and very clean The best part was the location It was close to so many of the main tourist attractions and close to many restaurants and pubs Loved it 
241336,Mercure London Bridge, both me and my wife are disabled and cereal toast juice and continental items for breakfast are upstairs in the restaurant so my wife had to sacrifice her normal breakfast, great location and a good price room was not the biggest but as just a place to sleep it was more than adequate 
241337,Mercure London Bridge,No Negative, Great location for all the main attractions didn t book breakfast as so near to Borough Market which shouldn t be missed Bedroom was a little small but that did not compromise comfort or style Staff were very helpful certainly service with a smile and as an added bonus our bags were looked after on the day of departure so we could continue to enjoy the sites 
241338,Mercure London Bridge, Bit of a walk to underground but plenty of taxis not really a complaint Tv wasn t much use was slow smart tv with no internet access or movies didn t bother us as we didn t spend much time in the room but some may have an issue with it , Staff very helpful close to the magnificent Shard building room upgraded on arrival as we were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary bed comfortable room clean plenty of tea and coffee in room Nespresso machine was fantastic We were even given an anniversary card and a chocolate cake by staff very happy with our stay thx Mercure 
241339,Mercure London Bridge, the staff at breakfast were rude especially the person who appeared to be in charge The breakfast was very average and for the price of the breakfast I was extremely disappointed , The location was good for our weekend event The check in staff were very helpful 
241340,Mercure London Bridge, Breakfast was dreadful and cost nearly 40 for two We could only eat the toast The scrambled egg was like yellow sawdust We complained but never got the promised call from the food and beverage manager to discuss our awful experience There are so many local cafes for breakfast that no one should eat it in the hotel , Location is excellent for Globe Tate Modern etc Staff friendly 
241341,Mercure London Bridge, Very well situated the hotel and Very good Value being it was August and very well situated from Waterloo this was one of our better hotels and one of the cheapest we have stayed in we will definitely come back again and it was our 24th Wedding Anniversary we took a chance and it paid off well recommended in our opinion , Very
