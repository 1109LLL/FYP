50595,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The size of the room, Every thing was excellent the staff breakfast and comfort Special thanx to Daniel at reception and the host lady at the restaurant
50596,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Although we made reservation beforehand we were refused in accommodation due to some mistake in Marriott system they offered us another hotel for one night after which we were to move to Marriott ,No Positive
50597,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, you gave us a special needs room which we did not book and the girl at the front desk promised to change the room but she did not give us any feedback if that was possible or not so we stayed from may 2 till may 10 in the same room also they did not change the bed sheets the whole stay, guy at the entrance was very helpful at the front desk kind
50598,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Overall the hotel did not meet our expectations based on the high star rating We have stayed in other hotels in the same area at a similar price point where the room and facilities were much better For the cost of the stay we do not consider this hotel value for money , The main advantage of this hotel is the location which is very close to the tube and central London Breakfast was good 
50599,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, I didn t like that I asked for a bath a upper floor room and when I complained said there was nothink else available didn t think it was worth the money, The pool that s it
50600,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The loby the room space too small the room layout and the cleaness level Will not book there again , The location the friendly staff and the wifi
50601,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The room view Room service charges Generally expensive TV wasn t working well Technician Visited 3 times , Location is more than excellent TV channels selection
50602,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane,No Negative, Everything were excellent All the staff kind and helpful And the room was so clean as no one ever stay on it Definitely my choice in London for the next visit 
50603,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Lounge was really ugly small old fashioned and food was not up to a 5 star hotel and for 500 euros a night that should be a must Rooms quite small , Location the lobby the staff
50604,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, It says park view well it is but not a great view They say executive lounge well it isn t good as people off the street come in so not very quiet or private , The heated toilet seat lovely The room was nice but quite small The bed was comfy Great location 
50605,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, They closed the bar for a private function so no guests had access to the bar and lounge Also alcohol was supposedly included in executive lounge it was not , Good pool
50606,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Our flight comes in very early from the UAE we waited for a long time till our room was ready The staff were very courteous and cosiderate till the room was ready but after 3 hours I suggest that special early check in should be in plan for flights like ours , Everything its perfect
50607,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, I dont like the conradiction of reception clerk When i ask for smoking room one told me all full and the other told me we don have smoking room at the hotel , I like the quietness in this hotel
50608,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The only thing there is no direct elevator from entrance to the room either to change 2 elevators or the staff can help to carry baby buggy the few stairs steps to reach the 2nd elevator For familys without baby buggy it s no problem at all , Perfect location as hyde park few minutes by walking and shopping areas are around Staff were friendly and there was a nice smell in the lobby area We enjoyed our visit and wish to visit again 
50609,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The chambermaid service left something to be desired A stained undersheet was not changed A used milk capsule was not removed Perhaps shortbread biscuits could be provided in additin to or instead of the oatmeal cakes The mini bar was so noisy an interrupted humming that after a disturbed first night we had to ask for it to be disconnected And lastly for disabled or elderly people the steps from the entrance up to reception are difficult to navigate and the lift doesn t stop at the entrance level A ramp of some kind would have been most helpful , The beds were extremely comfortable The staff were well trained courteous and very helpful We would like to praise the exceptional service provided by Lucas at the front desk 
50610,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Television stations were free to air and it showed Not a great choice The system they had sometimes told you one show was being aired when in fact the show was a different one We asked for the detox juice on our first morning as per the breakfast menu to be told that the machine required to make it was broken The machine was still broken the next two mornings If I was running a 5 star hotel I would have had the machine replaced immediately Another option would have been to remove the item from the menu Breakfast service could be improved Maybe we had different expectations coming from Ireland and maybe breakfast service works a different way in England I think it would be worthwhile for the hotel to send people undercover to the hotel and check how the breakfast service is They should use people from both English and other backgrounds and get their feedback Personally while the staff were lovely and courteous at all times I believe this aspect of the hotel could be improved For example one morning we were given our tea and coffee at the beginning of breakfast We ate a cereal and then waited for our cooked breakfast our tea and coffee were cold by the time the cooked breakfast arrived We could have asked for more tea or coffee but I think staff should have been more attentive to something like this and asked us if we needed fresh tea or coffee due to the length of time involved I don t believe this is an issue with the staff but rather an issue with training , All the staff were lovely We always got a nice greeting and smile from everyone working there The rooms we stayed in was lovely and we were happy with all aspects of the room and it s facilities The bathroom was also excellent The hotel and all areas of it we visited were maintained very well and displayed quality and regular maintenance The location of the hotel is excellent and we couldn t have wished for better We both enjoyed our stay very much and would return again

50616,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, The noise from an air vent in the bathroom the light from the hallway shining through into the room Difficult to control room temperature I did not sleep well during my 3 night stay Also I did not get new shampoo and conditioner in the 3 nights I stayed and had to call and request some even though my bottles were used the first night , Concierge very helpful The room was beautiful gorgeous interiors and the bathroom had an amazing toilet 
50617,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, limited food choices for breakfast in executive launge breakfast not included in room rate except with launge access, The Qibla prayer direction is there without I ask for it well done The WC with auto wash friendly staff the executive longe access clean room excellent location
50618,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Breakfast service a joke Very slow service Better service in a 1 star hotel fior breakfast Ordered veggie breakfast with poached eggs and traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs The food came with the wrong eggs on both plates Why bother with waitress service and writing down the food order if them the food delivered is wrong Self service would be better Great hotel but breakfast really let the hotel down , Pool bar staff location beds
50619,London Marriott Hotel Park Lane, Breakfast totally below standard , Everything in the hotel was good except breakfast 14 minutes to get coffee Then 5 more minutes for any food to arrive It s not self service My Luke warm cooked breakfast arrived just after my cereal was delivered I ate the cooked breakfast then went back to the cereal Only one item of the cooked breakfast was hot Worst breakfast I have had in any Marriott anywhere in the world Breakfast Staff need to be retrained
