197229,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Me and my girlfriend had booked a night at the hotel from the 24th to the 25th of June On arrival just like every other hotel I have stayed at we paid for the room and they add the deposit charge which we were told the deposit is just a holding charge and will refunded back This is completely normal just like every other hotel I have stayed in We were kindly upgraded FOC to a master sweet which of course we were very grateful for On departure the following day they requested a second payment for the cost of the room After explaining to the clueless front desk several times I had paid for the room on arrival they were still adamant we need to make a second payment and that the cost of the room and the deposit are just holding charges Never heard of this before and nor does it make sense seeing as they have taken the money already on the first day just to refund it back And then pay again Great logic there Unfortunately I did not have a receipt as we were not provided with one I should have requested one but I did not assume I would need to prove my innocence to them that I have paid already as it would show on their system which they checked and apparently no payment was showing Annoyingly Barclays Bank were undergoing some maintenance so I had no way of accessing my accounts via app or online to show the payment I had made on the 24th The staff were very patronising and made me and my girlfriend feel cheap as if we were trying to get away with not paying In the end we had to pay AGAIN as we were holding up their que as I couldn t access my bank to transfer further funds to my account so my girlfriend had to make the second payment This was meant to be a treat for her from myself following a promotion at her work I ve never felt so embarrassed I left feeling very bitter and robbed , Nothing really

197234,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Papersheet thin walls and no room door soundproofing getting woken up by disrespectfully loud clients in the hallway adjacent room at hours where silence should be expected Bed mattress could be changed felt like sleeping on a wooden plank , Mayfair located
197235,Washington Mayfair Hotel, 1 The water pressure from the hose for bathing is small and unevenly distributed 2 The breakfast spread was miserable 3 There was a middle aged lady who knocked on our door shortly after we checked in and when I opened the door she said just checking and walked away So much for security 4 The 1st night after we went out we came back with a plate of fruits with compliments from the hotel to us Thats a nice thought and appreciate that but on the other hand doesn t it mean the hotel staff just walked in and out of our room whenever we are not around 5 There was no ironing board and iron in the room, 1 The concierge was very friendly and helpful 2 Near Buckingham Palace

197239,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Bathroom looked a little tatty on the woodwork and to the bath but lovely marble Wasn t keen on the staff in the restaurant watching us all eat though that did feel slightly odd , An old hotel modernised but it s originality could still be seen which was the appeal for me however it was close to where we needed to be Staff friendly and accommodating which makes a difference 
197240,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Beware of false mini bar charges Several weeks after the check out I noticed a 2 charge from Washington Mayfair Hotel I know 100 that I did not use the mini bar As I live in the uk on my next trip to London I went directly to ask for a refund but they wouldn t do it Such as shame I won t be staying here again , Location

197243,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The entire hotel decor was tired I would say it s more a 2 3star Our room needed redecorating as there were dark patches on the ceiling and parts of the walls The rooms were noisy You could other people s doors opening and banging shut you could also clearly hear people s conversations when they were in the hallway felt like they were in the same room I can honestly say in terms of general noise i e Doors opening and slamming shut works being carried out outside it is the noiseiest hotel I ve ever stayed in , The location of the hotel was perfect 10 minutes to the ritz and 15 minutes to Buckingham Palace

197247,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The room was very dated and needed a lot of refurbishing The window was cracked and overlooked a very ugly sight In order to shut the door completely you had to actually slam it The walls were so thin that we could hear our neighbors quite loudly all night long There were not enough usable outlets in the room and the lighting was very poor , Location is great 
197248,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The hotel is very tatty and needs refreshing all through All walls had marks on everything looked very old Wouldn t recommend this Hotel can get a lot nicer hotels in this kind of area for same price , Location was ok

197256,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The bathroom was tired the bath panel had seen better days and was tatty The shower over the bath was fine and hot water plentiful however the bath was narrow and the shower curtain kept encroaching My fear when we were informed of the upgrade to a Deluxe Twin was that this meant no double bed This was realised by the fact that the twin beds were pushed together with no topper or other method of covering the gap between them Our experience in the restaurant was not great The food was very good and the menu suited us well Unfortunately the staff appeared to be new and had little idea of what they were doing There was only 6 people in the whole restaurant but still they found it hard to attend to us When the wine came it was poured spilt on the table cloth and the bottle taken away The waiter had to be escorted back to the table with the bottle Ordering the meal was challenging I was informed that my main course came with mash but when it arrived there was none After what seemed an age I finally had to go and find the waitress to ask for a desert menu My wife asked what cheeses were on the cheese board The waitress went away to ask the chef and returned with the information this persuaded my wife to order When the board arrived it was carrying completely different cheeses none of which she liked This was to be a special meal for my wife s 50th birthday Appreciating London prices the stay over was not cheap The experience was unfortunately underwhelming to say the least , The location of the hotel was excellent just a short walk from the tube and adjacent to Hyde Park The room was larger than expected as we were upgraded Staff weren t rude but not over friendly either

197299,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The curtains in the room were filthy there was what appeared to be a substance on the bath which I cleaned off and the dressing table was very wobbly I was only there one night New Years Eve so didn t highlight the issues as especially because I was given a room upgrade without asking and it was NYE You have to pay a deposit on a credit card which gets refunded but something to bear in mind Our room door also clattered every time someone opened a door in the corridor Very noisy AND I was told I was placed in the quiet part of the hotel I would stay here again if I wasn t expecting absolute luxury I would say it wasn t worth the money I paid unfortunately Would be comfortable paying 150 , Bed was very comfy Friendly staff Great location Useful fridge in room Sky TV with lots of channels Free upgrade Good check out time of 12 00 Decorated nicely for Christmas

197307,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The upgrade was a bit of a disappointment for the price we paid we were expecting something a little more fine tuned However one of the major let downs was the air conditioning we couldn t adjust it which meant that we were over heated the entire night and didn t sleep at all well I had reported this to reception but no one came to see it and we had dinner plans so I had to leave The minor details are the room looked tired I had to request a minibar to be in the room but they soon brought one up This was a king size bed but it was quite uncomfortable and was a very hard mattress Pillows were not in proportion to the bed I think it needs a feminine touch to bring it really on par with other Hotels in Mayfiar at the same rate , It was an anniversary evening for me and my partner We got upgraded to a king suite which was lovely They also treated us to cake and fruit basket which was delightful The staff were accommodating and friendly 
197308,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Decor overall is looking worn and in need of a re do Check in check out were slow with not enough staff on the desk to get people on their way My one complaint is that the bed was pretty awful and same with the pillows like two poly filled slabs Glad it was just one night or I would have been pretty stiff and sore , The location was great walking distance to Buckingham Palace Hard Rock Cafe Harrod s etc The staff seemed to be friendly and accomodating Although small my room was clean and the Sky TV was great I had everything I needed for a place to stay over a busy weekend

197312,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Bedside lights poor and very difficult to read my book in bed, Room and bathroom were spacious comfortable and clean Glad I could open the windows and also pleased that I was given a street facing room which was what I had wanted
197313,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The hotel is dated and need renovating the beds have incredibly uncomfortable spring mattresses there are no basic conveniences in the room that you might find in most 4 star hotels hair dryer dressing gown shampoo and conditioner and the staff are slow we asked for an iron and ironing board that took over an hour to arrive , If it wasn t for the location this hotel would have nothing to offer
197314,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The hotel is quite noisy from the rooms you can hear doors opening and closing constantly BUT it is an old building so to be fair I don t think there is much they can do about this Decor is a bit tired , I was travelling with my young Niece and we arrived at the hotel at about 11am My Niece was very tired from the long journey to London and the receptionist went out of her way to secure us an early check in Excellent concierge service who are set up to look after your bags before and after check out Full Sky TV in the rooms and extensive room service menu The location is fantastic lovely 10 minute walk through Green Park to Buckingham Palace then on to Houses of Parliament etc easy assess to Hyde Park and only a 20 minute walk to the Theatre District too Lots of cafes nearby and a mini market over the road for essentials 
197315,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Room looked very different to the pictures when I booked the room paid extra only to be put in what looked like a standard room staff was rude when I asked to check in at 1 but check in time was 2 o clock then in the next morning they was mocking on my room at 9 50 to clean the room,No Positive
197316,Washington Mayfair Hotel, As I say sometimes seemed a little tired I prefer a walk in shower rather than in the bath And no free WiFi , The staff were great The location was superb for me as my business dinner was around the corner It would be great for anyone wanting to be in the heart of the West End And great value Some of the facilities seemed a little tired but the bed was very comfortable The bar is great for a drink and when I was last at the Madison its restaurant it was a good place to eat not on this my first stay as a guest 
197317,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The room I was allocated was very narrow The bed head was positioned under the window Narrow access to bathroom It was an exercise in limited space management and a successful outcome achieved however this is not a budget hotel I expected more space for the rate charged I noted the mini bar was not stocked up according to the list of what should have been available No biscuits or shortbread with a very sparsely stocked tea and coffee area in the room A bit disappointing for a top location in Mayfair Got the feeling that it doesn t have to try the location alone will sell rooms , Location is superb for access by tube or indeed is in walking distance 15mins to Picadilly Delightful quiet location in the heart of Mayfair The standard of cleanliness was superb 
197318,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The staff were very rude lack of communication the iron that was given to us exploded causing me to have an electric shock the breakfast facilities were not clear in orientation When arriving back late at night the night member of staff got frustrated at us for not pushing the correct door and was not at all hospitable Due to the iron exploding we had a power outage for 20 minutes and although the power was turned back on after this time the sockets in the room either side of the bed were not This caused us to have not have charged phones and therefore we were unable to even take photos let alone post them On social media or even use our iPhones for GPS Upon complaining the manager gave us a pathetic discount of 10 and offered us an upgrade This was despite us exclaiming as clearly as we could without swearing that we would not be staying there again In event , The location was good 
197319,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Buffet style breakfast Paying just under 200 for one night I would have expected a breakfast to order , The hotel was situated in a very nice part of London easy access to the sights of London close to tube station and the Ritzjust around the corner Very nice hotel would book here again 
197320,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was very good except for the extra charge for special coffee latte cappucino The hotel is in a great location close to restaurants and the regents park
197321,Washington Mayfair Hotel, When we got to our room we noticed the bins weren t empty glass half full of water and bed not properly made They apologised straight away and gave us a new room There was a crack in the window which was taped up with selotape , We were upgraded on arrival Location was excellent Hotel was easy to find and rooms were quiet Bed was really comfy and we slept well 
197322,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The room did not have what was stated for a deluxe room No mini bar safe broken no bathrobes no hairdryer shower head dirty Window latch broken so held with a magazine Receptionist stated the robes was on request Staff had to send a hairdryer up to the room Assistant manager listened to all the complaints offered us 10 discount off our next stay no discount could be offered off our stay 525 for 2 nights This service will make me think twice before booking again Room 611 , Location
197323,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Too hot Unable to turn heating below 19 degrees which made it very uncomfortable as the room wasn t large , Very welcoming the staff were very courteous and attentive
197324,Washington Mayfair Hotel, General cleanliness not good carpets in lift dirty front door covered in finger marks Bedroom tired and needing maintenance, Location excellent Breakfast very good choice
197325,Washington Mayfair Hotel, we booked in early and left bags expected no delay in collecting keys later when room was ready There was some confusion over our keys delaying us 20 mins when we were short of time Staff poor communication rude ,No Positive
197326,Washington Mayfair Hotel, No one talked through how to access WiFi however I particularly didn t need it but my partner did On the next morning a maid knocked and rang the room bell non stop once I got out of bed to make myself decent and opened the door she sheepishly apologised perhaps she thought the room was unoccupied However no excuse to interrupt my stay by banging like the police Not long after the door is knocking AGAIN I grabbed a towel to cover myself as I had JUST got out of the shower and instead of waiting for ME to open the door this employee whom usually works in the bar burst into the room I was stunned as it was approx 11 20am and check out is at 12noon and asked if I had helped myself to any products from the mini bar I said no and my parter had the same response No sorry no thank you nothing Unacceptable Room 405 11th 12th Nov 2016, Loved the quick and friendly checking in process and general staff acknowledgement The breakfast was delicious and complimentary birthday cake was a really nice touch to make the evening special for my partner
197327,Washington Mayfair Hotel, My room key didn t work 3 times so I had to go back to reception, Old room and corridor leading upto room was in need of renovation Very dated and in a state of distress
197328,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The room smelt very strongly of stale cigarette smoke and the window wouldn t stay open we wedged it with a glass We are both non smokers and this made the stay unpleasant I should have complained straight away but we were tired and had to go out to meet our friends I did mention it when checking out and was told 617 was a non smoking room even though there was an ashtray on the side near kettle The air conditioning was very noisy and ineffectual , Good breakfast and bed comfy
197329,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Very convenient location about 5 minutes from Green Park tube and just a walk across the park to Buckingham Palace The staff were all very pleasant particularly those attending at breakfast Would definitely stay here again if staying in London 
197330,Washington Mayfair Hotel, A walk in shower would have been good as I hate a shower curtain which wraps its self around you when you switch on the water , The service was excellent from reception to the restaurant even the room maids were very professional and pleasant
197331,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Nothing, Last chance booking to to mix up tho have stayed at the Washington before great location and fantastic upgrade to 8th floor suite can t get any better Thank you
197332,Washington Mayfair Hotel, We were right next to a building site and they did not mention this work noise all night and it ruined the whole stay They would not even offer us discount when we mentioned it in the morning I would never stay there again , Leaving 
197333,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Place was very dirty and badly in need of updating Only one lift working that took forever to arrive We where on 7th floor Our room was ok and clean The hotel is defiantly not a four star maybe 3 at best also very over priced , Bed was comfortable
197334,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The decor was old and tired especially in the lobby and hallways old carpets The staff was also only partially trained it seemed The coffee in the room is instant was terrible and the tea was so so if they improved the coffee and tea in the room and remodeled the lobby and changed the hallway carpets I would like it more , The location was perfect Near tube stations hyde park centrally located The wifi was free and worked well The rooms were clean beds large and the bathroom was clean and modern It is a good value for the location 
197335,Washington Mayfair Hotel, No response when asked them to come and fix the TV There was a drunken resident which disturbed the night to such an extent we had to move rooms There was a noisy fan which prevented restful sleep in the bedroom , Sky TV was good when you eventually could get it to work Location great Room sizes good 
197336,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The elevators got pretty dirty and were not cleaned daily The breakfast never changed a little variety would have been nice , It was in an excellent location and the staff was very friendly 
197337,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Reception on arrival was alright but no information about brekfast times or if we could use restaurant the following night We only discovered it was out of use by a note in the lift from the manager not there in the morning to say it would be closed from 5pm for a private function Staff would direct us to a suitable establishment We did not think this was at all acceptable We had to go to reception to ask for a room service menu they told us to look for it in the room we already had we were not believed which disappointed us In the end we rang room service and asked for someone to bring a menu to us That staff member then waited at the door for us to decide Remember the customer is always right and there was definitely no menu in that room Reception gentleman couldnt wait to tell us we had a refurbed room but omitted important things as above No one helped us to our room with the luggage or even pointed out the lifts There were no easy chairs in the room and although the bathroom was adapted there was only a shower over the bath Whilst I agree I did not ask for a special room I was unable to use this as I am unable to get in and out of a bath The expense of a part renovated bathroom seemed pointless it needs a rethink No biscuits on the hospitality tray and you had to take the kettle over to the desk to boil We did have to ask for extra tea coffee and milk and after a 20 minute wait I had to ring room service again for these items I had originally asked reception before we went up to our room Only 1 piece of A4 paper for the desk and no pen these items would have been helpful helping us plan our day This was the first hotel I have been in where not provided There was no way of adjusting the heating in our room and although we opened the windows we were still very hot For a high end hotel we were disappointed by some of the staff and communication also some facilities were lacking , Breakfast was excellent and so were dining room staff Bottle of water provided every day was good cleanliness was very good Beds comfortable and bedding spotless plenty of towels provided
197338,Washington Mayfair Hotel, My room was close to the gym and I got woken up every day by people running on threadmills or playing music in the gym Soundproofing is in general very bad This hotel definitely needs remodeling , Location is great staff is helpful
197339,Washington Mayfair Hotel, mattress on the bed was dreadful It was not comfortable at all Room was too hot couldn t open the windows Just couldn t cool the room at all The room itself was very shabby Breakfast was very basic , Location was great 
197340,Washington Mayfair Hotel, First room was small dark and old, Once we got a renovated room everything was perfect The first room they assigned was old small and dark So one needs to requested renovated room Otherwise good hotel and great location
197341,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Specially temperature in restaurant and other areas of hotel far too high not comfortable room temp OK Hotel need freshen up many places worn down , Great location and size of room friendly staff 
197342,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The hotel d cor feels tired and the updated rooms miss the luxury mark you would expect of a four star hotel in Mayfair The road was also incredibly noisy being woken up at 6am to workmen outside , The location of the hotel was ideal with shops bars restaurants parks and museums just a few minutes walk away 
197343,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Located across from a mini mart Trucks would unload at 3am 5am Shower difficult to use Staff not approachable Would never consider staying here again regardless of any discount Plus they took payment 7 months in advance while other hotels have waited for payment closer to the time ,No Positive
197344,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The windows needed a clean and just needed a little tlc in some places of the hotel , We only stayed for one night when we arrived we were upgraded to the suite which was very nice In a prime location we thoroughly enjoyed our stay 
197345,Washington Mayfair Hotel, There was no air conditioning on the ground floor and as a result was not comfortable to sit in the bar and Dining Room Floor Fans were used instead of the installed air conditioning They said the AC was in need of repair It was working just fine in our room and in the hallways of the upper floors We were there for 19 days and the AC was never on for the ground floor The hotel needs to pay more attention to detail , The food in the Dining Room was exceptional The drinks from the bar also excellent The staff for the most part was cheery and welcoming The chef was excellent but the dining room was to uncomfortable to sit in and was almost always empty The bar tender Cosomo was excellent 
197346,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Upon checking in I was informed I had been upgraded from a Classic to Premium room If that was the case I wouldn t like to know what the classic looks like The Premium was dark and plainly furnished with only the very basic facilities The bed was very firm and pillows were small and hard For the price was disappointed , Location of hotel was good for purpose in London and the car park nearby was useful notice at car park states it will soon cease to operate as a car park 
197347,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Trouble with room temperature controls Trouble with working the TV Both sorted bv helpful staff member Small stain on bed base Very noisy sounded like window was open not closed and a loud noise like water being pump , Staff very helpful and polite We were upgraded to a very nice suite Suitcase storage easy and secure Hotel was clean and comfortable
197348,Washington Mayfair Hotel, There was no iron trouser press in the room and the doors to the wardrobe were missing , The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent 
197349,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The mouse running around reception was not a good start the staff were rude and very unhelpful the toilet in the room was not entirely clean no apology for the mouse incident , The location could not have been better 
197350,Washington Mayfair Hotel, View was onto a wall but didn t really matter as blinds let in daylight so just left them down that wouldn t stop me going back, Great location clean bright room Staff helpful friendly Great breakfast selection all very fresh 2nd visit to this hotel just as happy as last time we stayed 10 min walk to Buckingham place too It s same time same place next year 
197351,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Nothin loved all of it, Really loved this hotel Hopin to come back again soon we didnt want to leave staff was all great an helpful absolutely no faults at all for our stay thank you
197352,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Lovely breakfast with plenty to choose from Lovely and relaxing Staff friendly and helpful the underground station just round the corner so easy to get around all the tourist sites 
197353,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded to a suite the Cleveland which was very well appointed with icy cold air conditioning and it was very spacious and comfortable The staff were very helpful and had a genuine interest in our plans for our stay 
197354,Washington Mayfair Hotel, It rained but even then the guy on reception lent us an umbrella No complaints at all , Room was lovely good sized bed and comfortable Not noisey Staff were great Breakfast excellent Couldn t fault it for the time we were there 
197355,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Upon arrival bathroom was not cleaned safe was not working called reception to fix this they did not, Hotel in excellent location waiting staff excellent cleaning staff not so good overall very good you are paying for the location
197356,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The poor service I had to wait 45minutes for a blanket to be brought up to my room after 4 calls to reception and rooms weren t good enough for the price The bar food is over priced a pizza cost 10 95 and it s probably a 2 frozen pizza , Location
197357,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The reception staff were abrupt and unhelpful Daniel didn t offer help with luggage and didn t provide information how to find room The room has inadequate curtains to block out the light they are four strips of material but the biggest concern was there was a blood stain on the underneath of the bedding that we discovered when turning down the bedding to get in We paid a significant sum to stay in this hotel and when we checked out early and told Daniel the problems we were not offered any recompense The room 522 was also very noisy located near a fire door that constantly banged We left early , The location
197358,Washington Mayfair Hotel, I keep deposit 100 uk from that deposit take it all because in our bedroom broken something and reception evaluate that item from deposit 100 uk In fact that item very chip in market not that much cost money ,No Positive
197359,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The shower was hard to stand up in The room was also a little strange not uncomfortable but kind of oddly laid out which involved limbo dancing under the wall mounted TV to get from one side of the room to the other , Check in staff were very efficient and nice Location can t be beaten if you like Mayfair and Shepherd Market 
197360,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Didnt stay for breakfast overpriced for continental, Very friendly staff clean shower very powerful service very quick we ordered an iron and it arrived within minutes
197361,Washington Mayfair Hotel, room was a little small but not a huge problem if you are not planning on spending too much time there, staff were excellent and the room temperature was perfect 
197362,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Heavy doors are a little tricky to get a stroller through but really minor issue , Excellent breakfast especially liked the scrambled eggs Helpful friendly staff Location is convenient for London s parks 
197363,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Room wasn t as clean as it could be hair on the floor and Mini bar had half bottles of water, Bed firm and comfortable Shower powerful Staff very friendly free upgrade to a superior room
197364,Washington Mayfair Hotel, We didn t like the original room we were given and so were given another room Apart from this at the start of our stay the rest of the trip was good ,No Positive
197365,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Quite expensive for one nights stay but due to its location it s understandable , The location is brilliant it s a 5 10 min walk from Green Park tube station or a 5 min taxi ride to Oxford Street costing between 6 7 each way The hotel room was comfortable with all the amenities and a super comfortable bed Breakfast was lovely and staff couldn t do enough to assist 
197366,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Service could be improved Bit more warmth would be appreciated Friendliness of staff desired Concierge staff should speak good English, Location was great Rooms were clean Bed was comfy 
197367,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Except for one member of concierge the staff were unfriendly and not very helpful the heat inside the hotel was very stuffy could nt open a window as they were jammed closed fridge was nt working so nothing stayed cool , The location is good easy for tube to all areas and in walking distance to many sights shops restaurants 
197368,Washington Mayfair Hotel, We stayed at first floor side building room rather noisy from very early in the morning although it was a blind street , Perfect central location very close to metro station and major attractions 
197369,Washington Mayfair Hotel, If you stay in the lower level room you are paying for the location Although the room was clean the carpets were fraying away the curtains were stained and the bed was worn , Bed was comfy enough and you get limited Sky TV which is a little better than freeview 
197370,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The stairs from the elevator to my room Not great if you have heavy lots of luggage , Lots of space in the Deluxe Room for a Central London hotel All the amenities you could ask for Tesco Express across the street a plus 
197371,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Spa bath didn t work Superior suite not as good as junior suite but charged 50 for upgrade when their mistake with smoking room Breakfast too expensive , Location 
197372,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Noisey banging doors and really uncomfortable pillows Smoke alarm went off while i was in the bath Had to have the door open and heated towel rail was on and couldnt turn it off Bathroom unbearable hot, Bed very comfy
197373,Washington Mayfair Hotel, When we arrived there was no booking record Very disconcerting to say the least After 25 min this was sorted out and we were shown to a room which had two single beds plus an extra bed this had not been requested We were then given another room By then much of our time had been wasted as we needed to be else where We had to hurry off On returning to our accommodation late evening we realised that there was only one bedside table lamp no bathrobes only one armchair in a Superior King Room supposedly The chest of drawers was in a state of disrepair with one handle on the lower drawer hanging off Obviously Housekeeping left a lot to be desired These issues were raised with Management at checking out and we received 10 off the room tariff and the promise of a room upgrade in the event of any future booking which we feel is highly unlikely The whole experience was very unsatisfactory indeed The breakfast by the way was very mediocre Overall not at all value for money , Nothing in particular 
197374,Washington Mayfair Hotel, hotel concierge had absolutely no knowledge about where and what kind of places restaurants are in the neighbourhood Hotel staff had given a special room in the top floor but the room s curtain kept falling in the period of our stay the room was new but was not equipped with any art except for white walls and curtains which were not of correct sizes which was a disturbance since I m not a early morning riser , location since it is located in Mayfair 2mins walk from green park tube station the neighbourhood is the best for nightlife and rich and famous stay in this area 
197375,Washington Mayfair Hotel, All good , Very helpful staff Duty manager was very helpful when there was a query even sent up a bottle of prosecco Lovely hotel Close to an underground that links to most parts of London Close to highly visited parts of London Would definitely stay again 
197376,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The bathroom could be updated and bath plug didn t work This meant no relaxing bath at the end of the day , Enjoyed the spacious room and helpful staff 
197377,Washington Mayfair Hotel, View of a brick wall there seemed to be a funny grinding noise in bathroom , Location friendly staff especially what seemed to be the lady in charge of breakfast best shower I ve used 
197378,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Terrible service staff unable to answer simple questions wait times at reception unacceptable concierge no clue about the surrounding area Rooms small very dark and stuffy A very average hotel got s high price, Lication
197379,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Because of a temporary hitch with proferred credit card we were treated as potential scammers One member reception even said that they should check our credit card history He appeared to be a trainee who badly needed further training in customer relations The Mastercard offered has an immaculate record with full payment made every month on time for years ,No Positive
197380,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Being in the Hotel refurbishment industry I tend to notice more than most the Hotel for where it is in Mayfair could do with a bit of modernisation program carpets bathroom tiles ceilings in lobbies water damaged , Bed very comfy bathroom ok breakfast great 
197381,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Included Continental breakfast in not really good or tasty Carpet probably needs a shampoo to be in perfect cleaned condition , Good location Quiet environment early checking without additional cost 
197382,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Such a comfy bed and we arrived very early in the morning and our room was available It was so good to rest after our journey allowed us to enjoy the rest of our stay Staff were very quick to clean our room 
197383,Washington Mayfair Hotel, breakfast not included in the high price of hotel room service during breakfast not the best from all staff with some far more helpful and happy than others would have been nice to have double or even triple glazed windows to combat the noise from outside the hotel as it felt like we were outside with the people coming home from the pub when we were tucked up in bed it was that loud , really comfy bed although was two pushed together nice breakfast with good selection and high quality Friendly staff at reception area and at concierge a good rate of discount on the local parking when paid for in conjunction with the hotel invoice 
197384,Washington Mayfair Hotel, some of the staff were absolutely so rude our tv didn t work so they just messed us around with rooms and blah blah saying they gave us this and that room at the end they gave us smaller rooms then tried to charge us more1 kept taking different amounts of money from my account which still hasn t returned just disgusting service so confusing and time consuming not worth it especially when on holiday just a 2 star hotel with a good name living off the mayfair name nowhere near its standards oh the hotel room was very dusty and caused breathing problems here and there not the fault of the cleaning staff but the senior management who should be on top of these things if you want to be in mayfair as a new visitor in London spend a little more money and get something better yes its cheaper than some but its cheap for a reason spend wisely ,No Positive
197385,Washington Mayfair Hotel, There was a frequent but irregular booming noise elevator mechanism The pillows were AWFUL We started out with four foam rubber slabs that could not be made comfortable After two days of requesting feather pillows we got two one of which was so old it was more like a one inch thick placemat No mini bar which we only use to chill our own items anyway so no biggie , We love the location very close to Shepherd Market close to Green Park station and a block from Picadilly Street We had asked for a king bed and we got it The bathroom floor was heated The decoration seemed new and was nicely modern Lots of lighting options and modern temp controls 
197386,Washington Mayfair Hotel, There was a group of loud foreigners whose children were allowed by their parents to run around and scream at breakfast time The staff did nothing about this , The breakfasts were great
197387,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Despite our being a couple only one face cloth and bath robe were initially provided each night you shouldn t have to ask at such an establishment , Within easy walking distance of many central london attractions 
197388,Washington Mayfair Hotel, There was only one dressing gown in the room would have been nice to have two as that s how many were in the room, It was my partners birthday and so they upgraded us for free I just noted it in the booking details and when we arrived they were friendly Ordered room service and it was fairly quick and tasty and as we did they got complimentary bottles of water and bowl of fruit Staff were friendly and when we needed an iron brought it up very quickly
197389,Washington Mayfair Hotel, We did not use the services of the concierge except once and that individual was very helpful The overall impression given by several of the concierge staff was that they were bored and would rather not be bothered This may be an unfair assessment from afar but on one other occasion when the Front Desk requested that the duty Concierge obtain an item for me there was nothing that would challenge that assessment , Front Desk staff Housekeeping and Room Service were all exceptional 
197390,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Breakfast offering was expensive , We have stayed at the Washington Mayfair before and we love the combination of comfort location and value for money that it provides This latest stay was especially nice at we had a superior room which had a huge and blissfully comfortable bed with more space than usual And the duvet was like a slice of heaven Where can we buy one 
197391,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The kettle and hair dryer were not beside the sockets When the dryer was moved to a Socket it was not near a mirror Very important for ladies , We liked the central position the breakfast which was extra was good The beds were very comfortable 
197392,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The wardrobe rails were a tad high for easy putting in and taking out of clothes Otherwise the room was very good , Everything was really good My wife was even allowed to borrow an umbrella for the Royal Garden Party All meals were very good with plenty of choice And all staff were most courteous and friendly 
197393,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Some places looked a bit worn but not extreme , Pleasant staff good breakfast comfortable rooms all with a great location I will definitely look at staying here on my next trip 
197394,Washington Mayfair Hotel, We had two single beds which both are due for replacement You could feel the springs and generally did not sleep well The pillows and duvet also needs to be replaced , Great location and close to restaurants underground and park
197395,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Our room certainly wasn t value for money it was small very tired looking with a very uncomfortable bed our friends had booked directly with the hotel breakfast was included in the price this was the same price we had paid for room only with Booking com Overall disappointed with the quality of accommodation for the price paid , Staff were friendly location good
197396,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The outside noise was a little troublesome and the room rather hot on arrival although opening a window and putting on the aircon fan helped this , The room was clean and comfortable 
197397,Washington Mayfair Hotel, For breakfast I was seated at a table with totally stained tablecloth It was a table set for two where probably one person had eaten before me and I was then seated at the other end I would expect that if one person leaves and had made such a mess that the table was properly cleaned up before seating the next customer , The location is just great 5 minutes to Green Park station and just 5 minutes to Hyde Park The staff were friendly and helpful and overall it was a good experience The room was nice and quiet with a large and comfortable bed 
197398,Washington Mayfair Hotel, This hotel you have to like Location location location Piccadilly is just around the corner , I just loved the fact that the hotel is privately owned I was upgraded to a superior room complimentary The breakfast was awesome I will definitely stay there again 
197399,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Not the best pillows Gym was near our room whirring of treadmill woke us only about 1 2 hour before we were due up so if you fancy a lay in avoid room 530, great location friendly helpful staff reasonable price
197400,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The price If i had not paid for the room and was a visitor i would of thought i was in a travel inn or travel lodge i get the location but 170 is a complete rip off as far as i m concerned i felt robbed the bathroom was exactly the same as a travel lodge for that kind of money i expect a decent bath a shower cubicle something a little luxurious for gods sake my partner purchased the full english breakfast and for 22 it was worse that stopping at a motorway services i would appreciate a refund but i know this will never happen i suppose i can add my negative feedback onto trip adviser and a few various hotel recommendation sites and hope someone see s and does not experience what i did for such an extortionate sum of money Completely mis sold and completely ripped off , Unfortunately i struggled to like anything at a push i would say the check in staff and the guy that fetched me the iron ironing board even though that leaked water all over my clothes and the actual ironing board was wonkey i d have to say these were the only positives 
197401,Washington Mayfair Hotel, Room smelled of cigarette smoke Couldn t open the windows at all but air conditioning did work well , Great location and great value for money 
197402,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, We have been using the Washington Mayfair for years have tried others but always come back It s good value for money comfortable and well situated Already paid a visit this year and will be there again soon 
197403,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Without a doubt this one of the best hotels I have stayed The location was perfect The food and accommodation was perfect the staff was very friendly and I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends 
197404,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, The location of the hotel was excellent arrived early we were allowed in our room straight away excellent service by all the staff definatitely stay there again f
197405,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, Great Location surrounded by shops restaurants and coffee shops with the piccadilly line less than 5 min walk away Room was spacious warm and well equipped 
197406,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The lighting was very dim in the corridors chairs in room uncomfortable Overnight road noise , Very comfortable and spacious bed Nice area to explore Easy to walk to shops restaurants etc 
197407,Washington Mayfair Hotel,No Negative, We were upgraded to the Executive Suite which was very spacious and comfortable Staff were extremely polite and the location was ideal for our trip 
197408,Washington Mayfair Hotel, The noise of the location The room we were promised only materialised after we complained , The staff addressed our problems when advised of them did what they could to assist our stay
