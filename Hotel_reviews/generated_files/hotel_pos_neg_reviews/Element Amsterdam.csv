272833,Element Amsterdam, The hotel is not far from the center but the metro takes about 30 minutes to Dam square So little bit of traveltime and planning is nessasary but this is not something you should let stop you The hotel service and staff are great , We recommand this hotel new mode interior design good size room with everything to make the stay comfortable and relaxing Next to a fashionable mall for those who love shopping 
272834,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast selection is poor bread croissants yogurt boiled eggs and only one type of cheese Parking is not free around 35 EUR per day In one occasion they didn t come to clean our room Location itself is nothing remarkable , The bed was very confortable good sound insulatated room hotel relatively close both to public transport and highway
272835,Element Amsterdam, The only area of improvement I would recommend is in the breakfast It was very one dimensional and boring More fruits cheeses vegetables and a different additional flavor could help , We travelled to Amsterdam on the 18th of July and stayed in Element Hotel for a period of 3 nights Our check in at the hotel was handled efficiently and overall the front desk staff were extremely professional and handled all my queries and requests extremely well I had an issue with the AC which was also handled very well The location of the hotel is a bit away from the city center and that s not a bad thing as it is located in a calm neighborhood The rooms are quite comfortable and my 9 year old son loved the large TVs that were in there Not much of a view from the rooms as this is a business district Overall I would say it was an excellent decision to stay at this hotel and I would strongly recommend it 
272836,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, The room little studio was exactly what I needed The mattress was super comfortable not too soft There were really nice healthy breakfast options with fresh lemon and ginger to add to the tea for instance 
272837,Element Amsterdam, Having to check out and go home , The staff were super friendly and more helpful than I could have expected they checked me in 4 hours early at no extra cost Who could complain about that Absolutely fabulous staff brilliant hotel excellent location I can t wait to go back 
272838,Element Amsterdam, No room service no warm breakfast options e g scramble eggs, Bed like a cloud Small kitchenette very convenient Very close to shopping mall same building 
272839,Element Amsterdam, Distance from public transport Consider free shuttle service from Amsterdam Zuid Station to hotel for guests on arrival , Beds extra big and comfy with large rooms and nice healthy breakfast and direct access to shopping mall
272840,Element Amsterdam, Do not stay if you like a piece of salami meat fish and or vegetables for breakfast as you will not find it there , Very nice and spacious room Very nice design 
272841,Element Amsterdam, Not the ambience of the central parts of Amsterdam but that is our problem and not that of the hotel or area , Good service polite professional staff uncomplicated travel to and from hotel 
272842,Element Amsterdam, Replenishment of the tea and coffee in room would have been nice Perhaps they don t do that sort of thing in The Netherlands Just grab some breakfast tea bags As for coffee you d have to source those elsewhere yourself The 2 small windows would not open After investigating I found out why and fixed them up no worries , I loved the bed So comfortable The staff were excellent in tending to any needs or wants The room was quiet and relaxing The breakfast was healthy and plentiful Had a burger and beer there One of the best burgers I ve had If like me you re not averse to some walking then it s a good central location to stay A nice long walk into the city centre but also within walking distance to Vondelpark Amstelpark and Amsterdamse Bos forest park like setting if you like greenery which I do A peaceful and quiet stay 
272843,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast assortment is rather poor it is really affecting negatively the overall experience, Very modern clean comfortable great stuff impeccable service
272844,Element Amsterdam, little choice for breakfast unsupportive suff I asked what was the best way to get to central station and was roughly advised to get to the street and have a walk I finally got lost unpleasant experience with heavy luggage why did noone tell me that taxi might be a better option also i asked to check if the bagage lockers at central station were open as the site was in Dutch only but i was refused overall very upset with how the check out went , good coffee croissants for breakfast room was ready for early check in without preliminary notice 
272845,Element Amsterdam, parking wasn t available on site and a bit an inconvience to go to the nearest public garage , this was a beautiful hotel The rooms were very nice and the breakfast was amazing 
272846,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast I consider it too healthy Just for vegetarians Buy some solid staff in the mall food store No available olive or other oils even salt is not at hand you should ask for it but healthier pepper is on table The only positive in breakfast fresh and good bread Very expensive car parking a way to discourage use of polluting cars , Property located in a new built area silent and conveniently linked with city tram underground Not far away from Shiphol airport abt 18 euro via Uber Large rooms with kitchenette all new and in good shape Lucky me to stay during weekend free car parking on street only where are white lines Otherwise be prepared to spend a lot up to 50 euro 24 hours Timely and clean public transport yet quite disturbing to check in and check out at every trip 
272847,Element Amsterdam, The hotel needs more staff as on weekends and evenings when house keeping has left there is only one person on reception so if you have any problems they cannot send anyone to the room to help The staff that are there are helpful and polite , The property was clean spacious and the gym and shower were fabulous The is a shopping centre and supermarket next door to the hotel and a great Japanese restaurant the location is perfect 20 min tram ride to the centre and trams arrive every 6 mins so that was perfect 
272848,Element Amsterdam, Very far from center of town Breakfast very poor for the quality of the facility Sometimes chose to make my own, Bed was super comfortable Room quiet
272849,Element Amsterdam, The selection of breakfast very poor hardly any healthy options no ham scrambled eggs restaurant staff very slow not attentive they asked us to sit at the bar very busy place cramed in tiny room also not enough tables for such big hotel We skipped breakfast for the remaining 2 days They don t set the tables either Our room did not get cleaned on 1 day at all or missing toiletries or did not put sheets on extra blanket For such expensive place these few things are spoiling otherwise a very nice hotel , Very well equipped hotel very quiet comfortable bed 7 min from tram metro station than 25min to center Few restaurants around and shops too Reception staff very helpful 
272850,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Perfect hotel Friendly staff clean and cozy rooms with many appliances The shopping centre is a plus and it also just 5 minutes walk from the Tram no 5 which gets you anywhere 
272851,Element Amsterdam, Would be difficult to find anything better no complaints, Lovely location with shopping centre in complex Very good breakfast and very friendly staff 
272852,Element Amsterdam, A bit far from the city center but very well connected through the public transport tram line 5 , Extremely clean and comfortable rooms Bed mattress pillows is great and super comfort Staff is polite and helpful Nice breakfast Close to shops and groceries 
272853,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel room is large very much like an Studio Really enjoyed our stay Breakfast was good Easy 10 minutes walk to Train Tram and Metro stations Staff are friendly 
272854,Element Amsterdam, Housekeeping is poor and seem short of staff Towel not replaced totally Compliment bottle of water only supplied the first night and no more penalizing longer stay customers, Front desk staff are friendly and informative 
272855,Element Amsterdam, It was a bit of a trek to get downtown but the public transport is great Not much in the way of local restaurants , The staff are very professional and helpful Property was immaculate 
272856,Element Amsterdam, Everything was good nothing to suggest, Staff was very helpful and friendly rooms are absolutely not noisy and bed is extraconfy Breakfast has many options rich selection of sweet and savoury healthy options and a very cosy environment Even if the hotel is not at downtown the connection to airport and tram metro is easy metro tram station is 3 minutes walk from hotel when we arrived from airport at evening we even walked to the hotel from Zuid station that is less than 15 minutes walking distance Being embedded into a mall you can easily get food to cook in room kitchen if you have special need or get something from mall restaurant to enjoy in your room after a long day around Amsterdam 
272857,Element Amsterdam, Hotel team was rude maybe when we got to the management level and complained I guess the customer is never right when we asked for extra blacked at 21 we got it at 23 as there was one person on shift Breakfast was very poor limited healthy offer toasts got stuck water were jammed in the kitchen sink and too strong air co got us sick as we could not regulate Finally location beside the fact its next to a shopping mall it very far from the tram station and center of Amsterdam , We will not come there again
272858,Element Amsterdam, The times for the breakfast were very strictly kept even in days with too many customers It was acceptable we were noticed about but unnecessary The breakfast was quite good but could be better for such a perfect hotel , Everything Perfect vast room with even a complete kitchen and an iron Close about 5 minutes to two train and metro stations and bus stops You can go everywhere in city Peaceful neighborhood 
272859,Element Amsterdam, The reception guys are kind but not well informed at all The first day sent us to a bike shop and told us that we would receive a discount as customers of the hotel but the shop had no clue about this offer Same thing about the keukenhof gardens One told us that the hotel has an offer the other denied it Another annoying thing was that they were closing the breakfast buffet earlier or exactly the indicated time I went to refill my coffee and they did not let me at 10 05 Last thing was that we had a hard plastic shaker and some coffee with us to make coffee at the room which went missing the first time they cleaned up our room , The room was beautiful and really spacious like a modern studio apartment Clean and with a really comfortable bed It also has a nesresso machine and the first two coffee capsules are free of charge 
272860,Element Amsterdam, The shower cubicle for the room didn t have full doors so water did spray out there was no handwash soap but this was only a minor inconvenience , Friendly staff the rooms were spacious and had a relaxing atmosphere The location was not in the tourist city centre but close to the Metro tram meaning a peaceful evening and good access to attractions The nature themed panels and walls gave a calm ambience Overall very impressed with the hotel and will stay here again next time in Amsterdam 
272861,Element Amsterdam, One of the days we were there they straightened the room but didn t clean it The location was a bit outside of the city which was nice but is little daunting if you re walking back from the tram after dark , We liked that the hotel staff worked with us to get us a discounted rate They offer it but Booking com does not The location was quiet with a 5 10 minute walk to the tram 
272862,Element Amsterdam, See above , Bed was good but there should have been a frying pan in addition to the two small pans available One pan was discraisful and should have been changed Room size was good 
272863,Element Amsterdam, The location was not as convenient as I thought about a 5 minute walk from the tram stop line 5 but not as close to South Station as I had thought The surroudings are not very interesting This hotel aims at long stay visitors which was not clear from the booking The atmosphere lacked warmth and personality , Element Amsterdam offers spacious rooms at a reasonable price the place looks nice and well taken care of The rooms have a kitchenette in them aiming at long stay visitors Wifi was excellent 
272864,Element Amsterdam, not much happening in the neighbourhood hotel restaurant way too expensive and closes early the price for this property was heavily discounted by some 50 truth be told although it was a very comfortable hotel the originally quoted price would have been too much so if such generous discounts aren t normally available when booking well in advance i d call this property over priced breakfast is good and fresh but little variety and selection , very comfortable apartment equipped with facilities Tram metro line to city centre 9 minutes walking distance away quiet area very friendly and helpful staff very close to VU university which was the reason why i chose this property mini pantry available at reception where you can buy some food drinks
272865,Element Amsterdam, A bit far out of the centre for the price although short walk to the tram , Lovely comfy bed and great kitchenette Tasteful decor wide bright walk ways lobbies Breakfast had a nice selection and nothing too heavy Gordal offered delicious tapas 
272866,Element Amsterdam, Maybe slightly nearer the city but as mentioned before not a huge problem as so easy to use trams etc, The location although a little outside the city was near to the tram and metro so no worries travelling into the city This also made the hotel quiet and a lovely place to lay your head The staff were very friendly helpful and courteous 
272867,Element Amsterdam, For me the location is perfect Just be aware it is not in the historic centre of town It does not claim to be and personally I love the quiet sophistication of the Buitenveldert locale and the easy access to the Oud Zuid Old South area of the city Just check your maps first and decide what you want , Location is great for WTC Zuidas access for A roads or just being out of the mania of the centre of town Perfect if you want to shop Gelderlandplein centre or spend a lot of time in the Amsterdamse Bos woods and nature park Design is modern clean and fresh very northern European and better for it Staff are helpful and pleasant The room was great like a studio apartment and perfect for a longer stay Bathroom was excellent We experienced a particular problem during our stay and the hotel investigated thoroughly and were professional competent and sympathetic and it ended up well 
272868,Element Amsterdam, Too much expensive I made a reservation though Booking com which said the payment will have to be made directly to the property on the spot but actually the mount had been already deducted from my account I reserved the hotel for my colleague from Japan therefore if the payment is reducted from my account the things would be complicated The receptonist who was nice kindly credited on the spot the amount paid The system should have been sdjusted to the booking com indication , Kitchen Set
272869,Element Amsterdam, none , Awesome hotel Perfect for family or business Very friendly and helpful staff from Reception Housekeeping and Restaurants Shopping malls just next door We had a wonderful stay 
272870,Element Amsterdam, I thought the breakfast could have been a little better was just standard There wasn t much space to sit everyone either especially at the weekends when the hotel was busy , Beds very comfy and hotel very clean 
272871,Element Amsterdam, The hotel was a bit far out from the city center but it s only a minor issue , Friendly multilingual staff who really make an effort to talk more to you than the odd small talk The hotel had modern and tasteful interior in pastel colours Provided good choices for breakfast continental breakfast with a variety of bread and rolls pastries cereals boiled eggs coffee and tea mini dutch pancakes Though the hotel was located a bit outside amsterdam it was not far from a metro station that would take you within 10 minutes to central station You are not far from de pijp uber ride 6 euro and there is a really great spa zuiver spa in 25 minutes walking distance 
272872,Element Amsterdam, Very Poor TV Signal 4 days of Relaxing spoiled by poor TV signal and constant stream of staff entering your room to fix it Underground Hotel parking very expensive better to park elsewhere Towels not new and fluffy , Great atmosphere Great decor Great soft Brazilian lobby music Great Staff Hotel Clean and New Interesting shopping arcade Good location for Metro and Tram use
272873,Element Amsterdam, The hotel is very far away from the city centre and at a 15minutes walk from the closest train metro station Amsterdam Zuid The hotel seems to cut corners on everything and the staff could benefit from better training Not having bin bags is unpleasant especially when you have kitchenette and you may want to cook something Coffee tea bags milk pots dishwasher tablets toiletries were not available for the entire stay just for the first day They could have been purchased from the reception at a very expensive price for their value go to the supermarket Hema situated at the ground floor of the shopping mall or bring your own It was the only hotel where I had to ask the receptionist for a toilet paper roll I asked left a message for the housekeeper but I did not receive any The breakfast was basic nothing special Although the food was satisfactory the staff s attitude was not No Good morning no thank you no good bye They looked at us when we left like we were nothing but a one more table to clean Same with the housekeeping and receptionist Disappointed Oh and the hotel retained a large deposit from my debit card which was refunded two weeks after I left the hotel I did not see that mentioned on Booking and I did not enjoyed having that money blocked for such a large period of time Also the hotel initially took more money than mentioned on Booking so be vigilant and check your bank statement They claimed they took money for the city tax but the amount did not match They refunded but I still lost money for currency exchanges Overall I am disappointed and I would recommend to go to another hotel , 
272874,Element Amsterdam, breakfast was disappointing and staff weren t the most helpful, good location we enjoyed being out of the centre while still being able to access it within 20 minutes very spacious and comfy room bathroom was lovely cleaned every day and left spotless
272875,Element Amsterdam, Having to pay for additional coffee capsules Give me a kettle and powder rather than a single caffeinated nespresso tab , Nice breakfast and friendly staff 
272876,Element Amsterdam, The hotel has WiFi keys to open room doors Well in my case they worked poorly and needed at least 6 or 7 times going back to the reception for new cards , Very convenient location for my purposes Close to the world Trade Center close to the railroad station to the airport and close to a mall Actually the hotel is in the mall Nice simple breakfast Spacious rooms with a complete kitchen 
272877,Element Amsterdam, N A, The staff were excellent and very welcoming The hotel is a super location and right next to a shopping centre The hotel reception is also open 24 7 which makes it ideal for experiencing Amsterdam nightlife 
272878,Element Amsterdam, The breakfast is very simple The is no fried egg option On the average I give 5 6 out of 10 to breakfast Hotel is far away from the center Take this into account while reserving The surrounding is quite and nice area Nearest metro statin is about 700 900m So for shoppers I do not recommend this hotel The city center takea about 20 30m depending on where you want to go Price vs quality I think that you can find more balanced deals elsewhere , The hotel is clean and staff is very helpful The bed was very confortable The room is clean and spacy Check in and check out is smooth The room has dishwasher and kitchen utulities Hotel rents a bike if you want 
272879,Element Amsterdam, Parking was 100 for two days , The hotel was amazing Connected to a mall clean and comfort rooms with refrigerator microwave dishwasher and stove top 
272880,Element Amsterdam, Location Some effort to walk to and from the tram stop but we didn t mind , Room size facilities and cleanliness Breakfast while limited in variety was wholesome and is in line with Element s philosophy 2 adults and 2 kids 
272881,Element Amsterdam, Booking com charging me full price for children , The hotel is fantastic and in a great location we will definitely be back However to get the best deal book direct with the hotel we were charged full price for the two children via booking com The hotel advised me at checking in we could have saved 50 if we booked direct with them 
272882,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Me and my wife spent in Element Hotel Amsterdam 2 nights FRI SUN in December 2016 We choosed this accommodation because of the same distance to the city centre and Heineken Music Hall Jesus Christ Superstar with Ted Neeley A few recommendation from the airport taxi ca 37 eur and ca 11 min drive no traffic To the airport bus no 199 1 person 5 eur and ca 50 min drive nice tour by the way Taxi take the official taxi Follow the yellow signs on the floor when leaving the airport building I net connection wifi we did not use B fast ok no special surprise typical 4star bfast Room 100 clean safe quiet comfortable super bed pillows Staff some blond hair girl at the reception from Ukraine who speaks also german polish and german super friendly nice polite helpful To the van Gogh Rijks Diamond Anne Frank Museum take tram no 5 and then walk ca 25 min The hotel is located in the shopping centre It does not disturb you at all Fresh fishes great supermarket with good fresh cheap stuff and also a playground for the kids inside ATM 30 sec from the main entrance door to the hotel We recommend 
272883,Element Amsterdam, Little wall to the tram train but without the children this was fine, The black out curtains and comfy bed meant a lovely sleep away from the children Followed by a tasty brekkie Really liked being so close to the shops 
272884,Element Amsterdam, Element Amsterdam would make a great service to their property by training their staff better One day I called the reception about misunderstanding with the cleaning personnel The reception promised to return to us but it never happened I waited for the whole evening We were put in an invalid room that was not the coziest one There were these small things said by the personnel that make you feel they wish you to be gone Telling 2 hours before check out that you can leave already when you ask whether the check out is until 12 Not asking how your stay was Not showing any appreciation that you stayed for 5 nights Not providing tea bags etc in your room daily Maybe there are just too many tourists in Amsterdam , Interiors both in public and private spaces looked good There was enough space in our room it was well equipped and silent Bed was really good Harmonious colors and interesting pillows in public areas of the hotel Loved the orchids and Christmas decorations Location in a shopping mall is very handy 
272885,Element Amsterdam, The bar closed quite early , The hotel was spotless and the staff very friendly and helpful The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in 
272886,Element Amsterdam, The only issue is that there wasn t the choice of a full English breakfast , The bed was the most comfortable I ve slept in The fact the rooms have a kitchenette including dishwasher is awesome 
272887,Element Amsterdam, Very messy and poorly organised breakfast A lot of people crowding in a limited area and food finishing quickly Also poor variety of fruit and a very very slow coffee machine need to change that as it is not in line with the overall standard of the hotel which is quite good , Good room brand new with nice design large and new with kitchenette 
272888,Element Amsterdam, No plastic bags for the bins livingroom kitchen and bathroom which I think it s essential particularly when you have a kitchenette inside your studio because at some point if you cook or eat something you will need a rubbish bin to dispose your leftovers A part from that everything was perfect , Staff very kind Comfortable studio room and good breakfast cereals granola muesli milk coffee tea juices marmalade bread butter cheese ham yoghurt fruit boiled eggs pastries Tram metro stop number 5 51 to Central Station Amsterdam within 10 minutes walking There are also buses within 2 minutes walking which go to the city centre 
272889,Element Amsterdam, Unfortunately on the morning of checkout it was extremely slow took me about 20 25minutes as there was a large wait and made me rush for my morning meeting , I love the shopping center it s attached to with some great shops and restaurants Also I love the decor of the hotel 
272890,Element Amsterdam, Nothing I think it s a good choice , The breakfast The location is not bad you can take the tram to the city center and there is a bus just in front that takes you to the train station The bed and the pillows are perfect for a night of rest 
272891,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Very comfortable hotel Amenities included a microwave fridge cooking hob utensils for cooking plates etc It s truly a home away from home Located next door to a mall which is convenient The only negative is that it s a 5 10 min drive to the city centre Apart from that Awesome hotel 
272892,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast was weak and repetitive Lots of dust behind the sofa They take 5min to do the cleaning Miss the toiletries Worst toilet paper ever, Great bed Good location
272893,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Fantastic from start to finish very clean and very quiet hotel you wouldn t think anyone else was staying there as its so quiet Breakfast was lovely with a good choice of food Room was lovely very clean lovely big bathroom super comfy bed Very tastefully decorated as well Will definitely recommend 
272894,Element Amsterdam, The entrance is somewhat difficult to find next to the entrance of the mall Breakfast is adequate but could be improved more variety , Spacious room with all facilities more than necessary Complimentary water coffee in room Nice breakfast Helpful stuff Hotel is some 30 min walking from the museums square But you have a very good connection by tram and train to the downtown and to the airport 
272895,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, We had an amazing time at Element last weekend Room is amazing and the huge bed something out of this world Everything about this hotel is perfect starting from location staff room facilities and the buffet breakfast had so many choices from fresh smoothies coffee fresh juice to toast croissants fresh fruit yoghurt and much much more 100 recommended we ll return soon 
272896,Element Amsterdam, It will cost about 40 euros for a taxi to the airport Use local transport if you can approx 7 euros unlimited for 24 hours , Very helpful staff throughout great accommodation 
272897,Element Amsterdam, It wasn t easy to go from the Hotel to the airport early on thw morning We had to walk about 12 minutes to catch bus 310 Also the distance from the Elemnet to Metro and tram it was 10 minutes walking , Super beds super comfortable with well equipped Kithen The Hotel is in big shopping mall where there is a large Super Market So it is easy to buy somethnig to cook Always we had to catch metro 20 min or tram 45min plus 10 min walking every time from the hotel to the tram stop if we would like to go to the city center
272898,Element Amsterdam, A little outside the city centre approximately 1km from the large Station Zuid train metro station 600m from the tram stop that takes you directly into the city centre or the museum quarter out of the front of the hotel and turn left Tram line 5 , Beautifully clean comfortable hotel Excellent staff on front desk Continental breakfast very good Room spacious and great to have the flexibility to cook heat food if required with the kitchenette in the room Large bathroom with excellent walk in shower again very clean and fitted to a high standard This is equivalent to a better than average 4 star hotel in the UK Large supermarket within the same complex not Mrqt which is small and expensive look for Albert Heijn supermarket Domino s pizza 400 metres down the road to the right as you come out of the hotel This is a really good hotel that I would thoroughly recommend especially if you don t mind the short walk to the tram stop 
272899,Element Amsterdam, We had a piece of bread lay on the ground in the corner since our arrival It stayed there for 2 night when on 3rd we moved the bin aside so that cleaning lady could see it Lack of warm food during breakfast mostly cereals waffles croissants meat for sandwiches and cheese and some pancakes , Shopping centre is literally downstairs 30min by tram to City Centre Tram station is 10min walk 
272900,Element Amsterdam, Was no air conditioning and no alternative blankets thermostat in room did not work If I would have known would not have stayed there but they advertised the aC as being in all the rooms Had to borrow blanket and Fan from a family member , Reception staff very nice very good breakfast
272901,Element Amsterdam, I was here attending a conference at the nearby university which is 15 mins walk away The city however is far from the hotel and if I were a tourist I would find it too far at least 45mins tram ride plus walk The city itself is beautiful and is nothing like where the hotel is located It s safe and clean but nothing much to look at I was also quite disappointed by the staff The man I checked in with could have been friendlier When checking out I asked for a taxi at 3pm When it didn t show up after 3 I asked and was told I should wait a bit more At 3 09 I asked again I was pacing in front of them and they never came to ask They made a call and I was told the taxi was stuck in traffic and should arrive in 5 mins The taxi didn t arrive till 3 22 and I was getting very nervous I spoke with the driver and I believed that the company never got a call from the hotel until 3 09 I was very disappointed that they messed up my taxi booking and did not apologise for their mistake , King size bed was extremely comfortable I slept like a baby each night It is very quiet I never hear any noise and the room is large and very clean Bathroom is also large clean and modern Kitchen equipment is handy though I haven t had a chance to use it Wifi works great Located right next to a nice shopping mall which has supermarkets some shops and restaurants the Vietnamese place is quite good 
272902,Element Amsterdam, Having to pay 100 euro per room deposit, Good location close to metro and tram rooms were very clean and well equipped supermarket was close by Breakfast had a good choice Staff were friendly 
272903,Element Amsterdam, The location was to far away from the main tourism part of amsterdam although it states different on your website one night a cleaner had left our door on the latch luckily nothing was stolen out of our room but still abit careless also the breakfast is not at all apealing for an english person , It is very clean staff are friendly and welcoming the room was 5 star quality 
272904,Element Amsterdam, No free slippers , Modern and chic Spacious Clean Location few mins walk to tram or metro going to the center Bus from airport stops directly at the hotel Right inside the mall where there are shops restaurants and supermarket 
272905,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast was good but it would be great to have some healthier options available, It would have been good to have been told about the free beer at the bar The young man serving was very courteous and made sure we got what we were entitled to 
272906,Element Amsterdam, The cleanliness of the room floor was so dusty and under the sofa there was a huge amount of dust as if it is never removed for cleaning The kitchen can be better equipped for bigger families it hardly serves 2 people and can be further equipped with additional supplies for ease of use , I liked the location proximity and the convenience of the mall and tge super markets Albert Hijen and marqt Staff were cery friendly and helpful Hotel is very new with an elegant modern style furniture and convenient kitchenette in the room The bath amenities were very good organic material Location close to tram station is very convenient tram 5 goes to centraal station in less than 30 mins
272907,Element Amsterdam, The breakfast was terrible scrambled eggs and no meat, The rooms where clean and comfortable and the location was right at the mall which was convenient The food was not worth the extra cost the breakfast was all carbs and no protein 
272908,Element Amsterdam, The light over the table could have been brighter for reading purposes Relatively far from the center where the action is , Excellent breakfast Electrical outlets for charging gadgets Proximity to the airport
272909,Element Amsterdam, It was cold the AC was stuck 24 C the wi fi was slow and there was no floor drain of water in the bathroom , Excellent room design fairly good breakfast welcoming staff 
272910,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were always welcoming The whole hotel was very quiet Very close to the airport and close enough to the tram station Breakfast was better than expected
272911,Element Amsterdam, One can always find problems The view wasn t the greatest but not the worst either The outside restaurants associated with the Element was going through some growing pains during our stay but as I said several other places to eat close by or buy some food and prepare in the room , While not in Dam Square or its surrounds only a shortish walk 10 min and 10 minutes depending on where you are going on a Tram or a 15 to 20 minute Uber ride to most points The modern mall nice shops markets and restaurants part of the hotel complex made our stay even more comfortable 
272912,Element Amsterdam, laundry equipment did not work properly instructions should be available to operate stove etc , the suites being equipped with a kitchenette the king size bed and location of the property
272913,Element Amsterdam, The wi fi worked fine in overall but sometimes it gets weak and we had to go out to the hall near elevator where the signal gets strong again and then it worked well again in the room , The room we stayed was very comfortable And it is convenient because the hotel is a part of big shopping center and there are restaurants and stores 
272914,Element Amsterdam, Amenities not stocked daily and location is about an hours walk to central only two bikes for rent Terrible breakfast for the amount of guests Very corporate, Beds were beautiful Bikes to rent
272915,Element Amsterdam, When checking out they charged me for laundry service which I did not use They kindly reverted back the charge but then some days later they charged also a large amount of money They rolled it back but it was quite frustrating Anyway they were fast and helpful solving it Also room was clean but was not perfectly clean and you could find some dust balls and other s people left things under the sofa , The room was very nice and comfortable and the staff very helpful The staff during breakfast was very diligent too 
272916,Element Amsterdam, I have booked two rooms and was asked for placing two security deposits of EUR 50 each So the hotel just charged me everything rooms and securit deposits I am a busy person and now they keep sending me filled documents back as there is some logo missing The worst is that I was asking the counter desk person and he assured me that they never charge the amounts but they did , Sorry but a negative situation has removed all the positives 
272917,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Had a wonderful stay and the staff were very helpful Fantastic breakfast with a lot of choice Great location with a very modern shopping centre underneath with every type of shops you would need to make your stay comfortable I would highly recommend this hotel if you want to be out of the city but still with very easy acess to the city by tram 
272918,Element Amsterdam, The room was not cleaned until 5 00pm , The experience was very pleasing from our comfort point of view Having a shopping centre and supermarket in the same complex is a real bonus 
272919,Element Amsterdam, I didn t like how the staff wasn t very helpful at receiption not telling us how to use our room key and the elevators then at breakfast no one saw to us to explain how it worked or when we could have our breakfast It was a shame that you only were aloud one bottle of water and two coffees in your room and we were there 4 days for the price of the hotel you would expect a bit better service We wasn t told about having to have a deposit down also so when we arrived we wasn t aloud in our room because we had spent all of our money paying for the room already to then be told they wanted another 150 out of us So we hung around not knowing if we re going to have a hotel for our holiday although we had already spent nearly 400 for just the room Hotel was nice just a shame no one seemed like they wanted to work there and be helpful at all , The room was smart and comfortable 
272920,Element Amsterdam, Only very minor things some kitchenware missing once the room was not cleaned which surely would have been fixed if we asked the reception , Large new room full of optionals including working kitchen and fridge Very friendly and helpful staff great breakfast good location 1km from Zuid and RAI stations next to a mall with supermarket and many shops and restaurants Clean and safe area 
272921,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Great friendly hotel only 15 min tram from the centre ideal for if you don t want the hussle and Bussle at night but want to be close enough to the centre for day time Very clean and tidy and the hotel staff were incredibly accommodating and helpful 
272922,Element Amsterdam, When we first got there there was calcium in the rain shower head so water didn t come out properly Had to wipe it off, Bed was comfy Shower was nice Cinnamon rolls were good
272923,Element Amsterdam, Lot of dust everywhere TV table kitchenette surface coffee maker etc Crumbs of food in freezer on table and so on We stayed there for 4 nights and dust was not cleaned during our stay Room service only change towels one towel was dirty on arrival and make bed Soap not available in bathroom only wall fixed and broken showering gel dispenser in shower Shower was leaking to bathroom so after taking it you need to mop the whole bathroom Breakfast was acceptable on weekend but choice reduced on weekdays Looks like management invested a lot to build good looking and comfortable hotel but personnel is ruining it For example vacuum cleaner stayed dropped in corridor for 3 days until someone removed it , Good equipment nice design 
272924,Element Amsterdam, No duvet provided but a quilt that s a little heavy and stuffy , Brand new hotel with nice design and decor Location is good close to a park and Amsterdam city The room is like a real studio with a sitting area study and kitchen Bed is big and comfortable Breakfast not a big variety but the hot croissant is really great 
272925,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, There is a relax hour from Monday to Thursday Each guest can get a free drink and some snacks It provided a leisure place for people to relax And the staff is nice and helpful 
272926,Element Amsterdam, The location wasn t as close to the town center as I d liked but the close tram nearby ensured it was an easy journey to get there , Incredibly comfy beds Friendly very helpful and attentive staff Excellent in room amenities Very clean and modern hotel Great shops and cafes nearby A short and easy tram ride into town the tram stop being a 4 min walk from the hotel A really nice continental breakfast selection 
272927,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff were amazing so friendly and helpful Beds were comfortable and breakfast was wonderful Although location was out of the main area it was easy to get to by tram in 15 minutes and loved the convenience of the shopping centre below 
272928,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast is a turn off we had the same menu on all 4 days of our stay so much so that we skipped the breakfast on the last day , Super bed cleanliness nice bathroom too and spacious

272930,Element Amsterdam, We managed to get free bikes from the hotel great idea in Amsterdam but I was unlucky to puncture a tire and got charged 45EUR to replace it You can rent a bike for 4 days and you won t be charged for a punctured tire at a rental place for 45EUR For this reason I wouldn t recommend taking the free bikes from the hotel you re better off renting somewhere else May I suggest the hotel reviews this policy to truly be a Wonderful place to stay , Great staff excellent bed and a great kitchen Tasty breakfast strong wifi everywhere in the hotel Good location with transport links closeby Shopping mall in the same building as the hotel Will definitley consider this hotel next time 
272931,Element Amsterdam, The only thing I could fault was the hotel withdrew 200 from my account without any explanation before hand They asked for credit card details upon arrival and I noticed 2days later 200 Was withdrawn by Element Hotel When I went to reception the receptionist explained it was a deposit I just felt it would be better to have known this before my trip It went straight back into account on check out , Rooms were exceptional beds extra comfy and a lovely shower Friendly Staff and warm atmosphere Very close to no 5 tram takes your straight into city centre We stayed for 5 days so we bought a 4day ticket so we could hop on and off Bonus having a shopping centre underneath also 
272932,Element Amsterdam, Upon arrival we was not given any details of the gym facilities or not offered any information about the local area and the bike facilities , The hotel was of an exellent standard with accessable facilities The staff was friendly and helpful 
272933,Element Amsterdam, The bar prices were extremely expensive for a hotel nowhere near the city centre , Being able to sit and enjoy coffee and snacks on the large roof terrace 
272934,Element Amsterdam, Laundry facility could be improved i e Add tv include basket In room to transport laundry, All great staff from check in to post check out Neat place easily accessible quiet Fantastic stay
272935,Element Amsterdam, The hotel is really unresponsible They hold 150 on my bank even I already checked out perfectly a week ago That made me call from Finland to Holland many times and finally they told me to find the bank Actually the bank said that they took the money I have travelled many times and always booked hotel on booking but nothing like this ever happened before I m so angry at this hotel and the service I still didn t get my 150 back ,No Positive
272936,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, The location is a tad off city center and main tram line but we have very clear instructions from the friendly staff to direct us The hotel is clean and new and we really found it to be very comfortable
272937,Element Amsterdam, That we can t find anything to criticise , Very comfortable a home from home feeling Staff were so helpful and friendly Excellent Free local shuttle to train station was a bonus 
272938,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was quiet spacious clean with good quality furnishings and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The breakfast was fine and staff were pleasant and helpful 
272939,Element Amsterdam, Not a good place to stay with a small kid no transportation is being provided from airport and vice versa house cleaning is not upto the mark the kitchen utensils were never cleaned properly towels were never changed regularly, The location is not very far from the airport the staffs are helpful and cordial both the restaurants are good and provide fresh foods
272940,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Our room was super clean and comfortable with soundproof walls big TV and an equipped kitchen The hotel itself has a great location easily reachable from center and airport we reached both of them in less than 20 minutes furthermore it s close to or better to say right inside a big shopping center Staff are really friendly and nice Breakfast was great and at our time of stay was served from 6 30 in the morning which made it possible for us to have it considering our early flight I d definitely go there again if I visit Amsterdam one day and I highly recommend it 
272941,Element Amsterdam, Location is far from centre but with a metro or tram station 6 minutes away Then 20 min ride to centre, Basically it wars the best hotel i have stayed regarding cost 
272942,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast was somewhat limited , Element Amsterdam is a recently opened harmoniously furnished hotel in a shopping mall The room was well equipped studio with enough space and fresh colors Could rest there well 
272943,Element Amsterdam, Size of the studio is smaller than what the description 29 sq meters of the hotel claims The room is dusty more care and effort should be made on vacuum cleaning Coffee and tea in the room is supplied on arrival only One trash bin should be included in the kitchen area , Good sound proof room with a compact kitchen Free bikes self laundry and fast wifi Cozy lobby that serves as a good living room area Location just above a AH XL supermarket within a huge shopping mall Relax weekday offer of free drinks is a great idea 
272944,Element Amsterdam, I little hard to find at the start need a number 5 or 51 tram and go 2 stops beyond Amsterdam Zuid , Lovely quiet location away from noise and busyness of Amsterdam central Nice upmarket area location with loads of nice parks nearby Free bike use if you are up in time Reception and breakfast serving staff are very friendly and helpful Nice kitchenette area and all very clean Spacious en suite 24 hour open gym Attached to a lovely shopping centre
272945,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Very convenient location 10 min walk from Amst Zuid connected to a v nice mall in a charming neighbourhood Great base for business or leisure Very clean good kitchenette Lovely people esp those at breakfast 
272946,Element Amsterdam, Location was far out therefore eating out was limited lack of bars or restaurants, The size of the room and bathroom was amazing studio kitchen was fully fitted Great sized shower
272947,Element Amsterdam, more instruction in bedroom on how to use safe hob phone menu very limited in restaurant, Ability to prepare food in room large bedroom plenty of space staff incredibly helpful
272948,Element Amsterdam, They have only 3 bikes for rental so you have to be really lucky to get one , The atmosphere in the hotel is friendly the pleople are so helpful the room is really nice and the matress was awesome 
272949,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast could be little better there is little weird smell in halls shower cabin looks great but it is very impractical, Staff is perfect hotel is beautiful and clean 
272950,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Great breakfast healthy food drinks shakes excellent comfort of bed very nice room spacious nice design utilities kitchen sofa and friendly staff Whenever I return to Amsterdam I will book this hotel again 
272951,Element Amsterdam, The nespresso capsules were not replenished on Saturday , It is value for money cos although it is further from city centre the tram line is only abt 5 10 mins away depending on how fast you walk Get the 24 hrs ticket and you can go anywhere serviced by GTV trams n buses A small but adequate kitchette with induction cooker microwave oven allows for quick cooking There is a great food market as well as a supermarket in the adjacent mall Several eateries are also close by 
272952,Element Amsterdam, Element is rather far from key transport stops takes a bit of time to reach the center of Amsterdam s action But if you don t mind a bit of a stroll have time to get from one point to another it s really not a big deal , This hotel feels like coming home The front desk staff are unfailingly friendly but not intrusive Room s are spacious well equipped comfortable lots of storage space clean Facilities are excellent the connecting mall with a grocery choices of restaurants is also so convenient Breakfast is a relaxed uncomplicated experience waiters don t hover around eyeing you to make sure you re even allowed to have breakfast Also the pantry is such a nice touch Loved this hotel 
272953,Element Amsterdam, none, Amazing experience nice and helpful staff clean modern rooms we had a room on 6th floor with a nice view convenient connection with the city center take tram 5 
272954,Element Amsterdam, We had slight issue with keeping the room as cool as we wanted it , Clean quiet wonderful staff Very comfortable beds This hotel is outside the city center outside the ring but is quite accessible by tram or train With Tram no 5 you can get to anywhere you want to go in 10 12 minutes From the airport to hotel by train is 20 minutes door to door Go to station Amsterdam Zuid walk for 8 minutes 
272955,Element Amsterdam, A minor issue which was easily resolved was that there were no larger cups for making tea in our room , Everything from our arrival onwards the welcome and helpfulness of all staff the room kitchenette the bed the breakfast and evening meal the roof terrace the free use of bikes the gym and location 
272956,Element Amsterdam, The hotel is new and the first impression is Wow However when I went for breakfast in the morning I was surprised to see that there was nothing to eat but bread 3rd grade cheese kind of ham and green melon Next surprise came when I returned from work at 18 30h and found out that nobody cleaned my room Well I had to be very noisy at the reception to get my room s towels changed and litter bin replaced I wish they cleaned the the floor too Vacuum cleaning technology hasn t come to this hotel yet Mop is a dirty job for a room keeper so forget it Many people commented here that the hotel has good location Maybe if you go to Amsterdam for shopping in a small mall with 10 shops or to buy cheap beer from the supermarket The reality is that the nearest metro station is 15min away fast walking and another 25 minutes ride in the train to reach the center of the city In fact I was much faster with the bike I was lucky to get from the lobby as there are only two bikes for all guests , The hotel is new good modern design moderate gym not exactly gym and rooms are well furnished I was lucky to get a bike so I really enjoyed my last day One of the guys at the reception was very responsive and polite I wish I knew his name to give him my 10 points which I cannot give to another guy that didn t know when is the check out time and a lady that was smiling when I told her I will write review for not cleaning my room at all 
272957,Element Amsterdam, Only supplied 2 capsules of coffee during my 2 night stay and did not replace lotion My complaint is with Booking com Price went 100 lower for a deluxe studio Was told if it was a studio the price could be adjusted When a lower price for the studio appeared they said no Won t book with Booking com again as prices fluctuate lower then higher then lower I booked because the prices kept going up Buyer Beware , Heavenly bed so comfortable Element Amsterdam was excellent 
272958,Element Amsterdam, As a fairly new hotel it was faultless , Excellent modern hotel with very comfortable rooms and spacious open areas The hotel is part of a very new shopping complex in Amsterdam South but is well placed for connections to the city and Schipol Airport 
272959,Element Amsterdam, Not enough bars close to location but this has nothing to do with the hotel , The reception staff are amazing the tram in to dam square is an easy 5 minute walk away The place is brand new and has everything you ll need A big shopping centre with supermarkets and fresh food outlets on your doorstep Bars are half the price in this location than in the centre I ve been to Amsterdam many a time I ve stayed at the worst hotels but also at the best Hotels This definitely ranks with the best however it is further out from the centre by quite a bit but tram is 5 minutes away but for the difference in cost then it s definitely worth staying here
272960,Element Amsterdam, We ve made our reservation several days after the hotel was open for visitors and 3 months prior our stay There were a lot of free rooms At our arrival we were surprised to find out that we could not have the rooms with 2 separate beds as we have requested The girl at the reception desk explained that booking com could not guarantee that we will receive the rooms that we have asked for and that we should have made our reservation directly with them , Comfortable beds Iron and board in the room Clean Tasty breakfast including various fresh fruits and even smoothies 
272961,Element Amsterdam, No mention of gym , Brilliant breakfast Lovely staff Room really clean Super close to a shopping centre 10 mins walk to tram which takes you all over Amsterdam 
272962,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Room was really well furnished and featured a small kitchenette area The bed was really comfortable and the room overall was really clean Breakfast was top class with lots of options and they d really gone for quality in what they were serving Not just a meat and cheese platter as there were pastries nice bread smoothies cereal etc and of course there was a meat and cheese platter 
272963,Element Amsterdam, Although breakfast choice excellent as self service breakfast area very congested and coffee machine inadequate as very slow delivering coffee This resulted in long queues Seating also insufficient resulting in people needing to stand whilst eating breakfast , Liked Suites as good size with dishwasher cooktop and microwave Liked quietness of rooms and location as part of shopping centre Breakfast choice excellent considering included in room rate Liked receptionist as took time to talk with us and arranged access to room early although hotel very busy 
272964,Element Amsterdam, Staff very slow at cleaning tables at breakfast twice we had to clear them ourselves , Stuart the barman for the restaurant and the outside patio area was fantastic nothing was too much trouble Excellent breakfast Great restaurant nearby 
272965,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast coffe machine capacity must be improved , Brand new and modern fresh look with serviceminded staff Convenient and quiet location with tram and train within walking distance Afternoon relax time with a free drink snacks nice gesture 
272966,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast should have a more diverse offer but it was tasty , The Bed was extra comfortable We hardly wanted to get up in the morning The staff was super pleasant and attentive 
272967,Element Amsterdam, For me the location was bad as it is very far from city center we had to take 2 taxis every day which was a waste of time and money , for a 4 star hotel can t expect more the hotel is new the rooms are very clean and even have a Nespresso machine in the room
272968,Element Amsterdam, Room was very poorly cleaned No clean sheets on bed despite staying for 4 nights Even the gym was not regularly cleaned , Bed was fantastic Staff very friendly and helpful 
272969,Element Amsterdam, The hotel location is far from the city center There are very limited options if you are planning late dinner 22 00 all closed The hotel facilities can be much better including TV channels And the breakfast time menubar prices menu should be reviewed by hotel management to have better grading , Staff are very friendly hotel is clean and furniture is new
272970,Element Amsterdam, They struggled to keep the room clean they had a housekeeping issue complained and got sorted, All brand new rooms are big their studios are good value for money connected to the mall and you have a lot of places to eat and shop
272971,Element Amsterdam, I have to say that the only thing that l didn t like was brekfast It is advertised as a lot of healthy options etc and l was looking forward to it but it was pretty basic and dry Some bread and cheese waffles butter There was nothing green like salad tomatoes cucumbers no mayo or red sauce There was nothing available from kichen things like omelette fried egg porridge etc The only healthy thing available was two types of smoothies but they were constantly running out Coffee wasnt great not bad but not good The staff and service at the brekfast was very slow tables were not cleaned quick enough to allow new people to be seated coffee machine was breaking up running out of food Generally people looked frustrated as they had to wait to find a clean table and queue to get some coffee etc If l would stay there again l woud not pay for brekfast as it not my type of brekfast at all The hotel is located within shopping centre there are coffee shops and food markets to buy things , The location is good it is not faraway from central area it is easy to get anywhere you want from that location You need to walk about 10 min to the train station My friend and l even managed to walk back at night 2 am from De Pijp area back to hotel it took us an hour or so but we like walking and were able to navigate back The hotel room was really good size it has everything you need the bed is very confortable and you have mini kitchen facilities if needed 
272972,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Very good position The hotel is in a mall And there are many supermarkets even a Japanese and korean one restaurants including Vietnamese Japanese and Chinese and also other stores I will choose this hotel next travel to Amsterdam Really recommend this one 
272973,Element Amsterdam, A little way out of the main tourist centre Easy to get to by public transport but requires some walking from the train tram station A directory explaining how to operate the appliances safe is needed , New clean hotel Has a small kitchenette and located near a shopping centre for self catering Very helpful front desk staff Prompt response from housekeeping for minor needs e g An extra cup assistance with operating the safe 
272974,Element Amsterdam, fire alarm goes off middle of the night due to another guest cooking in the room Probably management should give strict instructions to guests, everything was comfortable 
272975,Element Amsterdam, Not so central so didn t provide any special view also bit expensive , Very modern spacious hotel with great facilities I loved the breakfast friendly staff and comfortable bed Gym was also a plus although there could also be a sauna The fact that it was placed in a shopping mall was a great idea too one could easily buy something and unload in his room directly Also Cable TV with Programs in English 
272976,Element Amsterdam, Somehow far from the city center but good tram connection to Dam square , Smart studios with a small kitchen inside The breakfast Hall was really nice Very confortable We had a great time there 
272977,Element Amsterdam, Breakfast area is too small When choosing Breakfast you have to be prepared to get knocked into , friendly and helpful staff very bright and cheerful Hotel
272978,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, Lovely hotel Perfect for a short break Rooms were lovely very comfortable and clean Food was lovely too The only thing was it was a bit out of the way from the city centre It was about a 10 minute walk to the tram and then about 20 minute to half an hour journey on the tram depending on where you wanted to go This being said I think I will stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending it too friends and family 
272979,Element Amsterdam, NOTHING, the bed was phemonal staff excellent location near mall d cor kitchen area in room wonderful i was flustered at check in but staff were very polite
272980,Element Amsterdam, A little out of town but there are good transport links tram or metro round the corner And it s really not too far to walk to the centre on a nice day 2 5 miles , Great facilities in room with USB charging sockets and impressive kitchen facilities including a dishwasher if you want to cook a meal Comfy king size bed Delicious breakfast including lots of Dutch delights such as meats cheeses and waffles 
272981,Element Amsterdam, nothing it was perfect, very nice staff good location there are trams close by and a shopping cente with great restaurants room was very clean and had everything we needed
272982,Element Amsterdam, The breakfast lacked healthy options No porridge and no greens berries No omelette either When I asked for greens I got a plate full of rucola with pesto Strange No natural yoghurt just hard and stiff quark One morning I asked for natural yoghurt and eventually got it the other day the same member of the staff told me that quark was yoghurt That was strange and funny They should do something about airconditioning it turned on automatically every morning even though I had turned it off and I got sick as always do with aircon The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we were forced to go out Reason a couple had prepared food and burned something Maybe the stoves should be automatically turned off at 10 PM Too small trash can Recycling for paper and bottles but why not for bio waste Small adjustments nearly perfect hotel , Neat and clean new hotel Super nice personnel Quiet room nice little kitchen and functional stylish bathroom Liked the furniture and modern air of the hotel Not too far from the city although 10 minute walk to the tram stop 20 minute tramride seemed a bit long 
272983,Element Amsterdam, The hotel was a bit far away from the city centre We spent two nights in this hotel and we was frightened by two fire alarms The first one in the 9PM on Friday and the second on Saturday s midnight We were really frightened that something happened but the alarm starts because of too hot showers Hotel stuff apologized but still it was very disturbing , Hotel s king size bed is the most comfortable bed we ve ever slept in The room was comfy Hotel stuff was very friendly polite and helpfull Breakfast was very tasty 
272984,Element Amsterdam,No Negative, This was a really excellent stay Stayed in their basic studio and it was spacious clean well appointed The bed was one of the most comfortable I ve slept on in a long time And the small kitchen makes it feel quite homey Perfect for a business trip 
272985,Element Amsterdam, Well location is a problem This hotel is far away from the city where the museums and the attractions are There should be more advice about how to get about by trams to the city The advertised bicycles did not exist which was a disappointment The restaurant in the hotel was lovely but have to say the portions were too small I had been travelling from Finland and had been on the road plus than 12 hours and I was hungry I did not return to this restaurant for that reason even that the food was lovely and service good I just needed more value for money Breakfast was full of low nutrition white wheat products rolls waffles etc which I do not regard as healthy food Maybe serve more foods which are not just white flour and sugar Coffee was good and the cold cuts Some salad and scrambled organic eggs would have been nice There were multiple false fire alarms during my stay which were quite annoying Out of the bed in the middle of the night is not my idea of relaxing hotel night Still thank goodness the alarms were false , Lovely and stylish place friendly staff Loved the gymnasium Excellent bed lovely kitchenette in the room loved the decor throughout the hotel especially the wooden floors Also the fact the hotel is pet friendly is a plus 
272986,Element Amsterdam, Parking although it is in a mall and they are negotiating with the mall to have use of their car park facilities I am disabled with a blue card so I was able to park across the road but you can use the car park to unload as there is an entrance to the hotel in there and then you can park a couple of minutes walk away at Frieslandstraat Accessible bathroom I would have liked to have seen a fold up seat in there as I cannot use my own wheelchair in the shower I suggested to the staff that they may wish to review the heavy sliding mirrored door to the wet room difficult enough for my able bodied daughter to open someone with dexterity problems would have a nightmare of a time opening and closing it I have a little gripe about the food Don t get me wrong the food is superb even though the menu is fairly limited it is super quality food My gripe is that after a busy day travelling or sightseeing one is tired and hungry The beautifully presented food is very chic and therein lies the problem I think The portions are too small Starters are 6 50 Euros and mains are 12 50 Euros I wouldn t mind paying a little more and having a bigger meal , The hotel is brand new only opened 2 weeks ago and superb I was given a wheelchair accessible room on the second floor Lift access is excellent spacious studio apartment with full facilities including induction hob nespresso machine toaster full size undercounter fridge dishwasher all pots and pans crockery and cutlery some rooms have a microwave There is a well lit wardrobe with a pull down rail It also houses an iron ironing board an electronic safe and a suitcase frame Large TV with cable channels including BBC and Sky both Dutch and English speaking channels The wet room is bright and modern with both a rain and conventional shower head plenty large enough to fit a wheelchair in with room to spare The toilet has support frames installed too which can be folded up for able bodied use Wash handbasin is there too The kingsize bed is incredibly comfortable with a clock radio alarm on the bedside Lots of storage space The memory foam mattress is a dream and the bedlinen is crisp and clean Pets are welcome 12 50 euros per pet per night My cat was very comfortable There is also a gym although I did not partake of the facilities so cannot comment on that No swimming pool The staff at the hotel are fantastic Nothing is too much trouble Although there is no room service they go out of their way to help Breakfast was included in our tariff Its a buffet style in the restaurant on the 1st floor Oh my what a spread Superb You name it they have it and some The trams are good here and you can get one from virtually outside the door to the centre of Amsterdam with no problem Wifi is super fast reliable and free in all rooms There is also a computer in the lobby area for guests to use With tax the accessible double room for my daughter and myself for two nights Friday and Saturday Feb 2016 cost me just short of 200 Euros More money than I usually spend but a lovely new hotel 
272987,Element Amsterdam, The plates glasses cups and cutlery used during breakfast were not clean The first teacup I grabbed had a lipstick stain on it the first plate some unidentifiable stain Gross The cold drinks during breakfast were also below average the orange juice was undrinkable the rest bad the hot drinks were served in thermos bottles that were wrongly labeled Refilling both foods and beverages during breakfast was also done very poorly , The size of the room and the facilities in the room were great the bed was enormous and very comfortable
