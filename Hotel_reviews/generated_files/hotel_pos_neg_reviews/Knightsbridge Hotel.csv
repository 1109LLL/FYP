17949,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Great location super staff and good value for money 
17950,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Design
17951,Knightsbridge Hotel, Lack of window dressing in the bathroom felt a bit weird Had a piece of opaque glass which covered 80 of the window but didn t feel that comfortable having a shower so put a towel over the other part of the window , The hotel has a really nice feel about it It s not too big and so feels cosy The other guests seem normal too and the staff weren t up themselves Lovely and clean and beautiful food 
17952,Knightsbridge Hotel, Nothing, This is a lovely boutique hotel in the Knightsbridge area Fifth time we stayed here Decor of rooms is excellent Comfortable beds and we had a magnificent bathroom Excellent food serviced for breakfast lunch or dinner
17953,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly service team relaxed yet elegant and efficient The shower is one of the best I have experienced in London with great water pressure Harrods is literally around the corner I d definitely stay here again 
17954,Knightsbridge Hotel, We ordered some beverage items to be sent up to the rooms They never arrived so we had to re order Not impressed , A smart room excellent bed and air con that worked efficiently during very hot weather Polite and helpful staff 
17955,Knightsbridge Hotel, The room that you could eat your breakfast in was far too small for a busy hotel so we had breakfast in our suite which was lovely but if I had to gripe it was slightly uncomfortable perched on a sofa and bending down onto a coffee table, Very light and spacious
17956,Knightsbridge Hotel, Nothing in regards the hotel although now I know there are no front facing deluxe rooms I would reserve a different room type next time Its also a bit expensive in our view but at least you know that up front , The location the fact it is not a huge hotel so you are treated more as a person rather than a number the d cor in the rooms and the fact each one is different the type of building its a relaxing place to stay amongst the bustle of London 
17957,Knightsbridge Hotel, Nothing to say , Location and and comfort of the hotel was really excellent Drawing room and Library were nice place to chat with someone and or have some tea They don t have any restaurants in their hotel but they have 24h room services We didn t use the service for meal so I can t make any comment for that 
17958,Knightsbridge Hotel, All I wanted after a very long flight from Australia was a cup of tea room service was prompt however quite expensive Although it maybe common to have a kettle in the room it had all the other comforts you would find so being able to make a cup of tea would have been perfect It was however Served in a beautiful pot so I guess that made up for it On two occasions we other guests were asked to leave the drawing room so that a guest could interview someone seemed rather inconvenient Overall good , Gorgeous interiors Fairly unsuitable for children unless of course you are booking a seperate room Great bathroom products 
17959,Knightsbridge Hotel, The public rooms always seemed to be totally occupied by the same guests it really didn t allow for us to enjoy them very much , The room was lovely with a lovely view and the bathroom was great I loved that at almost 11 00 PM we were able to get sandwiches that were freshly made and delivered promptly to two very hungry people 
17960,Knightsbridge Hotel, There is nothing I didn t like about this hotel , I liked the quaint cozy atmosphere and the two sitting rooms Much different from a large hotel I definitely prefer this beautiful eclectic upscale boutique hotel to any of the large luxury hotels I have stayed in The staff was friendly and accommodating but not intrusive just very professional 
17961,Knightsbridge Hotel, Although breakfasts were good for the most part room service choices were limited and extremely bland and flavourless , Superb location lovely staff and great interior design 
17962,Knightsbridge Hotel, I think the reception is very simple compared to the over all interior of the hotel, The cuisine and service is good I stayed at the Junior Suite color Green and i found the layout of the ro perfect with 3 big windows
17963,Knightsbridge Hotel, However I was so disappointed at the size of the hotel and the lack of facilities i e A proper restaurant or bar I have stayed at the Charlotte Street Hotel on numerous occasions and to be honest was expecting similar facilities , The staff were highly trained and very pleasant 
17964,Knightsbridge Hotel, Breakfast was good but should be included in price But apart from that all good , Bed was really comfortable hotel was easy to get too staff were polite and helpful 
17965,Knightsbridge Hotel, The rooms are quite compact and therefore eating breakfast which is served in the room is a bit awkward Breakfast was not as hot as it might be if they had a restaurant , Comfy bed 
17966,Knightsbridge Hotel, No heating in very large bathroom radiator not working staff informed rectified but still remained very cold eventually moved to larger room Breakfast was very slow no dinning room taken in lounge area , Beautiful boutique Hotel 
17967,Knightsbridge Hotel, The bed in our room was very high unusually high but comfortable The room was not very big either Adequate for our one night stay , Boutique style hotel with lovely decor Very near the shops in Knightsbridge Very kindly called us a taxi to our venue when we needed one 
17968,Knightsbridge Hotel, Can t think of anything, Slept like a log Definately one of the best hotels I have ever used Superb decor absolutely spotless and attentive but unobtrusive staff 
17969,Knightsbridge Hotel, Correcting the breakfast bill with staff still ringing to check our order Staff adding a continental breakfast We had a great time but this soured the experience a bit , The Breakfast arrived later than the allocated time It was very nice but items were left off what we originally ordered When we went to reception to checkout we found they had added another continental breakfast this made the bill skyrocket A word of advice try not to forget anything left in your room no matter how small as you will be charged for a stamp 
17970,Knightsbridge Hotel, I had an incident where an employee barged into my room when I had a do not disturb sign on at 6 a m This made me jump out of my bed scared for dear life I obviously called the front desk asking for an explanation and they simply replied that they have been told of the incident by the employee who mixed up the rooms and they have informed the manager A couple of days pass and I hear nothing from them I called the manager and asked if she knew what happened she confirmed and simply said that the employee needed to be reminded of what a do not disturb sign meant I mean I would appreciate it more if they have done more than just saying that I don t know send a free fruit basket whatever it is it is hard for me to fall asleep in general and then someone barges in without even knocking it really frightened me and of course couldn t go back to sleep , spacious room room service is pretty quick nice location 
17971,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, everything was amazing staff helpful room divine bed so comfortable shower and bathroom faultless location quiet relaxing atmosphere and breakfast perfect
17972,Knightsbridge Hotel, A rather small back of house bedroom which was either boiling hot or feeeziing cold depending on whether you wanted to be in air con fug or have the window open Breakfast in the sitting room had very slow service with one poor waitress trying her best , Location decoration
17973,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is perfectly located for shopping and long walks The rooms are gorgeous we stayed in a jr suite loved it Nothing is a problem for the warm helpful staff A real homey cosy restful feeling here 
17974,Knightsbridge Hotel, it wasn t possible to switch off the extraction in our bathroom I personally didn t hear a thing but my partner is a very light sleeper , lovely staff extremely nice and very helpful excellent showers very comfortable beds interior design colorful and cosy and at the same time exceptionally tasteful
17975,Knightsbridge Hotel, The English breakfast was disappointing in that it was undercooked to the point that we both sent it back To be fair we weren t charged for it but as we were only there for one night and we both really enjoy our food and look forward to a cooked breakfast when away it was a disappointing finale to the trip, Room was clean and comfortable
17976,Knightsbridge Hotel, There is always a smell in the bathrooms Since before I arrived I asked for a late check out COZ my plane was late THEY didnt LET me stay too long , THE LOCATION AND THE STAFF
17977,Knightsbridge Hotel, The breakfast was a set charge of 20 so very expensive if all you want is a hot drink and a pastry , The staff were so welcoming and the hotel was absolutely perfect and felt so comfortable and inviting The room although small it was a single was a delight and the bathroom fantastic 
17978,Knightsbridge Hotel, i was booked at the lower floor as I have requested for twin beds The architect of the beautiful hotel should be penalised for not installing a sound proof flooring All the movements at the lounge can be heard in my room and when the cleaners came to vacuum the lounge at 430 am it woke me up every morning of my 3 day stay Everything else was perfect, The room was very large and has a gorgeous bathroom and the save the best baguette for breakfast
17979,Knightsbridge Hotel, Room service menu can be better with additional plates, Checked all room types recommend each in terms of space storage space and interior design by Kit Kemp Very good location in a silent street Nice lobby and friendly staff Value per m2 is optimum when compared to other hotels in the same range MS Food and Waitrose are at 3 min walk
17980,Knightsbridge Hotel, Compared to other places I stayed in Europe the price is still high although the pound dropped in value, Excellent room service all staff very helpful and friendly The size of the room 
17981,Knightsbridge Hotel, Breakfast was poor best option to eat out at many of the cafes in the area and internet was slow Avoid room in the basement because you will wake up early with people walking in the livingroom above where breakfast is served , Large and well decorated room nice bed large flat screen tv Staff very friendly Overall very cosy and comfortable hotel 
17982,Knightsbridge Hotel, nothing the staff were wonderful and very helpful and the location was the best , the little extra touches like complimentary chocolate and room spray which were delivered to the door and the shower was fabulous 
17983,Knightsbridge Hotel, AS IN YOUR HOME YOU WILL FIND NO GYM NO POOL SERVICE WAS GOOD BUT NOT AMAZING WHICH YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A VERY SMALL HOTEL SUCH AS THIS , THE HOTEL FEELS LIKE A HOME AND IS VERY COSY
17984,Knightsbridge Hotel, I feel it was all perfect , The friendly and very helpful staff was a pleasure the cleanliness of our room superb and just the overall feel of the hotel was great 
17985,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Great location in the middle of everything yet quite and cozy customer oriented and professional staff clean and v nicely decorated room in room spa services Highly recommended and would definitely stay in the Knightsbridge hotel again 
17986,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Beautiful decor Individually designed rooms with very comfortable beds Convenient location in an interesting area Close to tube and bus transport 
17987,Knightsbridge Hotel, Unfortunately a lot of things But most importantly There are security issues with the hotel During my first night a housekeeper just barged into the room unannounced and unapologetic about it while I was sleeping Given that this is not a standard practice of any hotel esp that they should always knock before they enter things got worse The last day of my check out they checked in a guest into one of my rooms I booked two at 10 AM BEFORE I check out I even entered the room thinking it was still mine with my key and found the new guest already sleeping on the bed and shocked when they saw me come into the room That was completely absurd and never heard of especially in a supposedly 5 star hotel When I checked into this hotel twice I was given the rooms after 4pm so to actually check in a guest into an unchecked room before 10AM was a rip off to me To make things even worse after at least 15 minutes of arguing with the manager about it they were not taking responsibility he did not apologize for this until I demanded an apology I have never ever seen such unprofessional behavior of staff ever in any of my travels around the world and in any hotels I have been to I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone Other things worth mentioning rooms are the smallest I have seen out of all the hotels I have been in London Breakfast was very limited and dull Sometimes it was a little challenging getting a taxi to the hotel , The location was good The design of the interiors was beautiful designed by the famous Kit Kemp The attention to details in terms of design was notable 
17988,Knightsbridge Hotel, 1 Room is very small You can hardly move around it with very little soace around the bid 2 Small tight corridors for a 5 star rated hotel 3 For 312 per night you d expect some kind of a veiw What we got is view at a brick wall seriously We were told the street view is for other type of rooms with higher rates 4 Flat TV is too small , Staff is very nice and polite Room service cleaning was superb They have cleaned our room twice in one day Bathroom and toiletry Rik Rak is fabilious You can really enjoy a shower 
17989,Knightsbridge Hotel, The house cleaning service is not the best The maid did not organise the items in the bathroom neatly and the maids did not stack up my magazine and other items nicely Also I think for a 5 Star hotel it should have a coffee machine free tea bags for customer , The hotel is quiet and the suite is nice 
17990,Knightsbridge Hotel, Staffs are not helpful Out of my 3 nights stay and probably 7 8 different Staffs I have encountered day and night There are only 1 lady at front desk and 2 gentlemen helping me with luggages are nice The rest is either cold or not helpful at all , I like the deco cleaness and the high quality amenity the boutique use 
17991,Knightsbridge Hotel, Size of the room very small The cost doesn t justify the size of the room The hotel also doesn t have a proper restaurant although there are options nearby , Location friendly staff clean boutique 
17992,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff very comfortable rooms and though they dont have a restaurant the food from the kitchen is top notch Best english breakfast ive had 
17993,Knightsbridge Hotel,No Negative, The Staff were incredibly helpful and nice My Mother and I stayed for 3 nights we loved the relaxed comfortable environment The location was excellent I would highly recommend for all ages 
17994,Knightsbridge Hotel, It would be helpful to have a larger bottle of water in the room , Delicous breakfast eggs cooked perfectly served in record time Very good and hot tea extremely friendly and helpful staff at reception Will definitely stay here again and recommend to others Great location in middle of Knightsbridge which still manages to offer very peaceful rooms with no noise from traffic 
17995,Knightsbridge Hotel, The room was very small Decently appointed but very small The minibar pricing was even mote outrageous than normal , The staff was exceptionally attentive 
17996,Knightsbridge Hotel, As it was only a Saturday night stay in the hotel it was difficult to find any negatives If the stay was longer we are sure we would of struggled to find anything We will return without doubt next time we fancy a night up town , Classy hotel with very friendly staff that made us feeel very welcome on our arrival We normally stay in larger hotels but we loved the upmarket boutique feel of the Knightsbridge Hotel We did not spend a huge amount of time in the hotel but we were made to feel very special during our short stay 
17997,Knightsbridge Hotel, Price could have been better wasn t cheap, Bed was very comfy but the staff were an asset to the hotel very helpful and warming and did their upmost to meet our needs
17998,Knightsbridge Hotel, Really would have liked a kettle in the room for early morning cup of tea The rooms were rather small but everything was there , Very comfortable hotel in peaceful location and the service was excellent very attentive staff Nothing was too much trouble for them
