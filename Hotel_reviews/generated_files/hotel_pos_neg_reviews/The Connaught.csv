297114,The Connaught, if i knew there was renovations going on to the main setting area i wouldn t stayed there , the staff are super helpful and friendly the room is clean and equipped with every thing you need 
297115,The Connaught, Nothing, Oozes class and style great spot in Mayfair rooms are great and could have stayed in shower all day long If you are feeling decadent then don t consider anywhere else 
297116,The Connaught, Reception was chaotic at the check in They did honour our request for a quiet room but we later found that the maid room service store was across from our room so very noisy in the morning and late nights Service at the tea room was good at the start but waned between shifts , Location and cleanliness decoration were great Service at the start was great at breakfast and tea They sent a cake up for my wife s birthday which was a nice touch We saw a celebrity when we arrived so that s a good start
297117,The Connaught,No Negative, The pure definition of luxury discretion sophistication and elegance The rooms are perfect and the amenities are amazing Right in the middle of Mayfaire The Connaught has the best location for a shopping trip 
297118,The Connaught, Nothing, The best hotel I have ever stayed in the care and attention taken by all staff was beyond what I expected The whole hotel was magnificent and I will certainly be staying here again 
297119,The Connaught, As an architect I looked at my stay with an analytical eye When I arrived at my room on the third floor of the modern wing the first thing that struck me was that the hallway with the cupboards is too narrow People want space to open their suitcases but not on the bed where I would never think to put them as they would soil the duvet The desk may be too long Perhaps make it shorter to provide a bench for opening suitcases In fact make it a double decker so that a lighter suitcase can be lifted to the upper shelf The marble in the bathroom was lovely but the mastic used to seal the seams completely undoes any aesthetic gesture We do not use SO MUCH of it in the US There must be some alternative to stem any damaging leaking The fancy multi buttoned toilet really isn t necessary In fact to me it seemed a joke and a little vulgar If someone discovers that these toilets stem disease then I ll rethink it One sink tap was broken and the awful puny rectangular handle design made both taps hard to turn Comfort comfort comfort The shower could have been smaller to accommodate a wider hallway as indicated previously I would have preferred a tub with a shower head but realize that I probably should have asked for one Lastly all bathrooms can never have too many hooks and towel bars for wet towels etc Many guests will want to rinse out the odd garment I suppose there are a few who will pay the relatively exorbitant prices for the laundry service but I think a relatively inexpensive laundry service would be a huge draw to an untapped clientele Today s inexpensive low water front loaders would allow for all sizes of requests Of course if a predominantly short stay business hotel it may not be worth it My view was of mechanical equipment which should be camouflaged better It s a big letdown to see them The breakfast lounge should be more colorful or another kind of subdued It looks boring to me , I loved the bed I loved the quiet My dinner in the breakfast lounge was delicious as was my breakfast The restaurant and bars into which I peaked after dinner looked terrific with a stylish nighttime ambiance 
297120,The Connaught, The manager in the bar was not very welcoming nor friendly when we arrived for a drink so that was a pitty , Almost everything in this hotel is a pleasure
297121,The Connaught, Nothing was a disappointment things could not have been better for us, staff behaviours excellent attentive but not overbearing The quality of food excellent the fixtures and fittings excellent the ambiance excellent
297122,The Connaught, That we wanted to extend our stay with 2 days and had to pay double the price per night so we decided to change the hotel which was too bad as we really loved the hotel ,No Positive
297123,The Connaught, Almost impossible to have a bad experience here, Extremely personal attention to every guest To paraphrase a famous quotation about London When a man is tired of The Connaught then he is tired of life 
297124,The Connaught, Bemused by an additional discretionary service charge of 26 added to bill did not notice this until after I had checked out So I advise checking the bill carefully before checkout , Good location but room overlooked scaffolding building site Attentive staff
297125,The Connaught,No Negative, A very traditional grand hotel but with subtle modern touches Lovely relaxing spa and pool area in the basement which is much needed after a day of shopping on nearby Old Bond Street Breakfast was excellent with large portions expertly prepared Cocktails in the Connaught bar is definitely a must followed by exceptional meal in the Helen Darroze restaurant Would also highly recommend Espelette which is the more relaxed restaurant but food quality was outstanding and again good portion sizes 
297126,The Connaught, The main French restaurant was closed, The location The hotels history The bar We felt like we had stepped back in time No hustle or bustle of London just a back street gem
