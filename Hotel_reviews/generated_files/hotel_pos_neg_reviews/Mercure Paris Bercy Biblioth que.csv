218303,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, The breakfast spread was very limited and only two people was managing the whole crowd which led to delay in serving the customers We had to wait for cutlery food items every time However those two staffs were very efficient and running around for things but more staff is needed to manage the breakfast chaos The location is also on different, The staff was very courteous room was clean and the size of the room was also good 
218304,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, I was given a room with the view of the brick wall across the road I asked for a better view given it was a short stay travelling from Australia but was told I would have to pay 20 extra on top of paying top dollar for the booking This was disappointing as the hotel shows river views online not brick walls Customer service was therefore lacking My quilt cover had blood on it There was only one complementary drink so had to ask for the other As an Accor member I wasn t impressed , Mecure is always well maintained and has new rooms fixtures and fittings So you can always be sure that you have a working fridge The hotel is right next to the rail service No 6 so has a speedy service into and around Paris 
218305,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Room was freezing window wide open when we got there safe in the room was broken reported it 4pm on Friday still not fixed by the time we left Sunday had to go around all weekend with passports on us It was raining all weekend and when we went back to the hotel room you couldn t even warm up as there s no heating working We will never use again, Nothing
218306,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, It was a little too far out the centre But obviously this is my error for not doing my research properly, The hotel was lovely and staff were very helpful The metro was literally outside too 
218307,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, via booking com my package included Free Parking and breakfast When I arrived at the Mercure their records stated Breakfast 18 per person and Parking 22 per day were Not Included Furthermore water was to be provided in the fridge in my room again Not Included 478 for 2 nights ROOM ONLY crazy money even for Paris The staff at the hotel probably students were Not helpful whatsoever Asked on our fist day where was the closed attractions and how to get there Was told on you left about 15mins walk was the Notre Dame Paris NOTHING ELES Took about 40mins to walk there in 34 degree heat Ask about where was the closest ATM machine told across the bridge on your left again no sign of it Staff would want to take out a map and get familiar with Paris ,No Positive
218308,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Nothing it was great, The overall environment was very comfortable friendly and conducive to a wonderful stay in Paris The location was ideal for us to get to the concert at the Accor hotel Arena as well as easy access to the Batobus which we used all the time 
218309,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, I came to the breakfast room at 10 10 and was denied entrance because it was too late I was offered a plain platter to go and requested to take my breakfast elsewhere Since nowhere was stated that breakfast was only until 10 and I ordered it ahead it was quite disappointing Only a small soap in the bathroom TV jaggy almost unusable and Wifi very slow Overall this was IMO really overpriced 250 for the night with breakfast , Room was quiet and clean Staff at the desk was kind and helpful 
218310,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, nothing, The staff were great thanks to Sarah we found some amazing restaurants they helped us find our way everywhere could not have done it without them 
218311,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, The room was a little bit small There wasn t any place to hang towels in the bathroom There was just shampoo which was also used for body gel no conditioner etc In the minibar there was just one water , It was close to the river we walked to Rue Cremiux It was very close The gar was also very close We used Uber but think it can be advantageous It was a very clean hotel 
218312,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, The key card failed to open the door of the room on most occasions so that I had to go down again to ask for it to be activated each time again The shower cabin is too small although bathroom is generally OK and very clean , Very clean very friendly staff non tourist area good cosy brasserie all day nearly next door 
218313,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, This is more of a nice to have metro maps in the lobby or at the desk would be nice , The staff made it amazing They were accommodating when we arrived giving a welcoming that is to be desired The staff were patient and helpful with all our questions even helping us understand the maps and marking down our plans on them There was no feelings of being rushed through any of the process from check in that left everyone approachable which is important And as one was busy another person would hop out take take of others and another would hop out of the office to as though they are just ready to help people The impression did not wane even to the day of check out they were helpful As the first impression to Paris they set the tone right 
218314,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Didn t have a restaurant inside of the hotel but there was plenty near by Lights in the room not so bright so for example you can do your make up only in the bathroom Also noise coming from the hallway and the doors are like papers We could hear everything they were saying in the room opposite to ours Maybe could be better soundproof system inside the hotel otherwise all good Didn t mind the tv only with french programs but someone might , Wonderful location just right next to the Accorhotels arena and next to the metro station easy way to the city and train station near by Supermarket just across the road and also few restaurants near by Breakfast was amazing even though a bit expensive Comfortable and big beds good pillows good aircon 
218315,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, THE BREAKFAST IS 18 00 IT IS TOO HIGH IN COMPARISON WITH TWO BARS AND STARBUCKS 500 METERS WHERE YOU CAN MAKE A VERY GOOD BREAKFAST IN TWO PERSONS AT THE SAME PRICE , IT IS VERY CLOSE 10 METERS TO QUAI DE LA GARE METRO STATION THERE ARE TWO BARS AND ONE SHOP TO BUY SOMETHING FAST TO EAT BAGUETTES CROISSANTS MUFFINS BY WALKING NOTRE DAME IS ONLY 1 KM FAR FROM HOTEL ROOM IS LITTLE BUT COMFY AND CLEAN IT IS IDEAL TO STAY IN PARIS ONLY FOR QUICK SHOWER AND SLEEP 
218316,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Nothing, Everything was superb from the premium room with added comforts and amazing soundproofing to the delicious choice of breakfast Being able to park the car undergound in a secure car park was incredibly helpful All the staff were very friendly and and our special request to be able to leave our car in the car park for more than the 24 hours we paid for at no extra charge just added that extra care which made our stay just perfect 
218317,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que,No Negative, The hotel is next to the metro station The staff are very friendly and helpful Room is very clean with good wifi connection The area around the hotel is very convenient with nice restaurants The breakfast is very good also 
218318,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, We ate meals from room service a couple of times it wasn t great the cheese and meat platter was really good but the other meals were overcomplicated and would have been much better if they d kept it simpler The bistro just up the road on the corner was fantastic , The bed was comfy the room was very warm but once we found the valve and turned the radiator off it was much better We visited for a concert at the Accor Hotels arena so the location was absolutely perfect 
218319,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, We haven t got any complaints , The staff were very friendly and helpful brought a cot up to the room 5 minutes after check in for my daughter They spoke really good English and were so pleasant The location was brilliant only 25 minutes from Gare De Nore station and the metro stop is directly opposite the hotel so you can get anywhere you need to There is also a shop opposite and some lovely cafes which we ate in shortly after arriving Also worth a visit is Bercy village which is a 10 15 minute walk away Next time we are in Paris we will definitely stay here again Our 2 year old loved it 
218320,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, This is the first time of my checkin experience that doesn t require IDs If this happens to every customer and every checkin procedure I would be concerned about the security of this hotel , Friendly stuff
218321,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, a hotel that I cannot fault , The hotel was immaculate the rooms were spacious and comfortable and the staff were very welcoming and professional This has been one of my best hotels of Paris The location also cannot be better 
218322,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, A bit loud outside metro busy street won t be able to sleep with an open window With closed window ok , Enough space rare for Paris Good breakfast very rare for Paris Rather new nice design of rooms Large comfortable bed Metro food supermarket just 2 steps away Quite helpful staff showed us several room options so that we could choose ordered a taxi at night organized food boxes instead of breakfast 
218323,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Facility is normal very far between the hotel and some visiting points probably I would like taking taxi Very pool shower staffs housekeeping is a bit rude and never fill in free water Attitude is normal and room is normal And towels are dirty , Everything is normal and average 
218324,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, , Just perfect I have been in many hotels in Paris and for that price it s luxury Friendly staff clean good condition well isolated and just in front of a tube station You have also a nice restaurant in the corner with great food 
218325,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que,No Negative, Very good breakfast althought fresh vegetables i e tomatoes were missing Soundproof windows large bed close to metro and nice restaurant just few steps away
218326,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, They messed up our reservation We had booked 3 double rooms but when we got there the reception said there is only 1 double room available and offered us a suite with 2 double beds Problem is there is no privacy for the 4 people who stayed in that room It s very disappointing and we suspect the hotel has overbooked as there were 2 bus loads of Chinese tourists who checked in after us Surprisingly they had no room issues The air conditioning of our rooms including the suite was not working Overall a poor experience , The staff were polite and helpful The location is fairly good as the metro is located opposite the hotel
218327,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Shower is ridiculously small could hardly turned around without bumping into the walls It is meant for 2 people but room not big enough Too expensive for the size, The staff was nice proximity of the tube station room was clean
218328,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Buzzing your way into the entrance was a nightmare when staff were elsewhere but the reception Cleaners kept coming in every day regardless of the do not disturb sign , Clean and tidy 
218329,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, The lady at the reception desk lidia was rude She lacks any insight of her poor communication skills with customers The room is very small The window view is awful , Opposite to metro station
218330,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, I would have given full points for the staff if the cleaning lady wouldn t have been so unfriendly They had difficulties in filling up the breakfast and sometimes it was a bit crowded in the breakfast room Nevertheless the breakfast was good and they offer room service for breakfast which we didn t use So they have an alternative , The receptionists were really nice and helpful Rooms were quiet they have double windows so when the windows are closed you don t hear any noise from the traffic and the bed was very comfortable and big For us the location was perfect as it was very close to the train stations Gare de Lyon and Austerlitz around 15 mins walk They don t have a restaurant but the restaurant next door serves really good food 
218331,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Express Breakfast policy was not clear but they do have option for this which cost 8 Euro each, Bed was very comfortable Room was very clean This is more of 3 star hotel than 4 star
218332,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, On the first day there was no coffee in the room and on the second day there was no milk Otherwise it was wonderful , The bed was very comfortable with 2 types of pillows a harder a softer one which we really liked I also enjoyed the coffee machine in the room

218337,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Hotel does not have air conditioning I was told it will be fixed after two weeks But it s possible they just say it all the time Dodgy looking people congregate the street on the side of the hotel especially after dark , Hotel is located next to metro stop Room was clean well equipped Standard breakfast Comfy bed 
218338,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, It is not made clear on the description that this hotel is permantly secured Even during the day and you have to be buzzed in due to people congregating in the area shouting and fighting all night in the road right below the hotel Parking is unsecure and on the road , The rooms were comfy clean and the bathrooms were clean and spacious 
218339,Mercure Paris Bercy Biblioth que, Hotel s door always closed to get in you have to ring the bell and the person on desk open the door sometimes this person in the back office which leaves you out until he came , good breakfast close to the metro station
