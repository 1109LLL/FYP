175683,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London Marble Arch, The room was worn and one wall was very dirty At first I thought it was a crack in the wall when I gave a closer look later in the day I realized that it was built up dust so thick that formed a dark line down the wall The shower had high tub side walls that were a bit high to step over when getting into and out of the shower The tub itself was a bit narrow on the inside to use as a shower You had to be extremely careful moving around while showering Finally the paperwork in the room referred to afternoon tea complements of the hotel held everyday in the lounge When my wife and I showed up for the tea the staff didn t know what we were talking about Lastly getting luggage in and out of the hotel was a challenge because of the stairs A porter would have been nice, Location was good Some of the staff were informative
