496065,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The Breakfast could offer more kind of bread whole bread rye turkey breast and cheese cream cheese cheddar For those who do not eat pork it is not cool to see 4 types of pork salami Also all cakes taste the same No honey and only one jam , We were really satisfied with our chosen Hotel Public Transport is not far away and gave us the opportunity to explore the City Clean and modern room The reception also offered us cheap tickets for the gym spa next door but we did not go 
496066,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, very good experience Modern rooms clean nice people at the reception and in the bar breakfast area Very low rates close to the metropolitan 200 m 
496067,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No electric kettles in the room hence no complimentary hot beverages Unfortunately came across a number of unfriendly receptionists Inconsistent professionalism and politeness Gestures made can often found be very rude almost felt like we were a burden to them This quality of service left a very bad impression and severely impacted our willingness to come back to this hotel therefore would not recommend friends and family to consider their stay here Considering it being a 4 star hotel and in comparison to other 4 star hotels services and facilities are not up to the standards Therefore another downside to this is the poor value of money Hotel lacked variety in dishes served for breakfast Limited vegetatrian vegan options , Satisfactory cleanliness Good location In walking distance to the nearest metro station 
496068,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The breakfast was abit basic but for a quick bite before a day exploring the city it was fine , The hotel was modern and fresh and the staff were very helpful We preferred being slightly out of the main hustle and bustle of Milan and would recommend this place to other travellers We enjoyed having a few drinks in the bar in the evening but would have liked abit of background music This hotel was also close to the tube station under 10 min walk which was a perfect way to get in and out of the city 
496069,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room is quite small the window is blocked so there s not enough air be aware that 5 per person will be charged additionally to your booking travel tax wi fi was sometimes poor, Good location 150m to subway station friendly staff clear and new room free parking near the hotel if you manage to find a vacant place 
496070,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There was no parking available at the hotel for some reason but should be as says my reservation we had to change our room because it was too small not remodeled The Personnel was very customer oriented and gave us a better option , Location hotel staff breakfast was ok

496078,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Only details We would appreciate hard boiled or fried eggs and sausages for breakfast the warm meals range was quite small The towels were changed every day and every time there was one towel missing , The hotel is really modern and clean the staff was very kind and helpful The location is great too just a few minute walk from the Bignami metro station and also from two huge shopping centres one to the south one to the north where you can buy dinner and enjoy a drink or two Even though our room was right opposite the elevators there was not much noise coming from the hallway so nothing disturbed us during the night Great range of sweet stuff for breakfast three types of croissants and many cakes all of them delicious 
496079,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, This is good very comfortable hotel outside the city centre but only a 5 minute walk from the metro and about 20 minutes from the city centre by metro Only stayed here to attend a concert nearby but the hotel was fine Room was very nice and staff were great 
496080,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, For 4 stars hotel absolutely poor breakfast At 9am NO instant juice from automat available and personal only says it is not our problem we have no more but you can by juice at bar per 2EUR No musli which is absolutely standard available only some choco balls Mixed eggs was not only from eggs but with some substitute probably water no taste resp terrible taste Breakfast was very big disappointment Personal on reception incompetent They get smiles all around but do nothing We should have Genius 2hrs check in When we came to hotel and check in desk At first she didn t find us in computer Then he told us the room will be available after 30 minutes Ok we waited After 40 we ask her about our room but without check it in computer or call anywhere said 30 minutes So after next 30 minutes we ask hardly and then comes other women and check something in computer and immediately we get room What is this , location is very near the metro station cca 200m but end of line M5 shopping center and restaurant there near the hotel cca 200m new hotel with comfortable bed and nice bath room aircondition

496083,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The doorknob was weird There was one part that detached from the doorknob The door would not close unless pulled manually looked like something is wrong Shower was not properly cleaned and there were black tracks of bacteria around the white silicon glue It would be nice to have additional blankets in the room temperature was hard to adjust Breakfast could be better, 200 m from underground transportation station polite staff nice rooms nice beads decent interior of the rooms value for many great underground garage low price the neighborhood is not the best so you don t get beautiful view but for what you pay you get more than enough
496084,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The thing that I disliked was the fact that you have to pay extra money to park on the property of the hotel If you do not want to spend that extra money you have to park outside the property which is less safe As far as I remember the parking costs were 8 euro per night , I liked the fact that the room looked very attractive because of all the lighting Also the bathroom was very comfortable For the price you pay you get a lot in return I would definitely recommend this hotel 
496085,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, This isnt necessarily something that I personally didnt like but anyone going to milan for a weekend city break should be aware that it is quite out of the city so be prepared to be ubering or metroing a lot of the time , This is an amazing hotel All lf the staff where so friendly and helpful and there was no problems with my requested early check in The room itself was beautiful and comfortable The location was perfect for myself as I was going to a concert at the carroponte which is close by Breakfast was great too Great value for money

496089,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Location isn t the best but very near the metro to connect to the rest of milan, Excellent hotel very clean friendly staff Definitely recommend
496090,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, location although it was near a metro station it was over 4km from Centrale and there is nothing of interest in the area PLUS the location has changed recently although in the same road the map location is about 2km from it s current location , Although the room was rather small it was quiet and comfortable with temperature satisfactory tv worked ok and bed was comfortable
496091,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, You can t open window in the room You don t have normal view and daily light in the room There is some metal gratings No gym no restaurant inside of the hotel , Good price for Milan Clean room and bathroom 
496092,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The room was small There was a big screen but the tv was tiny which I found funny The bathroom was the worst part though The shower doesn t have a door in it The bidet is exactly behind the door so for example if someone wants to enter the bathroom and is pooping it can be dangerous and a bit tricky There was no shampoo , The breakfast was pretty good A lot of food and great variety from bacon and eggs mortadella and salame to croissants and chocolate cake The staff was excellent 
496093,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The ironing board was moving around the building we could not get it delivered to the room but had to go and find it in a staffroom every day on a different floor with no indication for the guests , all good
496094,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Parking is a kind of a small hassle as it is located underground , Great hotel located near Metro and big malls within 10 mins walk Rooms are clean as well 
496095,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I would have preferred to have a spare cover sheet blanket s this is a minor and easily solvable issue though the staff would have provided them instantly with a smile upon a request , The staff is very helpful professional and polite We had trouble connecting to cellular networks so we arrived early at the hotel before the check in time and we used the hotel Wi Fi Also we left our luggage for storage at the reception so that we could do some sightseeing around the city during the day The room was really nice the bed was very comfortable I usually have trouble sleeping but not in this hotel The comfort sleeping was additionally aided by the thick curtains allowing for a very dark room and by the fact that it was very quiet The breakfast was also good buffet style Coffee was very tasty as well The room was clean and furnished in modern style and overall the hotel is well maintained Showering was also not a problem at any time of day night There was heating in the bathroom and air conditioning in the room At a walking distance from the hotel there is a big shopping center with a supermarket shops cinema restaurants and bars 
496096,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No airport shuttle service although they announced it Bathroom was not cleaned satisfactory You have to Pay the city Tax although i ve Read that its included in the price Breakfast low Quality I m really disappointed of this 4star hotel ,No Positive
496097,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The breakfast buffet is chaotic The food they offer is really good but the way the buffet is arranged leads automatically into a chaos when many people come at the same time Furthermore there were not enough coffee machines which led to long queues of people who were waiting to get tea or coffee , The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very nice It s in walking distance to the metro and all in all perfect 
496098,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, The staff was extremely nice and helpful the room was pretty nice comfortable with modern furniture The bed was comfortable the bathroom is really clean very well equipped It was good that everything is pretty colse with the public transportation The bar and the breakfast is amazing

496101,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We were booking a room with TV There was not TV The trash was broken And the bathroom was designed for people with disabilities who we were not , the breakfast was good
496102,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, TV was not working minibar with minimal filling and open refilled water bottles access to the parking lot impossible to handle staying on board choice of drinks and food at the internal restaurant average quality location not well served by public transportation, clean minimal rooms with efficient air conditioning spacious bathroom and shower

496108,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, This hotel was so easy to find with a station a couple of minutes walk The bed was incredibly comfortable and hotel exceptionally quiet We also thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast once we got used to eating cake in the morning 
496109,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, For some people location can be a problem since it is in the middle of the former industrial area not many attractions around , The hotel is very modern and clean the decoration is tasteful Everything worked so it was a pleasure to stay The location is very convenient for business travellers it is very close to public transport metro bus tram Metro line 5 will take you to the city centre in less than 30 min 
496110,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Tv remote controller it just work 1 inch away from the tv not more Shower box it doesnt have a door so it makes the bath a little cold and it makes the floor wet Refrigerator its actually not a refrigerator it is a cooler at most Parking they have a lot of space and it could be free but they charge you to park there Taxes you have to pay 5 per person per day as town tax but I dont think its their fault its the law Location its far from the center of the city but you have a very close subway station One single employee old woman of housekeeping was very rude the rest was veeeery nice All of that are minor problems I really like this hotel if I have to go back to Milan in future for sure I will stay there again , Everything except the itens reported as negative But really like this hotel if I have to go back to Milan in future for sure I will stay there again The hotel employees are awesome except for the old woman of housekeeping was very rude Thanks for everything Ohhh and the price is very cheap in comparison with the other hotels in town but keep in mind Milan is a expensive city in general 
496111,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The free WiFi was provided by an external firm socifi dot com and required to authenticate for the first time either via email or Facebook or Twitter When I tried to use the third method I was warned that Socifi would be able to send tweets from my account I preferred to use my mobile and be charged money for the roaming , The staff was kind and helpful My room was comfortable and clean The breakfast was very good The place was well connected to the city center and the main train stations via the subway line 
496112,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Our room was noisy Every morning around 6 oclock a trash truck is coming and you can clearly hear it You can also hear Sounds from other rooms , Hotel is closer to Subway and Subway Costs only 1 5 Euro to the center or duomo You can also buy 4 5 euro daily or 8 2 euro 2 days ticket 2 5 days works indeed Rooms are clean and breakfast is good for the value Staff is very friendly and speaks English 
496113,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast is a disappointment with fake eggs and plastic cups , Good location with ok access from motorway and easy access into city centre good parking garage well maintained and clean 
496114,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The beds was a bit to hard and having these super thin pillows was also a bit of a pain It does make me appreciate my own bed more , The breakfast was Great and it has sweet and salty The best was the Espresso Bar which was fantastic with great freshly made coffee and friendly staff Fresh croissants came out regularly Yum Yum
496115,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hot food at breakfast was actually cold one day and lukewarm the next cable TV has news in English and no entertainment channel and did not even show French Open on any sport channel the cheapest version of cable in any 4 star hotel I have stayed in, Beautiful room nice staff early check in 
496116,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The view from the hotel room , Really nice hotel in the near suburb of milan Train station just 5 min walk From the metro to central station just a 10 min ride When arriving by night take a cab from the metro station 15 because the last one goes at 0 30 24 7 reception towels were changed every day 
496117,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We got the room for disabled so it was really uncomfortable to use the shower Also the breakfast was really poor , Pretty good price and quality balance 
496118,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel doesn t have a pool The rooms are very nice but very small Because of the mirrors from the rooms I didn t realize the rooms are so small Anyway for a short city break are ok but if you have many clothes with you there are no space to put them The breakfast is not so perfect as in other comments You cant find eggs only some scrambled eggs You cant find different cheese there is only one cheese like the one you put in a cheeseburger , The location is good 5 minutes walking to the Metro 5 minutes walking to two different Shopping Centers with restaurants and Supermarkets The Metro is fast and easy to use in Milano So travel in the city center with the Metro it takes about 20 30 minutes to any point of interest The location is good for young people teens also cause in the Shopping Centers near to hotel are plenty of young people 
496119,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I don t like that you cannot go by walking from the city center duomo to the hotel and all the public transportation works only until midnight , There s a large supermarket near the hotel you can buy things and have them for late night when there s nothing to eat The breakfast is great it lasts from 6 30am to 10am and if they run out of anything it s refilled immediately The staff is very friendly and can even help you with directions of the places you want to visit 
496120,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The breakfast is poor and has a limited number of items the same each day The rooms are very dark all of them because the windows are covered by a lot of iron bars which we found very strange and the room bathroom specific items are rather of a low quality Despite the large size of the room we found it to be very uncomfortable small table etc The personal is very unfriendly and even ironic The hotel is far away from anything at the hotel corner each evening 2 ladies prostitutes are waiting for clients I don t recommend this hotel and wouldn t come back here in future Next time I will chose a small hotel in Milan center , The a glance the hotel looks like a new modern one Rooms were spacious 
496121,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I missed the more healthy type of foods from the breakfast selection eg whole grain bakery or wider range of vegetables Although the room was comfortable but I missed that there were limited storage places where we could put our baggage and clothes It was also the case in the bathroom , This is a nice hotel for fair price close to metro station You can reach the city center in 20 minutes We went for sightseeing so did not stay in the room too much just slept there but the room was clear and beds were comfortable The staff was helpful and polite 
496122,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, My own booking was fine But I had booked 2 double rooms for 2 nights for other people coming to Milano They could not arrive the first night and I found out too late and so had to pay for that I told the Reception that they will come for the 2nd night but very late When they arrived their rooms were cancelled as they had not checked in in the morning It was handled as 2 rooms were just cancelled but it was very annoying as I had given the information , I found the staff efficient and service oriented The room was comfortable and for me the bed was perfect as rather hard 
496123,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Such a shame for pool quality of the food in the breakfast Low cost products Far away from a standard of a 4 stars hotel Cheap salami and ham eggs had no taste and coffee is not even close to Italian famous one I would choose again this hotel for the beautiful rooms but for sure not with breakfast included , Very nice and comfortable rooms new furniture Big bed and cozy you have a familiar feeling when you enter the room Big for reception employees they always have a smile which is an important aspect for a tourist after a long road Is situated almost outside Milan but you have metro station at 5 minutes walking and you can get in the city center in max 25 30 mins 
496124,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, As this was my second time on this Hotel I can say there are differences between the rooms the second room had the shower only on top like the showers on the beach both rooms had the double bed made of two twin beds and on both there was a problem to keep them together the hotel makes a hold transaction on your card for the first night and release the hold after 1 month, all rooms are big and clean all rooms have good facilities safe cleaning service tv all rooms have a excellent breakfast included
496125,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, double beds are actually twin and you have problems with keeping them together windows cannot be opened but there is air conditioning big city tax 5eur day person but this is rather a city issue for 4 5 hotels, big clean room and bathroom cleaning every day good breakfast very nice staff close to the subway station Bignami Parco Nord 2 commercial galleries nearby Biccoca and Bignami 
496126,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Very mediocre breakfast Window in the room with stationary structural blinds that can not be opened , Very clean and comfortable room large bed with excellent mattress underground guarded parking close metro station and shopping centers 
496127,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Practically nothing Can say Milano Centrale is a bit far But Bignani metro station is quite near, The note for breakfast people who waste food will be charged 10 Excellent staff Great room for that cost
496128,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, some of the staff at the reception was not warm or friendly, beautiful design both outside and inside a great take on the Flatiron building in NYC very nice breakfast 
496129,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, None , The hotel is modern and my room is big clean and comfortable The buffet breakfast has many choices including scramble eggs pastries coffee etc and it starts at 6 30 am The hotel is a five minute walk from the metro station Bignami on the M5 line and from there it is easy to visit the main attractions of Milan There is also a big shopping mall near the hotel Check in is at 2 00 pm but they will store your luggage if you arrive early 
496130,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bad housekeeping service No change of bedding for the whole stay 5 nights 2 days no shower towels were provided No sanitary bags No plastic bags in waste bins Mould around the shower edges Not a lot of space to store belongings Just an open closet with 3 hangers per person one shelf and no drawers When checking out they forgot to charge one night so i came back and told them about the mistake and the reception guy couldn t even manage a simple sorry or thank you , Good location close to metro station Parking garage 
496131,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Underground parking 10 euro per day Too expensive , Customer service was professional rooms cosy and very clean Spacious bathroom Everything in modern style 
496132,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The draining in the shower was not working The breakfast can definitely be improved starting with the quality of the products , The location close to the metro The TV and the bed 
496133,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Given the hotel rating one would expect more options and a higher quality level for breakfast In house dining also only offers a rather poor selection of hot dishes WiFi had a tendency to disconnect and was not very stable Left the car in the garage to keep it safe but upon departure some unknown stubborn sticky fluid dropped on my vehicle from the ceiling most likely from some leaking pipes staining the side crystal to a large extent I was forced to drive to an auto wash station to attempt to clean it After 3 days it hasn t still been cleared 100 and that s pretty annoying , Smooth check in and check out professional friendly staff Clean room and bathroom comfortable bedding Indoor parking facilities 
496134,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Parking for 8 euros a night Did not know it in advance Booking did not mention it The staff was not so friendly at the reception Waken up by cleaning staff at 8 45 on Sunday As they had already started vacuuming the floor and the corridor Cleanliness of the room Breakfast quality was medium Hard to find a place for the breakfast in the morning on Saturday knowing it was not the peak season of the year yet , The location of the hotel is good really close to the metro Nice view from the room Bed was comfortable Design of the rooms 
496135,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We had some problems with WiFi connection signal was sometimes very poor Turist tax too expensive 5 euro per person per day Double bed was combination of two other beds so it wasn t very comfortable , Breakfast was really good variety of products juices from the machine great coffee served behind the bar selection of pastries and fruits Breakfast staff was really helpful especially a young man behind the bar 
496136,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, In the bathroom there was only a top shower in the frigo bar not enough food The bathroom was not well equipped with shower slippers or others bathroom necessaries as body lotions beauty set etc , the bed was really comfortable the personal at reception was very professional and kind the breakfast was very good and there were different kind of foods of very good quality 
496137,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No kettle to make tea or coffee which is usually as basic amenities in hotel staffs hardly speak English one of them didn t know the difference between knife spoon and fork when I paid city tax when check out the receptionist didn t have 2 euros to give me change so they took that extra 2 euros To borrow plates and eating tools guest must take them from receptionist no one will send it to your room , Located in walking distance to Bignami metro station situated in quiet area modern design style
496138,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The Internet should not be used It insists you download a program in order to use it and it looks very much like Adware Both Google and Microsoft warned me not to connect to the network The television is behind a large sheet of glass which makes it unwatchable in daylight due to the reflection You have to close the curtains , This is a modern hotel with clean and neat facilities It was a very short walk to a Metro to access Central Milano and a short walk to a large modern shopping plaza for a supermarket and supplies The breakfast was excellent with many choices available from a buffet 
496139,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Parking across the street from the hotel is free of charge Hotel should have free parking, The hotel is excellent a very good position for visitors with a car Breakfast was quite satisfactory Metro station at 100 meters from the hotel bout 15 20 minutes from downtown Rooms very clean and modern done central air conditioning Hotel is definitely recommended to tourists who are in Milan tourist and business
496140,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It takes around 20 mins to reach the city center 5 mins walk to the Bignami Station and 15 mins to Duomo Station There should be variety in the breakfast spread , Nice comfortable room Breakfast is included in the room rate The waiters waitresses at the breakfast area were very friendly and efficient 
496141,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It is a bit far from the city center although it is very close to the metro station Didn t find any restaurants around besides in the mall , Very friendly stuff comfiest bed Pretty good breakfast but they could have made more of a choice Close to metro shopping mall and hypermarket 
496142,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Issues with one of the rooms Air conditioning did not work and my friend was moved to another room Also my shower took a long time to get warm water Also we had dirty plates in the room from the previous nite and they were not removed , The room was comfortable and felt safe for a single traveler or with friends The breakfast was a good variety and complementary Also the staff was wonderful The Metro was a block away Line M5 Was very easy to get into Milano and connect to the trains we took daily 
496143,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Cleaning Service not friendly and not willing to clean up the room after 13 00 After complaining the cleaning result was under average, Staff in the lobby
496144,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, breakfast could be better outskirts location but secure enough , nice room small but comfy great staff very close to metro 5 minutes super fast check in and out no tax to store the bags after check out 
496145,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, 2 single matresses joined in a queen bed Breakfast egg pudding is horrible window to the room can t be opened no detachable shower, Very friendly staff Hotel is clean and neat 
496146,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Equipments are of very poor quality The bell in the lift it very annoying Snack food proposed for dinner is not prepared at the hotel The breakfast proposed is reasonable but the eggs are not fresh and the bread is dry The devil is in the details , Room size is quite ok calm and quiet pillow could be more comfortable Located close to a Metro station
496147,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, The breakfast had a good assortment and the first morning notwithstanding the high number of people arriving at the same time maybe a big group the personnel succeeded to cope with the situation very well 
496148,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The only thing that I didn t like is the fact that they charged us 5EUR tax per person per night while it was written on booking that the tax is 2EUR per person per night , Modern hotel great for young couples Clean and close to the metro station Breakfast is not bad but it could be better They have a private underground parking for good price 
496149,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel is in an industrial and dicrepit area The breakfast is a bit chaotic and the food is not in the quality of what you are used to in a 4 star hotel The room itself is small but okay It s impossible to open the window that s a big minus The pillow is like a stone very very hard , The staff was very friendly 
496150,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Disappointing breakfast small room Bathroom for the restaurant at the lower ground floor No slippers Window not opening in the room, Comfortable bed nice surrounding area close to student campus very active during te week 
496151,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The location which is far from the Centre Lots of transport Rooms are dark Closed Windows Shutters down No fresh bread at breakfast, Staff extremely nice and helpful Nice atmosphere Empty lobby nice bar Quietful rooms 
496152,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Fivefold price during Salone Makes the cons of hotel stand out Bad maintenance paint falling from bathroom ceiling cheap plastic restaurant chairs uncaring staff remote location , Proximity to metro Inexpensive bar 
496153,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, quite disappointing for 4 stars hotel expectations breakfast had low quality food the same premix omelette every day not from fresh eggs and low quality drinks and charcuterie not checking the details of the room fridge over freezing and then leaking no spare toilet paper in the bathroom as the spare paper support was broken no slippers windows cannot be opened 5 eur night person city tax not included in the initial booking price was added at the reception when paying, comfy and clean rooms modern hotel and reception nice bathroom shower and towels helpful staff metro station nearby taxis available at location 3 lifts 
496154,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was ok with good selection of food but breakfast room could be better organised in order to reach toast you had to wait in line with people who wanted coffee , Very conveniet location close to highway easy to park your car either in hotel garage or outside for free 2 shopping malls in walking distance 150 m to metro station Comfortable and modern rooms Friendly employees I recommend 
496155,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, View back of the house was not spectacular Breakfast very crowdy and noisy , 2 5 years old Hotel with good facilities and friendly staff Rooms very comfortable Modern layout Bathroom contemporary Towels nice and fluffy daily changed Soap good quality 
496156,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, A young tall man working at the reception was very arrogant Absolutely unpleasant to deal with Unfortunately he didn t have a name tag so I don t know his name I used to work as receptionist at a hotel a few years ago so I can say for sure that his customer service skills are really poor The young ladies working there were very nice and friendly though , The bed was very comfortable and breakfast had a nice buffet where everyone can easily find something to eat 
496157,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The shower in our room was not detachable it was a little inconvenient The room s window cannot be opened and has some small panels so there was a lack of fresh air and natural light , Staff was very helpful and kind The room is nice and modern Good and varied breakfast 
496158,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The rooms are so very dark All the windows are covered by thick shutters that cannot be opened or removed And the windows cannot be opened so the air in the room was not pleasant and could not be changed The safe was not anchored to the wall furniture so that the whole safe could be easily taken away Breakfast was good but scrambled eggs were probably made from powder , very comfortable mattresses Nicely furnished There is a fridge in the room Great shower 
496159,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We wished there was a kettle in the room so that we could have some tea in the end of the day The breakfast lacked hot options , The check in check out procedure was quick the staff were welcoming The bed and the quietness were ideal for a nice sleep A good option for budget travelers the hotel is located within 5 min walk from the metro station 
496160,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We accommodated room 613 which is near the street and the windows were likely open and it was not possible to close them tightly The beds were quiet comfortable , The room was big enough and it was very well designed Also decorations were very fascinating Towels have been changed daily which we did not request There s a park spot across to the street which was free of charge but I wasn t sure about the security and one night I saw that there is a police car checking the neighborhood at the other hand parking to the hotel isn t so expensive 8 per day and night The breakfast was quiet enough and delicious There is a metro line 300 350 m ahead which you can reach to the center by changing just one metro line in 20 25 minutes Also Como lake is very close we went there in 45 50 minutes by car 
496161,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, A lot of details there are no pillows in the bed room smaller than shown in pictures There was not shampoo in the bedroom and when I asked about it the staff told me that if I want it I would have to go to the pharmacy to get some They claim to be a 4 stars hotel but it s not even close,No Positive
496162,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, n a, One ideal feature of this hotel is its location in relation to central Milan Its an easy train ride from the station Bigname nearest to hotel and Milano Centrale There is also a mini mall about 7 minutes walk from the hotel which has a number of restaurants and cafes to choose from Definitely the most positive aspect of the trip were the Hotel staff Extremely friendly polite and welcoming Would recommend staying here if you are looking for a reasonable price tag on a short stay in Milan 
496163,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, the air in the room not able to open the windows but would still go again to this hotel , great location to travel to the city center by metro nice rooms nice shower great breakfast 
496164,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, To reach anything of interest you need to use the Metro a 5 minute walk away Immediate vicinity isnt very attractive but there is a modest shopping mall about 10 minutes walk away, Nice and new place although felt like it was still sorting out a few loose ends Trying to be clever and modern with styling and layout not sure it really works thou Good breakfast and attentive staff 
496165,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The housekeeper changed our towels however replaced all the bath towels for face towels which were very small Breakfast is a bit chaotic with and full of people Fortunately they extended the space to the terrace and to the room next to the reception , Very clean room and comfortable bed Very good breakfast Subway station is very close just 2 3 minutes walking and the heart of Milan is easily reachable with public transportation The hotel is new and modern Excellent price I would stay there again
496166,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was under my expectations Coffee is great but you need to ask the server to bring it to you and it is included in the breakfast at no extra charge do not take it from the self service machine They have a sauna facility but it was extremely small and the temperature was very low unusable for me , Room was very modern clean and nice comfortable bed Considering the price we paid for the room the hotel is great Location is ok metro can be reached in 5 minutes walk from the hotel taking you downtown area in 25 minutes Parking is for an extra high fee in the hotel but plenty of parking space next to the hotel on the street free of charge 
496167,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The toilet of our room was leaking the water and making the noise for the whole night Even though a staff checked it the problem was not solved , It s located in a perfect place close to the subway station Really nice breakfast The reception is good as well

496169,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Our shower leaked slightly not even bad enough to mention to the front desk personnel , The hotel itself is above average nice room with modern interiors a comfortable bed and really good water pressure in the shower What was REALLY great about the hotel was the level of customer service from the reception and bar staff We asked for extra towels and they were delivered in minutes we received great direction to all the places we wanted to see and were easily able to navigate the city on our first trip We would definitely stay with at the Hotel Degli Arcimboldi again on our next trip to Milan It s about 20 minutes via subway from the Duomo and you ll save some money from staying closer to the central downtown area 
496170,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The restaurant was always busy during breakfast time not easy to find a free table Worst scrambled eggs we have eaten in our life No other savoury options There is no kettle in the room to prepare a tea or coffee The smoking alarm is flashing all the time and is annoying to sleep , Great facilities very clean Big room 
496171,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The breakfast it is plentiful but not very good The orange juice has that typical taste of industrial cleaning products The cappuccino too Also because the breakfast is included in the tariff for everyone I guess the place is really overcrowded you have the general feeling of being in Hobbes state of nature competing with everyone else for the same resources , The room was very clean and large it has some weird blue lights but it is in line with the general style of the hotel The hotel is not in any way central but it is close to a metro station that will take you in the city centre in 20 mins or so 
496172,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, very poor breakfast with Disgusting and synthetic scrambled eggs Only two kind of vegetables Lettuce and tomato Instant coffee and poor meats Bathroom was not completely cleaned after previous guests The room was badly cleaned each day Double bed had two mattresses with big hole between them very uncomfortable Internet connection need on every connection your personal info like email age etc and showed the long ad video at startup TVs behind mirror glass was unwatchable when lights in room was on Very narrow desk Very little space two people have no place to put open suitcases Rather simple budget hotel than four star, subway station and shopping center nearby 1 km to good restaurants in Sesto San Giovanni

496175,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No coffee maker The staff gave me a cup of hot water when I went down to ask about it which was nice but Having a coffee maker in the room to begin with would have been nice Also much MUCH farther from central Milano than I thought it would be Use the subway to your full advantage The shower in our room was very Leaky as well If you don t put a towel at the edge the water all drops out and causes a huge puddle , Very clean and modern and great service from the staff Good price compared to the rest of Milano

496184,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Shower had black mould throughout it which was confronting at first sight An all white bathroom should be properly cleaned particularly for the price you pay and 4 stars They also only give one room key which is ridiculous for a twin room Hotel is 20 mins outside centre in a non appealing neighbourhood Metro is a 5 min walk Outskirts of Milan are very unappealing and lots of beggars around at night Breakfast is fairly ordinary with hardly any fresh fruit and no healthy options like muesli , Modern simple accomodations Beds were comfy

496189,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There was an awful odor coming from the bathroom I asked if they could fix it while i was gone but i came back the smell was still awful and they didn t check on me about that again The other problem was that the walls were not soundproof at all I could hear the people from the next room even if they whispered unfortunately our neighbors were very loud I called the hotel at 1 30am to do something about it because they were almost having a party They sent someone over right away but the noise didn t stop , The rooms are modern and the hotel looks nice and fresh

496241,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Nothing important to say I only stayed for a night , I have been here several times last time in March and April I will here focus on what has happened since last time Reception staff is more friendly and the security guard mentioned earlier has been replaced with a more friendly looking man The hotel uses now a couple of security men but why In the restaurant at breakfast time one was standing looking at all guests enjoying their breakfast A little difficult with security men looking at you Never seen that before at other hotels Good breakfast and kind and friendly waiters I had only one night to stay but I had some preferences about room and floor I had in advance told the hotel about it but I had to say it again when I arrived I came at a little bad time because a guest who was leaving the hotel was very angry and let all hear about it The receptionist told me it was of course not normal and excused the scene I agree if a guest has a problem tell the reception staff about it and get a solution I got what I had asked for when telling about my preferences The rooms are very nice and I really like the design of light in the rooms However be aware about if it works or not In my room several spot s were gone Being there only one night I would not make anything about it just telling the staff in the morning they had to be changed It is good that it is now possible to get something to drink in the bar until midnight That was not possible before However this is a four star hotel and If you have a bar why not sell the most common drinks and have some good wines to It could be much better My conclusion is however If you get a good discount you get a very comfy room with a good bed I would like a lounge area very much For the time being the hotel is more like a 3 star hotel 
496242,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, More english channels on the TV would have been nice , The room was spacious had nice lights breakfast fare was pretty good Toilet was clean plenty of towels and shower accessories and the bed was comfortable Very near to the Metro Check in was nice and easy and so was the check out 
496243,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The only problem was the location too far from the city centre and major attractions even though there is a metro station nearby no tourist facilities in the vicinity like restaurants cafes sightseeing , Everything else was really fine staff rooms breakfast cleanliness quietness although the hotel was full 
496244,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There weren t anything we didn t like however it would ve been slightly easier if we had a kettle in the room as I had to make my way to the hotel bar every time I had to make milk for our baby With that note I would still need to compliment the staff as they were extremely patience and accommodating to my requests So a big thanks to them all for improving our stay in Milan , The staff were fantastic and extremely welcoming We arrived at the hotel before midday and still managed to check in to our room We were travelling with our 5 month old baby and he got so much positiv attention from the hotel staff which seriously made our stay much easier The front desk staff were also very knowledgable about travelling around Milan city 
496245,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bathroom looks like for Hospital some corners are not cleaned up even dustbin is broken Breakfast is not tasty at all cakes and Edge of Ham are dried and hard etc , Staffs are very Kind and Patient From Hotel to Station takes only 2 minutes go on foot 
496246,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I would like more options at breakfast There is no meat choice for non pork eaters Any beef or chicken salami would be fine , Very good location Just walk 250m to Bignami metro station You ll reach city center in 15 minutes Ticket is only 1 5 euro per person 
496247,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, N a, 1 Very good location 2 min from hotel there is underground station 10 15 min and you are in the city center 2 Breakfasts were tasty 3 Personal very friendly 4 Room was clean and warm
496248,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We ordered a double bed and we got 2 single beds together TV kind small for the size of the room , Breakfast really really good Hotel very close to the metro station so you dont have to worry about the location because the metro in Milan works very well Very comfortable and cozy rooms Very good bathroom We could switch the language on the tv for english because everything is doubled to italian Loved the simpaty of the employees 
496249,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room to a smaller size if you have big suitcases and more clothes it will be a challenge where to keep all To change bin in the bathroom and the plastic table for towels was broken and kept falling down Does not cost that much to change it but it would give extra value for the room itself during breakfast guys were way to fast to take the plates felt like we have to rush to eat and go out Very friendly thought but would of appreciated more relaxed breakfast without rushing , Nice hotel in good location close to metro station Lovely choice of breakfast 10 min walk is big supermarket Rooms were clean nice shower hot water 
496250,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, A bit out from the center of Milano but with very near metrostation which makes travel easy , Excellent hotel with extraordinary quality for this price Helpful and professional staff clean rooms nice atmosphere 
496251,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was just like in a student dormitory poor loud and fast the waiters are shouting the whole time and take your plate away while you re still eating don t go away and leave your table alone you ll find it occupied , The personal on the reception was gentle the garage for 8 euro is OK you are soon in the center the bed is perfekt 
496252,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room was not very clean not a 4 star standard the bed was hard and the pillows not comfortable, Location close to metro parking garage available staff was friendly
496253,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Nothing, Very clean with excellent staff and very good room with many many facilities and the location is near the bus station and 100 meters away from the metro station and supermarket and shopping mall
496254,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bit out of the centre but with metro very easy to find and close to metro The heater wasn t working in the bathroom The windows are locked we had to ask someone to come up to our room to open it with a special key for fresh air So this is bit strange , Very clean room nice and compact but not small The light in the room and shower were nice blue colour was possible Very big breakfast lot s of choice and u can even ask a fresh cappucino or caff normal instead of the instant machine Very good price we got it as a value deal of the day 
496255,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The shower cabin was leaky and we had to use a towel so water does not flow on the bathroom floor Also not the biggest thing but the trash bin in the bathroom was very rusty , The room looked nice and tidy breakfast was tasty 
496256,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Reception staff a little abrupt although still polite and courteous hotel entrance could be better signposted However overall very happy with choice, Bar and breakfast staff very friendly excellent breakfast with plenty of choice even heart shaped Nutella donuts one morning cute comfortable rooms great location only few mins away from Bignami metro Bedroom lighting was nice with a few different options for ambience
496257,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The toilet in underground level didn t have light The shutter of the window is fixed can t be open , Near to the metro station Easy to arrive the Bicocca village where many restaurants open until 24 Enjoyed the stay and breakfast Staffs are very helpful 
496258,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Very strategic location a few steps away from the underground Rooms have a modern design The shower is big Staff is very kind and well trained For those who are travelling with a dog this is a perfect place to stay Furry friends of very breed and size are accepted extra 10 euros They are welcome everywhere including the breakfast room ps Hotel Arcimboldi is located a few steps away from Hangar Bicocca the only museum in MIlan to accept dogs For 6 legged joggers Parco Nord is very close A number of bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood are pet friendly as well GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY 
496259,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The negatives the room was terribly hot even with a climate control panel It was mid November and my partner and I were sweating profusely during the night to the point she had to call reception A man came up at 4am to open our window which is bolted shut with a key as we were on the 6th floor This still didn t help really and despite the time of year the heat in the room was pretty infuriating at times The maids although they do a cracking job decided to repeatedly knock loud one morning even though we d left a Do Not Disturb sign on the door This is because we d had a late night and weren t planning on rising until a time after the maids had done their round The next day my partner was out and I was in the shower when the maids knocked yet again as I d forgotten to remove the sign However upon opening the door they had gone The following day one of them collared my partner and said they are paid on a room to room basis and that they had not been in our room for 2 days So they pretty much frog marched her back in order to clean our room My issue with this is sometimes I work away on nights and sleep in hotels during the day if someone in this hotel is doing something similar to that I m sure he would not want to have his door banged on 3 or 4 times over a 30 minute period at 11am The signs should be adhered too , We stayed at Arcimboldi for 6 nights from 19th to 25th It s the second time we ve stayed here previously spending 3 nights here back in August I would say value for money it s one of the best hotels I ve stayed in but it isn t without its faults Let s start with the positives Breakfast is included with every room and although continental it s of a high quality with a wide variety The hotel is very modern and the location is superb being built on the former Breda factory site it s located within a 5 minute walk from Bignami Parco Nord metro station which is the end of the modern automated purple line You are also a 5 minute walk from the very modern Biccoca Village shopping centre which has a large selection of Restaurants a Cinema Bowling Alley Gym Arcade Bars and Fast Food joints Next to the village is the Hangar Biccoca art exhibition which is housed in the former Pirelli tyre plant Back to the hotel the rooms are very modern and each room comes equipped with Sky Digital which includes all sports channels The showers are extremely spacious and are of a high quality 
496260,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The young lady who greeted us was a bit rude When we first arrived the young lady seemed annoyed at my asking questions Nothing like the experience we had in Boutique Hotel H10 Moncada The staff at Boutique Hotel H10 Moncada was fantastic The beds we re very uncomfortable The bed sheets seemed to be very itchy as if they were washed without any fabric softener The pillows were quite flat and there were no blankets just a sheet , Breakfast was good The serving staff was great 
496261,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Everything was perfect except for when we went to pay the remaining of the stay the 1st night deposit was already taken out from our account we were told we need to pay the full amount then and that the deposit will be returned to our credit card within 30 days This does not seem fair especially because we were not aware and somehow I am left without a significant amount of money stuck for what could be a month s time , It was very close to the metro that had a direct line from Stazione Centrale and the big breakfast provided every morning The hotel is situated between 2 of the biggest malls for anyone interested in doing some extra shopping as well as local restaurants down the street On our last day we left at 3am and we were given a breakfast bag to take away Very nice touch 
496262,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I could have enjoyed more shelf space in the room , A modern property with newer facilities and amenities They offer a large breakfast selection typical Milanese high fashion designer rooms with over the top lighting schemes for a modest pricing A evening bar offering Happy Hour drink food specials comfortable lobby and lounges A great staff that is present and helpful I could see that a business traveler would not think twice about making this hotel their first choice As a leisure traveler I would go back again and again The metro is a short walk away 
496263,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bed wasn t very comfortable and there was a blinking smoke alarm just above my bed that prevented me from sleeping well , Nice hotel in a nice neighbourhood Clean and proper 
496264,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, but unfortunately not perfectly maintenaned Toilet paper holder was lose and carpet was stained , Breakfast buffet was good actually a modern and nice hotel 
496265,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, I liked that hotel Very clean and modern cozy rooms delicious breakfast friendly stuff wifi works great Good location just 3 minutes from metro or bus station Value this money It is not easy to find such an awesome place to stay in Milan with really cheap price for this city I was choosing between this hotel and hotels near Milano Centrale They were old and pure but for the same price i am happy that I chosen this one because it is really easy and quick to get to all beautiful places from here and you can even use a tram at night Recommend 
496266,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Friendliness of staff, I liked this place everything looked nice and clean new and is not that far away from town centre With the underground you will travel around 1520 minutes until the I liked this place everything looked nice and clean new and is not that far away from town centre We to the underground you will travel around 15 20 minutes until the Cathedral of Milan Until the underground station you have to work around five minutes 
496267,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Only one little regret which is whenI got problem to find the hotel from metro station I called the receptionist but the young man was not very nice Also the bathroom cups are cheap and weak plastic cups unfriendly to use , The breakfast is great location is good as well Facility is quite good decorate style is nice 
496268,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast could have been better as we were there for 4 days it was the same every day , Comfy room cleaned everyday fresh towels every day Staff friendly efficient Adequate breakfast altho little choice on the hot side scrambled eggs bacon every day Hotel handy for Metro easy to get about

496272,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Staff attitude is annoying especially reception Coming back at night I realized that my room had not been cleaned at all but when I complained at the reception a male staff replied something like I just started my job today so I am sorry but I don t know about this we will check And then he called me soon after to ask if I had accidentally left do not disturb sign on the door Obviously not The day after at checkout I asked to another lady receptionist if they knew about the uncleaned room problem Yes we are aware and we will check with the cleaning lady That s it WOW Now I understand that sometimes accidents can happen and I am not so upset for unclean room but much more for the arrogant and self centred attitude of both receptionists I travel often and it is clear to me that this hotel don t train its staff to be service oriented They actually made me feel like I was bothering them And there was no real apology no nice gesture It s a shame because Arimboldi hotel is otherwise good in a convenient location with excellent price point , location and price 
496273,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, 1 I booked on line and there was a metro strike on the day I arrived the way most people get to the Hotel It would have been useful to receive an emailed warning and alternatives to get to the hotel 2 There needs to be a working powerpoint for laptops near the desk 3 The TV did not work I did ask for someone to look at it but no one came , 1 Very helpful staff except one insident 2 Very comfortable bed 3 great shower need a bit more space yo put toiletries near the sink 4 Very close to the Metro and so very accessible

496277,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It would be better if a bigger map of Milan was available so you could see where the hotel was situated in relation to central Milan It would also have been useful to have details of buses i e number and where the destination was Also it needed more information of nearby places to eat like the shopping complex down the road It would have been nice if there evening menu had lasagne or bolagnes just a little more choice although i appreciate they do not adveertise they provide a restaurant service , it was clean well maintained and the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel had little snacks free when you arrived and the prices of drinks etc was very reasonable Good choice for breakfast It was close to metro and buses The restaurant recommended on first night was excellent picked up and returned to hotel it was about 30 for each person the reception arranged taxi for return to central station and it was there within 3 4 mins Good contact maintained with facilities Metro was 350 yards away 
496278,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No tea coffee making facilities phone was broken No restaurant room service for dinners In a double bed two single mattresses instead of a big one , Staff was very friendly and helpful location really close to a tube station 
496279,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, In booking air port shuttle is included but when i arrived in hotel i see it is private service and i should pay taxi So you should omit shuttle airport in specification for this hotel ,No Positive
496280,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The location of the hotel is close to the last stop of the M5 subway it s quite a long ride from the city When i arrived in the middle of the night the area seemed pretty dodgy Groups of young men were hanging out on the streets it was pretty dark so altogether rather unwelcoming the hotel stands next to some dilapidated building and is enclosed by huge blocks of apartment buildings First time inside the bathroom i could not open the plug of the sink When i looked under i saw it had been fixed with some sticky tape I readjusted everything and it worked again but the way it was fixed appeared pretty unprofessional when i missed the last train one night the taxi ride from the city cost 35 , The room was clean the free wifi really worked and the tv selection was excellent sports channels There was a mini bar in the room with reasonable prices Except checkin checkout i did not have any contact with the staff they were not overly friendly but also not unfriendly 
496281,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I did not like anything The staff are not caring in a dirty hotel They lie about the information they provided to booking, The hotel is filthy with small dirty toilet shared for all the hotel residents The room blankets are very dirty with a lot of insects inside the room Only one shower shared for all the hotel

496329,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast the layout of the food dishes and coffee machine was extremely uncomfortable The hotel is big so it has a lot of guests in the morning there is a huge queue in front of the coffee machine there was only one functional and there was no access to the food or dishes because of the queue I had to wait in line 10minutes for coffee and food it s not what you expect in hotel , The staff was very friendly and the rooms are also nice and clean 
496330,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It could be a bit cheaper price always goes up with the Italian taxes garage should be included in the price at least if price stays the same Location is not ideal but it is great that it is close to the metro so the city is almost easily accessible , Excellent service attention and personnel really good breakfast comfortable bed and adequate room great bathroom Nice lights just not too big but they play with the mirrors to make them seem bigger than they actually are We had a great time there Secure Effective 
496331,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Although we had mentioned that we are with an 8 year old child they wanted to charge us extra In the booking com page it was mentioned that All Children are welcome and in the description of the room it was also mentioned that you can add an extra bed But they refused to give us the room in the deal and wanted to charge us 800 euros It was in the middle of the night and everybody was super tired We had booked 4 rooms and they receptionist didn t accepted the clear info on our booking It took half an hour to convince him to give us a room We were also overcharged during check out by counting the child for city tax which is supposed waived for children , We got the 80 deal so it was definitely value for money It was a nice hotel There was a very big supermarket in the north side of the hotel and the metro was also pretty close 
496332,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There were not too many places where you can put your clothes , Great location comfortable clean room and delicious breakfast The staff has also been very helpful 
496333,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel was crowded It created uncomfortable atmosphere during breakfast The worst was to find additional cost tourist city tax 5 euro person It was written in small letters in the notes to the booking instead of being included in the price shown at the booking site When a tourist is tired and has limited time for a hotel selection such hidden cost are typically remain unnoticed This undermines the credibility of booking com , Good food for breakfast corresponding to 4 star hotel scrambled eggs with bacon selection of fruits that however quickly disappeared croissants Parking 
496334,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No near by shops or restaurants , Clean hotel good breakfast It is relatively away from attractions but very easily accessible via public transport 5 minutes walk from metro station It has interconnecting rooms which was very convenient for family
496335,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Perfect nice and clean hotel Pleasant and very friendly staff Fast WiFi garage parking Nearby to the metro station and 20 30 min to the city centre 
496336,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, this is an ok hotel nothing special what could be improved is replacing broken stuff in the bathroom bin towel holder paying a bit more attention to ensure everything is available during breakfast hours and given that it s Italy I expected a bit more than a Nescafe coffee machine with instant coffee, New hotel fancy room decor rich breakfast located 3 min from Bignami tube station
496337,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Facilities There is no pool gym etc, Rooms are small but comfortable clean All is modern Rooms lobby etc Breakfast is good value Subway close by
496338,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, little bit messy the the restaurant during the breakfast so crowded Funny and also a bit annoying the tv in the room At first sight the room has a big a bit dark glass mirror and the tv is located behind which is really tricky design but you can not use the remote control only in 10 cm distance because of the the glass thickness Btw my feeling is not 4 star just a good design 3 star hotel , The location ia good easy access to Metro M5 Bignani so in 15 minutes you should reach the downtown Good design the lights in the room comfortable bed We had a room on the 9th flloor so the view was great to the northern part of the City and furthermore the mountains Good sound insulated walls Really good free wifi I really liked the wood log at the bed 
496339,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The location no good restaurants were nearby and it didn t feel a safe area Metro nearby but 40 mins into Milan, The hotel was modern and comfortable
496340,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, My only complaint is that I was staying at this hotel to meet a friend we both booked a double room and paid the same price for it I thought my bed was surprisingly small for a double when I arrived I only realised after the second night when I saw my friend s room that was actually a double that they had given me a single room When I called reception to say it to them they were not very helpful and said that I should have complained earlier and they could have changed my room They said that they have no single beds only one and a half beds which didn t really matter because my booking clearly said double To be fair I should have made note of it earlier but I asked for late check out to compensate which I thought was a very fair request but it was refused quite rudely , Nice hotel clean and comfortable rooms with blackout curtains They have a really good breakfast and the hotel is a handy two minutes walk from the metro station and 10 15 minutes to the centre of Milan The hotel gives the impression it s a luxury hotel but it is more like a high end Ibis or something like that which is not a bad thing I enjoyed my stay 
496341,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Maybe Wi Fi, Staff welcomed us nicely Most of them speaks English Hotel is in the middle of 2 shopping centers and like 5 minutes away from metrostation Bignami Hygiene and comfort are great Breakfast staff is working hard for the customers I will recommend this hotel to my relatives We will definitely come back to this hotel 
496342,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Neighborhood is not that nice industrial zone but it is still ok Breakfast was not as you would expect from such a hotel Flickering light leaking a bit from the shower and there was two doors between our room and somebody s room so that was a bit weird , It is a new or renovated hotel 200m from last metro station M5 There is a garage from the hotel only 8 EUR per night and it s very convenient Staff is polite and helpful they called some food delivery for us almost at the midnight and that was very kind 
496343,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Not so clean bathroom Old industry parc like neighbourhood Lots of renovating and new building going on though Just average breakfast , Modern building with fine beds and good airconditioning Has a private parking garage with gate for 8 euro night Only five minute walk to subway station twenty minute subwayride to duomo Ten minutes walk from supermarket shopping mal
496344,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bathroom had hair in the shower and sink disgusting The toilet seat had urine stains on it The breakfast was horrible except for the fresh fruit and freshly squeezed orange juice which you have to ask for and I found this out by chance after nearly choking on the artificial grapefruit juice everything else was processed or what I would consider cheap quality The cakes were nice and freshly baked however loaded with too much sugar so it put me off on the first bite There wasn t even an option if didn t want to eat powdered scrambled eggs For a 4 star hotel I was really disappointed , The front desk staff were not as welcoming or friendly as we expected from the reviews however the breakfast waiting staff of 4 were wonderful Friendly and efficient 
496345,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We were traveling as a family and requested since reservation 2 rooms together I got rooms in different floors and the staff was not at all helpful or willing to find a solution , The hotel is great comfortable and modern rooms and location is close to subway station making it a great place to stay 
496346,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Very modern with fantastic breakfast private parking in underground garage with charge but only 8 euro per day only 100 metres away from the closest metro station very polite staff and unbeatable price Would return 
496347,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bar was expensive and had only a small menu , New hotel in the outskirts of Milano The city can be reached with the Metro the station is about 200m from the hotel Free and secure parking in the basement The rooms are modern and comfortable Very friendly personal The breakfast is very good large choice from the buffet 
496348,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, This was my favorite hotel I ve ever stayed at The staff was friendly the breakfast was really good and the room was extremely clean and had everything we could want 
496349,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was ok but we expected better breakfast from that hotel , Nice modern hotel Clean and comfortable Location so and so a large supermarket with food court within a 10 minute walk also the metro stop is less than 10 minute walk So in that terms location is very good But if You want to walk and hang around the hotel then choose more central property but You would pay more for less there 
496350,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Our shower drain clogged but they fixed it as soon as we told them, The bar was nice and welcoming the look of the hotel was neat The Staff was very helpful very nice great people 
496351,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, They completely forgot to put the baby bed that we requested when we booked Unfortunately there were no baby beds available when we arrived Lucky for us we had one in the car ,No Positive
496352,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The front desk was often crowded and difficult to talk to staff long waits The lack of variety and mediocre quality of the food in the dining room Breakfast was OK, The visual design and architecture Good bed and shower 
496353,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The Wi Fi was basically inexistent I could connect to it but that s all Not even a byte to load even though we had a central position in the hotel , The rooms had a rather modern design and a nice reflective panel that houses the TV 
496354,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Cannot open the window in the room door man in the parking dont now how ti deal with the guest he was speaking unrespectable way, Nice lightinig and tv in the room
496355,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The smoke alarm installed above the bed caused some disturbance while getting asleep bright light flashing during whole night , Comfortable bed nice and spacious bathroom 
496356,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Some rooms are made for handicapped people They allocated me for one of them firstly but they will very accommodating when i asked to be shifted to another room Unfortunately they don t have any room with bathtub which i was looking to have for my son i have been given a room with shower it was ok for me , The location is very good you can be on central Milano if u the metro station is only 5 min walk The staff very friendly and welcoming Though the rooms are a bit small but the way they were designed make them look like good and comfy
496357,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Wifi in the room 4th floor was too slow to use efficiently , The hotel was close to the university where we attended the conference but otherwise a bit out of city centre There s very easy access to the metro though Breakfast was good too 
496358,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The silicon in the shower was a little moulded and could do with replacing , The room was clean modern Staff was friendly and for breakfast there were more than enough choices available from fresh fruit yoghurt granola to eggs bacon freshly baked rolls pastry Location was perfect only 5min walk to the metro station which had a great connection to the major lines so in less then 15min you re in the city center Price quality perfect value for money Great hotel for a trip in Milan 
496359,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It seems that they have been rushing to finish construction of the hotel my room was not flawless at all Nothing major though but it lowers the general impression , The hotel is located close to metro it was very easy to get to the center from there Nice breakfast 
496360,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast scrambled eggs were awful A sex worker could be seen at night near the hotel entrance , Convenient location 5 minutes walk from the metro tram station Easy to reach the city centre day and night in about 30 minutes Friendly and helpful staff all could speak English Very friendly staff breakfast Superb brand new room furniture enough power sockets great bed clean room bathroom fluffy towels good air conditioning excellent wi fi Rich breakfast buffet 
496361,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The room we were in was too small I couldn t even place my computer onto the small table in order to charge it As a result I couldn t do any work in the room , The croissants were OK and the restaurant and front office staff were very helpful
496362,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, My bag was stolen right in front of a security on duty and receptionists while I was trying to check in My Mac notebook iPhone 6 office I d card clothes wrist watch by Festina etc were all in the bag Never seen this in my whole life someone stole my bag while I was talking with receptionist in front desk and security was standing there I was wondering what was his job Only in italy I have seen this , The hotel was clean and they serve good breakfast The staff were friendly and they were ready to assist and support one The manager was awesome Metro was close distance and connects one to any part of Milan Nice stay here 
496363,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel says that it is a 4 star one However no proper restaurant for dinner And no good breakfast For example especially very poor selection of cheese and dairy products isn t the hotel in Italy No fitness room And finally in the lobby area there were some staff walking idle and chatting around while the receptionists looked they don t like their job without a smile in their face This brings a negative atmosphere in the hotel entrance and shows in my opinion a lack of managerial attention The hotel location and capacity could be served in a much better way by increasing the quality of the restaurant at least the breakfast and by letting some smile and motivation into the staff And a basic and good ventilated fitness room would be a plus nice to have , It s one of the hotels nearby the business and academic center in Bicocca neighborhood of Milano For those who goes for long running or long walking even during their travels the hotel is very close to Parco Nord Milano Very close to public transportation a main bus station and metro station Bignami is 2 3 minutes by walking 
496364,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Cleasiness of bathroom could be better Breakfast was so so eggs were more something like instant scrambled eggs than real egg Coffee machine was broken on first day on our stay they didn t want to turn on the second one Garrage is 8 per night a bit high price since you have free parking in the street but we didn t want to leave our car in that kind of neighbourhood over the night , Staff was friendly WiFi worked ok Garrage expensive was good Location is good because you have 5 min walk to metro station 
496365,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I did not find the reception staff during the day to be friendly or helpful However the evening and night shift could not have gone out of their way any more It certainly wasn t value for money given I could have paid a little more and stayed at a big chain hotel in the CBD , The hotel was very modern but lacked creature comforts such as a pool and gym However very central location to City Metro Station and shopping centre 
496366,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There was a TV remote but no TV It s not a problem but they should remove the remote as well , The location was really good the nearest metro was about 5 7 mins away on foot The line the metro is on if taken all the way will take you to San Siro The other lines were not hard to switch over too either Staff were really friendly and were enthusiastic to help out and provide any information required The room was beautiful although the window view wasn t of much They screened the finals of the Euros 2016 in the breakfast area as well 
496367,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Couldn t iron in the room had to go to a different floor , Everything is new it s close to the metro the staff is wonderfully helpful the value for money is unmatched and it s close to a shopping center if you re bored

496377,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Dinner Terrible Inedible we were exhausted from our day and did not want to get back in the train We tried tomato soup which seemed like a chunky sauce with bits of old bread in it And a Cesar salad old And expensive There are no options close nu that I knew of , Breakfast wins at this hotel Also love the breakfast space so light and airy There was so much to choose from and who doesn t love cake at breakfast Staff was amazing at breakfast 
496378,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The receptionist staff need to smile more and actually look like they are happy to help they were not very welcoming You could let people know about the mini bar in their room not being free from the desk so that they will not think it s free Also the 5 charge per person per night could be explained at the desk before check in, Only 2 staff we re friendly to US that was the staff working in dinner area one called Thomas he was nice
496379,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, dirty room walls very small room it s true that we booked a single night so they probably gave us one of the worse rooms TV did not work had to call someone to fix it safe did not work no olives at breakfast no cheese, location close to the metro easy to get to the Dome quiet area no problem with noise from outside or from the other rooms nice bathroom well equipped and new the wifi worked ok 
496380,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, The staff were extremely helpful and extra friendly They were very welcoming Unfortunately the hotel could not accept an advance payment the hotel ended up being more expensive due to our currency exchange rate This was disappointing Everything else was perfect

496382,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The only thing was the hotel security They could smile a bit They acted like that you are entering to a nightclub and make you feel uncomfortable somehow , Breakfast was satisfying 
496383,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, They can definitely add few more things to the breakfast and make it like a full 4 star hotel breakfast , Good Staff Location is away from city centre about 4 miles but you have metro about 300 350 meters away from hostel and you need to change two trains to be in the city centre Or you can walk 1 1km and take another train and be in the city centre Both route takes about 35 minutes Price is reasonable If you are with kids or family I will recommend to find the hotel close to city centre Staff always helpful environment was great Room was cozy and comfortable but slightly smaller as compared to other 4 starts we have twin bed room Air con system was perfect
496384,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, far fom center weak breakfast very little cheese not enough personnes work in restaurent no body hepl you to carry the bags , one man speak Arabic very helpful we vould like to thaks him
496385,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, toilet configuration, nice room in peak season breakfast quite good location is quite good but M5 is always not a smart option if you don t care really much about the price difference compared to other hotels
496386,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, there was no kettle or coffee maker in the room so in morning we must go to the lobby for that there were no bed covere in the 1st night there was just the bed sheet , The staff were very helpful

496389,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We ve got number for disabled so there was shower for disabled without walls bathroom was full of water Mid day snacks were pretty bad especially for the price Carpet was pretty dirty some green spots there were no slippers so combining with very wet bathroom was quite disappointing, Quite good location and very good price value ratio
496390,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, really none , Perfect place if you come from north by a car and try to avoid city jams 200m from metro station All new and in modern Italian design fashion Excellent breakfast Excellent price performance value This is the first hotel I rated maximum in every category Very happy with the choice

496393,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Restaurant dinner is buffet and a bit expensive There is not much room to walk a dog inside the hotel premises and the neighborhood does not look nice to do it either it s very dark at night and it looks like an industrial district , The hotel is perfect for a road stop it s far from the city center but relatively close to motorways It is modern comfortable and quiet There is underground parking available 
496394,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Medium price hotel charging outrageous prices because of Cup Final weekend Ok at its usual rates but very poor value at nearly 350 per night I was charged But I guess all the hotels in Milan were charging outrageous prices Restaurants in the Milan centre weren t charging any more for food or drink which was good ,No Positive
496395,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The area seemed a little rough TV was a tiny bit on the small side but easily enjoyable The bed was two single beds together so kept falling through the middle , Nice bright modern hotel Great breakfast and staff Location seems to be in a rough area but essential being near the metro 
496396,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Although relatively new hotel rooms look used Too far from city centre Location is not great , Free parking possibilities next to the hotel Metro station nearby

496403,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, they didn t refill the shampoo and soaps even when asked the reception staff wasn t informed even about the basic tourist information the windows can t be opened inside the rooms overall very average hotel, nice breakfast for milan standards modern design hotel
496404,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast not bad but could be slightly improved in terms of food quality for instance the scramble eggs were too artificial and lack of mineral water, Metro very close to the hotel internal parking new rooms
496405,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, A light flashing on the alarm for the room which disturbed me from falling asleep , Amazing value for money for hotel with a good range for breakfast alongside a very modern room Metro station is a short walk away from the hotel plus a small shopping centre
496406,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bed was too hard and the continual flashing of the smoke alarm and air con control panel kept us awake If it wasn t for these two things we would rate this hotel considerably higher, Friendly and helpful staff Great breakfast
496407,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The staff was the most arrogant in my life They overcharged though their policy to children is terribly unclear Some garbage was scatterred in our room Water flooded in the shower room NEVER recommend this hotel , Was close to the final station of purple line subway 
496408,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Limited food alternatives in the evening The area has little to offer , Very modern and functional rooms all working well Good reception area nice staff Safe underground parking Ok breakfast Short walk to Metro with good access to city Acceptable price level 
496409,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We were put into an odd shaped room 626 where the tv was slanted at an angle away from the bed The placement of the bed to the weird angle of the wall had you tripping into the wall trying to get to the restroom The mattress was like sleeping on a slab of concrete and for such a highly rated hotel it was a huge disappointment to have flat shapeless pillows It was overall just an awkward space that was not comfortable at all , The hotel was very clean and modern Staff was very friendly and helpful easy walk to metro The breakfast had a nice selection 
496410,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Location is a bit far from the center and next to the hotel you have an old institute building waiting for restoration or to be removed At this time it appears with broken windows and grafitti We are in an industrial quarter and next to the hotel you have a lot of storehouses combined with new hotels However people also live here in both new and older blocks of flats Unfortunately you cannot open the windows of security reasons However the cleaning staff have a key to open it when cleaning the rooms You have not very much daylight because of bars or blinders outside the windows However you have an aircondition and it works very well The outdoor area to the hotel is nothing to write home about Reception area nice designed but no lobby area just a bar and unfortunately not comfortable furnished But it looks nice You can sit at the restaurant tables The hotel still has the same security man walking around in reception area The problem is that he looks very unfriendly and actually he is Reception staff friendly if asked about something but unfortunately do not expect a welcoming word during your stay I am sure the reception staff has a good time talking with each other but hello how about a smile and a welcoming word I hope you are listening My conclusion In my opinion we do not talk about a 4 star hotel more a nice 3 star However I will come back again and I am sure we will see some improvements , I frequently come to Milano and instead of booking different hotels I like to have a place feeling like home A hotel with good standard competitive prices and first and foremost good service and a welcome attitude from the staff I have been at this hotel also in Marth and now again here in April from 7th to12th of April You can see my first recommendation written 14 of April concerning my stay in Marth This time I was here 4 days plus 1 That is why I make my recommendation after the last day Be aware about the prices per night Monday is very expensive compared with weekends and fridays As mentioned in my first recommendation the rooms are very nice good bed and bathroom Modern and nice designed also the electric light Good cleaning and nice cleaning staff Breakfast is also very good and in my opinion you cannot complain about that I cannot tell you about the dinner at the hotel at that time I am in town When I booked a room this time I had of course some preferences about floor number view and kind of room I got what I had asked for and many thanks for that That is good service Unfortunately the safe box was out of order but talking with the reception staff they send at man to fix the problem at once No delay That is very good service All waiters during my stay very friendly and some remembered me from the month before Some of the reception staff are very friendly and helpful If you want a nice room good breakfast and competitive prices and you do not stay at the hotel during the day or in the area because you want to go to the center of Milan this is in fact a good hotel That is why I will come back again Location just 5 min from Metro Bignami It takes about 20 min to the center of Milan Be aware that this M5 will stop about midnight If you are in town late you have to take bus and tram Tram stops next to M Bignami 
496411,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was not good Not suitable with a 4 stars hotel , Friendly reception Big and clean rooms cozy bed parking slots in front of the hotel available good for a city trip 
496412,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast variety is a little bit on the down side as the selection of food is not very wide Lifts are slow and not synced among them so prepare for long waits if your room is on the upper floors, The hotel is modern and with stylish furniture in the rooms The location is convenient close to the M5 terminus 15mins from Garibaldi Staff at the front desk are welcoming and very helpful
496413,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Hotel is far away from city center and anything else but small shoping mall , Hotel is quite new It has very nice rooms and great parking Good value for the money 
496414,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Poor daylight in the rooms because it is not possible to open blinders , The location is super The accommodation and the breakfast are excellent You can park your car for free in the street next to hotel parallel City center is easy reachable by metro which is 3 minutes walk from the hotel 
496415,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Guy on recepcion high guy with morthal combath hair cut is the most unfriedly guy that I evet meet in any hotel With that kind of staff and rooms like on pictures this hotel do not deserve 2 Never ever in this hotel , NOTHING

496417,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, A little bit far from downtown with no shops or food outlets nearby , The ladies at the reception are nice and helpful when I asked for a change of the room due to some reasons The breakfast tastes good too although choices are quite limited 5 min walk from metro 
496418,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, crowed and noisy breakfast lack of electricity socket 1 in a room window view, two supermarkets are very close beautiful lights in a room spacy bathroom unusual style of exterior peaceful atmosphere
496419,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel has only 1 2 free televisions You must subscribe to SKY if you want to see something on TV This was not in their hotel description I checked again if this is written in the hotel description and I feel like booking com the hotel are telling half of the trut in their description Please be clear and fair in your description Location far away from the city center even if Bignami M5 station is 100 m distance from the hotel It takes you app 40 min get in the center by underground , clean hotel great staff Congrats for their manager trainer They were always smiling An example about how staff should look like good breakfast many choices and a surprise decent coffee A mister for me is why olives are missing from the breakfast in an italian hotel surprisingly good wifi service Perfect whatsapp call clarity and decent quality of the VOIP calls very good value for money I paid app 60 euro night per room 2 people and I think that it s one of the best prices you can find in Milano the hotel is in a safe area 200 m from the hotel is a mall and ther you can see football games As a conclusion I recommend this hotel to people who are not travelling with children Distance to the main tourist attractions could be a problem for young sleepy children less than 5 6 years old 
496420,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Dirty rooms human hair on tables in bed Terrible dinner flavourless and not big variety Breakfast big variety but no quality , Big variety of sweets during breakfast 
496421,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It location far from historic center The parking would be free , The room was excelent with all need a person The breakfast very good WIFI good The personal in reception excelent 
496422,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, THE ROOM IS SMALL No fridge not one nightstand no closet nowhere to keep your clothes the pictures show a big room however it is all mirrors Nothing in the room Who needs art pictures in the room You need a closet a fridge and a night stand , The location is close to a metro station
496423,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room lock system was a bit weird even when you put the don t disturb sign people will still knock your door , Although the location is not in the center the metro station is near by and its easy access to all locations within Milan Garage service available on site for a reasonable charge Breakfast buffet was good staff were friendly and room is modern and clean 
496424,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Elevators were very small and poor for this size of hotel and they were very crowded in breakfast and checkout time , Breakfast was good nice view and atmosphere location staff were very friendly and helpful 
496425,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Internet wasnot working for a day and we had to work If they had told us it was working in the hall we would have gone there But they compensated us professional staff , Location was good room quiet protected garage 
496426,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, While comfortable it felt more like a 2 or 3 star hotel It seemed the only coffee available was from the automated machine and the bedside table was dusty The furnishings in the room were very cheap But considering what I paid it was nevertheless an excellent value and I would definitely stay again at the same price I would not stay at the full rate , The breakfast was nice location suitable and the discounted price was excellent 
496427,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Location is far from center and next to the hotel you have an old building with broken windows and to be removed at some time Not the best view All windows at the hotel need a speciel key to be opened and only the cleaning staff use it You have to be happy about the aircondition The windows have outside bars that means you do not have much daylight and no sunshine coming into your room Some of the staff in reception seems to be a bit arrogant and they never say good day or good night In fact they give an impression of you are not welcome or we do not care style I suppose it is a security person you have in front of the reception walking around Unfortunately he never smile or seems to be nice , Very nice rooms colorfull and modern special light design Good bed and bathroom Cleaning staff very nice smiling and helpfull Breakfast very good Waiters fine But you are to hurry about start up cleaning at 1045 Telling people to hurry up and remove food 1030 sharp is in my opinion a mistake However good value for money Near Metro bringing you everywhere I had a problem with the minibar it could not cool down the water However they gave me another room at once I think they do their best solving problems and I will return as long as they are competitive Value for me is first and foremost service and a nice staff Feeling welcome 
496428,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Service breakfast the basic lights in the room do not work and we replaced them by our mobile you cannot see well outside of the Windows, Good design of the room
496429,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Location isn t very good if you are their for leisure Takes 30 mins to get into central Milan and public transport seems to shut down after midnight making it very difficult and expensive to get back at night We asked for two dressing gowns and they came with brown stains which was off putting The windows have bars over them and don t open which isn t good for ventilation, Considering we paid 100 for two nights and it was originally 600 we can t argue about a thing Staff were friendly and breakfast was nice
496430,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We had some problems with Using the TV but were out most day so it didn t matter as much Location was outside main city centre so without own car needed to rely on public transport and change lines to get to city centre and attractions which was a bit difficult for my elderly parent , There was an excellent spread at breakfast The staff was very helpful to fix minor issues like not enough bath towels on arrival The staff was always polite and helpful The rooms were cleaned and kept st good standards High standard of overall presentation of the hotel 
496431,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, You cannot open or close the window unless you ask the receptionist for Room maids do not open the windows for fresh air Although we read on the reviews that it is a new system to bring fresh and clean air inside we could not feel any difference from a normal air conditioning system The air conditioning is not working properly Even if you set the temperature it automatically sets sometime for hot temperature we had it on 26 degrees twice due to system error as the receptionist said There is no wardrobe in the room Poor and routine breakfast untasty fried eggs not a single salad mix milk mixed with water like all other baverages even coffee Food is hardly replaced because of too few waiters so we had to wait for certain food for a while Breakfast looked as for a 3 star hotel No curtain or door for shower cabin The bathroom always becomes flooded after a shower , Good location close to metro about 150 m very quiet place at night friendly receptionists large bed Very clean We had a mall nearby about 200 m romantic colourful lights in room large mirror tv embedded in the mirror the curtains are very thick so they block the sunlight very well when needed Free fliers were available for guests Large and clean fridge 
496432,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, With the buffet breakfast I thought more savoury food was needed , It was a great location right near the metro and all staff were welcoming and friendly Our room was delightful and modern and would be cleaned daily and the wifi was on another level of fast Great Stay and highly recommended 
496433,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Though the hotel seems to be modern it looks worn down the white walls on the bedroom and the halls were dirty the carpet on the rooms had some holes and didn t look that clean Room was very tiny it was hard to get around , Location was very good 200m from the subway to city center Breakfast was ok maybe not 4 star quality but it had variety and decent quality Hotel was pretty inexpensive 
496434,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There wasn t a shower curtain or screen in the bathroom Hence when one showers it s easy to make the entire bathroom floor wet even up to the toilet Although accessible by public transport the location of the hotel is quiet a distance from town 20 minutes train ride and a short walk from the station , Considering this is a mid range hotel the room is cozy with comfortable bed and ample room space The breakfast had quite a selection and there s private parking 
496435,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Amortization of room Limited choice on breakfast not as expected in 4 hotel , Reasonable price frendly stuff Locarion not city centre but with very good connection via metro 
496436,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Housekeeping did not do there job properly, Location is good because its near to metro station only 1 min walking good breakfast and divers staff is helpful really enjoyed being there
496437,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Not much to dislike but if you press me scrambled eggs breakfast didn t taste like much one more elevator would have saved us at least 3 or 4 minutes each way at breakfast time , Extremely quiet room cool temperature at night meant I slept like a baby Buffet didn t taste like heaven but good healthy choices Staff was friendly Location was a subway ride away from the city centre but overall it was well worth the added comfort 
496438,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The TV remote in my room was dysfunctional so it was quite irritating to use it the bar downstairs and the room minibar were also expensive and this would put off young budget travellers who want to enjoy a drink after a long day If this would be within the budget it would be much better, Awesome breakfast staff were friendly always smiling polite and helpful clean rooms bathroom and toilet were perfect Very quiet at night so you get a good night sleep
496439,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Didn t like the breakfast a lot of sweet stuff and I am more of a savory kind of breakfast eater and those options were limited Also one of the maids has trown out one of my plastic containers filled with a hair serum which was a clear substance but the jar was not empty and still the jar comes out of a traveling kit which is now incomplete , The room was clean
496440,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The breakfast was very bad and the dinner buffet was very very bad and dosn t worth the money The receptionist wasn t that good except one lady she was adorable and friendly The security guy was scary he was looking to me like i m an accused and un friendly at all except one who s smiling all the time , Quiet
496441,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, far from city center but we knew that we only had one shampoo and one bath shower for 3 nights same for the toilet paper the hotel needs painting It looks very dirty, wifi breakfast close to metro station staff
496442,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The location may be in an upcoming area but at least for now it s the weakest part of the experience Your neighbor to the north is a steel mill , The hotel is very new and modern The rooms are very nice with a great bathroom with shower bidet and towel warmer Breakfast is delicious with great variety of pastries fruit cold cuts and cheeses There is also eggs and bacon but that s likely aimed at the north American traveler In honesty that wasn t the best part of breakfast The location is in a less desirable area of Milan but it is a 5 minute walk to the Metro stop Transit connections are fine There are restaurants and shopping in the area as well as Teatro degli Arcimboldi for concerts and events 
496443,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Staff on reception desk is arrogant and only if you insist they will help you and be careful when you pay additional service because they will try to cheat you , clean rooms good breakfast very good facility 
496444,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Staff very helpfull and always with a smile We traveled with an 11 months old baby and stayed for 10 days and needed to put some food in the kitchen freezer and everything went fine Thx to the reception and staff 
496445,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, the coffee machines at breakfast didn t work properly instead of hot chocolate they poured dirty water NEVER get a dinner at the hotel they offer a buffet for 15 euro and it is open until 22 30 we came at 21 30 and half of the buffet was empty only different vegetables and potatoes left and they don t fulfill it even after my complain that for the price i pay i want to see everything you offer at dinner the staff answered that they don t bring more staff in the restaurant can hardly understand english, Private parking nice and modern room good breakfast 5 7 minutes to the tube station and 25 30 minutes by tube to the center very nice and friendly staff at the reception
496446,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We found the staff not that helpful and too busy talking to one another The security guy just stared and didn t make you feel welcome , We were happy with the standard of cleanliness and quality of food
496447,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The room was really small and had no natural light the windows ate closed with a special stuff and you cant change it it s built that way Hotel has no view and territory at all which at 4 star hotel is unacceptable, It s 4 minutes to the metro station so it s really convinient Breakfast is not bad especually if you ate staying not more than 3 5 days as we did The stuff are really pleasant
496448,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Rooms could be bigger Provide a coffee tea maker And finally provide glasses to drink water , Very contemporary decor Nice view from the 9th floor 
496449,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There was a spot on the wall in the bathroom The room was clean but it could have been even cleaner , The service was excellent The food was good The price was appropriate 
496450,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room is too small coz we ve got the angle room no space enough to open 2 large luggage And the room use too much glass mirror I m not sure if it temper glass but for the design issue this made room look bigger which is not safe especially bed head should not use glass If guest lean on the glass while they sit and read on the bed could be really bad accident if it break down , location breakfast and bed
496451,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The location is not very good but there is a subway station at 3 4 minutes, The hotel offfers you an excelent breakfast it has very clean rooms I had a small incident with payment but they succesfully solve it in my favor very good value for money

496453,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, First I changed the room because walls were dirty with a lot of tracks on the walls They gave me another room but walls are still with tracks not so much as first room In the first night we eat into hotel s restaurant The dinner is like an buffet 15 euro person eat as you want like happy hours drinks were not included After booking at booking com I paid the room with an extra fee of 10 euro at the hotel I paid 5 euro each day person as local tax On booking was not listed the taxes TV does not worked normally using informations from the room I called reception to send a people to correct Nothing special but special settings After that was very dificult to change programs TV if you stay in the right side of TV and standing works BUT if you sit in bed nothing works between remote and TV Please paint the walls Wifi was slow I felt cold in the room when I came no blanket during February I ask to give me one and they give me the same type as blanket covers the bed during day In the next days the temperature was ok The view of my windows was to warehouses No opening windows but ventilation air system works well No space for clothes very economically no wardrobe only 6 hangers , With metro go anywhere in my opinion good location The staff and personal was ok breakfast too

496456,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Clean and very modern hotel in Milano which can be used as a hub when travelling to other cities nearby Located near the metro station with easy parking facilities Surely will return to this hotel on our next trip to Milano 
496457,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bathroom was soaked with water leaking out from the bath area we wasted 2 towels just to stop the soaking , the interior design was nice and if u find it for an offer i recomend the hotel 
496458,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The personnel was a little rude The location id very remoted There was nothing to go around the only solution was the buffet dinner of the restaurant which was pure and expensive , It was clean with a good breakfast good internet good amenities The metro was close by Taxi station was just across the street 
496459,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, As soon I get there all the bins were full of rubbish toilet they didnt change soap was dirty inside the shower place My bed they didn t change nothing and also I had no one to reply me back for questions that I asked online before departure, 2 staffs that was very helpful
496460,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The dinner buffet was unpleasant as there was not much selection for the price and what was there was cold even the food that was meant to be hot and it was very loud in the open area when it could have been set up in the other room, Bed and pillows were super comfy The Tv was hidden in the glass 
496461,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It s a bit far away from the centre but still on metro 3 minutes , Spotless clean and equipped in a really nice and modern style Great value for the price 
496462,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No tea coffee making set in room provided , Early check in was given to us and we really appreciated that as we had landed in Milan at 6am and there s no better place to be than the warmth of our hotel room Breakfast was substantial although the variety was minimal but it was enough to start the day Room was clean toilet was spacious and we liked the lighting in the room Train station was located within walking distance from hotel The mall nearby was great for getting all required essentials 
496463,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel is about 50 minutes drive from the airport We landed in Milan at 2 am Only taxi 90 euro So the deal was already not worth it In order to get to the center you have to take 2 trains from the metro ,No Positive
496464,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The cold ambiance in the lobby as well as the breakfast hall It has the flair of a company cantina most furniture is plastic made and not inviting you to enjoy a restful evening at the bar after a day of working or exploring the city TV in room is integrated an a fancy way behind a mirror but is not great to use especially the channel lineup is very restricted and the reactivity is very bad , The room was well cleaned with a decent bed and sanitary equipment Pretty good free WiFi Price worthiness is given 
496465,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I had a great holiday until it came to check out where I was confronted by Matteo I was Told to pay 30EUR per room I did not know what this was for as it was badly explained and when I queried what it was for Metteo started raising his voice and shouting at me to pay and if I did not he was going to call security I replied by saying ok I will pay you now but I will call the hotel tomorrow for more clarification to which he replied YOU WILL PAY NOW and started shaking in anger I didn t expect that kind of behaviour from an experienced member of staff working at a 4 hotel Put a bad memory of the hotel and bad connotations of my trip to Milan in my head , Rooms were very nice Hotel about 15mins from city centre Bar was great Special thanks to Francesco who was great and looked after myself and my friends very well

496467,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Moldy fugue in the shower are the only drawback, The hotel is new and modern good and varied breakfast also glutenfree and for allergy suffeers close to subway station and CentroSarca shopping centre good value for money helpful staff I would also like to come back in the future 
496468,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Minor adjustments to make it a great hotel The entrance of the building could easily be made more visitor friendly when taxis could drive until in front of the door instead of in front of the fence The quality of the dinner buffet may very well be improved by having a heating system A shower curtain or wall avoiding the bathroom to flood while showering would also be a great improvement , Very friendly staff and very quick follow up by the caretaker 
496469,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Carpet was heavily stained and walls needs paint job because of all the markings Tv is faboulously hidden behind the mirror but that makes it difficult almost impossible to control Breakfast was varied and plenty but of low quality yellow rubber instead of real eggs bad coffee in Italy but lots of different cakes available Bar has very white bright neonlight which makes it not a place you want to be in the evening , location next to the office very personal I know Lovely rooms great interior design good value for money at 65 euro Early breakfast available free wifi works well 
496470,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast was average The hotel doesn t really offer any atmosphere , We enjoyed the evening buffet dinners The hotel would have been pretty average if it wasn t for the ma tre d that worked their during the evenings The hotel is very close to on of the metro stations

496472,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bathroom with fixed shower head so when we want to have shower we have to put on shower cap Sometimes during the night was cold and there was no blankets only sheets and very thin plaid over Breakfast was poor , Hotel was very clean and wi fi signal was excellent 
496473,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Buffet dinner was not the best and the choice of the food was low Easily can hear through the walls , Hotel was really nice and appealable for the present expectations Beds were comfy 
496474,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Would recommend the hotel to add gym to its facilities The area around the hotel looks as industrial district though the hotel has security inside and looks safe , Location is fairly good close to subway 300 metres it takes about 25 minutes from the hotel door to the city center Clean new furniture Excellent value for money Good breakfast Friendly staff 
496475,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The picture of the triple room is very misleading Shot at a mirror which makes the room look bigger than it actually is No door on the shower so water leaked all over the place No drawers in the room to put clothes No iron in the room , The breakfast buffet
496476,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I just didn t like that we were celebrating our anniversary and all rooms were the same It would of been nice to have a bottle of wine or something Also I was charged additional 5 euro that was not on the site advertisement unless I missed it Overall I still think the hotel was great for the cost , I cannot remember the name of the guy who ran the bar older gentlemen but he was very welcoming and is was the main reason we loved the hotel The breakfast wasn t too bad either I would stay there again 
496477,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Small room was not great value for money Smoke detector flashed all night Aircon not working effectively Understaffed check in and out was slow staff were good just not enough of them , Good breakfast Close to metro Friendly staff Early check was helpful

496479,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The reception staff who checked us in was very rude Booked 2 double rooms but there 5 of us 2 adults and 3 kids I asked her if we can have the 7 year old kid sleep with us we will just pay extra She said impossible and showed us our reservation paper I asked her if we can change the 1 double room to a triple room she again said impossible She mentioned that our booking com reservation was only for 2 double rooms and we will void our reservation and pay the total amount if we change it She wanted us to book additional room which we did so 3 different rooms for the 5 of us and we have to go back and forth to our rooms as most of our stuff are shared in the same luggage But as it turned out there was still a vacant triple room which she could have adjusted One of the rooms given to us Room 525 also had some problems The room was too warm 27 29 degrees C so I asked someone to fix it They sent someone and opened the window and reset the airconditioner But the next day my daughter had a nosebleed and the room was still very warm 29 degrees C So I called in the reception in the morning and told them to fix it which they said they will But when we arrived in the evening the room was still warm and I again called the reception and informed me that they don t have any staff to take care of it and asked me to just transfer to another room This is one of the worse hotel experience I had Not the worst as the hotel itself is nice and clean While most of their reception staff are well dressed many of them don t seem to be happy at what they do I still think that the hotel was badly managed You can always see people lining up to check in or check out No one seems to be bothered if they receive serious complaints from the guests , Modern design rooms and clean Restaurant staff are very nice and helpful
496480,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, small rooms not cleaned enough very poor breakfast windows do not open only one power socket next to bed tv played only one channel, nice hotel very good location 2 min from Bicocca about 20 min from center you change two line M3 M5 5 min from shopping center with super market

496498,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Major problem was with the booking dept Beginning of July I booked a room for 21st November About 2 weeks or so before my staying I got an email saying my credit card was not valid and to enter a new one within 24 hrs otherwise my booking would be cancelled I did so but in the following 24 hrs I received the same mail again I decided to phone the hotel I spoke to two different ladies the second of which contradicted what the first one had told me the first said I could not enter a new credit card but I must use the same one I had made the booking the second said the opposite According to them I received an email back in July about the credit card problem This is totally false because if that had been the case I would have done something back then so not to loose the booking Why was it not automatically cancelled if they contacted me in July and I had done nothing Why was my booking still confirmed at the beginning of November Anyway beginning of November I get this email saying that my credit card is not valid and to provide a valid one within 24 hrs I do so but this too is refused and I have 24 hrs time to provide another or I loose my booking So I phoned the hotel itself and asked what they suggested to solve the situation I had tickets for the concert at Arcimboldi so didn t want to change a hotel I booked back in July with a good rate to book another just a few days before my event as the employee remarked I was suggested I send my credit card number by e mail is this acceptable I decided not to do it and entered another credit card number which a good friend agreed to give and this time it was ok fortunately I had a lot of hassle and this 24 hrs time threatens was very unpleasant since all the credit card numbers I gave were valid I checked with the bank and since no e mail was sent to me in July , Booked the hotel for a night out at the Arcimboldi theatre which is walking distance The room was very nice and clean Service was poor at breakfast and at the bar We went for a drink in the evening and waited for some time then waitress acknowledged us so we thought we d be tended soon so waited longer but nothing happened and we decided to leave The bar wasn t that busy but there was only one waitress on a Saturday night in a Milan full of events Breakfast was of an extremely low quality for a 4 stars hotel However I d recommend it and would go again since breakfast is not what I look for when in Milan Just take the metro find yourself in town and there will be thousands of nice cafes 
496499,Hotel degli Arcimboldi,No Negative, Second time we stayed here the staff are really friendly We arrived hours before the rooms are supposed to be ready they did everything they could to get the rooms ready on the same floor we booked 2 rooms and as close to each other as possible 
496500,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Room poorly equipped nowhere to hang your hand towel also not sure if two people are in the room why is there only one towel set up and second one is in a plastic bag Shower is leaking outiside of the shower tub so you will have to use one towel for that Also no duvet just thin bed cover we had to ask for a second one also no slippers or bath robe as a standard set up Remote controller slow and takes a skill to change the channels or maybe it was the batteries Staff is so lovely but they are overwhelmed Front desk not enough agents as they are all slammed with the line of people checking in Breakfast two poor waiters cannot absolutely serve that whole dinning area You have to get up 5 6 times in order to complete your breakfast as the things are constantly running out and these guys very constantly running to refill everything Eggs horrible inedible even though powdered they were swimming in the water Rest of the food is decent quality Tall gentleman that works at the bar is a true gem Also you have to pay for parking garage which is not advertised but there is a public parking across if you are lucky you can park there , Wonderful staff at the Reception and at the Bar
496501,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, It will be great if the hotel room is provided with kettle Anyway the hotel manager offered us some free hot water teabags during our stay , One of the Best Hotel Services that I had Friendly Helpful Staff High Speed Wifi Clean Modern Room Design Highly Recommended 
496502,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Please see above , I had narrowed my search by the proximity to the airport and the availability of a shuttle this hotel provided neither It was 50 km from the airport and did not provide a shuttle I had to pay the taxi 130 00 euros to get to the hotel The website was very misleading The night staff was not very helpful Shower broke down halfway which was a very unpleasant experience

496505,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Make sure you don t get a room with a connecting door to the other room it will be impossible to sleep We tried to switch room but we were told the hotel was fully booked When we further complained that it was impossible to sleep because of the connecting door does not isolate the other room we were shouted at that the hotel is full Checking on booking they had rooms left but the reception was very rude and not receptive of our problem at all Not at all a 4 star hotel approach On our 3rd and final night our room was changed and we managed to get a good nights sleep , The hotel was 3 min walk to metro station which took about 25 min to center The room was clean and the breakfast is good with lots of sweats 
496506,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There s really nothing to say bad about our stay in this hotel I do recomend this as best choice for alue you probably can get in Milan, Hotel it self looks brand new It is really close to subway 3min walk lovely breakfest full of fruit and chocolate as well as veg and eggs and bacon There is a good chance to have bufet dinner for 15 euros free bag deposit is so handy when you have to check out and you still have plenty time to walk around Staff can t do more for you they re all lovely and smiling at all the time We checked out and left our baggs in the hotel about the lunch time Came back about 5pm had a cofee cup of juice cola and some chritmas cakes all served by nicest man you can can get in the hotel It was so impresive I am sure we ll come again on the next oportunity

496512,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Coffee and Tea facilities in the room , Although restaurant served buffet the restaurant bar manager went out of this way in order to serve us food which we could take due to food intolerance at no extra charges 
496513,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Plastic glasses in room for a four star plus TV was ridiculous Not enough closet space The hotel was more like overpriced three star , Underground parking was great and a decent breakfast 
496514,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, They did put us in a room for disabled people which was totally disappointing We went back to reception right away to complain and we were instantly offered a normal room looked like this is a normal procedure This made a really bad first impression Its really really far from a 4 star hotel Absolutely no facilities no staff to offer to take your luggage you have to ask for it etc I would describe it as a really good 2 star hotel Double bed was just 2 normal ones that are put next to each other It sounds not that bad but it was a big problel , Breakfast was very good Hotel was 3min from subway M5 It was in general in a very good condition clean and newish Most of the staff are friendly Good Wifi internet with full signal in hole hotel 
496515,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bathroom was always flooded when taking a shower since there was no bath or window walls to block the water , Parking is very convenient paid or public in front of the hotel Te connection to Duomo is done via subway not far from the hotel Good location outside the main city 
496516,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast is rather poor for 4 stars selection of hot food is very moderate but this is common for Italy No apple juice , Clean room helpful staff good room 
496517,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, They gave us an invalids person room without asking us so which created us inconvenience especially during shower Also TV was hard to work or shut off The breakfast was very poor , They gave us not carpeted floor as requested
496518,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We wanted to change our reservation we even wanted to extent our booking But when we come to the hotel the host and hostess told us they cannot change the booking they can just give us a new room and we had to pay for all rooms It was incredibly stupid They didn t even try to understand and solve the problem It was a nightmare I cannot suggest anyone to stay at this money oriented hotel ,No Positive
496519,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel is very convenient for Milano Bicocca University but it is out of the city center It is very easy to get to more touristic areas but it takes 20 30 minutes with public transportation The area is not very attractive in the evening Hotels in Milano are expensive still the price tag of this hotel was too high but considerably cheaper than similar alternatives in the city center , Modern hotel with comfortable room 
496520,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We was tree days at hotel We get room with bathroom for persons with disability There is no shower cabine ALL bathroom was wet after showering TV remote control too complicated , Staff in loby bar was pleasant Good WiFI

496522,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The staff were at best indifferent Did not take not of our booking request for a room on the lower floor but did change the floor when we spoke to them Constantly made mistakes resulting in us being called in our room to resolve their mistake ,No Positive
496523,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel website boasts a restaurant with an enticing menu including fillet steak with rosemary potatoes and a wide array of wines Alas in the meanwhile the restaurant had been resized to a gloomy buffet restaurant with cold dishes and an extremely noisy radio playing a football match commentary I asked the bouncer maitre about the fillet and he skeptically answered to me that the restaurant offered only a buffet , Great pricing in a period where the frenzy for the Expo closure has led hotel rates in Milan to unsustainable levels
496524,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, the breakfast selection is average but overall a satisfying experience in this hotel, modern 4 stars hotel with a nice Milanese atmosphere clean rooms and comfortable beds location in a quiet area near a shopping centre eventhough not central in Milan but very close to Bignami metro station which is the final stop of M5 metro station 
496525,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The room was very tiny there were no drawers or shelfs to place one s items This was part of an extended stay in Europe and I had more luggage than just for a couple of days so I needed some space to store it Also no hooks for the coats The room was equipped with different lights with no convenient lighting over the working table which was tiny and in a shape of a triangle not enough space for a computer and a notebook There were only two outlets in the room My daughter was with me so we had trouble charging our computers and phones at the same time , The hotel was near the University of Milano Bicocca where I was visiting for a few days and that was very convenient Very good happy hour in the evening Also breakfast was nice 
496526,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The bathroom after a shower there was water everywhere all around the bathroom It would be better to have glass around the shower, The lighting colors and the room modern style are amazing
496527,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, There are no Facilities in hotel The furniture is very very modern more than I like my wife and I had a Queen bed but it turn up that they put two mattress together and it was not comfortable to sleep , The hotel over all is good very close to underground station and shopping centers Wifi is very good and fast internet
496528,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Tv didn t work in room which is only a very minor quibble , Very friendly staff The hotel is located outside of the city centre but the Milan tube system is a joy to use and the nearest station is less than a 5 minute walk away Room was clean and bed was comfortable 
496529,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Minor thing difficult to operate the TV in the room , Short walk to the recently opened Metro line takes e g 15 min to Garibalid were you can take the train to the Malpensa airport Two shopping centers in waking distance from the hotel with good variety of restaurants and shops cinemas Excellent WiFi in the room 
496530,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We stayed 2 day actually the housekeeping didn t happen The double bed is combination of 2 single bed with a gap in between with poor comfortability , Fashion design poor service 
496531,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hostility of the receptionists were totally bad I reserved the hotel before and when I reached after 30 minutes of 18 00 to the hotel they had cancelled my reservation and said we have no room and offer higher price but I could see the information about reserving other room still on booking com then I booked other room on Internet in the lobby Finally they had to accept new booking, The size of the room and the breakfast were good
496532,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We turned off the AC but there was anyways cold air coming out so I got sick during the night It was a twin beds room and on the bed there were only bed linen and in the closet there was one blanket So we needed to request another blanket We also requested slippers and as the mini bar was not filled up we also requested water Also we requested help cause the TV didn t work Half an hour later and after we went down to the reception AGAIN a guy came and brought fixed everything but he was visibly annoyed by our requests The TV remote control only worked from 1 meter distance so it was impossible to use it while lying in bed The floor of the room was full of hairs from somebody else so gross , The hotel is close to the metro the interior design is modern there is free wifi The breakfast buffet was okay but not on a 4 star level The waiters were very fast with taking away our empty plates 
496533,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Modern Sky TV didn t work properly so I reported it Next day I arrived back and it was working then stopped once I started changing channels Third day they came and re booted it and after 5 minutes it stopped again , Very clean modern hotel excellent staff 
496534,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Grossly overpriced hotel with the charm of a railway station Not a 4 star and worth perhaps half the money Not suited for business either not a proper desk chair not enough power sockets small rooms not even a shelf for luggage plastic cups and the worst is the restaurant buffet they offer in the evening a disgrace for Italy and its gorgious food but there is no alternative around If not forced avoid , Friendly staff
496535,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The dinner buffet that costs 15 pax was very poor some cooked eggs with tuna pasta cheese grilled vegetables ham and some bread without drinks , The room was very comfortable and cosy the breakfast was very good with many varieties 
496536,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Air conditioning poor to completely non functioning room temperature rarely below 25 degrees Celsius Insufficient storage space and little room to move around room comfortably for two people Although within easy walking distance of metro location was as far out of Milan central as was possible to be it literally was the end of the line , Helpful staff Good restaurant for dinner 
496537,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, restaurant was closed for dinner I ve heard from a guest that was for technical problems I can t accept this argument given that they didn t inform me when my reservation was made I was furious , facilities are new
496538,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, This year i was disapointed by the staff the restaurant food quality is expensive charging you for eating there when you are already and hotel guests Shower was leaking , we went there last year and were amazed by this brand new hotel
496539,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, everything staff included was a little bit cold breakfast was poor for a 4 star hotel, close to metro underground parking quiet location
496540,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, I was given a room for disabled with two beds when i asked for a big bed I went for a run without a phone and got lost in town when i called from some restaurant to hotel the hotel reception refused in a rude manner to send or order a taxi to pick me up With this kind of manners and service the receptionist lady should work as a cleaning lady and not be allowed to speak to the clients,No Positive
496541,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Staff Very Rude Bed uncomfortable Far from center Poor Internet we had no internet for 2 days Poor Breakfast Too expensive for Nothing, there is nothing to like in this hotel Far from center Poor internet Staff very rude poor Breakfast 
496542,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Neighbourhood is a bit boring but that wasn t a problem anyway since getting to the city is very easy with the nearby subway , A very clean and comfortable room Helpful staff good breakfast facilities and open pretty long so no need to get up that early For those that care wifi was fast and TV was nice with access to a lot of channels The hotel is located in an area where it seems there isn t much to do but it was very close to a subway line to the city Very convenient 
496543,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Bad experience Very rude attention at the reception desk you may don t know if you are a customer or you are asking for a million dollars I ll never come back , New hotel
496544,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Each morning the wifi broke and wasn t available for quite some hours The service was italian which means chaotic in my opinion , The hotel is located close to the Metro This means that even though the hotel is not in the centre you can get there quite easily 
496545,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Some programs of sky tv were not included in the room rate and the breakfast was quite modest the breakfast room was almost a mess and the personnel was not taking care of details cups glasses and dishes were missing coffee machines were out of order etc The receptionists were in trouble managing for customer checkout and a huge queue was there in from of the desk Poor organization and professional standard not suitable to match the expectations for a 4star hotel in Milan, Everything looks new and of good quality furniture tv etc Room quite comfortable in almost everything
496546,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Wifi was not working when we arrived but that was fixed by the evening, Almost everything was great in this modern 4 stars hotel Although not placed in the center district it is 5 min walk from the Metro which makes it super fast to get anywhere Plenty of free parking in the street This place served the best breakfast we had in our two weeks trip to Italy 
496547,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Personally everything was OK but my colleague had a room at 26 C without possibility to fix the air conditioning issue except by opening the window of the noisy street , Excellent Price offer ratio despite the Fashion week event 
496548,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, room so small it s either you or your suitcases Air conditioning makes some noise but no cool air the same in two rooms the first wad changed because toilet flashing and safety deposit box did not work, Clean and modern
496549,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Important Parents do not go there with your children They are not welcome After a long trip from Germany late in the evening we were welcomed with rude and arrogant behavior at the reception We were with our son and we were forced to pay additional room for him This is the first time we received such kind of humiliating behavior nevermind of the type of the hotel There were no manager at duty and we didn t received any help Of course we didn t stay at this hotel but we were charged for it I am not about the 100 EUR but this type of humiliating behavior is absolutely not acceptable ,No Positive
496550,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The room was a bit small but if you are there to sleep only it is more than okay It is far from the city 25 min with metro and changing lines once , Very clean and new Close to the metro 
496551,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Private parking charged in a 4 stars class hotel is a bit sad Standard double room didn t have the space enough for 2 people to stand side by side , Excellent breakfast handsome staff Room was quiet 
496552,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Minor annoyances Only six coat hangers available in the room Double bed was harder on one side Power outlet only on one side of the bed Impractical tree log served as one of the bedside tables, The room was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful The short walk to Bignami station made the location feel very close to the city center Wifi was fast and easy to use no complicated login required Breakfast buffet was a delight 
496553,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The hotel charges 5 Euros per day extra than the booking price for local municipal taxation This should appear on the calculation of the daily price as it is unfair competition to other hotels The hotel and booking site mentions there is a shuttle service to the airport available for a price Upon questioning it turned out that by shuttle service they meant an expensive bus from the Central Train Station This is a joke as one can get a cheaper train from the station and it is by no means a shuttle service It should not appear at the website as such otherwise it is misinformation Finally the hotel location is not ideal with street workers stopping cars for business just outside late at night and the hotel staff not really bothered with it , The hotel is new the staff relatively friendly the wifi works well and the design is very modern 
496554,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The facility in the hotel is not very satisfying The shampoo and bath shower is not enough for one person , The hotel is clean It s near the underground station so it s easy to find 
496555,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, No issues, Staff were helpful and pleasant Location not great for view but very close to subway system to get you all over the city Overall very clean and comfortable hotel 
496556,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The only problem is with the bed Actually beds because a king queen size bed for them means 2 beds attached to each other which is really weird , It was only one night stay but we enjoyed it Friendly staff fast checkin free Wi Fi and nice breakfast It s also very near to the metro station so it s very easy to reach the city center in few minutes 
496557,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Hotel is in the north of Milan so you need to have a car hotel parking at an additional cost or use metro which is 3 mins from hotel Getting to center with metro takes around 20 30 mins Breakfast is typical for italian hotels some ham cheese and fruits could be better but as I said it s kind of an italian hotel standard unfortunately DO NOT TRY SCRAMBLED EGGS It s more a yellow goo than anything close to an egg Air conditioning in our room seemed to malfunction and it was extremely cold only solution was to turn it off , Room was clean and cozy and the price value of this hotel is excellent It s a new facility thus everything is new and shiny with LED lightning etc Good place to stay Also you gotta love the price 
496558,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Location very bad very far from the city and other recreations Very small room not comfortable bed Very poor facilities in room as well as hotel even tea or coffee maker are not available in room , New property and godd staff
496559,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, we checked in late so we had a dinner in your restaurant the food was cold salad very small price was not relevent in the shower the water was everywhere the tv in the room diff to operate no instruction book , the room clean parking price is reasonable breakfast was good
496560,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Housekeeping not up to par Had to request cups and additional toilet paper Additional soap shampoo not replaced Location was quite far from downtown , Reception staff was great very helpful Loved the room design 
496561,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, n a, The place was new clean and very comfortable Though it is a little far from downtown it is only 1 block from a metro stop so downtown is easy to get to 
496562,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Disappointing for a 4 star hotel The bathrooms are badly set up the shower is wheelchair accessible but has no door so it is impossible to prevent water from going all over the floor The beds are a bit firm and the blankets provided not that warm Power outlet in the bathroom had a short which caused the room to black out Dinner was OK but staff seemed very under pressure even though there were not that many diners and many tables got the wrong orders ours was OK but took a long time and the waitress forgot our wine Breakfast was average , Very powerful air conditioning Staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful Underground parking with a lift directly to the room floors 
496563,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, While fairly well connected to the centre via metro it was still a little difficult to find and located in the outskirts of Milan We spent the whole day at the Expo so we didn t really get a chance to explore the surrounding area but it looked like there wasn t much to offer in terms of shops or restaurants The quality of the breakfast food was excellent however I would ve liked to have seen a bit more variety Also the coffee dispensed from the coffee machine was awful get a coffee from the bar instead yes it s included in the breakfast so there s no extra charge for that I m also very aware that the Expo was going on at the time but we would have like to have been able to access our room before 2 p m I am aware that this was difficult for them to arrange however I did try to put in a request the week before and it was never answered Also other guests did get access to their room almost immediately after checking in around 12 pm Asides from this it was a great stay and we very much enjoyed our holiday , Very clean facilities and the staff were both very helpful and very friendly The room was comfortable and we had a great stay overall Very good value for money 
496564,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, 1 Furnishing in the room and bathroom no space for cosmetic bags very poor bath amenities 2 Lack of the sockets in the room 3 No tissues no tee coffee facilities 4 No drinking water 5 Complicated TV system at the same time not possible to change the language in menu , 1 Very nice personal polite and helpful effective 2 The range and variety of TV channels 
496565,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, This hotel is similar to a prison The hotel gate and wall is designed with exaggerated security Staff was almost very bad no smiled faces and the worst dealing We ve faced from a hotel classified 4 stars hotel The room size was different from what we saw in Booking They ignore our request to cancel the reservation because these notified comments although we ask them to cancel and charge the first night and refund the other two nights The location is very bad it s far from the center far from the airport far from every thing , Nothing special 
496566,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Breakfast very poor and very basic and not worth the money we paid No free TV No tissues supplied Staff couldn t help with tours and what to see in Milan they just didn t want to help There wasn t even leaflets on where to go and to do in Milan They wanted to make as much money as they could from guests , Free wifi

496571,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, Take care where you put your car in the garage there are tubes loosing some calcareous liquid which could harm the paint of the vehicle , Very Clean place efficient staff even though some of them one tended not to understand that not everybody are from Milan the location is not spectacular but ok because of a metro station at little steps from the hotel
496572,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, The working zone wasn t totally clean when we arrived seemed that some maintnance work hadn t been approprietly cleaned , Room and hotel design breakfast the staff we arrived earlier than expected but a room was prompbly available that was really nice

496584,Hotel degli Arcimboldi, We booked a normal double room and we expected to get that but instead they gave us a double room for disabled people and when we asked them why they said this is the only room available s The room was fine but u wont feel comfortable in the bathroom as its totally designed for disabled ppl The breakfast is a big disappointment The food they are offering is not enough and with bad quality Ppl were waiting in lines just to have a cup of coffee or a orange juice No tea cups or glasses so u keep waiting for the staff to bring and when they do you will see a shocking view of ppl running and fighting to have a cup , The hotel style is modern The staff are really helpful speacially Veronica Alberta in the front desk who were super helpful and patient in guiding us in the city main attractions
