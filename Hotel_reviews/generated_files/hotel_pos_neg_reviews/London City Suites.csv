187955,London City Suites, The hotel is a little walk from the metro stations in the jungle of the glassy office buildings and it is a bit difficult to find even for the second time Nescafe was not replaced so one of us had to dress up in the morning and get coffee from the ground floor Very expensive breakfast , It was not the first time everything is excellent very nice place to stay for a weekend Lovely pub connected to the hotel lovely terrace on the other side of the street to sit outside for a drink Great coffee for free on ground floor for the guests We got upgraded and my partner got a BD present from the hotel which was very kind thank you 
187956,London City Suites, The room was much smaller than the pictures on the website I narrowed the search to have a hotel with parking which it says on booking com that this hotel has parking facilities but it DOES NOT This is simply bad advertising and scamming , The rooms were clean The staff was very responsive

187961,London City Suites, Very hot night Air conditioning units began to rattle badly at about 2 30 am So loud sleep impossible In desperation we rang down to reception who moved us to a different room This was even worse The room was on floor M had no secondary glazing and the traffic noise was appalling We hated it so much we checked out a 4am there being no point in staying longer since neither of us could sleep A shame We were celebrating a birthday,No Positive
187962,London City Suites, Breakfast price is over the top , An imaginative conversion of the old Whitbread Brewery into a luxury hotel which is in a very quiet spot at weekends No doubt it s busier in the week but our room was at the back South Wing and didn t overlook any roads only other tall buildings Great coffee from the Nespresso machine Pleasant scent from the scent machine Fruit in the room Very comfortable bed Do let the porter show you how the technology works in the room we didn t have time and had to learn the bath controls the hard way

187964,London City Suites, With a major rugby match being televised during our stay we had chosen the hotel partly for its Sky Sport channels Unfortunately that channel didn t work on the day The reception suggested it was a network wide problem but we really didn t buy that explanation and think their IT team could have done a little more to investigate urgently A few minutes interference would have been explained easily but 2 hours of video with seriously impaired audio seems unlikely to us I guess you can t please all the people all the time though , The location close to three stations suited us really well There was a fantastic selection of restaurants nearby The concierge service was outstanding 
187965,London City Suites,No Negative, Beautifully decorated Rooms were lovely Little kitchen type area in room with microwave and sink Bed was super comfy Loved it all and Staff were amazingly helpful and friendly

187968,London City Suites, We didn t order any room service but we did look at the menu and had we wanted anything would have been put off at the prices 9 for porridge made with hot water and 3 50 for a cup of tea is a bit steep even for a London hotel But lots of places to eat nearby , Beds were very comfortable Rooms had everything we could have needed Very luxurious and loved the Elimis bath products 
187969,London City Suites, Its a little outdated shower sprayed water in all directions light switches too complicated and the do not disturb maid button goes inside the wall , The room overall 
187970,London City Suites, I forgot my passport at reception when i check in I noticed that on the way back to airport at coach and went run back to hotel to collect it I was almost missing the flight I stayed at hotel for 2 days and nobody told me that i forgot it even during the check out process Everything was perfect but this , Yatak

187977,London City Suites, My wife thought the bed was too high She had to jump up in the air to get in We both thought the lighting controls very complicated , Beds were very comfortable
187978,London City Suites, It was like a maze tryin to find our room on the south wing we got a little lost but there was a door at the elevator in the south wing that made it easier although we were told it closed at 10pm, Location was great right outside the Barbican theatre
187979,London City Suites, Room wasn t set up for a couple had to get extra toiletries and the dressing gown but this has been addressed and minor room was slightly small with regards to us staying 3 nights and had 2 large suitcases but normally wouldn t be an issue if you are staying longer and have lots of luggage as no where to put stuff ask for large room as they do have them , The bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in pillows great to as I am fussy the noise reduction was great didn t hear a thing outside Great staff made to feel welcome 
187980,London City Suites, No terrace on the roof and very long corridors because of the old building but in the same time the good quality of rooms It was value for money and located in a good place That s why it was my choice But 1 night I stayed in their second hotel which advise me in a hotel due to no availability for the first night Lond City Houses located nearby and had a little bit more quality there and good terrace on the roof for breakfast and nice city view So I can advise both of this hotels to stay , Good location Near barbican parking and almost in the center of City 
187981,London City Suites, Lighting in the room over complicated and confusing with numerous switches on both sides of the bed to switch on and off all the different types of lighting in the room , Good facilities and refreshments in the room Clean bathroom and shower 
187982,London City Suites, The light switches are a bit confusing i e not well positioned for the lights that they operate and some rooms are a bit dim , Having stayed at the London City Suites a few months ago I was so impressed that I ventured back again for another stay The staff are so welcoming attentive friendly and helpful Nothing is too much trouble at all The property is well positioned for both Liverpool St station and Barbican station as well as buses Plenty of great walks around the area including Spitalfields The rooms are comfortable and well fitted out I d thoroughly recommend staying at the London City Suites 
187983,London City Suites, Left tablet called and they didn t send email Emailed twice and they didn t reply called and they kept putting the phone down I can t say anything good at the moment because they are still not responding to emails at all, Not good service at all arrogant staff not helpful
187984,London City Suites, The suites were incredibly difficult to find We had to ask several people This could be approved by putting the name of the hotel on the confirmation ,No Positive
187985,London City Suites, Very small detail but the reception does not take any Maestro cards for payment , The hotel is located relatively close to the tube station Moorgate easy to reach by walking We got an upgrade and therefore stayed in a really nice room The employees were very helpul and friendly There is a waggon with hot coffee and the in the lobby where guests can help themselves with a beverage There is also some fruit and some magazines in the room very nice details that made the hotel a little bit better than the normal hotel in london The best thing for us was that you can really sleep in without being disturbed by the cleaners Also the check out time is rather late noon which we really liked Still when we arrived early on our first day they already had a room ready for us Eventhough we were about two hours too early to check in time 
187986,London City Suites, My stay was a gift from my mother she booked using her credit card but on the day I saw the small print on the booking saying you needed to bring the card it was booked on I called the hotel to ask what to do the man I spoke to was very unhelpful he spent a long time explaining that I needed to fill in a form and get my mother to fill one in as well only to say that had to be done 72 hours before the booking and therefore I couldn t do that My mother also called and received similarly unhelpful service Thankfully on arrival the lady who checked us in was a lot more helpful and accommodating , The hotel was of a very high standard the bed was very comfy if a little narrow the bath was massive 
187987,London City Suites, The bed was a bit too soft for my liking and there was some mould in the shower which was quite surprising given the high quality of the rest of the hotel room , High quality room Good location for what I needed but if you want to be closer to restaurants and shops maybe it s not the best Well stocked mini bar and fruit in the room which was a nice touch It was also great to have an iron and ironing board available in the room without having to call for it 
187988,London City Suites, The place needs a bit of a facelift if you look hard enough One of the chairs was ripped on the arm The bathroom floor heating was not working But these weren t deal breakers The place was still worth the bargain , Great staff Was greeted and treated like royalty The room was very clean and the extras that came with it made me feel at home like the fruit umbrella free international call phone sewing kit etc The bed was very comfortable 
187989,London City Suites, Breakfast very expensive didn t try it so no idea what we missed but had a great breakfast at a nearby cafe for 1 3rd of the price , Staff very helpful excellent location close to cultural venues restaurants and bars easy access to centre
187990,London City Suites, Staff acted like robots no genuine smiles The only staff that are worth mentioning is the door man and Gemma from guest relations Gemma was very natural and took the time to talk to us and make us feel welcomed although it was on our last day I wish we could have met her before She is definitely very human and have great customer service skills, Bed was extremely comfortable and room was cleaned twice a day
187991,London City Suites, Nothing that I didn t like, Super friendly staff spacious clean rooms nice decor great location short distance away from tube station brilliant value for money made us feel extremely welcomed and surprised us with a few special treats for my girlfriend and I s Anniversary 
187992,London City Suites, Breakfast was awful the first coffee was cold and when sent back was replaced with something to strong to even drink I gave up after that the food was old and stewed and the choice was poor would definitely not waste time or money trying the breakfast again would have expected much better for the money , The room was very comfortable and well equipped

187997,London City Suites,No Negative, The bed was sumptuous and we both slept really well Room was so quiet we didn t hear a thing Staff were extremely polite Great location for St Paul s Millennium Bridge and the South Bank 
187998,London City Suites, Not a lot of natural light in the room a bit gloomy Many different switches for many different lights in the room a bit hard irritating to figure out how to turn them off A few small eateries within walking distance to the hotel but not a very lively area overall Two bottles of water in the room but only upon arrival and not replenished Because it s an old hotel the way from the reception to the room is a labyrinth be on your toes Found it expensive for what it was 17 pounds for breakfast seemed a bit high , They provide a local cell phone for free that you can use during the stay to help get around the city make local calls This was brilliant Great tub and shower Cream for coffee in the room Butter cookies in the lobby in the morning Near a French bistro Cote that was terrific Very quiet and solid construction barely heard the neighbors Very comfy beds and linens Fruit in the room Noon check out time 
187999,London City Suites,No Negative, The staff are all very attentive and helpful Housekeeping even noticed that I liked peppermint tea and without me asking left extra tea bags during the turndown servicing Rooms are comfortable there s a heated towel rail in the bathroom 
188000,London City Suites, Staff are mixed some are great others can be a little pretentious i think they forget they work there and don t own the hotel but other than that most are great , I can be very harsh with my reviews but i am always truthful and this hotel is a real beauty gorgeous rooms its only 5 mins from nearest tube stop they literally cover everything to the finest detail the bathroom sink and bath and mugs and saucers for tea making are all villeroy boch the biscuits are gorgeous upon arrival basket of fruit and water the mini bar has a great slippers and bathrobes even nice bags to put any shopping in literally everything you need and the shower products are elemis It is all state of the art technology the staff can be a little too over helpful yes i shouldn t complain but it can be a little annoying but apart from that i can honestly say i will return over and over well done breakfast is steep at 24 per person but great though 
188001,London City Suites, Very good overall experience and these points are very minor I was told there was no bar open when I returned to the hotel at about 11 30pm The room was a little warm without the aircon on and the quite costly room service breakfast was extremely tasty but a little tepid , Very comfy bed quiet Club Room extremely well fitted out Even had a complimentary Android device for use Staff were very friendly and efficient Breakfast was very tasty 
188002,London City Suites, Very noisy room lots of busses at night windows does not stop the noise Did not sleep at all I asked with my booking s quiet room at check in I re checked it it was a quiet room this was confirmed A room with at least 90 dBA of street noise was the result , Location is good
188003,London City Suites, A bar would have been nice to chill and have a couple of drinks before dinner, Everything would love to stay again Staff excellent from door man to receptionists really felt welcome The room was excellent and the bed was the best I have slept in 
188004,London City Suites, There is no real heart to the hotel bars and restaurants are all public commercial outlets, Best use of space in room and public areas even though the square foot is small
188005,London City Suites, the room wasn t as clean as one would expect from a hotel of this standing There was a coke bottle lid on the floor behind the curtains when I arrived and when getting into bed I found 2 hairs on the pillow Not enough to leave but not what I expect from this hotel chain Also I used the soap and they didn t replace it the next day just put the empty bottle in the correct place really I pointed these things out and received an sorry but it was empty and delivered with little effort or conviction I ve stayed in the other hotel in Finsbury Circus several time and always much better so very disappointing , the bed was nice

188007,London City Suites, I think that the bed was too soft it should be harder The bottles with shampoo etc could be bigger , My room was quiet and cosy bathroom with bathtube which I love and glass wall between the room which you can cover Close to the St Paul s cathedral and London Museum metro stations and Tesco Very nice smiling personel Good quality for the price for the booking Genius 
188008,London City Suites, Rooms could be slightly bigger but it s London , Amazing venue placed in Barbican area It s an old brewery and the site is amazing Shoreditch area is a walk away and Liverpool st as well Highly recommended

188016,London City Suites, Our card was declined twice whilst paying for the room so had to pay cash yet the bank told us the hotel HAD taken it so in fact paid 3 times Was alot of time and inconvenience in trying to sort it out and really put a dampener on our stay , Everything

188020,London City Suites, Location wasn t the greatest unless you have business close by It is located in a business district and most shops and restaurants were closed on the weekend I thought it was slightly over priced as well and expected more , Great Bathroom Staff was incredible Close to public transportaion including metro and buses I was traveling alone and I felt very safe 24 hour room service was wonderful as my flight arrived very late at night 
188021,London City Suites, I traveled so many countries with 5 star hotel but I never seen that kind of bad service hotel you can find more reasonable good quality hotels instead of this hotel 1 metro station is only 5 min distance but usually weekend is out of working 2 room was tiny and noisy We complained about that and they changed the room with more noisy and double bed we are two women and our room was twin and urine smell eventhough I spent all my parfum but that smell was continued so We had to come back to our previous room one reception guy helped us only for one luggage peevishly unkindly we had 4 luggage also When I realized i forgot my shoes in the room I called to hotel for checking 1 day later They said no shoes in the room eventhough 200 certainly I put my shoes in our room I totally can say that Reception especially in charge of luggage is unkind and house keeping is quite suspisious I definitely do not recommend this hotel , nothing
188022,London City Suites, We paid our deposit at the begininning of the stay and paid in cash which we were fine with as we knew we were getting it back When it came to checking out the staff on reception had no recollection of the deposit so then we had to wait for a manager who had to check the cctv which took a while before giving us it back Also whilst I was checking out another member of staff Got us a taxi which my partner was sat in but didn t end up going anywhere because of the situation so we had to pay for the taxi which didn t go anywhere ,No Positive
188023,London City Suites, keep up the good work , I am usually super critical when it comes to hotels since I travel very often This was an amazing hotel with great price for value Trust me you will not find a better hotel in London for this price I can now say I found a hotel where I will always stay when in London
188024,London City Suites, staff Trainees gave unqualified answers instead of saying that they do not know the answer so that we lost around 2 hrs to find the spots and information that we were looking for , free mobile phone very comfortable bed soft 
188025,London City Suites, Sink overflow had mould growing in it and stunk Desk chair upholstery torn and tatty Road noise from early morning Check out queue too long to bother with , Given a complimentary cooked breakfast to compensate for check in computer having failed

188028,London City Suites, I would have appreciated some newspaper to be offered for the morning Breakfast is really expensive should be included in the price Pipes are noisy and we woke up every time somebody flushed the toilet next door The Brewery next door organised a party and people were very noisy downstairs smoking , The hotel is really nice ther was everything available what you expect in 5 star hotel Relatively spacious rooms according to London average they are huge 
188029,London City Suites, The Suites were near to each other and the soundproof quality was not too high as you could hear your neighbors through the wall so some plugs or better soundproofing would be most welcome, The croissants were flaky and lush Good Breakfast selection overall The staff were very very welcoming and nice It was my partner Birthday weekend and they offered him additional perks and made him feel very welcome He had a lovely time and we have already recommended to our friends and family Definitely a place to go for a romantic weekend with a loved one xx

188031,London City Suites, I gave my credit card details for the said booking and at 7am on the day 27 December of the booking the money came off my card However as the booking was a present for my parents it was my 85 year old mothers birthday when they got to the hotel they were told to pay the 99 pounds When I arrived later that day at the hotel I said to the check in clerk that the money had already been taken off my card so why did my parents have to pay to which they said I would be refunded in due course Well it is now the 20th January and nothing has been paid into my account People beware of this hotel I am going to write this up wherever I can , Apart from Taking double the money for the room I E 99 from my parents and from me what s not to like read below 
188032,London City Suites, Hotel environment great but very sad to say that food let this hotel down for me Paid for full English breakfast but only continental on offer in the club lounge Continental breakfast extremely poor for a 5 star hotel I ve had better breakfasts in a 3 star Only 3 meats some smoked salmon 2 varieties of sliced cheese some cereals 1 bowl of Greek yogurt toast and 2 varieties of pastries offered On arrival to breakfast there were no clean plates and we had to ask for them to replenish food bring butter to table etc Breakfast room busy with only one staff member who appeared put out every time you asked for something when really to give 5 star service there should have been another waiting staff Jugged Hair pub food pricey and very average , Hotel trendy quiet and modern Reception staff concierge extremely professional and welcoming they were attentive and gave the impression nothing was too much trouble Room comfortable clean and modern Nice touches like fresh fruit in room fresh coffee making facilities robes slippers free mobile phone device to make free calls abroad 
188033,London City Suites, Food choice and quality underwhelming not what you d expect given the hotel s star rating Room full of leds that won t switch off and numerous missed opportunities to attend to those small details that make all the difference , Hotel itself is reasonably smart with fresh decor Staff are friendly and helpful although the restaurant staff we met could do with some extra training 
188034,London City Suites, The breakfast could have been better but that s possibly because we went down for breakfast half an hour before it ended I m sure that it would have seemed more worthwhile if we had gone earlier , The beds are really comfy and a dream to sleep on The staff are all really friendly and make you feel welcome as soon as you step in the door The location is amazing 5 minutes away from a tube on the Northen line and 2 stops away from Charing Cross Some lovely cafes just down the road from the hotel which are slightly cheaper than the food in the hotel 
188035,London City Suites, Unfortunately there are smaller details which are not working 100 Could be easy to fix with better routines, Nice rustic hotel in a office area weekend really calm for good and bad close to 4 metro stations 2 of them with train connections

188041,London City Suites, Breakfast and laundry service over the christmas period was not good enough , It was excellent but the breakfast could have been better for the money you pay over the Xmas period

188047,London City Suites, The staff lied about the parking and as a result we had to pay 35 per day Very disappointed as this was the main reason we chose this hotel, The room was excellent very plush and clean Exactly like that photos 
188048,London City Suites, This is just personal but for me the mattress was too soft and I was considering sleeping on the floor Another downfall was that despite having a superior room we received a room with connecting doors and could hear everything going on in the next room Having a window facing the courtyard with an entrance to the Brewery wasn t ideal due to noises late at night but hey that wasn t as loud as next door occupants Our TV was defect as well however we received a complimentary breakfast which was nice as it was free However if you are not eating pork in form of cold cuts you are limited for choice which doesn t justify 22 per person , Hotel itself was beautiful Staff was friendly and welcoming Bathroom was very large and I like the Elemis Toiletries Any queries have been dealt within minutes Customer Service is great 
188049,London City Suites, didn t know reception area is in a separate building from the property where rooms are located there was no ramp going to the reception so we have to lift our heavy luggages , everything inside the room plus the mobile phone provided so handy

188078,London City Suites, I couldn t fault the hotel helpful staff lovely decor ideal location and great value for money The tea and coffee every morning was delightful too , The hotel made special arrangements for a Birthday upgraded us to a suite and gave us and the couple we were travelling with connecting rooms Oh and a free bottle of bubbly and chocolates 
188079,London City Suites, Can t think of anything we didn t like, Just love the way that the staff are so helpful and make you feel comfortable We are not exactly rich people but work really hard for our money but feel when we come there we are treated as equals and sometimes when we travel to lovely hotels we don t feel comfortable like when we stay st The Montcalm Looking forward to our next stay 
188080,London City Suites,No Negative, Staff really took care of us and the hotel itself was lovely one of the best we have stayed at We got exceptional value for money for our stay as it seems more expensive now Great location to explore
188081,London City Suites, Food we ordered was very bland and boring , It was wonderful We were only there for one night and didn t leave the room the bed was way too comfy 
188082,London City Suites, Access We had a to og over a large courtyard to initially get to the room from reception Normal access to the room was through the pub We were offered breakfast when we checked in at 17 50 per person instead of the advertised 24 50 but we rejected both offers as being exorbitantly priced So did not try the food at all in 3 Nights Reasonably priced restaurant just over the road serving excellent food not breakfast though , Very nice quite large bedroom and bathroom with large quite high comfortable bed Surprisingly quiet since there was a busy pub directly below us and a busy road outside Good free WiFi 
188083,London City Suites,No Negative, The hotel was pure luxury down to every detail from the extra comfy bed and pillows to the luxury branded Hermes shower products The staff treated us extremely well and had the friendliest doormen on earth The pub connected to hotel is a little gem Less that five minutes from a tube station only five short stops from kings cross and St Paul s only 10minute walk away 
188084,London City Suites, Nothing really absolutely everything was awesome Just missed breakfast because we had to leave early so we will have to come back to try it , Very welcoming and attentive service was excellent Room was big and bed comfortable and had everything we needed The hotel provides a mobile to use when you go to the city with free wifi and some free calls which is extremely convenient We will come back for sure 
188085,London City Suites, We didn t have a great view office block but it s London what did we expect It didn t in any way ruin our stay , The hotel is beautiful and our room was great A good size and very comfy bed with a great shower The staff were friendly and polite and couldn t have been more helpful We arrived very early and they took care of our bags which were waiting for us in our room when we got back to the hotel A great location for the tube both Barbican and Moorgate are less than a 5 min walk from the hotel Overall it was a joy to stay here and I will most definitely be returning 
188086,London City Suites, Didn t have it but thought breakfast was overpriced , Staff very welcoming friendly attentive and informative Good location Very restful decor bed was soooooo comfy good soundproofing beautiful bathroom actually had bath with great shower over Well equipped with lots of lovely extras which users of sleep and go no frills budget hotels i e us really loved 
188087,London City Suites, wifi was very patchy staff could not find my reservation for the longest time when I was checking in the property was very inflexible about making any modifications to my booking even when the request was made well in advance of the actual booking,No Positive
188088,London City Suites, We were staying in the South Wing which I m really not sure is part of City Suites or the Brewery The room was a bit of a trek from reception but we were shown in detail where to go The room was fairly small and faced onto the back of another building There was no noise from outside or from other rooms which was good apart from some kind of generator which meant we couldn t keep the window open On check in we were told we had been upgraded to a club room however there didn t seem to be any difference between our room and the standard rooms and we certainly were not informed that any benefits came with the upgrade My major criticism however would be the length of the bed My partner is only 5 10 and his feet were dangling over the edge so it would be a nightmare for anyone taller , This hotel really does feel like a touch of luxury The staff are very courteous and helpful the rooms are nicely done and everything you could need is provided We didn t have any food as the breakfast finishes quite early but Cote across the road does a nice breakfast until 12 The hotel is very conveniently located near Barbican and Moorgate If you book in advance the prices are very reasonable for the standard of accommodation in central London 
188089,London City Suites, Booking com had messed up our booking and it took a phone call to them to get it sorted out which meant we spent nearly 45 minutes at check in The receptionist was excellent at getting it sorted for us , Excellent position opposite Cote 
188090,London City Suites, Breakfast not worth the daily price rooms dark and not well appointed staff clueless complicated hotel in which to get around no CNN No value for money Cabbie could not find as hotel marketed as London City Suites yet official name is Montcalm at the Brewery, Location to my office
188091,London City Suites, Hotel is located in an old brewery which means that navigating to one s room can be a little like running a maze especially after a few drinks I found it charming but some might not , The team running this hotel is superb This was my second trip to this hotel in two weeks both times I was upgraded on check in Victoria was super kind in giving me my room well before the check in time because she knew I would be tired travelling from Canada overnight All the staff were extremely helpful in trying to make sure I had everything I might need The hotel is a short walk 30 minutes to the theatre district and has a tube station and bus stop close by for those who don t want to walk While some people claim that the breakfast is a bit pricey there are lots of cheaper options close by 
188092,London City Suites, cleaning personnel should also clean the part of the sink that is hidden by the stopper only when pulled the windows allow a lot of wind in Could not find the hotel and wandered around 15 minutes as the name I booked it on London City Suites is not the name of the hotel The Montcalm The brewery , comfy single room very clean walking distance to the Museum of London and St Paul s Cathedral
188093,London City Suites, Location in the East was fantastic for us but if you are visiting London for the first time you ll have to travel a little bit to see the sights We got a genius deal for this stay which reduced the price greatly if we were paying full price we may have expected the level of comfort and service , Staff were outstanding and welcoming the room was beautiful 
188094,London City Suites, The reception was great in general except for one trainee who was not listening to what to my question and sort of assumed what I was querying Any way no biggie , It is very different a hotel with difference Breakfast is not your classic in house hotel kitchen but outside but very near the hotel love the concept Staff are helpful in general 
188095,London City Suites, The lighting in the room whilst stylish was a little low would be nice if there was a really bright overhead that one could put on to have a good look around the room whilst packing to ensure that one has everything , Really really comfortable bed lovely shower bath facilities love that the shampoo soap etc was supplied by Elemis Friendly staff 
188096,London City Suites, The coffee on the hospitality tray filter coffee would have been much nicer and more what I would expect from a 5 star rated hotel , Beautifully decorated room fabulously comfy bed and pillows Quiet air conditioning and lots of extras 
188097,London City Suites, Difficult to figure out the buttons and there s loads of them Also heating didn t work and it was pretty chilly in the morning, Room was very nice and super clean
188098,London City Suites, The only fault there was Were the road works down the road noisy but no fault of her own , The staff were absolutely wonderful Celebrating a birthday they made us feel extremely welcome We absolutely loved it
188099,London City Suites, It was a little bit tricky to find the hotel You can just go to the hotel Montcalm on the opposite side to check in , The room was small but everything what I needed was there Very friendly and professional personnel 
188100,London City Suites, Most complicated bath to control I ve ever used Had to ring reception to get someone to show me how to fill it up The control said to fill the bath put the dial at 12 00 but we didn t realise that it was actually 2 00 Also to empty the bath I pulled and twisted the knob and it came off in my hand Had to physically put my finger nails underneath it to lift it out Cleaners need a keener eye Found 2 hair bobbles on bathroom floor and many hairs around sink , Comfy bed large bath
188101,London City Suites, Style over comfort air conditioning didn t work I was moved to another room where the A C still wouldn t stay on a cool setting Shower and bathroom fittings broken a dizzying array of lights on the roof walls lamps and even on the wall under the bed I gave up trying to find a combination that was workable The Hotel is a maze with confusing signage Staff in the evening were abrupt and bossy All in all unpleasant , Location
188102,London City Suites, Larger size bedrooms fab facilities all in too smaller space, Staff were friendly helpful hotel was clean modern yet had a good level of classic class
188103,London City Suites, Getting around the hotel it was very big , The hotel was just amazing in every way The waterfall on the wall in the reception area did it for me and the rooms were just immaculate Also being able to watch the TV from the bathroom due to having an open screen seeing through to the bedroom from the bathroom 
188104,London City Suites, If the correct name would be placed by booking com guest would find the location easier Right now it is named by booking com London City Suites but the name of the hotel is The Montcalm at the Brewery , The staff are extremly friendly and well trained 
188105,London City Suites, Being litterally chased after when entering the hotel by a very rude member of the evening team after a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant bar Shouting can I help you Can I help you Yes we re going to our room showing him the room key Was all very strange and a bit of a sour end to our stay You re only as strong as your weakest link , Check in was excellent and very much appreciate the little extra touches for the last night of our honeymoon 
188106,London City Suites, Our room was viewing the inner courtyard The empty bottles containers got emptied at 7 30 am on Saturday morning making a lot of noise and killing our lay in, Friendly staff nice room great hotel location
188107,London City Suites, Awkward kettle and design of cups and saucers high access to shelf for tea making No surfaces in bathroom for toiletries, Location ease of access cleanliness free fruit
188108,London City Suites, At 25 a tad expensive we decided to try Cote over the road and very good it was too Room not the largest and we had a superior double , Comfortable good staff hotel a bit different from the usual Some people might not like the location but I knew where it was and was more than happy I would stay here again City of London museum at Barbican worth a look 
188109,London City Suites,No Negative, Absolutely everything From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were made to feel like royalty Everything about the hotel is perfect location staff hotel room Will definitely be coming back Would highly recommend to others 
188110,London City Suites, We were left waiting for a while after asking if we could get a glass of wine in return from a day out I would expect to be able to get a drink at a 5 hotel but small issue, Room was amazing 
188111,London City Suites, Upon check in I asked for a quiet room not overlooking street side The reception staff member did his best to find the quiet room I only checked into my room in the late evening to discover that it had a tiny window facing a huge wall and very annoying noise from the ventilation system Despite earplugs sleeping pills and a pillow over my head i was not able to sleep all night What a nightmare ,No Positive
188112,London City Suites, There was nothing I didn t like about this property everything was high standards The don t have there own parking so be prepared to pay London prices for 1 night and day it was 47 on the weekend , Room service was perfect room was clean staff collected our bags and took them to our room very pleasant staff and presented very well Food is such a high standard 5 min walk to Barbican station 
188113,London City Suites, Mix up with room Double bed on arrival reserved 2 single beds A quick change of room Very obliging, Comfy bed and lovely staff Hotel very clean and tidy

188116,London City Suites, Bed very high and not supportive at the edges my wife rolled off Windows not secured or working in all rooms booked , Accommodating staff went extra for my son s 21st much appreciated Good standard of room with nice touches 
188117,London City Suites, The holder of the shower head could be better the excellent water pressure means the holder can go into an uncontrollable spin if you lose concentration for a second , The staff in the reception were very friendly and we were happy to try their recommendation of a nearby place with great coffee The room itself was very pleasant full of fun little modern gadgets I will let you discover them yourself Very good water pressure in the shower The neighborhood is nice not the boring Paddington area where it s all just hotel after hotel 
188118,London City Suites,No Negative, From the moment we arrive from the door man who was funny to the reception staff and all staff they were all just fantastic it was our 39 wedding anniversary they made it so special for us We
188119,London City Suites, First room was tiny had to move and it was OK still want to know why I never got into an apartment , Rooms have been designed and equiped to high standard bear in mind the is the Hotel never did get near the apartments
188120,London City Suites, It was perfect from start to finish , The staff was so super nice and helpful I really liked the hotel Very clean and the complimentary mobile phone in every room was amazing I have never seen a free mobile phone in hotels before which you could use for Internet and calls while you were exploring the city Seriously sooooo cool Loved it Thanks so much 
188121,London City Suites, The a c in room broke late during the night Became very warm inside the room called front desk but the line remained busy for hours So could not get through to someone in the middle of the night , 5 star luxury treatment
188122,London City Suites, Nothing, The hotel is convenient to Liverpool Street Station is beautifully decorated very clean with comfortable beds and friendly staff There was complimentary tea coffee shortbread as well as iced water and fruit that you can enjoy whilst sitting in the lobby As the air conditioning wasn t working in our original room and it was very warm we were upgraded to a Montcalm Club room This room type was more spacious and a little more luxurious than the standard room as you would expect and I would book this the next time The staff were very helpful quick to deal with any issues and did all they could to ensure that we had a pleasant stay 
188123,London City Suites,No Negative, This boutique hotel is great value for money beautiful decor and perfect touches to the room amenities Breakfast is at the pub just a few doors down fantastic selection and also quirky the staff at the hotel couldn t do enough for us would definitely recommend
188124,London City Suites,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and the continental breakfast was excellent The room was very comfortable and the location made it very easy to see London s attractions 
188125,London City Suites, Nothing , A beautiful clean hotel with state of the art rooms Customer service was brilliant staff went out of their way to make me and my family comfortable Special mention to Christina she s a credit to the hotel Wish we could have stayed longer 
188126,London City Suites, Hotel layout was confusing Room was very close to another office building approx 1 m out of the window and very dingy The room was not particularly well lit from a functional point of view , Nice room bed shower 
188127,London City Suites,No Negative, Wonderful experience Very luxurious excellent staff superb room excellent housekeeping A couple of small problems eg safe did not lock at first were dealt with immediately Location is good close enough to everything yet away from the craziness of central London Loved it and will definitely return whenever we are in London and will enthusiastically recommend to friends 
188128,London City Suites, Less complicated lighting and shower But to be honest it wasn t a big problem , The staff were fabulous Warm friendly polite welcoming and added to the specialness of our 25th wedding anniversary celebrations The Jugged Hare was outstanding 
188129,London City Suites, No faults what so ever , Could not fault this property Came for my birthday with family and friends and had rooms upgraded Nothing was too much hassle for the staff they were more then helpful The best service I have ever received anywhere Rooms were gorgeous quiet included everything you needed and super clean 
188130,London City Suites, Shower water pressure could have been better The waterfall shower had almost no pressure and the handheld shower wasn t much better Also the water temperature didn t seem to be easily adjustable Not too much of an issue as it was warm at least , Very comfortable bed and friendly staff Room was tidy and clean and the bed was turned down for us 
188131,London City Suites,No Negative, Loved the attention to detail in rooms A phone for free calls umbrella in the wardrobe and lovely toiletries It was very pleasant indeed Would definitely stay there again Close to underground and lovely eateries around 
188132,London City Suites, Appalling housekeeping we waited in vain for a rotten pear to be removed from the fruit basket Bathroom was not properly cleaned e g watermarks on basin surround not removed We could not sleep due to the rattles in The air conditioning, Concierge did his job well 
188133,London City Suites, The mattress was rather uncomfortable it felt like I was rolling off it The tea making facilities could have been in a larger space and it was very awkward to fill the kettle from the bathroom sink from where it was impossible to get cold water , The staff were very friendly The room was clean and the location was good With the double glazing the room was quiet 
188134,London City Suites,No Negative, This is a really nice hotel with clean and new facilities I enjoyed a 1 night stay as the offices of my company is a 5 minute walk from the hotel Usually I would have to pay twice the price for a hotel like this 
188135,London City Suites, Facilities divided in several non connected buildings , Interesting free extra services as having a cell phone with unlimited access to internet during the time we spent at the hotel
188136,London City Suites, The area was quite noisy at night settled down not too long after midnight though so wasn t really an issue , Staff were polite and helpful The tv wasn t working in my room unable to fix they upgraded me to a better room complimentary 
188137,London City Suites, The rain showers in both rooms looked good but in fact lacked power , Friendly and helpful staff very well equipped nicely furnished rooms with lots of extras Unfortunately the air conditioning in our room failed to work on our first evening they were unable to fix this however we were quickly moved to another room which was in fact a better room than the original The Hotel is very handy for the Barbican tube stop and there is a bus stop right outside the Hotel Equally if you enjoy exploring London by foot you can easily walk to many attractions We found this three night break to be of exceptionally good value for this standard of Hotel in London 
188138,London City Suites, We were there for 2 nights and didn t receive biscuits on the 2nd day lighting was very impressive but a bit dim in places where you could have had something a bit brighter Strange glass window between the bedroom and bathroom and took a while to find the controls to bring a blind down for a bit of privacy , On our arrival we were greeted with a very friendly and helpful manner We had a free upgrade as our son had organised a bottle of champagne for our 40th wedding anniversary so didn t know what our original room would have been Saying that the room was amazing as it was a Montcalm Club room with mood lighting everywhere even in the skirting board 
188139,London City Suites, Would suggest that if a client s booking confirmation says London City Suites that somewhere at the entrance of the hotel there is a sign that says this London City Suites The Brewery , Location decor of room welcoming professional staff made for an outstanding stay 
188140,London City Suites,No Negative, Great hotel in a very charming old brewery the staff was super super friendly Nice clean rooms with everything you need Close to Barbican Metro station 
188141,London City Suites, Room was cramped with some shoddy workmanship on show The bed had a slope on it the shower is tiny and has been installed badly , Incredible staff and facilities Excellent location particularly tranquil at the weekend 
188142,London City Suites, There was very little I did not like The hotel is a little distant from the Underground for someone hobbling along on a broken ankle in a boot but the staff were quite helpful in acquiring taxis for us , When checking in at London City Suites at least early in the morning you actually check in at the desk at the Montcalm at The Brewery London City which is located across the street My daughter and I and her broken ankle arrived very early in the morning and asked to leave our bags until later in the day after we had done some sightseeing When we returned the bellhop escorted us to an upgraded Club Room at The Montcalm at the Brewery which was handicapped accessible So I haven t actually stayed at London City Suites I have stayed at The Montcalm at the Brewery The whole point of this is the staff noticed our need for an accessible room and they made it happen even if we didn t actually have reservations at the Montcalm and even if we didn t ask for an upgrade It was a wonderful surprise The room came with a free cell phone with free international calling and internet access and maps we were allowed to take out of the room with us as we explored the city There were current issues of magazines a small fruit bowl an umbrella robes and house shoes 
188143,London City Suites, The breakfast could be included in the rate and was a little pricey , Located nearby tube station Room was extremely comfortable and very quiet even though I was on the ground floor and lots of people walked by Room Service was excellent and the staff especially the doorman were very helpful The fluffy bathrobe and slippers were a nice touch 
188144,London City Suites, Nothing all was great , The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived The room was comfortable and very well appointed fantastic bed The Jugged Hare on the corner was great and the beer garden opposite complete with leather Chesterfields was ideal on a warm summers evening The Barbican is just across the road and well worth a trip to see an exhibition or just for a coffee by the fountains The whole area was much more local than touristy which helped add to our relaxed weekend I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a London break with a bit of a difference 
188145,London City Suites, Tv remote all 3 of them did not work well with television I assume they are cheap universal remote controls This issue made me purchase a movie by mistake and I got billed I won t let this issue reflect on my overall experience , Everything They went the extra mile and gave a full 5 star experience 
188146,London City Suites, 1st room was like a prison cell kept awake by woman screeming having rampant sex early hours room service witnessed it room 326 then moved to next club room 220 faulty light no extractor working in bathroom pubic hair in bed hairs on towel in bathroom Moved to a Wow room was a nice room 4 poster bed but no sockets for laptop or phone bedding issues air conditioning took forever to change bit noisey next to staircase and doors 028 Biggest concern as an ex hotelier and ex steward raf looking after our Royals safety is paramount The sauna Steam room is down steep staircase in a dungeon i tripped in steam room pulled emergency cord was there 15 minutes nobody came to my aid Was told later there was a fault with locator it s been three days of having no relaxation or time to unwind asked to sit down and resolve my issues was offered discount which i didn t want i needed to extend my stay because flight not available until Wednesday so they looked to book extended stay but wanted 500 for a further two nights Staff all agency low paid as was Shaftesbury Hyde Park International owned by same people who actually had a party here in The Brewery last night whilst i was on the floor in sauna so pretty poor for William Windsor King Producer Director, The location was the only positive although the rooms were of a good standard i found lots of faults 
188147,London City Suites,No Negative, The bed was amazing and so was the facilities Staff were really friendly and my stay was exceptional I lived like a Princess Thank you so much for an amazing stay 
188148,London City Suites, My room was on the ground floor right by the outside seating area So it makes sense to have locked windows But I couldn t get the curtains to open either which made it a little dark Didn t matter much as I was out all day but for my next stay and I will definitely come back I will ask for a room on an upper floor Also the fact that the Fire Door was unlocked all day made me a little uncomfortable But all in all this was a brilliant find and I would definitely recommend , Staff made me feel really welcome Lovely comfortable bed pillows slippers I even discovered a mini sewing kit Great choice for room service Nice toiletries and towels Free wifi umbrella and even a mobile phone for use during the stay I d never seen that before in any other hotel And thoughtfully Prosecco in the minibar 
188149,London City Suites, Only wish that we stayed longer to enjoy the hotel even more , The staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble The room was fabulous good toiletries provided and the most comfortable bed ever 
188150,London City Suites, The noise outside our bedroom from roadworks but that wasn t the hotel s fault There is nothing to dislike about this hotel , This is a lovely hotel to stay at and a great location The staff are always helpful and accommodating from the welcoming doorman who has a smile whatever time of the day and reception staff to the managers Simone in particular is always there to welcome us We are returning guests Nothing is a problem for her and we were fortunate enough to be upgraded too It s the little touches that count sometimes hand written welcome cards and wine are waiting for us Be loyal to them and they will be loyal back 
188151,London City Suites, Nothing, Staff very welcoming and helpful nothing too much trouble and great knowledge Beautiful building Rooms are a nice size and lovely facilities Great location
188152,London City Suites, Nothing, Everything the bed was so comfortable The toiletries lovely All the little extras like slippers robe and fluffy towels Rain shower spotlessly clean 
188153,London City Suites, Liked everything, Bed extra comfy staff so friendly Given prosecco chocolate for our anniversary and my husband s birthday which was a lovely surprise 
188154,London City Suites, I foudn the room airconditioned to be very cold and it took a long while to warm up , Great service from the staff I got this on a bargain last minute deal and it was fabulous 
188155,London City Suites, No complaints at all, Everything was about this hotel was just incredible The room was absolutely massive and I cant believe the value for money The best hotel I have ever stayed in in London by far Me and my boyfriend stayed here for our anniversary this weekend and it made everything all the more romantic Location is also fantastic 2 minute walk away from moorgate station 
188156,London City Suites, Its not negative but a neutral comment The good things came for a price on a normal rate it is what you can expect for the rate and also worth it But when you get an discounted rate we had 100BP per night it is absolutely recommendable , Very nice staff even if we were not directly dressed 5 star Slayer shirt and camo short they did not make any difference Great location just a few steps to the next frequent subway and a supermarket close by Room is very nice and clean many light switches took us a minute to turn out all lights on the first day 
188157,London City Suites, Name on B com was different to the actual name of the hotel so caused quite a bit of confusion trying to find our way after 21 hours of flying , Excellent hotel in a fantastic location Within walking distance of the Tower of London Tower Bridge St Pauls Cathedral and the point to collect our hop on hop off bus Very accommodating staff enjoyed our stay 
188158,London City Suites, We could have stayed longer , Lovely style and we were upgraded for free to the WOW room as it was our honeymoon 4 poster bed and bathroom that overlooked the bedroom 
188159,London City Suites,No Negative, Location is great two blocks from Moorgate Metro Station The place is very fancy and accommodations really comfortable But the coolest thing was HANDY a smartphone provided by the hotel with free internet and many tips to better enjoy London 
188160,London City Suites, The temperature of the water in the bathroom took ages to change just couldn t get it to work , They went out of their way to make us feel welcome It was to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and they left a bottle of wine bath bombs balloons and rose petals which was just lovely 
188161,London City Suites, It was like a maze trying to find our room and the TV remote was a bit temperamental but that was all , Bed was super comfy shower was lovely Very clean staff were really friendly

188165,London City Suites, The rooms as amazing as they were are quite dark and I enjoy a bit of light coming through the windows but not really an issue just my own preference , This was a stay the day after our wedding and they made us feel like VIPs They upgraded us for free gave us use of the free bar breakfast and even sent up champagne to our room While we were out they decorated the room with towel swans and rose petals It was amazing and made the whole stay extra special The receptionist was so kind to us The rooms are gorgeous and for the price you pay even without the extras we received it is amazing value I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely stay again The location is good only 5 minutes walk from a tube and St Pauls Cathedral Thank you so much for making our stay so special
188166,London City Suites, the room was smaller than I expected since it was called city suites and there was not much light into the room from very small high windows I assume this is related to the building being a former brewery The soundproofing of the doors could be improved as I could hear people talking in the corridor late at night , location was excellent and very convenient near 2 metros Bed was very comfortable and amenities and cleanliness were very good Staff very friendly and helpful
188167,London City Suites, Some peoples reviews on here need a reality check everything is within walking distance i mean the pub for example is 20 yds away and eating places are on the same st, Location near moorpark liverpool st for getting around pubs and eating places right on your doorstep staff very helpful and friendly rooms big enough with everything required for a short stay 
188168,London City Suites, Couldn t turn off some of the lights without removing key card The kettle would not stay switched on either so I had to stand with the switch held in to operate Breakfast not worth the price , Comfy bed Courteous and helpful staff

188200,London City Suites, The rooms were small and the closet space beyond tiny Because it s on the edge of the City of London there wasn t a lot of night life or restaurant life nearby , Great staff and wonderful historic building that has been beautifully modernized The beds and linens were very comfortable 
188201,London City Suites, Location is in the CBD If you happened to stay during the weekend or bank holiday nothing much is going in the immediate vicinity It s quiet but the Jugged Hare pub is always which part of the hotel The ambience of the hotel is a little stiff not so welcoming Noise from next room can be heard in the bathroom it is less pronounced if you close the bathroom door Room 152 can be smelly in the bathroom as it is on top of the restaurant and the smell of onion sipped in the window which is not properly insulated Complimentary water should be available in the room no need to call the reception , Comfortable bed modern room and cleanliness Easy walk to Barbican station Moorgate and Liverpool Street

188206,London City Suites, The pillows were too soft for us We prefer firmer pillows for support , It was my husband s birthday and the staff made him feel very special by greeting us at check in and adding all the little touches to the room Thank you to all the staff for their helpfulness and friendliness We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and had a lovely nights sleep Will definitely stay again 
188207,London City Suites, The breakfast fell short of expectation It was cold the bacon like beef jerky eggs were sloppy and I would have expected a personal pot of tea however it came en mass tasted cheap and very weak Overpriced for what it was The Savoy only charge 5 more I will have the continental next time 14 cheaper and a lot more appetising, What a great location The room was spacious and clean it smelt clean The white linen looked crisp and inviting The bed was a fantastic size and very comfortable The decor was muted and relaxing with ambient adjustable lighting The bathroom was modern tiled again clean and very well appointed A lovely feature was a choice of waterfall shower power shower and a bath I really felt welcomed by the added touch of rose petals balloons complimentary wine and cake also the hand written note was a lovely gesture

188213,London City Suites, The TV didn t work on Sunday morning and they weren t able to fix it Couldn t turn off one small light in the room so had to remove the key card not so good if need air con , Beds were very comfortable Good decoration in the room Pleasant staff and nice lobby Very central for our needs 
188214,London City Suites, Someone left the alarm clock on for 7am which was quite stressful after we had been to a work event and didn t get in until late Also the television wouldn t turn off when we used the remote control and when we tried to turn it off from the unit so we had to leave it on while we were sleeping which was quite off putting because it the brightness kept waking us up , The bed was very comfortable and the room was fairly clean although rubbish from the previous guests was still on the floor under the bedside table 
188215,London City Suites, I tried contacting the hotel through booking com twice to get directions and request early check in but received no answer Maybe my fault for not calling internationally instead of emailing but still thought I should receive an answer , Location is close 6 min walk to moorgate and Barbican tube stations We walked to most places or took an uber which was fine by us Bed was excellent and comfy Staff was friendly 
188216,London City Suites, The room was lacking in daylight as we were over looked by a very tall office building we could not open the window due to what I presume was generator noise coming from the building over looking us , Clean comfortable compact rooms Great location for exploring the city Very helpful staff
188217,London City Suites, We checked in late after a long flight but we re not given a room in the London city suits building but in the brewery side of the Montcalm opposite This is not good at anytime with luggage given the layout of the hotel where lots of stairs cannot be avoided Then to get into a room with a large open window to the bathroom without a functioning blind we had to be moved to another wing of the hotel It was late and involved even more stairs before getting to our room which was still not on the side of the hotel originally booked The morning was even worse with an early start heavy suitcases to drag up and down stairs as you couldn t take lifts All of which was before even continental breakfast was available in the restaurant annoyingly For me this was a generally poor experience and not 5 star as advertised ,No Positive
188218,London City Suites, The breakfast is expensive and the room is small , The location is perfect near to the tube 3 mins walk the staff very good wifi and many restaurant around the hotel

188220,London City Suites, Rooms are teeny tiny My first room had a window over the pub which made a good night s sleep difficult The room I got as a replacement had no window only a frosted glass panel up near the ceiling that didn t open This room was a bit stuffy but running the fan wasn t a solution since it was rather loud , Excellent staff I asked for another room and they moved me with no fuss The second room was larger and had a tub so that was nice Location Beds extra comfortable Complementary fruit and water was a nice touch
188221,London City Suites, I was disappointed in the breakfast which I thought was very expensive 24 95 compared to other hotels on Booking com Yet it was nothing special at all Tea was poured for you out of a pot carried about by the serving staff when then appeared You didn t get your own pot Breakfast was also in a pub a few metres down the road so it felt a bit disjointed Beware of the tube disruptions on a Sunday and check your route The Barbican station was shut , The staff were very friendly and helpful reception was very welcoming The room was small but very nice and comfortable it was a single It was a lovely old building that used to be a brewery An easy walk to St Paul s Cathedral I even thought about going to the morning service there before breakfast The price at 100 for a single room was I realise good for London Sunday night and not a lot of places offer single rooms It was certainly a good place but not sure I would rush to stay there again but it was fine generally 
188222,London City Suites, my room was on the wasting which took me 2 times to figure out how to get there , Nice Location in an old Brewery Right between 2 tube stations great and friendly staff 
188223,London City Suites, It would be good if the hotel could provide a pair of shoes to wear in room , The hotel really worth the price The hotel is close to the visa center The staff is really friendly Cause the hotel is really complex The staff will take you to the room each time The size of the room is good as well

188227,London City Suites, Was made to pay for the hotel again as I had lost my bank card so no longer had the card I had paid with so had to fork out 144 again and now have to wait a week for money back plus they took 50 put my bank for mini bar witch I did not use and also have to wait a week for that money to come back ,No Positive

188232,London City Suites, That I didn t book for more than one night , I arrived at the hotel honestly expecting a kind of self catering room like you d find at a Marriott or similar and found to my absolute delight the most sumptuous room I ve stayed in in years The staff particularly Gabrielle were incredibly welcoming without being intrusive and couldn t have been more helpful Absolutely stellar service We also had dinner in the pub restaurant that night and it was to die for In all one of the best experiences I have ever had This will be my go to in London for business and or pleasure in the future Perfect in every way 
188233,London City Suites, Just need to precise that the reception for check in and check out is in the Montcalm hotel And the movie I paid to watch couldn t play until the end got blocked, Nice staff got a room at the Montcalm as complementary Very convinient small room but very comfy and clean 
188234,London City Suites, Breakfast was a bit pricey in the hotel , We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and found that the location to be perfect Breakfast wasn t in our meal plan but we found a great reasonable restaurant across the street We would stay again if we were to visit London in the future 
188235,London City Suites, Was a bit difficult to find as the name of the hotel on our booking was London City Suites and the name of the hotel was actually the Montcalm A bit confusing Hotel was about half way between 2 tube stations so not that close to tube Expensive breakfast , Literally across the road from the Barbican Centre which was convenient for an event we had to attend Nice rooms Helpful and friendly staff 
188236,London City Suites, The bed was very high felt like we were climbing on each time Also the room was very complicated to get to having to take lift from reception then cross over to another building take another lift , It was a 15 min walk to shoreditch
188237,London City Suites, Indifferent welcome Claustrophobic TV barely on the wall and held by a piece of wood Noisy as room was next to the lift despite asking for quiet room and poor value for money Breakfast another 25 When it is called City Suites and has 5 rating I expect much more , Relatively close to the City Nice bathroom 
188238,London City Suites, Customer lifts were a little dull and also they couldn t accommodate to connecting an iPhone to the speaker system, Mood lighting and atmosphere Bathroom was amazing and so was tub
188239,London City Suites, The room was small the air con was noisy and worked intermittently We were unable to open the window so it felt quite oppressive not the easiest room to access Breakfast at the jugged hare is very expensive , The staff were very welcoming and the room was very clean quite a good location

188248,London City Suites, It s just a suggestion put proper mugs in the bedrooms As a tea lover the little cups are just not big enough , Comfy room lovely staff great facilities
188249,London City Suites, The room we had like a generated noise coming from outside We couldn t sleep because the noise was quite loud and was annoying We complained when we checked out and was told they would look in to it I rather have stayed in a travel lodge Wasn t expressed also when I booked there was a parking symbol on the website but nearest parking cost additional 30 pounds ,No Positive
188250,London City Suites, Layout of hotel shower controls room controls confusing over complicated and annoying Expected dining facilities and a bar on site rather than a pub up the road , Staff pleasant and welcoming Proximity to The Barbican excellent

188252,London City Suites, Worst worn out matrass I ever had on any hotel and I am travelling quite a bit A hammok is tough in direct comparison The hotel is a conglomarate of different formats in a former brewery complex run under a central Management City suits is signposted nowhere and staff appears used to pick up a guests who do not find the place while standing in front of it Extrem noise from deliveries 2 o clock in the morning in the hotel yard , Staff overall friendly and engaged but of limited help if wake up call is at the wrong time and the communicated hairdryer does not exist in the room

188257,London City Suites, Breakfast is slightly on the expensive side considering what it entails Wellness facilities are lacking , The staff was very friendly and helpful The single bedroom while small had all the great comforts you d expect 
188258,London City Suites, Made to wait 25 minutes for our room to be ready even though we arrived at 2pm as per the check in time Breakfast was a joke and can only match that of a 1star establishment Cold food wait for tables to be cleared no cutlery severely understaffed Room had to be reset due to malfunctioning pad In the room And I was charged twice for my stay even though I had already paid for my room before my stay , Room beautiful and very clean
