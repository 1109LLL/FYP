479839,NH Milano Machiavelli, Shame there was no gym but there is a nice leafy park with a 1 8km running track just a few hundred metres away very popular with local runners which makes for a good alternative , Probably one of the best all round value hotels in central Milan Customer service excellent markedly better than anything I ve encountered elsewhere in Italy Smart modern hotel in good location walking distance to the town centre Secure spacious and clean underground parking Good breakfast Very competitive price through Booking com Regrettably didn t get the names of all the staff to acknowledge them but Sara and her colleagues on the front desk were especially helpful and impressively fluent in several languages

479847,NH Milano Machiavelli, 1 We came around 1 a m from the airport and found the the hotel cancelled our booking The clerk at reception Rocco told us that he tried to call us and tried to charge the credit card why and then cancelled the booking He called a taxi and sent us to another NH Hotel for this night Next day morning we got back and received the room But the experience was really disappointing and we got under the pressure which is not at all suitable at the vacation 2 Impossible to use the USB port of the TV hence you re limited to the hotel s set of channels which very very limited and poor 3 The breakfast was every day the same we have chosen the hotel impressed by breakfast s reviews and found it not worth 4 The windows were pointing to Via Camillo Finocchiaro Aprile and exactly under us was the taxi parking So it was noisy from very early in the morning with the loud shouts of taxi drivers , The bed was OK the shower the bath tube soap and shampoos The personal was polite and ready to help 
479848,NH Milano Machiavelli, Can t think of anything , The staff were friendly had lots of local knowledge good suggestions for dinner and Rocco on reception was so helpful in helping me locate the property that i left on my flight He rang the airport and sorted everything out Great location for walking into the city wonderful breakfast with a great selection of gluten free products
