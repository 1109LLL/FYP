108317,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I asked for accessible rooms as guests were elderly My husband was unable to use the shower in our room as it was over a bath My mother could not work the shower in her room no instructions , The location was excellent the staff were efficient and curtious 
108318,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, A little disappointed with the overall standard of breakfast Hot food looking tired dry A lack of tomatoes and attention in keeping the service area looking fresh and attractive I appreciate that as a professional Trainer and Assessor in the hospitality trade maybe a factor I would suggest that the executive chef pays some attention to ensure the standard is maintained and of a consistent standard for this element of food service provided The quality and exceptional standard of food served in the snack area the previous afternoon was superb Presentation and texture and flavour of each dish was brilliant and the tall young male server paid particular attention in meeting needs of customers in a polite and courteous manner which was exceptional , Attention to detail of the staff at reception and in the terrace bar was exactly as expected and appreciated 
108319,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The buffet dinner was expensive for what was provided and then a surprise Service Charge was added For a self service buffet it s a bit of an insult , Very comfortable and so well prepared for the Prudential London Surrey cyclists secure bike store in the ballroom very knowledgeable bike mechanic on duty maps to get to the Olympic Park 20 minutes ride away cyclist breakfast from 4 00 am cyclists buffet dinner or Italian restaurants few minutes walk away fast checkout The bed was very comfortable the hotel was located in a very convenient position for this cycling event it was quite expensive but worth it for the convenience and service The bike mechanic Steve was excellent nothing too much trouble and he gave great easy directions to the Olympic Park 
108320,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We couldn t fault anything , Our stay at the Marriot was very comfortable 1st class All staff very helpful and attentive always smiling to Most enjoyable and would certainly love to stay there stay again Highly recommend it 
108321,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, we really didn t enjoy the breakfast which was a shame As it was kindly added to our booking to enjoy The croissants were stale the eggs were cooked in a horrible buttery fat which is all you could taste so ruined the rest of the breakfast on the plate I went to use the serviette it was filthy huge coffee stains over it someone surely noticed this as it was folded round the cutlery should never have been put on the table Not enough tables long wait staff didn t return with clean napkin Would go elsewhere for breakfast now , Nice rooms good location in Canary Wharf we had a river view room which was really nice the staff were really nice adhered to my requests Have stayed at the Marriott before 
108322,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The Wi fi was poor for us to use especially in our room The person on the desk could not sort it out for us We had to go to the local pub to use the Wi fi, The location of of the hotel
108323,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, upon arrival it wasn t made clear that you would automatically be charged for touching something in the mini bar i had to read about it then ask staff to make sure that it wasn t credited to my room , Bed was comfy room was spacious and staff were friendly
108324,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Bought a late night gin and tonic at the bar which was a lovely bar but wasn t expecting the shot of gin to cost 13 That s a bit much for my liking will be checking the cost of the drink before purchase on our next visit , Bed was very comfortable staff were very helpful friendly and welcoming the place was spotlessly clean 
108325,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, 12 5 Service charge on a self service evening meal put on for the riders was a little steep Especially when we had to ask for drinks , We were there for London Prudential Ride 100 First class service which included an onsite bike mechanic Also had a welcome pack Staff could not have been more accommodating Would use this hotel for the event every time 
108326,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Check in was around 15 14 somewhat unacceptable given terms and conditions Abrupt and insensitive if not downright rude security staff Complained to Reception about extremely off hand attitude of staff shocking behaviour to guest on return to hotel Saturday evening , Beds very comfortable as was room 
108327,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, After a stressful long journey to reach the hotel experiencing top quality service on arival was amazing I was taking part in Ride London the concierge lifted my bike out of the car and checked my partner in whilst I parked the car They placed my bike in the ball room on a stand with a mechanic and all the tools to prepare for the race All the staff were helpful giving leaflets of race info there was a special event evening meal and breakfast Marriot could not have been better Thank you for taking the time and putting in the effort to look after the riders Really well done
108328,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, I always love staying at the Marriott WIQ especially if we get a good deal and can afford a club room The staff are perfect and I have never had anything to complain about
108329,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The shower didn t have much strength and the bath filled up whilst washing , The bed was comfortable and the black out curtains made it easy to sleep The view from our room was very good 
108330,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff on front desk were so helpful and kind my daughter was unwell so we stayed another night there was no problem finding us another room Before we left they sent a tray of biscuits to our room so thoughtful Can t thank everyone enough would love to stay again 
108331,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Queue for the bar only one staff member , Attended the Guns n Roses gig at The London Stadium great location great transport links arrived back at the hotel quite late hence the use of room service which was excellent waiter very pleasant would definitely stay again
108332,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The standard of the Deluxe room we booked was quite poor in comparison to other hotels of this rating, The hotels location was superb and had extremely good access to the DLR The bar food menu was very good The steak Sandwich was superb 
108333,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, no onsite parking and low level of off site valet parking made it hard for us , Chocolate cake was left in the room for my wife as it was her birthday nice touch
108334,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Liked the area Very clean with plenty of activity Right on the DLR for quick access Beautiful surroundings Also like the more generous room size , Excellent attentive and knowledgable staff They went out of their way to recommend alternative transport to central London River Bus which turned out to be an excellent choice Also removed the internet charged caused by incorrect registration of internet services our fault Have already recommended to friends 
108335,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Hotel booked for weekend in London to see The Killers at Hyde Park Chose hotel in this area as easy access from London City Airport via DLR couple minutes walk from Poplar or West India Quay and only five minutes walk to Canary Wharf underground for Jubilee line in to City Room was large with king sized bed and excellent buffet breakfast included in room rate 
108336,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We booked 2 rooms with friends our friend had the room closest the the DLR no view and noisy We had a disabled room which we did not request the bathroom was not clean and very tired smelt of drains and right opposite the lift Honestly I think we got the worst 2 rooms in the hotel and it was a special weekend away We could have stayed somewhere else and paid less and got better rooms , Breakfast
108337,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The pillows were so soft and comfortable the staff were always happy to help and went the extra mile to make sure that the surprised I had for my partner were perfect and just how I d asked for them 
108338,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing, Hotel was spotless we had one of the newly refurbished rooms so maybe lucky Staff were pleasant helpful friendly without being overbearing and very professional overall Great location too Was a great price compared to many others in the area that weren t of the same standard 
108339,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, very slow service 40 minute wait from a drink at bar no towels in room half an hour to get them from calling reception I was already in shower wife called down , accessible location
108340,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Cold water was turned of wasn t informed was in room 2 hours prior to water turned off went for shower lucky I never got scalded never had shower after all , Service was very good and the receptionist excellent
108341,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I had to wait till 5pm for my room when check in is 3pm This should not happen in a 5 star hotel and is not acceptable when I spend over 500 for a 2 night stay ,No Positive
108342,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Other guest made us feel as though we shouldn t have been there when we went to the bar for a drink as a lot of guests were older than what we are, Brilliant location easy to find friendly staff and loved the breakfast
108343,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only thing that I did not like were the pillows they could have been firmer for my taste But it is a very small negative, We have stayed at this hotel many times The reason we come here it is because it a great hotel The room have just been refurbished since our last visit and they look great There is everything you need at this hotel The staff are really friendly and professional and cannot do enough for you Great atmosphere The breakfast was great
108344,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, nothing superb , room fantastic all the little extras executive room floor 8 space in room good reception staff accommodating friendly and helpful canary wharf loads of pubs cafes etc and a view of a huge yacht shopping centre close by to hotel cineworld round the hotel s corner breakfast was superb 5 all the way everything you could want and more ie chef made pancakes and omelettes with choices of fillings and toppings eat as much as you wanted booking a room go with breakfast included option perfect 
108345,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Very quiet room and very comfortable bed Air con worked very well so room perfect temp Ordered room service after midnight and very efficient delivery of wings and chips Staff friendly and plentiful Have stayed before here and loved it Got reasonable rate so used again Lovely area with many bars and restaurants along the canal 
108346,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Our bags were not waiting us in the room as promised There were not enough towels for everyone There was a mix up in the information wether we had breakfast or not All of these were sorted but it was a husttle I didnt need The decore was old ,No Positive
108347,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Windows very dirty air con unit very noisy so unable to use whilst sleeping no table service in the lounge had to queue at the bar for a good 10 mins , location was good 
108348,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Location as we were going to a concert at the Olympic Stadium loads of great restaurants shops and things to do all served with excellent train services Also service friendliness of staff We all had a superb weekend
108349,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The fact that an Executive Room was booked over six months ago yet when my partner arrived they were told that the room was unavailable because it was being decorated Why did they not notify anyone To add insult they knocked just 50 off the 245 room rate When I checked other sites for the room they had it was cheaper then 195 charged Disgraceful way to act particularly as I had phoned the hotel on the Friday morning to see if I could pay as this stay was part of a present and was told it was not possible but having given them my details not a single word to say that the room booked was not going to be available , The location
108350,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The bar service was awful The hotel was full Robbie Williams concert amongst others things so when everyone returned at the same time there were only 2 staff on who were not the fastest 20 mins to get served , breakfast had good selection
108351,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Pillows were too soft No cushions Insufficient tea and coffee and only one biscuit in a double room 4th floor room was very noisy from trains going past and glazing did not mute noise 24 hour room service menu had little choice and no sandwiches available Bar was crowded with poor service Breakfast is too expensive at almost 25pounds , Location on the Quay is good but our room was too close to the DLR Cold drink on arrival and reception staff were friendly and helpful Room was good size 
108352,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The pillows weren t the best for me but that s personal choice , Staff were fantastic lovely breakfast with lots of choice big room extra toiletries provided easy to get to from kings cross and good location for Olympic park 
108353,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The added discretionary charge for everything from room service to just ordering a drink at the bar Surely tipping should be decided by the customer kind of awkward telling staff to take the charge off Especially when just buying a drink every round an extra 12 5 It wouldn t be such an issue if the drink prices in London weren t already ridiculously high , The rooms were beautiful and the staff friendly and attentive The location was perfect for our trip 
108354,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only complaint I would make was the wifi did not connect in our room and the phone signal was very poor It wasn t a huge problem as we were out most of the time but if I was staying for business I would have asked to change room , Staff were excellent very friendly and attentive Location great for our concert and the overall hotel was very nice
108355,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Seriously 24 95 for a breakfast I don t mind paying a premium but not 3 times what you would pay elsewhere 20 50 for two drinks at the bar blatant rip off ,No Positive
108356,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Waiting to check in although it was very busy The very large black hairy spider that was climbing up the curtains No spare towels in the room could ve done with one for my hair after getting out of the shower , Friendly staff 
108357,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, All of the above , Beds need to be king not doubles Our view was of rooms opposite awful The step up to the bathroom was a constant irritation The curtains did not close against the wall hence when the sun came up it flooded across all the bed pillows waking you up 
108358,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Time it took to check in it wasn t the queue it was at the counter must have taken 20mins the same employee check us in at the same time as friends and gave them a free suite upgrade and free breakfast which kind of ruined it cos we had planned to do things together but they were 7 floors above and we didn t have access to and we had to find breakfast else where as we weren t prepared to pay 22 per breakfast which is set up for company expenses which companies don t question To the to people stopping as a leasure trip its a total rip off and it stinks How can you justify that much for sausage and bacon , The location was good next to DLR
108359,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing it was spot on and we will stop again , Room was lovely very comfy bed the hotel bar after our concert was very welcoming and the staff couldn t have been more attentive 
108360,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Everything was great, Everything about this hotel was brilliant the staff were fabulous Had to take out a loan for the bar but that was expected Fabulous breakfast to much to choose from
108361,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, One side of the hotel is on the quay and lovely The other side is on a very busy road and looked a bit dodgy at night was a bit intimidating Location was good for what we wanted near o2 but locality not great for bars open later in the evening , Beds were really comfy hotel was quiet at night and staff were helpful 
108362,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The cutlery especially the knives were uncomfortable to use The toaster was not very efficient, A great breakfast with plenty of choice Spacious comfortable rooms Staff all very friendly and helpful
108363,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, only had coffee in the bar but found it to be not hot but tepid and overpriced service charge of 12 5 percent is excessive and in my opinion unnecessary , Did not have breakfast
108364,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Thought that the breakfast price was over the top so stayed in bed a little longer as the room was so comfy, The hotel was very handy for the O2 it was nice and clean and very friendly
108365,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We weren t sure if we could drink the water next to the kettle , Bed was super comfortable room was lovely breakfast was AMAZING Staff were ALL really helpful Fantastic stay thank you Location was perfect for the shops for the O2 
108366,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Location was great with a great view but just a bit far for choice of eateries I struggled with the card navigation in the lifts to get to the right floor , Spacious room and had a good nights sleep 
108367,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Being advised free wifi in the hotel then finding out it is 11 a day charge would have cost 44 for the two of us , Location next to the quay with various pubs restaurants 
108368,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We did have to wait to get into breakfast but that is the only issue , Great location and amazing staff especially Sam the Concierge for the brilliant cocktail bar tips 
108369,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The hotel was full and the breakfast wasn t as good as it should have been We also wanted to order some food in the bar late at night and was told a waiter would come to our table but nobody did , The staff were very friendly and helpful The beds were incredibly comfortable The location of the hotel was also perfect for us 
108370,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing, Wow we were there at the weekend of the attack on London Bridge When we returned to the hotel it was in lockdown other than guests We felt very safe The bar had a queue but this was expected as everyone dashed back at the same time 
108371,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No dedicated car park although a small discount is offered on the nearby public car park , Excellent staff Excellent location Excellent breakfast Concierge Security concious 
108372,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room keys were programmed wrong and didn t work Toilet broke with running water all night Nothing offered after complaint , Restaurants close to the hotel Canary Wharf tube station 5 minute walk away
108373,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Bar prices were expensive long queue at the bar not enough seating and not enough bar staff , Room was comfortable and clean In room facilities has mini bar toiletries iron hairdryer and ice bucket Great tasty choice at breakfast 
108374,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, It was cold in the night for me and friend said the same Did not asked me am I with car and did not write my car reg nr Could be cheaper car park Breakfet was included in booking room but still gave me receipt to sign , Excellent staff Thank you It was very nice place If will be necessary I will stay again there 
108375,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, there wasn t anything that I didn t like all positive, Loved the location as I ve never stayed in Docklands before the staff were very friendly and the room was extremely comfortable Breakfast was superb it was outstanding value for money 
108376,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing at all, Staff were very good asked for an extension to check out and offered with no issue at all Very friendly asking about a sporting event we were attending and shortly after check in delivered a goody bag full of running athletic related gifts and drinks 
108377,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, My only slight dislike was that the pillows although nice and deep are way too soft for my preference which as a side sleeper meant that I needed 3 pillows to achieve the correct height to support my head and neck The downside to this was that due to how deep yet soft and puffy the pillows are I ended up with my head deeply recessed in the pile of pillows which at times felt a little claustrophobic On the plus side though at least they felt generally comfortable and didn t make my neck ache In the great scheme of things though it was a fairly minor thing and in fairness to the hotel it s possible that if I d asked they may have been able to supply firmer pillows I don t know if that s the case though as when we arrived back at the hotel it was late and I was tired so just wanted to sleep Therefore I didn t actually ask , We were there for the Saturday Iron Maiden concert and so I really liked how close the hotel is to the O2 Arena Just a short walk and a single stop on the tube and we were there That meant that the return journey was quick and effortless when we were tired and aching The beds were very comfortable and the room had air conditioning which on such a warm day was very welcome I was there with my 16 year old Son and I felt completely safe walking through the area late at night on our way back to the hotel The area in general has a nice relaxing and safe feel to it and I would definitely feel happy to stay there again Another bonus was that the hotel felt safe and secure The lifts to the guest floors are accessed by using the key card to your room and so can t be accessed by anyone who isn t a guest Plus at night there is someone at the door checking key cards to ensure only guests can access the lobby 
108378,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The restaurant isn t big enough for the size of the hotel on the Saturday morning we had to wait in a queue to be seated, Our complimentary room upgrade
108379,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only downside I suppose would have been the parking for the hotel It is not clear upon arrival where you need to park and was a little expensive I would suggest making that clear to customers upon booking , We were given a complimentary upgrade upon arrival which was a lovely surprise and the room was a very good size The bed especially was one of the most comfortable beds I ve slept on at a hotel for a while 
108380,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, It took a loooooooooooong time to get our keys as rooms weren t ready, The view from the window as we were on the 7th floor otherwise you will see just office building windows
108381,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We booked a 2 nights stay at this hotel for the weekend of our wedding Although the wedding ceremony and reception was not held in the hotel the staff still upgraded us when they learned we were there for our wedding Also on the wedding day when we came back to the hotel for the night we were happily surprised to find roses petals all over our bed with some petals arranged to draw a heart They also left us a plate of strawberries covered in chocolate It was all really nice attentions for us and we truly appreciated the gesture and our stay at the hotel Thanks again 
108382,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only small thing was how finicky the lift operation was , Great location London centre easily accessible via DLW or tube We had a waterside room stunning views Several great restaurants nearby and a shopping centre short walk away Very helpful staff and beautiful rooms 
108383,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Very good for Business Trips when needing to go to Canary Wharf but a little too far away from the downtown Restaurants and Pubs , Nice clean place big windows comfortable beds 
108384,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Lounge for a drink when returning back to the hotel The location Even though not central it s easy to get to on Jubilee line and the restaurants around the hotel are a good selection
108385,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Noisy with trains passing the window until late and start again early Breakfast which I had been looking forward to was ok bit nothing special We were short coffee in our room teaspoons at breakfast etc There could have been more attention to detail considering what we paid 3 out of 5 , I liked the position of the property and it was very clean with helpful staff 
108386,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Poor view of Freeway No robes or slippers Windows had black tape to secure in place Not what you expect from a 4 5 star hotel Kettle wasnt working,No Positive
108387,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Check in was most difficult one I ever had in last 30 years with at least 6 months per year travelling globaly As one of the international hotel chain they didnt accept any cash payment except Pound Manager didnt show up Very unfriendly unflexible and arrogant receptionist as he was looking just to stress guest All this in London This shows clearly Management weekness at this Hotel If our international meeting wasn t held here I would not stay a minute ,No Positive
108388,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing it was a beautiful hotel with friendly helpful staff and the price was excellent , I have a difficult diet vegan the chef was wonderful and cooked me a beautiful breakfast each morning 
108389,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing , We stayed here overnight for the London Marathon my daughter participated in it to raise money for her Charity Project Sulangan for the deprived children in a village in the Philippines The hotel was brilliant The staff could not do enough for us and the runners of the marathon from the atmosphere to the food everything were geared for the marathon runners We checked out after breakfast on the morning of the marathon they offered us if we would like to come back to freshen up The location along the river next door to the train just perfect If we go to London for a weekend this would be perfect away from the hectic hustle and bustle of the city yet just a few minutes on the train perfect 
108390,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Staff knew we were there for London Marathon Found out too late they had special pasta buffet in restaurant that night specially for Marathon runners Also found out after leaving that Marathon runners were given a free gift goodie bag but we didn t get anything Also disappointed to see room prices that weekend hiked due to London Marathon All hotels doing this some tripling prices but this was the cheapest which is why we booked here , Had a free upgrade to a lovely room on arrival We stayed as I was running the London Marathon the next day Special early breakfast for all runners was excellent Doorman ordering taxis was excellent 
108391,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, My room faced the DLR railway and a busy main road but apart from the uninteresting view it didn t prevent me from sleeping So I guess that s not really a con , It was the best breakfast I ve had in London in years Excellent choice and quality of food and beverages with delicious pancakes Sitting at a table by the window facing the wharf only improved an already great meal 
108392,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Had a disabled room and didn t like the bathroom The info we were given by reception was not fully accurate in describing the facilities in the bathroom , Location comfy bed and the view
108393,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room was quite dated and had what can only be described as a wind turbine going all day until about 9pm I was advised that it was the fresh air supply and could not be turned off It was extremely loud I did not find the standard of the room to be in keeping with 5 star , Location
108394,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Place is slightly far away from the city centre, Staff was really attentive and friendly we came in from a long train ride from Scotland by the time we reached hotel all of us looked exhausted the staff offered us health club access so that we can take a hot shower really good observation and proactive customer engagement
108395,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, As soon as you get to the hotel they take a deposit off you why i dont know The bedrooms were too warm only air con as windows were locked shut so affected my asthma The breakfast was really unorganized and we felt like we werent wanted asking for things whilst the table next to us got exellent service , The bedroom was really nice with a huge bed large flat screen tv and a good sized bath
108396,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The front entrance is underwhelming with the pained crash barriers partially covered with potted box hedges, Breakfast spread was fabulous Chef was able to offer an excellent vegan cooked breakfast
108397,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The pillows Far too soft Impossible to get a good night s sleep which is a shame as the beds are fabulous Please offer a choice of pillows as standard , The beds NOT including the pillows 
108398,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room was great except it looked like it wasn t used for a while and was very dusty the windows inside were very dirty and no breakfast was included , Fantastic views of Canery Warf
108399,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The rooms are in need of a re vamp they are a little out dated and are showing some signs of use , The location is great just a 5 minutenwalk to the Canary Wharf metro station Also the breakfast is a pure joy with lots of choices sweet and savory 
108400,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Although check in was officially from 3pm we could not access our rooms upon arrival We opted to park the car and take a stroll around Upon our return one of our rooms had been allocated to someone else they had been connecting rooms useful for our family and the new room was unacceptable as someone had been smoking profusely in it The initial response was not helpful but customer services did manage to find us a better room to move to Although handled well in the end I was not happy really that the desk staff had flippantly changed our room arrangement and given us a room that no doubt everyone would complain about The cleaning staff need to ensure smoking in the room fines are put into force It rather upset the start of our weekend but was handled well by the staff in the end , The modern part of the hotel facing the quay was excellent The corridors in the older part had also been renovated The bar the restaurant breakfast room were perfect The lobby very stylish and the staff on the whole very professional 
108401,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We had a problem with our bathroom however our complaint was dealt with excellently by the duty manager and it would not stop me visiting the hotel again , Excellent breakfast and very comfortable room All staff we had contact with were very pleasant 
108402,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The shower gel, Great location and the bar for food and a drink is fabulous too During my first stay here the breakfast was amazing and it was great this time too
108403,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Location quality of hotel, We asked for an early check in but this wasn t granted ok that s fine but our room still wasn t available at 3pm So we had to insist on another room which was found 
108404,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The fact that the breakfast is not included in the room rate is not great it is also very expensive for what s on offer 18 for a continental breakfast is excessive and the pastries station was a let down pastries specifically the chocolate twist was rock hard and stale with a croissant not much better and the cookies under the heater were verging on burnt Add to that the fruit wasn t as fresh as I would expect for that cost with my mother in laws banana rotten and black upon peeling Finally the milk in our room was off but to be fair we didn t tell the hotel until check out , The beds were very comfy and the hotel in an excellent location The bar is lovely serving nice good at a reasonable cost 
108405,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We were there for the London Marathon The staff had hand written notes on gift bags for all of the runners checking in that included items like running gels Epsom salt coconut water water and other snacks Check in time was pretty busy being that there are only so many computers to check people in However those that were not checking people in were going through the line offering mocktails and chocolates while chatting with the guests I also loved how they offered a breakfast early in the morning specific for those running in the marathon and they know how we runners eat breakfast when some people are going to bed from the night before They also had a table of water and bananas in the lobby the morning of the race Just a fantastic place to make us all feel so welcome 
108406,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing here i didn t enjoy, staff very welcoming and accommodating rooms excellent and clean breakfast fantastic and the extra bonus goody bag as I was running the marathon was a lovely touch the hotel went out of their way to make sure the marathon runners had everything they needed 
108407,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room was dusty and the hairdryer plug was broken it obviously had not been checked from last occupants But Housekeeping were quick to replace it , Convenience for the DLR and the O2
108408,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Would have been good to have different choices for pillow firmness they were too soft for me as I suffer with neck problems, Complimentary brownies and soft drink on arrival
108409,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing Only thing missing was a swimming pool but doubt we would have got chance to use it , Comfy bed excellent breakfast choice and the complimentary champagne and strawberries added that special touch
108410,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No option to move to a higher floor unless to a room next to dlr which was told would be noisy No walk in shower, Good wifi staff helpful in setting it up Great location Comfortable bed
108411,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Dated rooms although I think some are being modernised ventilation was noisy in bedroom very poor quality selection at bar and slow service , Location to DLR and underground sense of security and safety on premises bed size and comfort 
108412,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, staff kept on asking whether breakfast was included it was and it seemed strange they didn t have it on all their records, great breakfast great bed
108413,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Very attentive staff had to wait a few minutes to check in as it was busy but while waiting we were offered juice and lovely chocolates very comfortable bed we had a great dinner in the restaurant too I was wearing a sling and the waiter discreetly asked if I wanted my steak cut into cubes very kind I was touched by this
108414,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The view wasnt great but that cant be helped An the bar prices are very expensive, Good location an the staff very helpful an welcoming Very clean hotel 
108415,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I think for a five star it could do with a more modern bathroom A few more added extras in the room and at the least sky Also the gym can be a little larger and the sauna didn t work despite telling them twice at the reception The hotel is lovely and staff is good However for the price that s charged I think it can be better or at least be breakfast inclusive at that rate , The place was clean and staff were friendly Also the room had everything that was needed 
108416,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Half hour wait for room to be prepared despite booking 12 days in advance beds not that comfortable quite dated decor no hot chocolate or herbal teas in room only one packet of biscuits quality of toiletries all in all not what we expected for 5 Could hear rumble of DLR no view our room overlooked a central roof , Breakfast and staff at breakfast Sound proof from other guests 
108417,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Poor quality furnishings in disrepair basic rooms and facilities extortionate bar prices even for a hotel and cold buffet breakfast not often refreshed , Excellent views helpful staff and brilliant location for local bars 
108418,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I didn t like the location and tried to change it to Meriott in downtown area but didn t happen, I liked the staff they were very kind and helpful
108419,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Car parking across the road a bit expensive even by London Standards at 21 a night , Excellent location for the new buzzing East End that is the Canary Wharf area Close to restaurants shopping tube and DLR A very smart hotel with pleasant and courteous staff Quiet location and rooms 
108420,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Explaining that the parking would cost 24 a day would have helped although you do get a 3 discount As you pull in by car the hotel is actually obscured by a bush so some additional signage would have helped , Beds were very comfy the reception had the feel of a nightclub but as soon as your reached your room it was dead silent The breakfast was exceptional
108421,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, There was a slight mix up in the complimentary breakfast offered , My friend and I were treated well and rooms were very clean The staff were helpful 
108422,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The shower in our room did not work and we did not have time to wait for someone to come and fix it before we had to leave Therefore we were unable to take a shower Also one of our other rooms had a faulty tv but this was rectified quickly There was a good choice of breakfast and the majority of it was excellent However I didn t like the omelettes as a powder mix was used instead of real eggs , The staff were very friendly and always keen to help A good choice for breakfast
108423,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I personally wouldn t rate the hotel as 5 star 4 star is more appropriate The location is good but there is a restricted service at West India Quay and so Canary Wharf is the more viable stop The room decor is a bit dated looking despite it being a relatively new hotel and I would expect little extras like a bathrobe and slippers at a 5 star hotel and usually a pool The area around the front of the hotel and the station side is in desperate need of sprucing up The back overlooking the dock is lovely though , The staff were friendly and helpful Relatively easy access to central London and very good for Greenwich and South East London 
108424,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Hot breakfast was mediocre Lukewarm and undercooked Room was clean but nothing special would expect more of a 5 hotel Overall the hotel is better for business trips rather than leisure , Very comfortable bed 
108425,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Restaurant service was awful waited 1hr for our steaks and people who came in up to 45 mins after us were served first to be fair they did drop the service charge , Nice room warm good bathroom dog slow lifts though 
108426,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Refused to give me the twin room i booked Made me wait an hour to get twin room then said your not getting twin room Terrible service and never got the room i paid for, Extremely poor service
108427,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, This was one of the worst 5 star experiences I ever had and I stayed in enough hotels to be able to give an objective review I stayed at the Marriott for 5 nights and not one single night could I sleep well the bed was beyond uncomfortable and by far the worst I ever experienced I complained at the reception so they added a topper on my mattress which did not help at all I could feel the springs of the mattress poking my back and the bed looked bent from how worn out the mattress was I had backache every morning in that hotel Apart from the bed the room in general looked very very modest old and worn out I stayed on the 1st floor I could hear people outside especially late at night by the elevator The shower facilities were appalling shower head unscrewing making a loud noise just appalling for the price No special amenities no cotton swabs or slippers or robe Again this all would have been acceptable to me if I was paying a 3 star price in a 3 star hotel but it was a complete waste of my money for MWQ Absolutely no value for money other than the great staff and convenient location , The service at the hotel was really 5 star unfortunately the great staff was the only thing that was 5 star about this hotel 
108428,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Everything at this hotel was done expertly and completely professionally in a quiet discreet and understated way Very well run immaculately clean luxuriously comfortable Perfect hotel for a relaxing break 
108429,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, It didn t feel like a 5 star hotel Probably a good 4 star room was clean but nothing special I expected the shower to be free standing not over the bath Also when I booked I was informed they the breakfast would be a special rate when I asked about This I was told that it was not , The bed
108430,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only minor gripe was the air con in the room which even on the coldest setting didn t quite get the temperature down to the level we d have preferred , Quiet location but only a couple of minutes walk from the DLR Rooms well insulated so no noise disturbance either from other rooms or from outside Friendly relaxed atmosphere in the hotel and some great views across Docklands West India Quay Spacious room with plenty of wardrobe space good facilities Staff exceptional 
108431,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room wasn t ready even though we delayed our arrival until 3pm Checked in but they said we would have to wait so we told the staff we would wait in the bar no one came to find us So later had to go back to reception to ask all over again with another member of staff for a room to be allocated to us Marriott must be cutting back on value for money extras limited tea bags and milk available in room had to call for more and waited a long time 2 Bottles of water supplied in room was the smallest 330ml bottle I have seen in any hotel I have stayed in for a long time and 2 80 charge for an additional small one out of the mini bar is daylight robbery for simple bottled water Probably the price to be in London It is after all just plain old bottled water right Also only one of each miniature shower gel shampoo etc for 2 people to share was not enough as the miniatures were very tiny Tried to connect to Wi Fi using the code provided by reception but unless a Marriott member it wanted to charge an extra 11 for a day I was only staying briefly overnight and thought we had Wi Fi included Also we decided to eat in the Manhattan Grill early at 6pm asked reception staff to reserve and find us a table for 2 by the window with a view out When we arrived the restaurant was almost totally empty bar a few tables being used and they offered to sit us as far away from the window as possible stuck in the tightest possible corner where our shoulders practically touched the wall next to us and a male female couple who were already seated at a table for 2 next to us with hardly any room between I am sure they wouldn t have wanted to be privy to our conversations and I not theirs , The staff were very helpful and polite and willing to please Good location for quick access to DLR Food in restaurant of good quality and portion size if a little pricey Hotel nice interior and room was clean and tidy 
108432,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing, I informed the hotel that it was my 15 year wedding anniversary and when I arrived I had a room upgrade with a rose petal bed and lots of there surprises The services was fantastic and I can t wait to return for another mini break 
108433,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room card reader in the lifts was erratic and you could hear feel the nearby DLR in the background but neither were a serious issue , All round modern clean fresh building with welcoming friendly staff 
108434,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We didn t have the breakfast as it was severely over priced , Location is ideal for a night out in East London Travel to Central London by the commuter boat from Canary Wharf Quay 
108435,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, You were unable to sit in the lounge without being made to feel you had to buy drinks from the bar Then when i ordered two cocktails it cost 26 and the charge for staff to make it was not optional, The beds were very comfortable
108436,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Hair in the bathroom shower leaking pen marks on the pillow dust in most places Not value for money, Very friendly stuff beautiful view from the window and good location
108437,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, When we got there the receptionist said that breakfast was not included although it was , Breakfast was really nice and they made the pancakes and omelettes on request which allowed you to get fresh and hot food 
108438,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Dated bedroom bathroom smelt musty no towels used soap Very noisy bar with aggressive intimidating clientele View from the room of DLR track great if you like train spotting Would not go back under any circumstances, Bed was comfortable doorman was friendly very efficient
108439,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room was very cold and we couldn t get warm all night The hotel need to think about how to leave the heating in the room so it s comfortable for guests when they arrive, Having 2 double beds in the family room was excellent rather than one being a sofa bed
108440,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, In our room we could hear the rumble of the DLR The bar was a bit small and crowded in the evening , Excellent location for Canary Wharf and surrounding area 
108441,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The bathroom was not good with the mastic round the bath having gaps and the bath enamel was chipped For the price I would have expected a proper shower The description on the web made it sound like the room had a lounge not a communal lounge, The location was good the hotel was clean
108442,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No ipod dock v shocked at this as the hotel seemed so prestige Only 1 tiny complimentary shower gel should be as many as there are guests Signage to lifts could be better as i got lost Not much in way of late night food options in the area if u did not want room service , Bed was comfy room was spacious enough for 3 ladies loads of tea and coffee Concierge was very helpful Great location for the 02 Arena which is why we chose this hotel 
108443,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, View from the room After asking for a room with a nice view we did not receive one, Nice size bed comfortable duvet Breakfast was fantastic So much choice and excellent quality
108444,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I altered my booking at the restaurant and I had to repeat myself over and over because the guy didn t understand me The reception staff weren t helpful what so ever Taking 200 off a debit card as security Why not just take the card details The room wasn t very clean and we did not like the fact that there is no duvet cover on it s just two sheets sandwiching the duvet The tv was not very easy to use either , Location and breakfast staff
108445,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and efficient Hotel is in the perfect location for canary wharf restaurants Has a nice bar which remains open late for any night caps 
108446,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, BEDROOM FURNITURE WAS A BIT WORN OUT HOLE IN THE CHAIR AND THE TV NEEDED UPDATING, EXCELLENT HOTEL IN BRILLIANT LOCATION FOR DOCKLANDS BARS AND RESTAURANTS
108447,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Would have preferred a room with a view but the third floor doesn t really come with one so stay on a high floor if you want a view , Good sized room Attentive staff very polite and helpful 
108448,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only thing I could mention was soft pillows but it didn t spoil the stay , All the staff were efficient and friendly Nothing was too much trouble Delicious pancakes and syrup at breakfast Hotel location was excellent for our needs 
108449,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room was on par with much cheaper hotels Marriott website was cheaper doesn t feel or offer a 5 experience booked in advance but the day before I travelled price came down meaning I could of had breakfast for the same as I paid room only mentioned in hotel and was told I could have breakfast for 17pp Not the great experience I was hoping for , Nice entrance close to station
108450,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I requested room at high level weeks before we checked in only to be given a room on 1st floor next to the train tracks I went to reception to complain and was moved to 3rd floor where we was given a room with just a door between us and next door I had to go to reception AGAIN to be moved to 7th floor which was finally suitable but the whole episode was very stressful ,No Positive
108451,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The first night room was located right next to the train station It was rather noisy , The staff were very helpful n friendly expecially the concierge Sam n Som 
108452,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We had a good price from Bookings com and this may have been why we had a room with an awful outlook Between the hotel and the station it was a wind tunnel , Right by a DLR station Concierge service was excellent they could not have been more helpful As we were visiting family we did not use any of the restaurants or bars There were a number of nice looking restaurants nearby but we did not get the opportunity to try them either 
108453,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We opted for the with breakfast stay When breakfast was delivered to our room we could only order once However I think it should be made to order as many times within the morning , I was very happy and delighted with the customer service of the staff and breakfast was also immaculate I would definitely recommend this hotel without a second thought 
108454,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Outdated bathroom d cor and design does not match the standard of the lobby and bar area or the fact that it is supposed to be a 5 star hotel There were no bath robes to use in the room and non fluffy cheap feeling towels which again were not in keeping with the hotel rating In addition whilst waiting for my wife to improve upon perfection I wanted to watch TV and realised there was a pathetic lack of TV channels not in keeping with a modern digital TV age and clearly designed to try and get guests to pay to view which is a bit much when you pay to stay , The reasonably good wifi the excellent large sized and comfortable bed the style and design of the hotel lobby and ambience of the bar etc the efficient and friendly staff and the great location with convenient car park and good transport links via the DLR
108455,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The heating in our room never really kicked in It said leave it for 20minutes before you will notice a temperature change But we had it on for nearly an hour and it didn t really heat up Saying that we were not actually cold We also couldn t find a TV guide on the TV You had to physically flick through the television channels to see what was on If there was a guide it was not at all obvious Finally and not really a big deal but there was no bedside cabinet on one side of the bed There was however a small occasional table I was able to move so I could have glass of water next to me and somewhere to put my phone glasses book etc , The breakfast was excellent You could take your time over it the staff were amenable and helpful Nothing was too much trouble Even catered for dietary needs such as soya milk for cereal and gluten free options I also particularly loved the size of the bed I could literally starfish and not bump into my partner at all The room was blissfully quiet at night This was a room that overlooked the atrium No view really but didn t matter as we were out a great deal The room was well equipped iron hard wire for internet plenty of mirrors and sockets Also the bathroom mirror was heated which meant it never steamed up Brilliant 
108456,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Method of payment staff member at reception took my card on arrival and took 168 when my room was supposed to cost 118 and did not explain why she had done this and was quite rude when questioned After contacting the hotel afterwards they explained that the difference is refunded afterwards which is a little strange but nevertheless was never explained to us , The hotel itself was very nice and luxurious our room was also very clean and spacious Vast majority of staff were lovely and very helpful 
108457,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Only one packet of biscuits between two guests Four pillows instead of six Our special request was not acknowledged This was a little disappointing No parking facilities , Staff friendly Fabulous views Room was lovely and spacious very clean Thank you 
108458,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The wifi in the bedroom didn t work When asked staff about this they were no help My daughter had to keep going down in to the lobby to use wifi with my mum whilst I went to the o2 Not good enough The room service food was very very poor and we couldn t really eat it We had the Marriott burgers and the buns were so hard that they were impossible to eat When complained no one took any notice Breakfast is not worth the money they charge for it and to top it off they tried to charge us 22 each for the breakfast when it was included in our room price, Thr hotel was clean and the beds were very comfy 
108459,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Didn t go for breakfast as very over priced Shower needed more pressure , Staff were friendly and checked us straight in as there was a room available despite us arriving really early Also helped us to print some information out free of charge Room lovely very comfortable and clean Bar lounge was relaxing and a good place to end a busy day Location was good 
108460,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Very friendly staff and excellent hotel my wife was celebrating a birthday which I asked for a special request in room the hotel supplied a lovely touch for her and a card thank you to all at the marriott

108465,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I didn t like the service at the restaurant for breakfast was not offered tea where has other guests was offered tea therefore we didn t eat there again we was then billed for the breakfast which I had to query , The location was perfect 
108466,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The staff were slow when checking in and out In my opinion they could have been a little more friendly They didn t explain to us on arrival that I had to request for a night maid to clean the room For a 4 star hotel it should be mandatory to have a clean room and towels for the evening I wasn t asked how my stay was at the hotel when checking out and I wasn t aware I had to pay by credit card and not cash on arrival They don t accept cash on arrival only when checking out Pointless to be honest , The room was nice and comfortable and clean 
108467,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Hotel room is a bit dated old TV only few channels no separate shower a lot of noise once you use the water Bed is not really comfy, Front office staff were great DLR station next to hotel Lobby bar is good Staff in general is good Decent gym
108468,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, No words can express how this hotel made our wedding anniversary really exceptional and special It s one of the most memorable stay of my life The preparation is incomparable Special thanks to Guest Relation Rumane for the effort She deserves the best appreciation My wife and I is so grateful to the management Keep it up You are the best 
108469,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The chefs in the manhatton grill ate dinner but didn t bother staying for breakfast didn t want to chance it after seeing how they perform, Being given a suite after complaining about dirty room

108472,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Breakfast is VERY expensive at nearly 25 Browns Brasserie next door is fantastic and just under 10 Also check in took ages with the amount of form filling this needs to be sped up , Location excellent staff very attentive 
108473,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff were nothing but lovely from the concierge at the reception desk to the waiters in the restaurant and executive lounge The hotel room was lovely the complimentary snacks in the lounge were delightful and the pancakes we had at breakfast were easily the nicest pancakes we have ever had 
108474,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The bed was lumpy and rather difficult to sleep on The armchair at the side of the bed was so worn and dirty on the arms that it was threadbare and had a hole in it We dare not sit in it due to the unpleasant odour eminating from it There are very few lights in the room making it rather difficult to work at the desk area which has no light The breakfast area was very chaotic with rather a trek to each for each area There appeared to only be plates available at one end of the dining room Some of the waiting staff were not so eager to be of assistance whilst eating but were very eager to try and remove a half finished cup of coffee The G T bar was quite nice but some of the gins were unavailable It is not fair to advertise gins if you do not stock them A fairly common gin like Silent Pool should be available The decor in the hotel is looking rather tired and there are lots of cracked tiles scraped door edges and rather dirty lifts This is not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination The hotel is definitely a 4 star and still needs some updating to remain at that , The reception staff were extremely friendly courteous and efficient The waiting staff were also very pleasant and courteous 
108475,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We moved the stuff from the fridge to put are own stuff in it and it was motion censored so they then wanted to charge us for everything in the fridge They locked the fridge and we had to ask them to unlock it so we could take are own items out We had already asked them to remove all items and they still tried to charge us for the whole mini bar and they had already taken it all away we had to then wait in a long line for a refund Unfortunately we also had a very noisy room opposite the railway Having stayed in 4 5 star hotels I feel this was not anywhere close we will not be returning Very disappointed 
108476,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Could have had more selection in the executive lounge Breakfast was hectic but great selection and staff Very stingy with body lotion in rooms, Excellent breakfast selection Love the toiletries but stingy with body lotion
108477,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The free internet was fairly fast kept dropping off and we were not in the room long enough to justify paying the extra cost to have a faster service This was a bit disappointing , We had booked a double room and when we arrived at checkin we got upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment The room included a full kitchen with all the facilities you would expect in a modern kitchen In this part of the room there was a large living space with a three seater sofa and a few chairs There was a flat screen TV and a DVD player this would be useful if a family was staying with young children We had a corner room on the 10th floor with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the night lights of London and Canary Wharf stunning views Off the main room there was a bedroom and a separate bathroom with all the facilities The bedroom also feature floor to ceiling window again giving great views over London As a Marriott member we had steady check out and within an hour I had conformation of the cost of the room straight to my phone This was a good service 
108478,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, There wasn t a good choice of food for the 24hour food service More option on the menu I d say , The bed was really nice and the towels were good size

108481,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Although our room was comfortable it was not 5 star in my opinion there were no extras like slippers ect I also thought 12 50 for 4 small crackers with cheese was a little over priced , Excellent staff made our stay very enjoyable they made our children very happy with complimentary chocolates activity packs and hot chocolate 
108482,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No complaints on this occasion , A welcoming doorman offered to carry my luggage to reception I was situated on the 3rd floor which was surprisingly quiet considering there was a corporate Christmas party about to start on the ground floor and I was anticipating revelry from other guests milling about I slept very comfortably and soundly notwithstanding a certain amount of alcohol in my own system by the end of the night 
108483,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Using the security card to get to your floor in the lift always required a deft touch It made for some friendly interaction with fellow guests but was also stressful as sometimes the card did not activate and the lift would have already gone past your floor , The breakfast selection was very good While the hotel is very centrally located my room was very quiet and I enjoyed two good nights of sleep Staff were always friendly and very helpful 
108484,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, When I checked in I was told that I was booked only for the following night and that the hotel was full I showed my confirmation with Booking com and after some investigation I was advised that Booking com hadnt pushed my booking through correctly and was given a room No apology was offered by the person checking me in The room was right next to the DRL station and I was unable to sleep so the following room I requested a change of room which was given to me , Good location for Canary Wharf and 02 arena
108485,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The grill restaurant was very below standard For a place costing as much as it does i expect more food was terrible but the staff did deal with complaint well , Bed was very cumphy good location staff were attentive

108490,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Did not like the attitude of staff especially security and conceirge both left quite an unpleasant feeling , The room was comfortable but quite standard for Marriott Breakfast ok nothing special and quite limited choice Location is fine 1 min from DLR stop easy to get to center of London

108494,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing I can think of, Room was excellent and the ice machine much appreciated The gentleman on the door couldn t have been nicer or more helpful
108495,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I had booked 3 rooms for family friends Unfortunately the shower in my room was not working It took 2 calls and 35 minutes for someone to come and investigate He agreed it was broken and in fairness offered to repair it It was too late by this time and I had already had to strip wash and wash my hair in the sink The manager was very understanding however it did spoil what could have been a perfect stay , The Hotel Staff and Location were excellent Breakfast was great with a wide choice of options available Rooms were of ample proportions and very comfortable 
108496,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, long queue for breakfast , Customer service is excellent the view from our room was amazing Location is accessible to the shops and restaurants value for money Very much grateful for their complimentary birthday cake

108500,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Reception staff are generally unfriendly abrupt Rooms are rarely ready unless you arrive in the evening and there is always a problem with the room you requested at booking I have stayed here for weekends for the past 4 years always encounter the same issues with reception Also this year upon arrival there was no gas in the kitchen so there was no hot bar food all day only salads Last year no wifi available the whole weekend A hotel of this rating is supposed to eliminate all stress upon arrival instead it creates stress , Excellent breakfast lovely lounge area nice bedrooms Restaurant staff are so professional friendly The restaurant bar area are well managed are the best feature of this hotel

108502,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Better directions to the location of the ice machine would have helped The breakfast was not good value There were no croissants or pain au chocolat The egg when heated under the grill became rubbery The cereal range was limited as was the fruit selection The pile of bacon was watery All very disappointing , Staff were great and very keen to help particularly the guy in the G T bar The ice machine was great for the champagne we brought with us 
108503,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The area quietens significantly in the evening maybe too much , Great staff Extremely friendly and helpful Comfy bed Easy access to DLR and tube Perfect for the O2 and Greenwich Really nice hotel Seemed to be very good value for money Breakfast good but standard large hotel set up

108525,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, For a 5 Hotel the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable and the room felt it was lacking things other 4 hotels have such as bathrobes and slippers Also a 5 hotel should offer better quality coffee and tea in the rooms Kenco is very basic , The staff were really friendly and helpful

108535,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Service in the bar in the late evening was awful We waited for ages to be served and eventually had to go to the bar to order drinks which seemed to upset bar staff as we were told they would come and serve us They were very busy but this is a 5 star hotel , Lovely comfortable beds and a large bedroom 
108536,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, 5 minute wait for table at breakfast in the morning this continued throughout the service between 10am 11am Not enough tables for size of hotel only real negative of stay Bar was busy and manager was straightening up the labels on the bottles rather than serving which I thought was amusing , Welcoming staff on arrival speed of check in Clean rooms great comfortable bed s

108538,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Club lounge closing at 9 30 15 min queue for breakfast Buffet breakfast hot and fresh however felt rushed and I ate on my own as husband queued in another queue for his breakfast thought the club lounge would have been opened in the morning for even express breakfast Really let the experience down, Staff were great hotel lovley Club lounge great
108539,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, There was a notice outside the restaurant informing guests due to high occupancy breakfast would be extended from 1130 to 1230 and peak time from 0930 It would have beneficial to know this beforehand as it was there was at least a half hour wait and with flight to catch my son and I went without a breakfast that was included in the price , The room
108540,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The bar was very very noisy and therefore we were not too keen on staying in for a drink The bar menu is limited , The staff were so helpful and courteous and we were upgraded on arrival The bedroom was large and the bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept on We were celebrating my husbands birthday and the hotel came with room service with a pile of Brownies which were to die for Breakfast was equally excellent

108552,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The iced tea, We needed a place for our bags as we were competing in a night marathon and wanted a shower before we went home this was the ideal location and price

108556,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We didn t like the breakfast The scrambled egg wasn t fresh and the rest of the hot food didn t look that inviting I certainly wouldn t have paid 22 for this , We stayed overnight for my husband s birthday as part of a surprise present The staff were very friendly and we even got some cake as a surprise 
108557,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Preordered a cot Not present in the room when we arrived in the evening so we had to wait for about 40 min extra before we could put our little son to bed Furniture and carpets stained and a little grubby Curtains would not close properly ,No Positive
108558,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Transport in London can be a bit difficult so probably not the best location for touring the city from Hotel has access to both DLR next to station and the tube 8 min walk we would recommend the water taxi as an alternative to consider if going to center , Very good location for Canary Wharf business area meetings although a bit away from city center Excellent staff very good breakfast however it can feel slightly repetitive and very comfy bed 
108559,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Breakfast buffet very slow topping up lack of items available at any one time long queues at check out due to early check ins , Lovely bar good waiter in bar excellent check in Great view of Canary Wharf DLR from room really added to feeling of being right in the heart of the city 
108560,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The train runs right by the hotel and woke us up as quite loud but the hotel clearly has taken as many steps as possible to solve this , The bed was fantastic and the room very spacious for London It was easy access to the tube and lots of nice bars and restaurants nearby Incredible value for money 
108561,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, air conditioning didn t seem to be cold enough and TV screen kept freezing during viewing, Location staff and overall service great value for money as we got a fantastic deal for 2 nights

108564,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The reception staff were attentive and polite Our room was upgraded at no extra cost due to us celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary When we returned from our afternoon walk a complementary bottle of wine accompanied with strawberries was waiting in our room We also found all the staff at breakfast the following morning polite and helpful 
108565,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Struggling to think of anything , We always stay at this hotel when we visit London as the staff are excellent nothing is too much trouble The DLR is just outside it s A 10 minutes walk to the underground station at Canary Wharf 
108566,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing it was all good, Staff and room were great it was our anniversary and my wife s birthday and the room location and complimentary birthday brownies were brilliant

108569,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, More spaces for the evening meal we couldn t get a table , We stopped there to do the London Prudential Ride 100 They thought of everything Cycle storage early start breakfast and special evening meal 
108570,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Sound proofing our room was adjacent to the DLR track which is very noisy and starts early in the morning Chose alternate rooms if possible , Location in the heart of Canary Wharf with spoilt for choice of restaurants within easy walking distance Transport links are amazing DLR Tube buses and River Clipper
108571,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We stayed here the night before the Prudential Ride London The hotel had really geared up for this event with dedicated bike storage a mechanic on hand a fantastic buffet breakfast starting at 4 00 a m and offering shower facilities post ride Genuinely friendly helpful staff in all departments 
108572,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We stayed here as we needed to be in London as my husband was in the Ride London This hotel provides breakfast from 4am for the riders and secure bike parking inside with racking As an extra lovely touch all riders get a goodie bag on check in all in all a most excellent service 
108573,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, My details were wrong on database offered biscuits cheese and wine but never materialised Very poor gym facilities ladies sauna not working very dirty room felt like I was treated as though no one wanted me there Will not return , Bed very comfortable TV good Generally very comfortable 
108574,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The cooker that was doing hot meals in the breakfast was excelent but he should have someone helping him because it was too much people just for one person I have stayed in Marriott Hotel in Lisbon and this didn t happen , Staff very friendly and supportive Very good location and confort Breakfast was also very good 
108575,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Noise of nearby station my room was very close to the tracks and literally vibrated as well as nosy trains didn t stop til gone midnight and started again at 5 30am So had disturbed sleep not sure if there are any quieter rooms My neighbours were not bothered by the noise so it will not be a problem for everyone but I need a quiet room , Bed was very comfortable staff super My only issue was the noise of the adjacent railway Staff gave me some ear plugs but hotel fully occupied so could not change my room sadly 
108576,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The facilities of the room felt a little cheap as in below average quality Personally I would not book around this area for a leisure trip around London or even for a longer business trip because it s quite remote , For a short business trip around Canary Wharf it s in a very good location and also next to a DLR station that can take you around central London with ease

108578,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable and the bedroom was amazing We had an enormous television which was like being at a cinema The cook which made the omelettes was very friendly He made you an omelette of your choice and it was delicious He also made some small pancakes with sauce and some cherries wonderful 
108579,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We ordered a king sized bed and when we arrived due to it being busy our room had 2 single beds When we raised this with the hotel we were told there were no other rooms available so the beds would be pushed together This was done but was very noticeable which made for a bit of a disappointing sleep , The breakfast was lovely
108580,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Found the hotel difficult to locate initially however in fairness this could be as much to do with an unfamiliarity with the area , Staff were excellent particularly the concierge who quickly and professionally resolved an issue we faced 
108581,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, I always choose the Marriotts West India Quay when I m staying in London The service is consistently good and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
108582,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, This was a perfect one night stay in Canary Wharf Located right next to West India Quay DLR and restaurants location is perfect Lovely hotel bar with great cocktails Room and bathroom very clean Bed very comfortable and sheets duvet crisp white All staff were very personable helpful and friendly from rushing ahead of you to open the doors to genuine interest and conversation about our stay Couldn t fault this hotel special thanks to Vera who took customer care to the next level 
108583,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Gym very basic Breakfast waiting staff non communicative smiley and the maitre d cleared our table whilst we were choosing pastries Door key stopped working on more than one occasion , Comfy bed and nice size room Breakfast chef cooking eggs was fantastically friendly and accommodating 
108584,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Shame no pool as we were under the impression it had from booking com, Helpful staff location executive lounge option at check in food was excellent 
108585,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The view was of the train track which isn t that exciting and we could hear it too which was a disappointment because we couldn t hear it last time , Clean and comfortable room enormous comfortable bed heavy dark curtains to keep out the light free nibbles wine gums popcorn and fruit infused ice water in the lobby and free wifi Great location superior breakfast spread friendly staff 
108586,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Poor breakfast for such an upmarket want to be hotel no fresh bread available and cold meat selection like in a poor army kitchen fruit salat no berries only cheap fruits Very disappointing for such a hotel Filter coffee ,No Positive
108587,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Very slow service at breakfast having to remind member of staff who forgot to bring tea Having to ask for menu s and how breakfast works Given a choice would prefer a stand alone shower to a shower in the bath although rest of room made up for this, Very friendly and helpful staff at reception and in the bar Receiving an upgrade to a nice room overlooking the dock with a comfortable bed
108588,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful from the off Lovely hotel very clean brilliant staff Couldn t ask for better Will use every time we are in London from now on After a long day out found they had even gone to the trouble of putting milk and cookies in the room for our son s bedtime 
108589,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble the hotel could not be better situated for transport links and parking the room was excellent with air con nice bathroom nice bedding comfortable beds etc the breakfast was unsurpassed with full English fruit and cereals omelettes and pancakes made to order and taste outside the hotel is a rage of restaurants and bars to cater for all tastes I would strongly recommend this hotel and its staff 
108590,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Wish we could have stayed longer , The staff really cared about us and asked about why we had come to stay and congratulated us on our 30th anniversary Cannot express enough how kind they were We had rose petals on the bed and strawberries chocolate and cream and a bottle of wine How thoughtful and the staff made our stay so so special 
108591,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Noisy room with the DLR next to the window and air conditioning that was louder than a jet engine, The hotel did their best to provide specific services for those of us entered into the RideLondon cycle event with an 0400 breakfast
108592,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The evening menu portions were tiny The food was delicious but I could have eaten three portions given the exercise taking place the next day The executive lounge desserts were lovely however it seems the volume of food provided was really limited given the number of people using the facility, Staying for the evening prior to the Prudential Bike ride We heard the GM of the hotel is a cyclist at was particularly noticeable that ALOT of thought had gone into making the stay for riders well managed The storage and safety of guests bikes was first class Having a bike maintenance facility on site was way beyond expectation and amazing service The collection of bikes in the early morning was incredibly efficient and smooth running The welcome pack for riders was a lovely touch Opening the breakfast facilities from 4am so riders were able to eat was fantastic The rider specific evening menu was a good idea Providing guidance maps of how to get from the hotel to the ride start was great we followed the route which was a little sketchy along the canal with road bike tyres but again over and above service Use of the executive lounge was worth paying the extra for Canap s and desserts were lovely just a shame we were not drinking alcohol during our stay to enjoy a wine with the beautiful sunset Our stay was extremely enjoyable and smooth running exactly what you need before a big ride thank you 
108593,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, When I booked I was unaware that there would be any special attention due to the Ride London If we had known we could have relaxed in advance knowing that it was all taken care of , The hotel was completely set up to welcome riders in the Ride London event which was great 
108594,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The lifts were somewhat erratic with a number of people going up and down a lot as their swipe cards didn t work The road in front of the main entrance to the hotel was quite scruffy and not at all appealing especially the large concrete road blocks The buffet breakfast is not what you would expect from a 5 hotel I didn t partake in the cyclist s early breakfast and went for the normal time serving The selection wasn t great and the serving spoons etc were not kept clean and the food was lukewarm at best The selection of fruit was also very limited I ve stayed at Premier Inn Hotels a number of times on business and their breakfast selection is wider and also better quality , The staff were all excellent and the provision of the cycle storage for the Prudential Ride London event was first class The laying on of breakfast from 4am was a great gesture as was the gift for the riders The view over the dock was and Canary Wharf was lovely Great access to the Dockland Light Railway 
108595,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We stayed for two nights for the Prudential 100 bike ride and had our bicycles with us Previous hotels in which we have stayed have allowed our bicycles into our hotel room bearing I mind bicycles are worth several thousand pounds but we were refused they arranged for a porter to carry our bikes to a secure room but in the process the porter managed to bounce it off several things steps wall with the potential of damaging it Although our room was supposedly cleaned after our first night half empty coffee cups were not removed and replaced with clean cups On calling housekeeping they did not send someone within a reasonable timeframe so we went to bed only to be aroused by someone knocking on our door which we assume was housekeeping as it was very late we didn t open the door we were also very sleepy having been woken up only to be woken by the telephone ringing on a couple of occasions As this was shortly afterwards we assume this was housekeeping we couldn t work out how to answer the phone in the dark as it was more than lifting the handset The hotel took my track pump in for safekeeping whilst we were participating in the ride and then couldn t find it when we were ready to leave No one was particularly worried about trying to sort out our issues again in a timely manner the porter eventually found it after approx 20 minutes having confessed that he didn t look properly in his cubby hole in the first place That combined with 35 00 for two gins and one tonic was the end of a bad stay ,No Positive
108596,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, I have never felt more appreciated by a hotel in my life Everyone looks after you from the receptionists and concierge to the house keeping staff Even the maintenance man helped to check over our bikes before our big ride out of the goodness of his heart Incredibly kind people thank you 
108597,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff were awesome the hotel catered for us as cyclists they had check in right stored bikes bags and even allowed access to the Gym for showers afterwards a real brilliant effort they even had a mechanic in the bike store unbelievable and proof that a hotel can provide brilliant service when someone thinks about things

108603,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room with low sink in bathroom I guess because I booked through Booking com I got what I paid for Reduced price equal not so good room and poor view , Staff very helpful
108604,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The fact it was had to pay for additional services like a bottle of wine to come to the room on special occasion, Amazing Movies paid for need to be of better quality
108605,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Our room was at the back of the building and I had difficulties sleeping due to the Docklands railway nearby but my daughter had no problems at all However the customer services manager has made a note so that we wont be put in those rooms when we return and she was genuinely concerned I hadn t raised the issue the first night but I thought I would get used to it , the staff are lovely and cleanliness excellent The rooms are well appointed Breakfast is very well cooked and a good variety of foods on offer the chef makes lovely pancakes omelettes etc to order If you want to stay in a modern area close to the city without the hustle and bustle this is for you you can explore easily via the underground Check out the museum nearby and the restaurants a trendy place to be
108606,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Food rather cold on both mornings bagel rock hard I am just questioning final bill as I was charged 100 more for Sunday night than Saturday never happened before in fact quite the reverse , Mostly good
108607,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only negative comment I have was was that the tables with lamps and flowers located along the room corridors on level 6 were dusty , The bed was very comfy and the pillows were the softest I have experienced All staff we spoke to at all levels were very polite and very helpful The breakfast was excellent lots of choice good quality food chef was really helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble The location was great the train station DLR was perfectly located next to the hotel and no noise was noted from our room I would definitely recommend to a friend

108610,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The biggest issue was the cold breakfast paid for hot buffet and it was all cold The tv signal was terrible just wanted to relax as I just got back from Saudi Arabia before travelling back to my house in Peterborough , The bed was amazing pillows were perfect 
108611,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, One room was not ready by 15 00 the check in time which was unacceptable having made the booking over 4 months previously We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the room , The rooms were clean and a good size The breakfast was excellent The staff were polite and offered a good level of customer service

108726,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The razor socket was broken there was black mould around the bath support and one of the lamp shades was damaged , The room was a good size it was quiet
108727,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The only thing I would mention was that we felt the breakfast was a bit pricey , We usually try stay at this hotel as we particularly like the location very near to the O2 The beds are also extra comfy All the staff are very welcoming super efficient 
108728,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Decor was a little dated Water pressure was not good so the shower was a disappointment There are better hotels in the area for similar prices or cheaper, Clean and comfortable
108729,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, As above any problem was solved quickly , Had a slight problem with our room not being ready and we were offered a disabled room Then another with the air conditioning stuck on That said when we went back to reception to say this was not suitable we were given an upgrade to a lovely room on the sixth floor with great views Sara in reception was lovely and a credit to the company Breakfast was awesome and the chocolate bunny by the bed for Easter was a nice touch
108730,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, As a young family we had to came back to the hotel room early and were quite disappointed as we wanted to experience a couple of London s restaurants but had to put the children to bed so chose to stay in and order a variety of things from a couple of nearby restaurants we called down to room service to ask if they could bring us up some cutlery and plates pretty simple but they failed to do so after saying they would I m glad we didn t wait for them because I would have been annoyed if our food had turned cold as well Apart from that the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our little ones giving my two year old lots of attention and treating her to a little cup of fruit punch it was very sweet , Was happy with the hotel it was a great location and the staff in person were lovely
108731,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Dirty windows ruined the view slightly, Good buffet breakfast and especially good omelette Good location for a visit to the O2 and with Cabot mall being just over the quay it makes for a good stroll around 
108732,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Not a thing, First time visiting this part of London as attending a event at the O2 arena Cannot fault the location and comfort of the hotel Have already recommended it to friends and family
108733,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Poor cleaning of room bin not emptied and poor cleaning of bathroom Charge of 100 00 deposit like a previous customer said makes you feel like a thief and for what water that in a supermarket costs 90p and in the hotel 2 50 A snickers bar costing 3 00 why an earth would we have them at such extortionist prices the hotel need to get real The view from the window looking at the DRL underground trains go by , The bed very big and comfortable Staff on the reception area were very helpful Lovely breakfast 
108734,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Very expensive food and drink breakfast 22 pounds each no thanks went to Wetherspoon 4 79 each , Great location for shops and bars restaurants and the 02 one stop on the underground 
108735,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The bed sheets were dirty with old stains on them The hotel was difficult to find through a maze of a shopping centre as the bridge was closed , The staff were friendly and helpful 
108736,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, First of all i prefer to leave a deposit of cash instead on my card that should be optional for customers second the beds was not comfortable at all did not get a good night sleep , they made sure a sofa bed was already in room
108737,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The heating in our room would not work it was very hot and by the time we figured that no matter what we did to the dial it made no difference we only had one day left When we reported it they offered to move us as they knew there was a problem but for one day it was not worth it Maybe an upgrade when we next stay would be nice , We were late for breakfast on our last day I asked at the breakfast station for a waffle I was informed it would be 3 minutes The waitress told me to sit down and she would bring it when it was ready I was expecting 2 quarter waffles and some syrup instead I had the waffles some fresh fruit strawberries raspberries etc the syrup and a large portion of clotted cream Even though we were the last ones there they went to the trouble of giving me a really lovely breakfast with no indications that they wanted us to eat up quickly A lovely end to our stay 
108738,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No bath robes and having to get several trains into london, The hotel was very nice and staff very help full Several eating and drinking places close by and a great shopping mall on the door step The Big Easy serve good sea food and there is a nice garden inside

108740,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, room was stiffling and had no windows air con was noisy but utterly ineffectual loveey experience spoiled by room being much too hot , the welcome the receptionist the overall wow factor breakfast was to die for and the waiting staff were superb 
108741,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The staff were overly attentive in the reception area and yet in the restaurant at breakfast there never seemed to be enough staff and the ones who were there seemed overworked very stressed they seemed to be doing their best in difficult circumstances, Location easy to find

108748,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The reception was like the Hilton the room was like Travelodge 3 50 for a bowl of crisps plus a service charge Breakfast was ordinary and not value for money , The location 
108749,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, old furniture very bad wi fi I had to beg the personnel for slippers and bathrobe this is unacceptable for a 5 hotel very bad TV channels selection very basic hygiene products in the bathroom extremely expensive for the offered quality of the services , Nothing I will never stay at this hotel ever I may avoid Marriott locations in all places I will travel
108750,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, new table mats in breakfast room looked like splattered with paint towels in the room a bit worn asked for extra butter finished toast and still no butter, view bed comfy

108752,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We were on the 8th floor overlooking West India Quay train station which was a little noisy , Lovely hotel and staff very attentive Had emailed hotel to let them know it was my 6 year old sons birthday they left cake a birthday message which was a nice touch Restaurants bars within walking distance Nice to get ferry into city centre for change from tubes Great value for money 
108753,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Photographs of the suites show ipod docks and numerous pillows We stay often and I have never seen a dock We had two pillows on a superking bed We had to request more which did turn up by the time we returned to the room , We upgraded to a suite The view was fab and the beds were comfy We ordered breakfast in the room as it can be seriously busy in the restaurant in the mornings the breakfast which was delivered was amazing and too much for us to eat The location is great with bars and places to eat around and also close to the tube and DLR Staff are always very helpful and friendly Parking very close by is a bonus 
108754,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, There were a couple of very minor points I could raise but in all honesty to find fault in any way would be picky in the extreme , I m not really used to staying in such a wonderful luxury hotel and it certainly didn t disappoint From the friendly staff to the quality and cleanliness of the room to the extensive breakfast it was excellent Thank you 
108755,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, asked for higher room but had first floor corner with train line looking straight in my room Breakfast wasn t included, Great facilities especially the entrance reception bar and restaurant

108763,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The check in clerk was very abrupt and did not fully explain that he was taking 100 per room for 3 rooms as a security deposit which was something I had no prior knowledge of which could have affected me if I did not have this available on my card Also we requested high rooms but were told on our booking we could only have low rooms We did feel slightly like 2nd class guests as we had not booked direct , The staff were excellent and overall the hotel was fine would have liked rooms close together as we requested but as the hotel was full this was not possible 
108764,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I do not have any negative things to add , I only had a short stay however the bed and linen were very comfortable The room was clean and adequately furnished Service in the restaurant was friendly and quick together with the food being good I enjoyed my stay 
108765,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The breakfast was burnt and it was served to me burnt an there was missing other stuff that was Ment to accompany my breakfast and yet it was served to me without that being explained Not only that my burger was over cooked and hard and burnt Aswell , The bed was fine clean room
108766,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No fault of the hotel but the footbridge was closed for essential maintenance making tube access a little more tricky than normal here, Second stay here and it was once again excellent Rooms very clean and comfortable Very busy doing other things so didn t really see much of the hotel but staff were very friendly and efficient
108767,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Maybe the pillows were a little to soft but its personal preference , Everything The location easy link to the city and to Canary Wharf The room and room facilities were excellent The staff were the most efficient and friendly of any hotel that we have ever stayed in

108774,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We were given a disabled room as an option either that or a room that overlooked the train line Took the disabled room option and it was okay However I thought it would be a nicer room with the amount paid for it The room was large although we couldn t open the windows which made the room a little stuffy The air con wasn t great and the charges for the mini bar were huge As there were two guests two bottles of water would have been better than one as that was quickly drank due to it being stuffy , The staff were lovely very friendly Good location for the O2 Fab welcome with a rose being offered on arrival along with homemade chocolates and fruit punch Nice touch Staff couldn t do enough when it came to directions and if they could do anything 
108775,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Having to leave , Nothing to fault Breakfast was amazing haven t seen that much choice in ages Staff very friendly and attentive lovely big room with massive bed very comfy mattress and super soft pillows we had a water view from our room which we paid for but was nice to see outside

108779,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room we had 214 was directly next to the railway with the train headlights lighting up the room and noises going on until early morning With passengers at eye level viewing directly into the toom when in the station from 10 metres away It made for a dark and morbid hotel room Sadly we were given this room even though the hitel was not at full capasity , The location is great
108780,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Always a check in queue The bedrooms are dated not very contemporary need modernising No separate shower not really 5 standards, Great location for tube nice restaurant bar with outside area friendly staff

108785,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Some people kept on knocking my room door and running away But I would say it s not the fault of the hotel but the just some of the guests that were staying there a the time, The breakfast was amazing as well as the room The staff has the best of manners as well 
108786,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Tv dint have the children s channel after 5pm not enough channels kids movie channels Missed having bathrobes and slippers Dint have a good view as we were facing the station as well and had to keep the curtains closed during our stay which was a shame , Excellent staff extremely helpful comfortable room and breakfast excellent Hopefully a room with better view next time

108791,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Booked this hotel for Christmas Eve trip to the theatre etc Hotel staff were welcoming and nothing was too much for them right next to the tube station and close to Canary Wharf which made a lovely Christmas morning walk seeing historic parts of London in a leisurely pace Once we checked out they seemed in no hurry for us to leave and our meal in the G and t bar was exceptional NCP parking is a three minute walk from the hotel would I use this hotel again Oh yes 
108792,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No access via stairs Only a lift Expected But very expensive for drinks 20 70 for a single vodka and a beer Location of the hotel wasn t fantastic Not much to do locally Either needed to use DLR or use a taxi, Staff were amazing Food was fabulous Breakfast was on time as we requested and could feed 6 people Room service was brilliant and fairly priced The hotel in general was lovely Close to the DLR Very quite location

108801,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I felt it inappropriate to have a female guest having breakfast in gym shorts and top she was overheard stating she had showered but was still in the clothes she exercised in had she returned to her room she surely would have dressed more suitable fr a dining room, hotel staff very helpful informative and courteous Bedroom and public areas spotlessly clean Good variety of food at breakfast

108805,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, My only disappointment was the room it didn t match up with the service and the rest of the hotel It was very dated and needed redecorating massively Final touches for me are important things like a large choice of teas in the room hot chocolate biscuits and enough sugar provided for more than one drink none of which was the case in our room , The welcome we got was lovely Very friendly informative staff and chocolate offered upon check in Location was good too close to some really lovely shops and restaurants The bed was really comfy 
108806,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Appeared to be alot of younger staff members who were perhaps not as confident as they could have been when interacting with guests, Considering the location and proximity to road rail links extremely comfortable and quiet room Although very busy at breakfast time seated and served very efficiently

108824,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Poor bathroom equipment There was only one bar of soap and one shampoo for 2 people We were palmed off with a room at reception on arrival which did not meet my expectation of a superior room I was informed we might find it slightly noisy from DLR trains passing but it should not be a problem and we were not given or offered another room despite the hotel being half empty however it was noisy and suffered vibrations at every train passing on the 2nd day there was no soap or shampoo in our bathroom at 10 p m and we had to use our own emergency On departure we were not given any compensation , Friendly if a bit rigid staff and amenities 
108825,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Even though we booked on booking com we still paid the best part of 200 for the one night The room was adequate but we were given a room right at the side of the DLR station so close in fact you could see every detail of the travellers in the carts and hear the carts coming and going non stop We went down for some lunch in the bar we ordered 2 Club sandwiches with chips a pint and a lemonade We given the bill before the food arrived it was 37 Expecting the food to be great quality considering it was only a sandwich and the amount we had been charged for it was a huge disappointment It was a slice and I mean a slice of turkey with salad stacked like a club sandwich but most definitely not full like you d expect a club sandwich to be After being out for the night we went back to the bar for some drinks it was absolutely packed The bar had barely any staff on not enough to accommodate the amount of guests in the bar the boxing had been on so as you can imagine with hotel being so good for getting to the O2 it was full Some of the staff I m guessing managers just stood around not helping what so ever rather telling the other members of staff rushed off there feet what to do Eventually it got to much and we went up to the room and ordered room service we ordered the fish chips which wasn t to bad but definitely not worth the 15 each and having to pay 9 for the luxury of eating it on the bed 6 for room service and 3 for the tray it was delivered on Im not one to write on things like this but with being disappointed with the quality I was given for the amount paid I had to say something We have recently been to Newcastle for a show as well and stayed in a Crowne Plaza for less than half the price as this and that was absolutely amazing the nicest and fanciest hotel I have stayed in , The location of the hotel is great for transport It s right at the side of the DLR station and a 10minute walk away from the underground which is one stop away from the O2 arena The breakfast which was a help yourself buffet was lovely 
108826,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The fact we got upgraded because our room wasn t ready and we needed to get ready and go out ASAP was lovely I literally couldn t fault anything apart from there wasn t a toilet brush in the room But the hotel was amazing if I was going to the O2 again I would not hesitate to stay here again staying at another hotel would never cross my mind And what can I say about the breakfast so much option so tasty and I would return just to have breakfast Thank you for an amazing stay really made our weekend 
108827,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, None, Very welcoming and helpful Ideal location in Canary Wharf right next to the shopping centre bars and restaurants only one stop from the 02 arena on the underground which was ideal for us as we went for the Boxing also Breakfast the following morning was very good 
108828,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Expensive breakfast so we didn t have any at the hotel and added service charge for drinks, Close to the O2 nice area lovely rooms very comfortable staff friendly

108837,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff were really attentive welcoming us or saying goodbye when we came and went also the door men there to carry suitcases was very nice Very comfy bed and good and powerful shower We found the lift a little confusing but had it sussed by the end of our short visit 
108838,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Bit pricey we stayed across the road for the same price for three nights last year and it was just as good Also didn t like the way the hotel was portrayed on the website with a photograph taken on the quayside the hotel is around the back and doesn t look particularly attractive on the outside but looks wonderful inside , Room was spacious clean staff were helpful professional Location was excellent the room was soundproof so we didn t hear the Train which is very close Lots of places to eat nearby too 
108839,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We were asked if we wish to upgrade to executive and the price was fair so we did the executive suite from 5 30 9 30 pm was drink and food if you wanted it also included breakfast Well worth the extra 60 odd quid 
108840,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Breakfast second trip to hot food wasn t that great food was down to the last scraps and not all that good Spent first 5 minutes another couple and some other guy to figure out how to use the lift, The view was beautiful The bed was really nice and comfortable It all looked really chic yet stylishly modern
108841,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We had dinner in the Manhattan Grill which I felt was a little over priced The steak was a little average and the starters were too expensive The ambiance is lovely in the restaurant though , Great reception staff we were able to check in early and the luggage was taken to the room very quickly It is one of the quietest hotels I ve stayed in with no noisy neighbours and is a great location for Canary Wharf shopping as well as travelling to the centre Oxford Street which takes just 15 minutes on the Jubilee line This is also a fantastic location for the O2 which is just one stop away to North Greenwich 
108842,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, TV remote control wasn t working in the morning however after reporting it I am sure it would hae been rectified by the attentive Staff , Peaceful clean room in a great location Excellent value will stay again when within budget

108847,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I thought the breakfast was very poor the quality of the food very low and would expect better from a cafe Also the hair in my partners mushrooms was not pleasant at all Overall a let down with breakfast and left with no breakfast and hungry , The staff were excellent and attentive 
108848,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Check in took a ridiculous amount of time I have never experienced such a long drawn out process They couldn t cope at breakfast They had an offer for breakfast but the queue for tables was ridiculous I made my booking for end of October earlier in the year for 2 double rooms At check in I was told had 1 double and 1 twin bedded room When I queried saying I had requested 2 double rooms I was told that it was just a request and couldn t be guaranteed I said that surely bookings are first come first served and my booking was made much earlier in the year and surely not all the double rooms would have been reserved at that time I was told it didn t work like that I wonder then how does it work I don t think I would stay here again in a hurry If I book a double that is what I expect and do not expect to wait for 30 minutes for a table for 4 people at breakfast and the check in process That really does need to be reviewed , The hotel was very comfortable and clean with good facilities and a good location I have given the hotel a good rating as I have answered the questions honestly but wouldn t rush back to stay again The reasons for this are in the what I didn t like section 
108849,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I couldn t find any faults we had a perfect stay , The room was luxurious and spacious with a fantastic view of Canary Wharf The service was better than excellent they made us feel very welcome Breakfast was very good too 
108850,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Housekeeping entered the room on three seperate occassions without knocking the door once at 4 30pm in the afternoon The restaurant service was very poor and we were infact charged twice for the bill, The hotel was clean and initially staff were friendly and welcoming
108851,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room not ready drinks very expensive and staff not very helpful on reception upon check in , The room was fantastic good view or the river Really comfortable bed and pillows etc think I might pop onto the shop Marriott website 
108852,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The restaurant was a total nightmare I waited 45 minutes for my food The waiter kept telling me it was coming and my pudding didnt even materialise , Lovely Hotel very comfy and modern The staff were very friendly
108853,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We were greeted with chocolates and a drink on our arrival The staff could not do enough to help Recommend this hotel if making a trip to London or a concert at the O2 Excellent shopping malls at Canary Wharf Plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby 
108854,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Room Service for breakfast was a bit disappointing but they did take it off the bill so all in all our stay was fabulous , Free upgrade without requesting it Very helpful and friendly staff Great location 
108855,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The hotel was obviously not full however as soon as they realised we had booked via booking at a 1 3 of the original price which was still not cheap only the rooms facing the railways were suddenly the only available rooms unless we paid a heavy supplement Disappointed that we were treated differently because of the way we booked , Breakfast was excellent and room clean and comfortable despite the train station outside our window
108856,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, had dinner in hotel restaurant that was very expansive and portions were small also breakfast per person is too expansive, professional very polite and helpful staff clean and comfortable good location
108857,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Lovely hotel We had the worst room possible for views as it overlooked the main air conditioning unit and DLR railway line even though I had requested a river view, I couldn t fault the hotel cleanliness or staff 
108858,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I didn t think the room standard was a five star hotel We did have a leaky toilet in our room Big bed but wasn t that comfortable , It was clean and tidy excellent and friendly receptionist staff at checkin and check out And free wifi in all rooms Bar area is nice and cosy 
108859,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, If you are unlucky to be on the right side of the hotel you are going to get an early wake up call as there is a train station outside your window A real shame as the rest of the hotel ie very good , Easy access to the O2 and easy tube ride into the centre of London
108860,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, When using room card for lift Recommend to remove card then press number I left card in and several trips up and down to different floor levels , The comfortable spacious room Heard very very little noise from the dlr Looked over the river Immaculate room 
108861,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Linited in room dining menu Lighting was too dim in room A few things did not work eg power sockets Face towels were grey and old not fluffy and white, Close to tube station and O2 arena Close to restaurants and shops Accommodating with early check in request Comfortable bed Friendly and polite staff
108862,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The sink pipe leaked on the bathroom floor when we cleaned our teeth in the morning A bathroom light was faulty and constantly flickered on and off and the iron thermostat gauge was broken and this meant the iron remained too hot and melted through my chiffon blouse , Of the three members of staff I spoke to two were very helpful and they brought a complimentary birthday cake for my partner 
108863,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Breakfast was overpriced and drinks in the bar However bars and eateries around and street food good, Location was spacious and airy away from city confusion Good view of water
108864,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Restaurants was humurous We booked a table and went at 7 15 They sat us at a table for two by the window nice we thought til we realised the air conditioning was above us so we asked to move The table next to us also moved Thereafter every person who came in was escorted to the same drafty tables and all asked to be moved Also the couple next to us left without paying when waitress went to get their billed a bottle of wine disappeared Caused a laugh but honestly the food didn t warrant the cost Afternoon lunch served in the bar was very good value and the chips were fabulous , Location Bedroom Afternoon tea 
108865,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The Marriott west india Quay advertises free Wifi The wifi that is for free is poor there are many hotels that offer free wifi that works I hope you will improve this false claim , The friendly efficient staff
108866,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Was a little too close to the DLR noise wise but as it calmed down during the night it worked out fine in the end, Easy to get to and in a lovely location The staff were all friendly and very accommodating 
108867,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, hand face towles were a bit grey need fresh white ones we stayed two days and only had two breakfast tea bags not replaced whole stay tried earl grey but didnt like Need more tea bags , location

108869,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, There should have been a magnifying mirror in the bathroom The reading lamp above the bed could have been better situated for reading , Staff efficiency and comfort 
108870,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Me and my girlfriend stayed recently for a concert at the 02 We were greeted by two friendly members of staff at reception The hotel was very nice from the outside and inside and in a very nice location We were upgraded as soon as we arrived to an executive room and given complimentary food items also we ordered room service which arrived within 15 minutes at 3am fantastic hotel with a fantastic service 5 Star service and location 
108871,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Hotel restaurant is good but very pricey There is much better value elsewhere in the area , Location in an area full of restaurants and bars good transport links very good staff service 
108872,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, If you are flying from Heathrow there is roughly 1 15 minutes commute with the tube , It was excellent value for money and very quite since the weekend activity is low at Canary wharf 
108873,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Have stayed at West India Quay many times but not in the last 3 years Thoroughly enjoyed our stay not like on previous visits when the chiller was not working and nobody took responsibility to sort out the problem 
108874,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The room though very comfortable was no bigger and glamorous than a purple Lenny bed The TV was very standard too , Very friendly and helpful staff We arrived early and were able to check in at no extra cost and was given a choice of rooms depending on sound from the local DLR There was no cot setup in the room however it was swiftly delivered and resolved in 15 minutes 
108875,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The breakfast was too expensive and much better value a stones throw away at Browns, The staff were excellent The bed was so comfortable The location and view over wharf were ideal for our visit 
108876,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Great location for attending a concert at the O2 arena Also just a quick hop on the tube and you are in central London Lovely hotel and the staff could not do enough for us to ensure we had a great stay Will definitely stay again 
108877,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Not super luxury no pool and no fitness equipment No coffee machine in room TV Chanels are limited Breakfast choices is limited , Very friendly personnel as expected Good position to DLR and Jubeliee line beds are comfortable and services are good 
108878,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, My Expectation is that staff know what they are doing Many of the staff are not properly trained presentation is poor and they are unable to say sorry if things go wrong managers in particular blaming junior members of the team Generally slow service needs to be right and pickup the pace , Great location clean
108879,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Didn t opt for the breakfast At 25 per head I consider this an exorbitant price for breakfast particularly given the price you pay per night in the hotel A delicious breakfast is available from surrounding restaurants for around 8 per head , The hotel is visually impressive the lobby area and rooms are presentable and well equipped with a very pleasant bar and restaurant area The location is a double edged sword fantastic to access both Docklands and Jubilee line trains within a few minutes walk however this does mean some less than attractive scenery from some rooms tube lines and concrete The other sides of the hotel however lead to a beautiful area well equipped with eateries and bars lining the river the delightful Cabot Place shopping centre and the square replete with fountains and seating Overall delightfully placed for seeing a side of London most tourists never see 
108880,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Breakfast was average and overpriced and drinks were very expensive 9 for an archers and lemonade plus service charge Asked for high floor overlooking water but was given a view of the DLR on the first floor , Room was nice comfortable bed clean everywhere Nice location ideally placed for the O2 
108881,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Far away from centre london I have ordered rooms with twin beds but they forget that and it was too late after that to do something , Very friendly staff warn welcome very good offer given Level Confort of the hotel
108882,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Professional and helpful staff Fantastic building and room Great value for money They also made a complimentary birthday dessert for my girlfriend with happy birthday written in chocolate sauce which was a lovely surprise 5 stars 
108883,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Couldnrt get Wifi to work But Girl at reception girl was great at helping and very friendy , Liked the handiness for Canary Wharf and DLR Out of the Bizz but near enough 
108884,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We ordered room service and I m sorry to say it was shocking The bill was 55 for haddock and chips burger and chips a double vodka and a cheesecake My complaint is the food It was barely warm the chips were anaemic looking and the fish was foul It tasted raw Wish I had returned it and asked for my money back Definitely not good value for money , Friendly courteous staff Room was excellent with twin double beds I took my 21 year old daughter Luxurious bed linen on an extremely comfortable bed Picturesque location Canary Wharf is extremely clean No litter nothing 
108885,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Nothing , The service Location tidy clean and the all blacks were there what a bonus Sam the concierge was great Knew it was sons wedding and sent complimentary wine to say congratulations wow how kind and all staff friendly awesome To be recommended We plan to stay in Marriott in Shanghai looking forever to it 
108886,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Very pricy at 140 per night but it certainly wasn t travelodge , The staff were very welcoming and friendly Upgraded me for the weekend to the executive floors Room was nice and clean Comfortable kingsize bed Fully functional air con Even had a member of staff pop round in the evening with complimentary chocolate We re very efficient with room service also Received discounted breakfast price on check in Great location and walkable to the tube and many restaurants along the river
108887,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Extremely comfortable spacious room on 5th floor looking out over the water Superking size bed and plenty of pillows gave us a good night s sleep Easy access to DLR and decent pubs restaurants Parked opposite hotel at Vinci carpark 16 per day at weekend 
108888,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The lifts are very poor got stuck twice In the end used the back stairs which wasn t very pleasant , Convenient excellent helpful staff comfortable room 
108889,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No where to relax Bar area was geared towards younger people and music was too loud Need to have a second quieter relaxation lounge not just a party zone For the price need to live and let live across all guest types, Facilities good except shower was not easy access in a disabled room Sides were too high
108890,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Bit pricey when it came to certain things I ordered a Pepsi and it came to 4 50 which is extremely over priced , Staff were lovely and helpful Made us feel very welcome always smiling couldn t fault them 
108891,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, none really, They were very accommodating despite we landing up past midnight They ran out of some of the all night food so very graciously they waived the entire room service order which was an excellent and thoughtful gesture 
108892,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Problems with allocated room Faulty key mechanism and poor condition of the room Requested a room change and only option I had was to pay for an upgrade at 50 00 per night , Location
108893,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We were convinced to pay an extra 40 per room per night to upgrade at check in I m glad we did because we got free wi fi breakfast and a great room I think it is appalling that any hotel charges for wi fi in this age It is a basic necessity not a luxury and when you are paying top end room prices anyway it should come as standard not via an upgrade Upon receipt of my invoice under the door on the day of departure I realised we had been charged 40 per person per night not per room for the upgrade as agreed and we had also been charged for wi fi use even though the business centre had reconfirmed to us that we would not be charged This was all rectified without question at check out but caused an unnecessary unpleasant experience , Rooms are great beds always really comfortable Gin Bar is a lovely environment Gym is well equipped and always empty at the weekend in the morning lovely to have the place to myself 
108894,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Staff were extremely welcoming polite and helpful I was riding in the Prudential 100 on Sunday 2nd August so was not around on the Sunday morning to check out with my wife I was therefore most impressed that one member of staff took the time to carry our bag s to our car in the car park over the road great service We were also greeted with a welcome drink prior to checking in at reception Arrangements for bike storage were also excellent and very secure 
108895,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Had the DLR trains running right past our window Made for quite an unpleasant couple of evenings, Got a great deal so good value compared to other hotels in the area 
108896,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Gym is very basic Could not locate sauna Pity there is no swimming pool , Everything Staff were fantastic Breakfast superb Loved the Gin Bar especially those guys running it 
108897,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, They automatically charged the room to the credit card used for booking I hate this Booking com even provides a drop down tab to inform the hotel how you would like to pay which is obviously ignored by them The card used for the booking wasn t even in my name why would they assume that it is OK to charge it This a woefully antiquated custom and I d really expect more form a 5 star The decor is a bit ugly I ve stayed in numerous four and three star hotels with better interiors so I m not really sure where this extra star comes from because someone says Hello when you enter the main doors , Couldn t be cleaner 
108898,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, An Incidental Charge of 50 per night was added to our account and then released when checking out This extra 100 would then be returned 3 5 days after our departure something I find totally unacceptable , Good location for sightseeing in London 
108899,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The pillows used by Marriott Hotels now are too soft and are more of a cushion shape Aesthetically this may be more pleasing but is s bind when using them , Very helpful and pleasant Staff
108900,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Dining options limited but there is a great choice outside of the hotel , Bed and room were excellent as was the shower Very well situated for Canary W and beside DLR station About 10 mins walk to Jubilee Line station 
108901,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, We were stopped outside the hotel at 11pm at night to show our hotel cards I believe 4 females should have been allowed inside to lobby to comply with this request very off putting to and RUDE We were all dressed respectable and looked honest and decent so I have no idea why they conduct this behaviour, Comfort and cleanliness
108902,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The breakfast is too expensive, Great location for canary wharf station if going to the O2 arena the hotel is itself is immaculate and the staff are very helpful and friendly We will definately be staying here again 
108903,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I had 3 reservations due to a few travels during this trip I was expecting the Marriott to notice that or at least add a note since I told them the first time I checked in Unfortunately they didn t every time I checked in my room was on a lower floor and less of a view , Location Convenience of breakfast included free wi fi for Marriott rewards members Front desk personnel very attentive and professional Great rates this time 50 off 
108904,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Excellent location for leisure and business alike Canary Wharf area eateries of every sort on your doorstep DLR tube and river service all to hand O2 which we came for just a short boat ride away avoiding the tube crush at end of show 
108905,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Having to pay for wifi in the room A top hotel should have free wifi every where, Staying in Canary Wharf excellent steak meal in the grill Good rail communications to other areas 
108906,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Stayed here numerous times but this one was the worst Normally great hotel but took forever for bags to arrive in the room and even called reception and then had to go down and ask as well No hot water in the afternoon for a shower , Location
108907,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, The staff were all very friendly and welcoming the hotel is in a beautiful quiet and trendy area with plenty of restaurants and right near the Thames The bed was extremely comfy I had the best nights sleep there 
108908,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, No paid wifi Pay per view movies very expensive 5 99 to watch Grease Really Might be an incentive if a number of the older releases were free to view , I was upgraded to an executive suite with view of water Sumptuous kingsize bed beautiful bedding Bathroom sparkling and toiletries luxurious Staff top rate can t do enough for you Great tea and coffee facilities mini bar and 24 hour room service including hot food meals Gorgeous lounge Optional full breakfast 15 but incredible selection of food as much as you wanted Hot and cold buffet style but you can request items such as omelettes I had a smoked salmon delightful View of restaurant again looking over water Top rate 
108909,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Sink plug did not work the ironing board marked my girlfriends top and the sausages at breakfast Apart from that everything else was fine , A very comfortable bed 
108910,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, WIFI connectivity in room did not really work and communication about whether it was included or not in price was unclear Breakfast is very elaborate but display is messy and with lots of children filling their plates it got more messy , Location is excellent for anyone who needs to be in Canary Warf Staff is VERY friendly and professional 
108911,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, The scrambled eggs not good , I was staying over the weekend of the Ride London Surrey 100 for the third year That must say something about how much I rate this hotel its staff and its facilities They are so geared up to meet the needs of keen cyclists many of whom have stupid o clock start times and so need an early breakfast Not many hotels will get staff in for 0430 and not charge anything extra either The whole experience makes for a hugely relaxing time apart from the ride 
108912,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, We stayed for the Ride London and we were very pleased with the attention to detail the hotel provided for the cyclists Security of the bikes and all the extras you provided Great weekend
108913,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Took my bike for Ride London 100 and they set up a storage facility mechanic tools available hot towels water etc for all guests with bikes Brilliant service all round highly recommended 
108914,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Paying for Wifi and cost of breakfast is high especially if a family even with discount at 15 each , Staff staff and staff were absolutely fabulous We stayed for Ride London 100 and having a secure bike store was a great feature 
108915,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Stayed at the hotel in order to take part in Prudential London Surrey 100 Perfect location and facilities for this event Staff could not have been more helpful and being able to store our bikes securely and have the help of the mechanic Stuart was fantastic Many thanks hope to be staying with you again for the event next year 
108916,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay,No Negative, Helpful staff going the extra mile to make us feel welcome The little extra touches at every opertunity Fantastic position Large room spotlessly clean and not noisey 
108917,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Couldn t fault this hotel, We stayed here for he weekend to complete the prudential London Surrey 100 ride The hotel was fantastic and had thought of everything Made the whole experience fantastic
108918,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, Our dinner took an hour to arrive we were given complimentary prosecco and our starters weren t charged The corn fed chicken on the menu turned out to be half a chicken Far too much for one person to eat and most of it went to waste , The hotel was really well prepared for all the Ride London participants who were staying there The ballroom made a brilliant safe place for the bikes to be stored Special menus for the cyclists including early breakfast 
108919,London Marriott Hotel West India Quay, I booked a table for two in the restaurant for 7 00pm on arrival i requested confirmation i was told the booking was now 8 00pm to accommodate others I insisted that it return to 7 00pm as i wanted to ensure my meal was digested before retiring for a 4 30am wake up call On arrival at the restaurant we were give a more than acceptable table with the restaurant only 20 full That is where the good story ends At 7 45 we had to chase the first course a small salad and a bowl of soup it arrived 5 minutes later Main course was simply two bowls of pasta off their specifically for cyclists menu At 8 15 after both table to each side of us had been given and finished their main courses off the main menu steaks and speciality dishes I had to chase staff again a few minutes later we were told it would be a couple of minutes it wasn t at 8 30 I went to the open kitchen and asked when our main course would be served in a few minutes I was told approx 5 minutes later the two bowls of pasta arrived unfortunately incorrectly I was served a meat dish which i don t eat I then took it back to the kitchen and in no uncertain terms advised them that i had now waited over and hour and a half to received a simple pasta dish which was not one selected apologies were for the hundredth time were given and i was promised immediate attention sure enough my pasta meal of ricotta and spinach pasta arrived in a perhaps 1 minute surprise surprise it was a bowl of pasta smothered in cream with a odd touch of green in it simply disgusting in both appearance and taste it was left my whole experience lasted 2 hours i didn t get what I had planned and as it was the last piece of the jigsaw before hopefully a good nights sleep and a hundred mile ride the following day , The location for the Prudential London Surrey 100 cycle was and is excellent the effort the hotel put in to accommodate hundreds of cyclists was above and beyond
