407685,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I asked for a bathtub pre paid non cancellation rate in full for an executive room for 6 nights asking in my email for a modern room with neutral furnishings shown in the photos I got assigned a room with gold furnishings drapes Bath tub shower very very narrow Asked for a higher floor Instesd I got assigned a room 508 on the 5th floor 9 floors in the hotel with rooms Noisy room at night bright light from neon sign shone through my blind at night , Breakfast very good Bed fine 
407686,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Had problems paying the bill I asked to use another credit card but he made the mistake of debuting the wrong card He said he reversed the payment then took another payment but the original has not reversed they also have not reversed the original authority on the card Not happy,No Positive
407687,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The fairly recently renovated Shower leaked onto the bathroom floor making it slippery and unpleasant We advised the staff on the first morning who said it would get attended to but the next morning it was just the same We spoke with the manager on checkout and although he was sorry and reduced our room rate it is disappointing when these issues are not corrected when noticed All it needed was application of some sealant Also the charge for an Aperitivo on the roof was very excessive at 15 Euro each , We had 2 nights at the end of our trip Everything was really very good Great location near Shops and the Duoma and other facilities 
407688,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We found the majority of the staff here rather rude and indifferent for the most part It was like pulling teeth to try and get answers and directions for anything It always seemed like I was bothering them whenever I asked most of the staff anything Alex on the rooftop bar was lovely and attentive though as was the one receptionist with long dark hair whose name I unfortunately didn t get She was helpful to all guests she interacted with Breakfast was ok overall but nothing stood out The room never felt cool enough but was passable If you enjoy a really cold room to sleep in at night I would reconsider Especially during these blazing summer months Otherwise I will not come back and will not recommend the place to anyone , Close to the Duomo some trams buses and trains so for location and your transportation needs it s a very well situated hotel 
407689,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We only had a bathtub not a shower Although I didn t mind it was a bit odd for my husband and kids , The breakfast buffet was beautifully displayed had a fantastic variety and tasted delicious They also stored our bags for us the morning we arrived since it was too early for the room to be ready The room was clean and comfortable 
407690,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Trams were a little noisy but no other negatives for this hotel, Room was comfy The hotel is very close to the Duomo Roof top bar provided a great view for sunset Breakfast choices were very good Staff in the breakfast room provided first class service
407691,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Tram noise , Very close to the Duomo We were given a beautiful and large room at the front of the hotel but did not get any sleep due to the screeching of the trams The hotel moved us to a back room for the second night which was very quiet Rooms were very comfortable with great ammenities Very good breakfast Staff very helpful Lots of cafes nearby Go to the top floor terrace for a spectacular view of Milan 
407692,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The hotel cooperates with a parking lot next to the hotel and costs 20 per night There is enough noise from the trolley uses in the square all night , The hotel is located in the center of Milan 5 minutes from the piazza del Duomo 
407693,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, the twin beds are too close to each other image a queen bed cut into two from the middle it s a bit awkward if you re traveling with a friend , Great location modern facilities 
407694,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Room size was a little on the small side but overall OK Why is it almost everywhere that when booking a double room there is only one luggage rack available Obviously two people are staying in the room and both normally would have their own suitcase One usually ends up on the floor In this hotel I cleared the nightstand and used it as the other stand for my suitcase , The breakfast buffet was very good A lot of variety and the staff were quick to provide coffee latte cappucino etc 
407695,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Some noise from trams and noisy cars outside Saturday night , Friendly welcome great breakfast including vegan options Room very comfortable including extra bed for my son A few minutes walk to Duomo central areas Parking in separate garage around the corner 
407696,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I thought there were two restaurants but it appeared the second one was only open during the day for lunch The menu at the roof restaurant was limited so you would not want to go two nights on the trot even if you could afford it No information given as to facilities when you checked in , Roof top restaurant very nice but very expensive 
407697,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Our toilet was too high for me and I m not too short 5 4 , It was a clean and beautiful and Modern Hotel with fantastic location and outstanding breakfast We had 2 triple bed rooms and i love the quality of everything from sheets and pillows and breakfast in Hotel 
407698,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I didn t like the staff they are rude and the minute we reached there was women yelling at the reception about some issues with her reservation and called them liers and they bothered to calm here or to make it right and security tried to walk her away from the hotel My kids got frightened with situation For us the AC was not working properly in the room and it was too hot when we asked them to fix it they ignore us completely , Like only the location
407699,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Very poor service at breakfast and it was too busy and crowded Took us 10 minutes to get some coffee which had to be ordered Check inn took a very long time, Bathroom was nice Good location not too far from the train and metro 
407700,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, There was nothing not to like An excellent hotel good value great breakfast superb location next to the metro wonderful rooftop bar and terrace , Awesome breakfast 
407701,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The climate system was not working properly couldn t be controled from the panel We got literaly frozen , Really perfect location Staff is excellent 
407702,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Entire experience was a nightmare from start to finish and we were on our honeymoon Upon check in we were informed we had to pay an additional 30 per person per night because booking com did not transmit the info properly I can t hold that against the hotel but will address this with booking com After checking in we went to the roof for dinner very and every meal was just horrible My wife ordered the land and sea option but we were told it was just one or the other ok her carpaccio tasted like hamburger meat and hamburger seasoning My fish was cold and very fishy tasting Definitely not worth the money 150 for a crappy meal We then went over to the bar section and ordered a cocktail I got my martini but my wife waited for 30 minutes and her drink never came We were never acknowledged by bar staff again to let them know so we finally just decided to leave When they saw us leaving displeased the bar staff finally asked who had taken our order so they could look into it but made no effort to buy us a drink or even apologize Then we got back to the room 10 30pm and the toilet would not stop running and it was LOUD like a rushing river My wife called the front desk and I went down to talk to the manager I explained the entire awful evening to him and he was more interested in our terrible dinner than the toilet but said he would send someone up to the room to fix it The first bellhop that came up to fix it was able to get it to stop running 11 15pm As soon as he left the toilet would no longer flush so we called downstairs again While waiting for the next repair we got a knock at the door I opened it assuming it was the gentleman here to fix the toilet but instead it was the restaurant manager waving the dinner receipt in my face and asking why we didn t tell him we were dissatisfied while at the restaurant this is at 11 30 at night down a dark hallway we were the only room down there , Location
407703,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Very uncomfortable bed noisy AC for me it should be a 3stars hotel and not value for money , Very good breakfast and smiling stuff Location is great walking distance to shops restaurants and Duomo cathedral 
407704,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, the family room is really big the bathroom also and the sofa bed is unexpectedly really comfortable really near milan duomo but not to near so we just enjoy the crowd and the silence 
407705,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lobby is unassuming and room was small but well appointed, Roof top terrace was fabulous views and super friendly staff Location was wonderful as well as breakfast 
407706,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The shops are too expensive, The Duomo Cathedral is the most wonderful and Amazing Cathedral I have ever seen and it s just a minute walk from the hotel 
407707,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We had travelled 26 hrs and arrived at the hotel at 9am Would have been good if the staff was more accommodating and tried to get us a room as early as possible But they did not even try There would have been some guests that may have checked out early like we did at 9am When we did wake it was 11 pm and there were no room service or a meal anywhere in the vicinity , Breakfast buffet was good
407708,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The drinks were expensive compared to the local restaurants and bars , The staff were very helpful The roof terrace was a lovely place to end the evening 
407709,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The reception staff have bad attitude The hotel charges 30 per day for the baby crib Poor wifi, Rooms are big clean toilets are clean and equipped smart location Most of the staff were friendly
407710,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Repeated requests to the reception staff over three days did not result in a functioning hair dryer , About three blocks from the Duomo and shopping Missouri Metro is around the corner 
407711,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The hotel was below our expectations First of all parking is very inconvenient the parking facility do not belong to the hotel they just forward you to some parking garage for a 24eur day Hotel lobby looks new and stylish but one cannot claim the same for rooms Room furnishings look old and ran down and size of the rooms are quite small Also you can easily hear voices spoken in the next room which is a very negative thing , We liked the location it is a walk distance to Duomo 
407712,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We booked the family room quadruple and arrived at 3 15 PM to find that our room was NOT ready and we were asked to wait just a couple of minutes After 30 minutes of standing in the lobby I kindly asked if the hotel might have a similar room that we could be re assigned One of the ladies at the desk started programming new keys for a new room but then another hotel rep started arguing loudly that this was not OK We were then told to wait a few more minutes We became a bit impatient since we had made reservations at another venue and because of the problems of our check in to this hotel were made to show up very late After a few more minutes we were told that our room was ready however when we got to our room we were met by at least three people desperately cleaning and were told to wait a few more minutes Please see pic of cleaning crew still working on our room The AC was not functioning properly so our room was very hot The fan on the AC intake is also quite loud and does not have a on off switch , Large rooms but please read additional comments and concerns Breakfast was very good though we had to go ask for coffee and tea after waiting over 30 minutes 
407713,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, It was in a great location Short walk to the Duomo Rooms were very comfortable and clean Bathroom was nice and big and the shower was amazing Great bar on the rooftop to relax in the afternoon with a few Moscow Mules 
407714,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The blind was broken but I called reception and they sent someone up to help me within a couple of minutes Excellent service , This is the second time I ve stayed here and it s still excellent The bedrooms are so clean very comfortable and spacious the nicest hotel I ve stayed in in Milan Easy checkin checkout process 
407715,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The shower was not good Although fixed to a bar it was more like a hand held shower Because of its positioning the water spilled on to the bathroom floor Shower was not powerful Free wifi but patchy at times , Staff were friendly Great selection at breakfast Good scrambled eggs Lots of fresh fruit Cake and pastries tasty The room was nice bed was comfortable Lots of bathroom products Hotel is in a terrific location just minutes from the Duomo I would stay there again 
407716,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Breakfast room is a bit of a hall but not a major issue since the food and drinks are very nice, Has a rooftop bar restaurant and we had a very nice light lunch there Proximity to Duomo and next metro stop are great Breakfast was very good 
407717,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The breakfast not really good i think it s lck of variation when this hotel is 4 stars hotel , The sofa beda is really comfy The location is surprisingly great near duomo but not to near so we don t annoyed by the crowd The staff was really helpful everytime i asked for their help And the last and the best they give us a bootle of wine for compliment
407718,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lifts that took an age to arrive , Room very comfortable clean and spacious Staff very helpful Easy to walk from the hotel to Duomo La Scala church containing The Last Supper fresco 
407719,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lifts are inadequate especially when functions on top floor Got stuck in lift for over half an hour and had to force the life and jump out with two others no effort from management to acknowledge or appoligise Had to ask for it No offer of a drink or anything, Great location fair breakfast Good reception staff Interesting rooftop bar which was expensive and had three functions for public in the four nights thetr
407720,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The bathroom was very small with no place to put out toiletry and the elevators were small and full all the time so most of the time we had to use the stairs , Location and the staff 
407721,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, the bed was not that comfortable and the light in the bathroom kept blinking wifi was also weak , breakfast and location is perfect just 5 min to Duomo by walk 
407722,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The hotel was way below our expectations First of all parking is very inconvenient the parking facility do not belong to the hotel they just forward you to some parking garage for a 24eur day Hotel lobby looks new and stylish but one cannot claim the same for rooms Room furnishings look old and ran down and size of the rooms are quite small Also you can easily hear voices spoken in the next room which is a very negative thing , The location is very central that is a big plus 
407723,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, If the printed address can show the gate of Metro station the foreign guests will save time to circulate around The breakfast buffet are almost same every day but no fish at all seems not matched with the price level The beans for coffering seems not good enough too The triple room is too small for a family with a teenage child as no space for 3 people to sit , The hotel is very close to the Duomo by just walking for 5min so as to be easier to reach the most famous scenery spots as well as the shopping The another advantage is convenient to take public transportation as just cross road to Missori metro station The staff is
407724,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Shower not comfortable to use AC did not cool room enough Tram can be heard felt from the 8th floor but if you re not sensitive not bad , Good location Excellent breakfast 
407725,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, The staff was friendly roof top bar was great breakfast was fab but room was standArd not excutive room but could do more for for single parents ie entertainment 
407726,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Travelodge at 4 times the price The hotel fairly centrally located had very little character no welcome made to feel a valued guest and amenities were basic On arrival the check in advised that she would upgrade the room as there was more space The upgraded room was smaller than a standard size UK room Room service was basic sheets not changed floors not hoovered and dirty cups not removed and replaced with clean Breakfast had a good assortment but on two mornings running left an unsettled feeling in the stomach The standard same reply to all reviews on this site gives away the lack of individual customer value and welcoming as shown in person Walls between rooms were thin with full conversations heard and the noise from the trams on the road below at high floors was great The roof top bar sounded great but again there appeared to be apathy in customer care many tables littered with dirty glasses and a 15 Euro price tag for a basic non adventurous cocktail There are many more hotels at this price in Milan that would be better , At a economy hotel price the hotel would be palatable 
407727,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Parking outside getting a voucher for a car park 200m away 24 Euro per day walking back Very busy reception area Outdated rooms and bathrooms tables WAY too close together in the breakfast room , Convenient location for Duomo and transport links 
407728,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The room was very small and the beds took up most of the floorspace The WC was positioned very close to the sink as there was a bidet in the bathroom so it was rather crowded The shower head was positioned oddly at the middle of the bath rather than the head, Good buffet breakfast excellent selection for European hotel Great location 10 mins to Cathedral Roof top bar pleasant and reasonably priced Bidet in bathroom single beds large and comfortable Good wifi Tea making facility
407729,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, Perfect location 7 mins walk to city center and metro Clean and comfortable room Wonderful terrace on the last floor with beautiful view Very delicious breakfast 
407730,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Amazing breakfast and waitstaff Great sized bathrooms, We had booked a triple room through booking com and on arrival the third bed was a sofa bed after travelling and paying what we did for one night accommodation this is not good if you are booking a room for three it s something you look out for is the bed type and sofa bed should always be specified which it is on most listings on booking com We ended up changing room which was ok Lumpy mattresses and utilities provided were for two not three 
407731,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Even though I was in a non smoking room the room smelled like cigarettes Also if you are a woman make sure to bring conditioner They only provide shampoo I would also recommend bringing your own hair dryer Their hair dryer is very outdated and takes ages to dry your hair , I was here for business and the hotel was a 2 min walk from the venue Very convenient location 20 min drive to Linate Airport
407732,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, While our room was clean balcony was grubby Although soundproofed our room on the 9th floor was just below the roof bar and restaurant and we could hear the music Roof Bar staff unfriendly and unhelpful We were going to dine at the hotel but after our experience with them we went elsewhere , Room size and bathroom Reception staff Good breakfast
407733,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Room needs serious updating Furniture old Bathroom shower gets water on floor no matter how you point it Needs extra luggage rack only had one Pillows and mattress uncomfortable Needs a good cleaning and had a small sink area for products The Reataurant was Excellent as were all the service people , Room size view restaurant storage space 
407734,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The elevators were too few Waiting for a lift too long , Breakfasts were feasts And the staff simply marvelous The view from the terrace was splendid It was even quiet at night 
407735,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, 2 tiny lifts for a 10 floors hotel impossible to go down with our pram between 8am and 10 30am I had to carry the pram in the stairs So ridiculous and stupid The shower was very modern but no hot water on saturday morning and the flow was sooooo slow drop by drop not the kind of shower one enjoys tiny and old TV we didnt watch it but still there was not the standard for a 4 hotel , location we walked everywhere room was big modern bathroom breakfast was good staff was friendly rooftop bar
407736,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I miss a shower in our room The rooftop terraze was ok English channels on TV was poor, We could order hot fresh coffee a volante breakfast buffet was excellent a lot of choices and fresh I like the fact they refill the buffet even after breakfast time because people were not done eating 
407737,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lack of maintenance AC windows shutters Bathroom door broken you could get a cold when taking a shower even the holder of the shower handle is installed in a wrong way which is something juvenile but frustrating when you start remembering yourself that this hotel is a 4 stars one , Close to the Duomo
407738,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Bathroom was good but the shower was in the bath and the screen was badly placed and impossible to stop water running on to the floor, Nice comfy room Roof terrace really nice Very central location ideal for sightseeing and excellent shopping
407739,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Perhaps they weren t tragic elements but my room needed several small repairs rattling A C vent toilet paper stuffed in a ventilator broken toilet roll holder leaky shower door The decor of the room itself was also a little tired and some refurbishment would be a good idea Also the lack of power sockets in the room was a little inconvenient , The hotel is ideally located with a Metro station just outside the hotel doors and the Piazza del Duomo just a couple of corners away The roof terrace bar is delightful with a great panorama of the inner city The wifi service is exceptionally good The breakfast is also excellent but can get a little crowded The staff are pleasant and helpful 
407740,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We ordered an omelette while having breakfast for additional charge as this is not included in the standard breakfast and both mine and my wife s was the worst we ever had dry and mushrooms from a can , The rooftop bar is really lovely 
407741,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It is very close to the tram line so is a little noisy early in the morning but trams are part of the beauty of the city so not a big complaint , Everything was fantastic The room was beautiful and comfortable the bathroom was huge and spotless The staff were polite and welcoming and helped my husband to surprise me with flowers and prosecco for my birthday in our room on arrival The rooftop terrace was wonderful if a but pricey for drinks and aperitivi snacks and a fantastic view The breakfast room was amazing and the selection and service outstanding The location was excellent less than 5 minutes walk to the Duomo and great value for money in such an expensive City 
407742,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The meals we received for room service were not nice They were lacking in flavor My faccacia was dry and very uninspiring, The breakfast was wonderful with a huge Surety of fresh food
407743,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Parking is a bit too far It is not in the hotel but a few block away , Good location only five mins walk to center of the city Room is clean and comfortable
407744,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Air conditioning appeared limited needed to open the windows , Great location five minute walk from the Duomo plaza Excellent staff and security The breakfast buffet included was like a gourmet restaurant with fresh pastries and excellent selection of both European and American breakfast choices 
407745,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Bathtub doesn t have enough water shielding when showering thus a lot of spill, Location clean spacious room good service nice rooftop bar good buffet breakfast variety
407746,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The view from our room wasn t great but then we were out all day and didn t need to look out of the window , A perfect city hotel just minutes from the Duomo shops and restaurants Quick check in and out friendly staff I was staying with my 2 daughters and the room was a good size with comfortable beds and the bathroom had a bath and shower with a good range of toiletries We liked the fact the room had a kettle unusual in Italy so we could make our own tea at bedtime without having to call room service or go out to a cafe Breakfast had a good varied selection including fresh fruit bread croissants and cakes 
407747,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Pig swill at breakfast TOO many people anxious to eat their last meal on earth at least that s how it seemed , Staff were standoffish maybe overworked 
407748,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Bathroom is absolutely ok but the bathtub shower is small unpractical and a bit uncomfortable TV screen is way below standard very very small Only two elevators for many floors and rooms more than once I had to wait quite a bit for the elevator to come and I was on the 6th floor so using the stairs was not super practical A bit pricey overall 180 euros per night but it s worth for the location , Location is fantastic 5 minutes walk from the Duomo which means that you don t need public transportation to visit and enjoy the city The hotel itself is nicely decorated and well kept definitely above standard for the 4 stars hotels in Milan Room was spacious and overall comfortable Breakfast is quite good in quality not outstanding however lacking a bit of variety Staff was kind and ready Restaurant food I had a room service was quite good even though a bit pricey 45 euros for an entree and a main 
407749,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Noisy even on the 6th floor trams outside running all day and night every 30 seconds with very noisy rails shutter didn t close all the way and curtains didn t meet in the middle so it was a noisy night and light morning , Good location Room was clean
407750,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The air condition has been set to 30 c deg as they told us its winter And no way we can adjust So the room is always hot We decided to open the windows however it was so noisy because of the cars and trains and lots of mosquitoes So we did not enjoy our stay in this hotel and would not recommend it to others to others , The location is fantastic 
407751,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The A C is loud in some rooms and the systemis old the first night it woke us up when it went on , Excellent location and a good 4 star hotel The hotel is quite nice and very clean the breakfast is tasty and quality and choices are very good for a 4 Star The Reception people respond very fast to your demands Our room had some problems the first night the nextmorning they upgraded us veryfast The beds are comfy and Housekeeping is very good 
407752,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I didnt like the front desk manager he tries to be polite but he does not like to help at all Also i did not like the bathrooms and the bathtubs that are extremely small although the size of the bathroom is acceptable Also u did not like the bidet which is very difficult to use Also the noise of the tram whichbis running all night is very annoying,No Positive
407753,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Unfortunately the aircon was really loud and blowing out hot air despite trying to turn the temperature down and even though I asked the staff twice to turn it off it wasn t done , The breakfast was fantastic lots of choice and the staff were always replacing food with fresh food The bedroom was comfy and the bathroom was a good size although only a shower no bath but that didn t bother me The hotel is in a great location 2 minutes walk from Duomo square 
407754,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Some people may find a bit noisy as the traffic is very close especially if you are located in lower floors , I reported a fault on television and it was fixed during the day 
407755,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It was sometimes hard to communicate with the staff in the breakfast room I could not drink the coffee that I asked for , The location breakfast cleanness room comfort I was in Milan for MADE Expo The location of the hotel was very close to the public transport for any business meeting At the same time it was in the hearthland of shopping area and historical places I strongly advice you give yourself a chance and stay in Dei Cavalieri 
407756,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, At 6 00 be ready to heare the tram mowing along the brick road If you whant to sleep longer keep your windows closed during the night, The room is really comfortable breakfast is teasty with a good number of cheese fruits etc to choose The car parking is nearby with the price of 24 Euro a day Really high but it s difficult to find anything cheaper in the center of Milan
407757,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The room had an slaying scent of perfume which was just too much My assumption was that they were simply trying to drown a bad smell in perfume The stay would have been much better without this smell , The room was small and cozy The Hotel is within walking distance from all important sights and public transport 
407758,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The hotel is old rooms not sound isolated you can hear other customers and staff at 6am in the hallway Staff opened our room door very early in the morning without knocking Staff at the reception were not welcoming nor smiling , The location of the hotel was very convenient within a walking distance from the center The breakfast is good too and very rich 
407759,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It was very warm in the hotel we were often too hot and had to sleep with the windows open Unusual for rainy cold days at the start of March , The breakfast buffet was amazing and the staff cheerful and friendly and very helpful The bedroom was comfy and the pillows were great 
407760,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Bathroom needs renovation Prijs of drinks en dinner a bit high, Very good breakfast friendly staff perfect location big room perfect view from the roof terrace Clean I highly recommend 
407761,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, no hot water kettle in room, Really spacious room with an unbeatable room rate considering it was the heart of the Milan Fashion Week one of the widest breakfast spreads among hotels I have seeen in Europe
407762,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, would have been nice to have been able to get a coffee from the bar in reception whilst we waited for our transfer vehicle upon leaving, great selection of items for breakfast and the hotel is in a prime location
407763,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I did not like the air conditioning ventilation system very loud and I seemed as it was not possible to change the temperature in the room or the airflow, Location fantastic in the center close to Duomo and close to historic part room is not new and quite small but clean and convenient spacious bathroom Breakfast is very good
407764,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lots of noise on the street outside and above The Windows and the room needs to be insulated We couldn t sleep well, Great location good facilities nice staff and hotel bar Good breakfast

407771,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, If you are a light sleeper get a room away from the street The trams run late into the night and are noisy Coming from Milan Malpensa airport by train the connecting metro station is Duomo which is quite a long walk from the hotel with luggage There is a closer metro station but it s on another line , The room facilities were very good and I wished that we could have stayed here on our second visit to Milan during the trip The breakfast buffet was also very good 
407772,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The parking location is almost two blocks from the hotel No private parking for the hotel itself , Great location in walking distance to Duomo and most shopping streets nice and big room to accommodate 2 adults and 2 kids Wide variety of hot and cold breakfast

407774,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I upgraded the room and I paid 100 then when I was checking out they asked me to pay it again because I don t have a receipt is that even fair,No Positive
407775,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It locates within the walking distance to Duomo Cathedral but the condition of the hotel is not satisfactory The room is way too small and the facilities really need to be updated Comparing with its neighbor hotel The Square this hotel is not highly recommended , Location 
407776,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Rooms are small cleanliness is ok , Location is absolutely fantastic Four mins from Domo and close to everything Breakfast is AMAZING Best I ve seen at a hotel 
407777,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Not all staff members treat guests the same from some of the staff being so kind welcoming and pleasant there are some not really kind or helpful Two quite opposite experiences in communication with different staff about the same thing Another minus for people who must leave early in the morning no avalable early breakfast or packed one but would definitely stay again at this hotel because it is a great value for money excellent location great food and all clean not to mention the fabulous rooftop terrace ,No Positive
407778,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Everything was perfect, The hotel was extremely bussy And I understand the lifts are small as the building is quiet historical But there is a long Very long wait for lift access
407779,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I didn t liked the fact that iron room was on the first floor and you had to get there with all the clothes Especially if you were leaving on the 7th floor We had some problems with opening the doors to our rooms as the cards were just unexpectedly blocked , The staff was really nice and you could easily ask for a taxi 24 7 The locaition is good as you can get to Duomo in a 5 10 mins 
407780,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, , It has an amazing breakfast buffet haven t seen a better one yet The location is very good within walking distance to duomo and there is a metro station right across the street from the hotel The staff was nice The rooms were cleaned and the beds were made daily

407785,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Having mirrors in all rooms At first it was hard to wear makeup or blow drying my hair However the other room had good mirror , Location breakfast We decided to extend our stay the Staff tried their best to accommodate us although the hotel was very busy 
407786,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Breakfast room is a complete chaos Waiters running and bumping into each other and complaining about too many tables of two When it comes to gluten free breakfast is kind of a joke , Hotel is in a very central location Duomo is around the corner several sites of the centre are on walking distance Overall furniture would do with a total refurbish but given the price the room size and the position it was a good deal 
407787,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I reserved a room for three The room was very cold Hotel told that they did not switch to heating yet end Oct therefore could not heat the room but only close aircondition The third bed was very small and convenient only for a child not for an adult The room was on the street side It was not possible to sleep because of trams Next day I requested to change the room and ask fora quiet room They did That room was perfect It was too big compared the first one temparature was normal so heating was working This means there are different quality of rooms Be careful while reserving, Excellent breakfast Every kind of food was available All fresh Location very good
407788,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Wi Fi signal was intermittent , Roof top bar was a lovely we stayed in the autumn and heaters and blankets made sitting outside in the evening very pleasant Breakfast was also excellent as a wide choice was provided and everything was freshly made 
407789,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, When we entered the room it seemed like we were entering into a freezer We tried to bring the temperature up with no luck Then we tried to turn it off its noise was too loud anyway but there was no off button We asked for help and the cleaning lady told us we would have to call reception desk in order to have the AC turned off So we did and we were informed that the centralized heating was not yet turned on but nice touch they could bring us more blankets in case we needed Needless to say it was not a comfortable night it was not comfortable to get off the shower in the morning into the freezin room shower that also spills water everywhere on the floor Regarding Breakfast It was OK This is a huge room full of guests with hardworking staff trying to keep up literally sweating but with plastic orange juice a no no for me Regarding staff maybe it was just bad luck but At 8 30 they are knocking at your door and in fact opening it just to check if they can clean the room can t they be informed by the reception desk who already checked out But also this lady at the reception desk that looks like a special agent from the eastern block was very professional getting the payment at check in and not check out like in any other place Considering that as mission accomplished she turned to the next guest and only after a good deal of time staring at her she asked me in a very snobbish way is there anything else I can do for you sir In fact there is now that I have paid for it maybe you could hand me the room keys Bottom line is an old hotel in need of some major refurbishments people and equipment wise in a very convenient spot , Location It is actually well located
407790,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Although the location is a couple of blocks from the center Duomo the sound of the street cars at 530 6am each morning was terrible Since we were there on holiday I didn t really want to get up so early So I would advise to ask for a room that does not face the front street or streetcars , Very cool boutique hotel very modern and comfortable plus great staff an amazing brunch in the morning that includes Prosecco sparkling white wine They also have an amazing bar on the rooftop that is a lot of fun at night 
407791,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Hotel transfer driver didn t ask which airport terminal we wanted dropped at and just dropped us at Malpensa terminal 1 We were flying from terminal 2 and took us mins to get there , Breakfast choice was fantastic 
407792,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Problem with bath not emptying Request to fix but not done and had to call room service to empty on second night again Shower hose too short causing it to spray all over bathroom also in the way while showering Dinner service was shocking The one waiter serving 2 tables only kept forgetting to return with request for butter and Parmesan cheese on pasta dish Bed sheets made but not change daily , Wifi breakfast location
407793,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It was advertised with an airport shuttle which is one of the reasons we booked it it didn t have one The lighting in the room was very dull you couldn t do anything at night as there was not enough light you couldn t even pack your bag ,No Positive
407794,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, There was no hot water in the bathroom on the last morning prior to a very early checkout The reception wasted time sending someone after 15 minutes just to verify whether our complaint was true In any case they were unable to get the hot water running and finally offered the use of another bathroom 6 floors below ours This was clearly unacceptable Also despite the Booking com commitment that there would be no deposit or advance the hotel tried charging blocking an amount on our credit card 8 10 days BEFORE we checked in This led to all kinds of complications because we were already on tour in other parts of Italy by then and our bank couldn t contact us to verify the transaction , Excellent breakfast and location 
407795,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Having to leave to come home , Suite on top floor was wonderful Great space sitting room had patio door leading on to rooftop terrace which had delightful lounge with unparalleled views of the city particularly at sunset Bar staff professional highly attentive and discreet room maid left suite immaculate every day Hotel is five minute very direct walk to Duomo Gallerie and Plaza which has buzzing atmosphere day and night plenty of bars and restaurants Hot and cold breakfast buffet well stocked and delicious Marble bathroom large and spotless A subtle but very worthwhile detail at sunset your drinks on terrace rooftop come with delightful nibbles as in most bars around the city Noticed on the hop on hop off bus tour that the only other large hotels we spotted were near the Central train station further away from the centre so delighted with our choice of hotel El Cavalieri is a definite touch of class

407804,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, pictures of rooms shown on your site don t reflect the real rooms i stayed in room 518 and its was too small too old and definitely not up to the value paid per night wifi in the room was very slow amenities in the shower did not include hair conditioner price of room per night is euro 350 are you kidding quality of bedsheets and pillow covers in below average i would appreciate when promoting any hotel to be more accurate and honest about the quality of hotel and to have prices that reflect those qualities thank you, location is the only value added to this hotel

407864,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, If you are reading this I suspect that you are interested in booking this hotel If so I heed and plead you not my learned friend During my short stay 4 days 3 nights at this Hotel dei Cavalieri it has been a series of unfortunate events This can be witnessed by 4 events that my mother and I experienced throughout my stay 1 I should have seen the signs the very first moment I stepped into this hotel At the beginning of my trip despite being first in queue and told that my hotel room was still not cleaned yet my mother and I waited on the side A blonde lady served me whose name I sadly did not manage to catch because during the multiple times we exchanged conversations she failed to wear her tag This hotel staff told me that once they received a telephone call from the cleaners I could head to my room Subsequently an Italian family behind me was also told that their room was also not cleaned yet and they waited Thereafter once she received a telephone call the blonde lady gave the hotel key card to the bell boy to serve the Italian family whilst my mother and I were left at the lobby It was only after serving several guests that my mother asked for the blonde lady to kindly check if our room was ready Without any surprise considering she received the phone call a while back she finally handed us our key card 2 The second event would be during the provided breakfast I have not mentioned my ethnicity but I believe that it has something to do with the ill service that my mother and I received Both my mom and I are chinese When my mother and I went to sit at a three person table for breakfast we were blatantly told off that we could not do so However next to the table that we chose were two blonde ladies sitting at a four person table Once we pointed out that to the waiter and asked his reasoning for allowing them to do so but not us he quivered and finally let us sit down 3 , The only thing I liked about this hotel was its prime location and its cleanliness However these are both very basic expectations from booking a four star hotel 
407865,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, See previous comment, Very much liked lication and overall hotel facilities Breakfast was excellent One odd thing happened TV in our room wasn t showing CNN international channel When I asked staff for help they said the whole hotel didn t have that channel however I was later able to fix our TV myself so it did show CNN 
407866,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Street Car outside does make some noise at night Part of being in an excellent location Our room had hand shower only , Excellent Location Excellent breakfast Helpful and professional staff
407867,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The air conditioning for most of the common areas of building except for the lobby was most likely non operational I know the AC in our room didn t work because I was forced to fight with the night staff about sweating while he tried to convince me it was because the thermostat was set incorrectly He sent someone up yo check it and he set it to 5 deg with no relief Finally at 3 00 am after 2 trips to the lobby and one phone call he allowed us to change rooms Bad night of sleep no offer of compensation no apologies At check out the staff member who was very nice otherwise clearly had no interest in my troubles The shower was also an awkward affair with the shower head in the middle of a narrow tub a position that allowed it to spray around the room because the shower glass only covered 1 2 of the tub , Lobby is pretty

407876,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Not a thing On a side if coming through Austria to get here don t forget to get the autobahn vignette We knew about it forgot to get it and paid the 120 Euro fine but did remember the vignette for Switzerland , Ratings say it all We spent one night on our way back home to Deutschland and that one night certainly impressed us Great room with comfortable bed big bathroom with slippers robe for pool big flat screen TV that wasn t used much since the balcony facing the valley presented an outstanding view of the spectacular Alps Indoor pool temp was just right and not over chlorinated Surrounding lounge area was comfortable and quiet Towels were available as was fruit for the eating we didn t use the sauna Grounds surrounding the hotel included short walking paths under the eagles nest and around the property Well kept grounds with water features and statues gave a relaxing yet upscale feel The Michelin rated restaurant served one of the best meals we ve eaten side note we lived in Vegas to 17 years and ate out alot While the price of the room and restaurant is steep all things considered we would definitely return and are planning to in the near future 
407877,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, nothing , The hotel was friendly and clean The location is perfect for the Duomo area just 5 mins walk from the hotel to the Duomo Piazza and 20 mins walk to Davinci s Last Supper Mural but make sure you ve got a route pre planned as there weren t many signs The hotel is also right next to the Central Line Metro stop Missori so very easy to get to and from the main station or to get around Milan via the Metrol The breakfast is an all you can eat buffet with an abundance of choice from pastries and cakes to fruit and cereal or hot cooked eggs and bacon The roof terrace was a wonderful escape The roof terrace bar is closed in the afternoon but you can still use the lovely relaxing area and buy drinks from the reception bar We shared a triple room each with our own large bed en suite bathroom with plenty of towels and shampoos etc I would stay here again if we returned to Milan The
407878,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The room is due for refurbishing The pictures are a bit misleading as the Duomo is not visible from the rooftop terrace , Location within a 5 minutes walk to the Duomo and Galleria Free beverages in the lobby with a few snacks which were welcome after driving there 
407879,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, 10 floors only 2 Elevators Pluming problems with some rooms bathtubs Parking lot is 5 minutes give or take from the hotel , Location Clean Friendly staff We stayed there few times every time they gave us a nicer room special treatment for regulars 
407880,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Cleans Air condition noisy and turn from reception not the room Very poor, Only breakfast and the stuff in restaurant spical mr Kareem Was helpful And the food was good and luggage man was helpful
407881,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Service at rooftop bar not the best especially on a busy night Pity the rooms don t have better in room coffee , Perfect location for central Milan right next to a metro stop Breakfast pretty good Views from rooftop bar are a must Would return 
407882,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lousy wifi and noisy a c fan The wifi in my room was not good connection is difficult to make and gets lost frequently also the speed is too slow so making a VPN connection to my company was impossible I was at a room on the 6th floor at the end of the hall the hotel personnel responded quickly to my complaint but to my astonishment did not take it seriously The did nothing and left The airconditioner can not be switched off the noise of the fan was keeping me awake at night The next morning the personnel at the reception confirmed that it was not possible to switch off the airconditioner and that there was nothing to be done about it This hotel is disqualified for me with 4 stars it is overrated and with 150 Euro overpriced , the location is good close to the subway and walking distance to the dome
407883,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Our room right next to the roof top bar walls between rooms that were paper thin so you could hear many conversations in the middle of the night The shower was mostly just tiny drops of water and they charged us for the room on a credit card I didn t want to be charged on before our arrival , The location and the roof top bar
407884,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Lack of table space and only one chair in the room , Assistance and advise from staff Politness and courtesy Excellent breakfast Roominess room 811 Good inhouse restaurant Location
407885,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The restaurant and bar menu was overpriced The foot wasn t the best quality after visiting other parts of Italy and restaurants in Milan The room for four which was advertised as two double beds was actually one double and a very uncomfortable sofa bed It was extremely hot and despite several calls nothing was done about this We were happy to open the windows but ended up with severa midge bites Very limited plug sockets , The hotel had a lovely rooftop garden It was in a central location The buffet breakfast was wonderful 
407886,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, The decor and design of the family room was perfect for 2 children and 2 adults Each had an area separated by a partial wall which facilitated privacy and yet allowed supervision of children The wi if and excellent buffet breakfast added to the experience 
407887,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Even when front desk was friendly I got a suite but we did not have a shower Bathroom has a jacuzzi but not shower on the whole suite I was told I should request a shower if I want one Well seems to me that I should not go to a hotel where I should request a shower an certainly will not go again to that hotel,No Positive
407888,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Room was small although we had an upgraded standard and required some renovation Air conditioning without real regulation more noise than air supply To switch off you have to ask in the reception Opening window is not an option due to the tram noise from the street , Central location 200m from Duomo Metro 20m Good breakfast 
407889,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, I liked the hospitality right from the start and really it made me feel at home The staff seemed motivated and passionate about what they were doing and that is the measure of engagement of any customer industry so the credit also to go to the Arthur Christina for leading the team with high spirits Through out the stay I felt at ease and was given good care Being a HR person and a trainer I could see the genuineness of the smiles and the passion to serve customers Both Arthur Christina did not act as hosts but in fact did with professionalism and sincerity Friendliness and politeness was felt in the air 
407890,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, That i didnt stay longer No bad reviews here , Everything was to our liking I had a great time and my parents who I brought with me loved everything about the hotel 
407891,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Everything was great Even the soap in the bathroom smelled great , The family room was very spacious Very clean great water pressure delicious breakfast and great location 
407892,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, There was a stench of drains in the bathroom that was terrible it was surprising given that our room was on the ninth floor , I loved the shower and the view from the room
407893,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, As other hotels the laundry cost is expensive It would have been nice if there was a coin operated laundrymat nearby , Breakfast was excellent Very close to the Cathedral 
407894,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The enclosure for the bath tub isnt good When one uses the shower water leaks out so the floors end up wet , The location next to the underground station
407895,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, breakfast staff don t have control on the coffee service at all 5 staff were around but still we waited 30 minutes for a coffee we didn t order a second one then It would be wise to simply install a self service Nespresso machine or change the staff , very nice Hotel next to the Duomo reception staff friendly and nice good room 914 back side 
407896,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The shower was a tad faulty as the temperature was difficult to set and kept changing In addition the screen on the bath was in need of sealant and better rubber and one would keep flooding the bathroom in order to shower , The staff was very courteous I liked the fact that our room was ready by noon as I had advised well in advance that we d be arriving at that time 
407897,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, Excellent central location pleasant and helpful staff I stayed two separate nights during one week and had booked the same category room both times Business Double The first time the room was basic and sufficient for what I needed but I would have expected a bit more comfort For my second visit I received a room upgrade to an amazing suite which was fabulous The breakfast at this hotel is amazing Well worth taking your time for in the morning The pastries are particularly nice but generally the selection of food and drink on offer is brilliant 
407898,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We booked a room with double bed and two singles but got two singles and sofa bed After negotiation they gave us a small double room at no extra charge, The location is unbeatable
407899,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, Gluten free breakfast offered perfect location parking just around the corner all good except for smelly overpowering perfume used presumably to freshen the hotel in the corridors and some rooms Ditch that and it is great 
407900,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Waiting for the lift was a real pain It often took five minutes or more to arrive and by then it was full , Very close to the duomo Excellent choice of breakfast Nice toiletries
407901,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, 1 Late Housekeeping they didn t cleaned the room until 16 30 when we came back to our room to take some rest they called us and asked whether we need cleaning although the room was empty from 10 to 16 30 2 There was a que in front of the breakfast room 3 We were on the 3rd floor but we couldn t open the window because it was the ground floor in the interier terrace, 1 Location We walked everywhere even naviglio last supper pieta 2 We stayed in the triple room it was large It was larger than what we expected 3 Breakfast was good
407902,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We have booked one room for 3 adults with 3 single beds as was advertised by the hotel Which was actually the main reason us choosing this particular hotel When we arrived we were offered a room with one double bed and one sofa That is why we asked on the reception to change the room After this the new room was offered to us which was located on the floor with the restaurant and no other guest rooms This room was actually looking more like a room for servants there were 2 proper beds and another one was a camping bed which was not actually suited to sleep We therefore asked again for a room change and were told there are no triple rooms available and it is a fault of Booking com as they did not receive our reservation stated that we need 3 rooms After a long discussion we got a key to another room for one of us When we entered the room we realised that there was already a guest in this room The reception ladies were most unhelpful and incompetent Finally we could have 2 proper rooms for this night but we were promised a triple room for the next one When we came back the next evening and needed to check in into another room we specifically asked if the room has 3 beds and were told that yes What we had was 2 beds and 1 camping bed We had to fight again this time that finally the hotel would provide us with a third bed Once the bed was installed another surprise it did not have a blanket We asked and were told that there are no more blankets left Again a discussion with the reception until they brought us one So all in all we spent more than two hours during our weekend arguing with the hotel This is definitely not a 4 star standard So if you want to spend nice time in Milan there are for sure better options for this price, The location is great close to Duomo Good breakfast buffet
407903,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, There are some ants in the room even after cleaning I could see some of them on my bed i found some towels not clean enough, They gave us a very nice roon with balcony i liked the location but if iam alone I won t great location but not for a woman in the evening Great stuff nice breakfast I enjoyed it
407904,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, The hotel is rather lovely and the room was very comfortable with a beautiful big bed well appointed and decorated well Bathroom was also great albeit a little dark as there was no window and all tiling was black Great bar downstairs and also a lovely in house restaurant which served very good quality meals About a 5 10 min walk to the Duomo area so a great location very central 
407905,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, no plug for bath only one bathrobe provided, really comfortable bed and pillows nice warm room staff made extra effort to help us charge phones when we had no adapter

407907,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, First room we were given smelled but they did move us to a nicer room after we complained , Breakfast was fabulous Location very good First room we were given smelled bad but the hotel did move us and we were given a much better room Also gave us a voucher for drinks at the bar to make up for the inconvenience All in all it was good Breakfast was fabulous and they gave us a bag of goodies because we had to get to the airport early 
407908,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Everything is chargeable in the room No complimentary bottle of water , Location is only 3 minutes walk to Duomo where the hub of shopping is Cheerful and helpful front reception Hotel is very clean Room is well equipped 
407909,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The receptionist woman had very bad behavior kept us waiting for one hour for check in The carpet in the room is very dirty The price is 50 Euro day more than one year ago but nothing changes It is not worth such high price , Breakfast is better than before Location is good close to the Duomo 
407910,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Staff at reception was a bit unfriendly the lady who did check in for us made us feel uncomfortable by her tone of voice slightly rude like she was so sorry she had to serve us No sleepers and bathrobe in the room Shower was not convenient Bell boy did not even offer his help to carry our luggage when we took key after check in But big variety of breakfast overweighted all drawbacks , Breakfast was excellent unlike three previous hotels we stayed during our trip to Italy Location is excellent Despite normal check in time is 14 00 we were checked in at 12 00 with no problem 
407911,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, I wasn t disturbed about anything but I can see how certain rooms on the facade of the hotel facing the tram lines could get noisy If you have a light sleep better request a quiet room at moment of booking, It s my second time at this hotel I love it s proximity to Duomo 5min walking and the Missori underground station just in front of hotel which connects you perfectly with Stazione Centrale and the Malpensa Express Amazing breakfast sparkling wine prosecco included lots of choices It had classy Christmas decorations in the lobby and generally a nice classy atmosphere Will return 
407912,Hotel Dei Cavalieri,No Negative, A decent size bedroom and en suite We were on the 4th floor at the front and it was quiet and comfortable Very good standard of breakfast with good service 
407913,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Only one lift working Room was cold After 24 hours with thermostat at 30 there was some heating but it wasn t right The safe had no instructions but got it working for the first 24hrs Then it died locked with our stuff inside The bathroom was v small hardly any room to move Difficult to shower without spraying entire room , Great central location Friendly staff Food was good and not overpriced compered to outside Excellent breakfast Given voucher for free cocktail to compensate for problems with room 
407914,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, we were put into top floor where there is the roof BAR outside our room We didn t realize about the noise until late night pls AVOID Room temperature, location room size breakfast
407915,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, There was a reconstruction in place that I wasn t made aware of that started at 7am and therefore woke me up early on my day off which was very upsetting The eggs at breakfast were cold they didn t refill the cakes croissants once those were finished , The location is great a few blocks away from the Duomo which makes it very easy to get to the shopping area as well The room was very spacious and clean and the soaps and shampoos that they provided were fantastic The staff at the reception desk were very friendly and helpful 
407916,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It s a bit pricy compared to service and room you get I made my reservation for king bed room I also specifically asked for a renovated room They gave me a double room with old decoration , Location breakfast staff
407917,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, It s right next to the tram so we can hear the tram all the time even we asked for quite room at 8F , the breakfast was really nice and the location is only one stop from duomo or just walk 10 minutes 
407918,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The TV and hot water didn t work in my room To be fair I didn t let them know as I arrived very late and simply didn t have the time to change rooms but I expect these basics to work on arrival The metro running around the hotel was very loud and squeaky and runs through the night Not a great sleep , The restaurant at the hotel was fabulous with attentive staff and a delicious meal for a very reasonable price Breakfast was also fantastic I wish I had time to have stayed longer Location was very good for the M3 metro line and for the Milano Duomo 
407919,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, We couldn t regulate the temperature in the room luckily it was too hot so we could open the windows Even after complaining nothing was fixed but we were offered a different room for the last night , The location of this hotel is great Next to a metro station and walking distance from the shopping streets and il duomo Breakfast was large and good quality Staff was nice though not going the extra mile

407922,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, The flatscreen could be a little bigger The tram is a little loud when cornering , Breakfast was very good The room was clean and the service was also good And the location is 5 minutes walking to the dome 
407923,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, checkin on both weekends was poor the hotel had confirmed twin beds by email but not in their computer Long delays and mix ups including no room until 6 p m However a complimentary coffee was offered during the delay , roof top bar great breakfast buffet
407924,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Shower was between freezing and tepid for the 3 nights we stayed here despite complaints The air conditioning was also not adjustable Trams running day and night made it noisy, Excellent location to explore the centre of Milan
407925,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, it was so unpleasant to take a shower in the bath tab while standing because of two things the hose was short could fix properly to be for a 1 75 meter long which is average secondly the water was difficult to set it to be warm , The location and cleanness and the kind lady Mrs GERMANA of the front desk she was kind and helpful

407927,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Being an old hotel the shower is badly designed in the middle of the bath and water goes everywhere , Great location Good choice of breakfast Had good spacious room Liked the roof top bar although we couldn t use it on the first night because of a private function which I didn t think was good

407930,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Room right under rooftop restaurant Ask for a room which is not right under the rooftop restaurant We were on the 9th floor and had to ask for a move You could even hear chairs scraping across the floor when people were leaving their tables , Staff at Reception Luxurious furnishings Proximity to city centre 
407931,Hotel Dei Cavalieri, Even if it Sunday I don t think it is ok for a hotel to have a closed bar and room service I couldn t even get a cup of warm tea on Sunday afternoon o , Very kind staff at the reception nice waiters at the restaurant Beautiful view over the city from the Terrace of the hotel
