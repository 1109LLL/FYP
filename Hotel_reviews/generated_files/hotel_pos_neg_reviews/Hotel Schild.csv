384941,Hotel Schild, We thought breakfast was included in the price but it was not which was understandable because it was such a good price We also lost wifi on our floor for the night It was tough to find a casual place to eat dinner Other than that the room and bathroom were very nice and the room actually had a queen bed , The room and bathroom were fancy 
384942,Hotel Schild, No parking available as the hotel selection was made taking this into consideration However the hotel offered a parking place with a fee 15 Eur which was not previously announced Reservation was completed for one night via Booking com app Taking this into account I would say that the room rate was rather pricey 69 Eur night , Good service for the price clean room breakfast variety fresh ingredients 
384943,Hotel Schild, The pillows were very flat almost like you didn t have one and beds are very firm , The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was very nicely decorated and in a good location with restaurants within walking distance The parking garage was very safe and convenient and the breakfast was good Nice hot shower too 
384944,Hotel Schild, Weekday mornings the traffic is huge towards the city center Size of blanket approx 30 smaller than a regular blanket , Fine breakfast quiet nights nice good equiped rooms Roomy bath 
384945,Hotel Schild, Shower towel could have been a little larger but ok , Helpful staff at both reception and breakfast Ample breakfast Location close to a number of traditional restaurants Very clean good bathroom facilities spacious bed room Wi fi was fine BBC World one of the 15 channels
384946,Hotel Schild, Sound isolation in room is rather poor unfortunately children s playground was closed from of October till April and we have two small kids location is quite far from main destination points no private parking only on the free places on the street furniture room and the whole hotel in reality looks older than on the pictures ,No Positive
384947,Hotel Schild, for Vienna visitors who like to be close to all the action in the city center this hotel is about 20 minutes away from the city by public transport you will need a bus and train , Real nice hotel cozy and comfortable spacious rooms very clean and tidy nice breakfast home style cooked Staff are wonderful
384948,Hotel Schild,No Negative, The Hotel is located in an amazing part of Vienna close to wonderful restaurants and bars The breeze which blows all the day from the woods makes everything fresh and bright Rooms are clean and comfort Although that Hotel is a little far from City Center but public transport service is really easy and fast Staying there is a good opportunity to rest in calm and nice district and also be near to heart of the city 
384949,Hotel Schild, Breakfast was overpriced no waterboiler in room and no desk small table with bottle of wine on it what looks like a gift but actually costs you 20 euros if you open it , Location was great for going on a hike in the wine yards The room had a great view on the hills 4th floor and beautiful garden Great bathroom and good bath 
384950,Hotel Schild, I did not give it an excellent on cleanliness because we had a chair in the room that was filthy Otherwise the place was clean Wifi did not work in the room I thought we had a free breakfast but they charged as well as for parking , It was in the wine region and a short ride by bus into old town Staff was friendly and helpful 
384951,Hotel Schild, The minibar fridge was not working and hotel staff couldn t fix it and helped to facilitate the stuff at reception fridge , The garden and sitting connected to room back side was awesome and provided a soothing view 
384952,Hotel Schild, the only complaint it that travelling to the city takes an hour there are few English speaking taverns so knowing the language does help , The bed was extremely comfy a big king size not what you normally get for this price Breakfast was standard but perfectly good meats croissants fruit cereal and scrambled egg Nothing was too much trouble I ordered room service twice late at night with no complaints and excellent service 
384953,Hotel Schild, Free parking to find down the road in range of cca 100m , Near the centre of Wien with easy access for exploring Room with big comfortable bed armchair and working desk On backside a nice garden for staying outside Great breakfast and great sandwiches toast and salads Definitely recommended 
384954,Hotel Schild,No Negative, Great hotel very clean and comfy They gave us a room with door to the inner garden with children s playground because of our son Cozy nice calm 
384955,Hotel Schild, The shower is not protected by a cabin it has only a curtain The furniture in the rooms is a bit obsolete , The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood has an indoor car parking and the rooms are big 
384956,Hotel Schild, My wife had paid two months in advance for this hotel room and I was nearly refused entry because I produced a different Visa card upon arrival I was even threatened that they would call the police I had called the hotel when it was booked and wanted to be assured of a quiet room at the back yes they would do that Yet I had lucky room 13 facing the busy road The room was dirty with two large black hair in my bidet lucky for me the staff knew the person the hairs would have come from the cleaning lady That was the best evidence that the cleaning lady had actually been in that room Wifi did not work in my room and I had to sit in the reception area for that , I cannot remember her name but all credit to I think Veda who tried her very best to make my stay at Hotel Schild bearable 
384957,Hotel Schild,No Negative, The hotel was in an easily accessible location we found it very easily The hotel was nice and it had a cute garden It was very near to the forest area and we had a great time walking there 
384958,Hotel Schild, As mentioned by other travelers you get one small soap in the bathroom I usually bring my own stuff however this time I forgot so first night I had to shower with that thing used for washing hands No I won t pay for something that is supposed to be there in the 1st place Matress was not comfortable it had 2 holes from previous guests on right and left sides So if you tried to sleep on the middle you would slide one way or the other Pillow too small and soft for my taste Parking Be careful where you park in Vienna better ask the residents I got a ticket for 36 euros for parking in front of an appartment builing with no signs for forbidden parking or a parking meter Hotel is on a street with free parking however be carefull exactly where you leave it and at what time of day week I felt like reception staff was a bit pushy with selling their breakfast parking garagge Second night I got a phonecall in my room at 5 in the morning telling me that police is here and they wanna take my car because I wasn t parked correct wasn t blocking anything and again it was 5am I got downstairs in literally one minute and the guy said the police were gone because there was an accident I found that really odd And how did they knew it was my car I wasn t for sure the only guest from Romania staying , Large room bath tub quiet street Nice terrance on the 4th floor Staff was ok Beautiful part of Vienna with wineyards I accidentally got to see when the street was closed and I took a wrong turn It was my first visit to Vienna and even though the long feedback below I would probably stay at Schild again 
384959,Hotel Schild, it was written that parking is for free howerer we parked in front of the garage of the hotel not inside and were obligated to pay 15 euro for that We asked which parking is for free they replied on the street We came at nigh and were waiting for 20 minutes while night reception turned on lap top he even couldn t find our booking Moreover for 3 year old child they wanted full price for breakfast , pretty big room clean
384960,Hotel Schild, Sofa needs shampooing wifi was not connecting in the room had to go to lounge to get connections , Good view from the room staff were friendly bathroom clean and large
384961,Hotel Schild,No Negative, We stayed in the room on the top floor with view on the wine yards It s beautiful The street is full of nice restaurants Room itself is nice and clean We didn t go for breakfast because it s a lot of other cheaper opportunities around 
384962,Hotel Schild, the room is classified as non smoking room but unfortunately it was heavily smelling from cigarettes , The room was big the staff is very kind and breakfast is great
384963,Hotel Schild,No Negative, The hotel was clean spacious welcoming comfortable and in a beautiful location of vineyards and heurigen I stay here several times a year and am always happy 
384964,Hotel Schild, Unfortunately I booked a room only but I saw the buffet while leaving and I thought it was very rich with fresh vegetables and home made fruit salad next time I will book breakfast too , The room was very comfortable and clean Beautiful location very green and I also could get to the city center very fast by public transport 
384965,Hotel Schild, Room was very poorly maintained with paint falling off the bathroom door Some staff were just plain rude Pillows and bedding were tired and uncomfortable , Manager was very helpful and accommodating Hotel is 50m from a bus stop and an effortless journey into Vienna centre Local restaurants were very nice with lovely friendly people 
384966,Hotel Schild, That guys are terrible Stuff is really greedy and poor From the begining they insist me to take parking garage from me 15 Euro day I told if I will find place on the street I no need garage On the second day I found place on the street but they told me that it does not matter and I have to pay for second day becouse I reserved it They show me booking confirmation but it was confirmation that I see and agree with this price Whan I checked out that greedy person spend with me 30 min and insist that I should pay parking I promise him complaine to booking bank and his boss He is on the very lazy way print me out new invoice with 15 Euro less By the way all stuff in hotel 3 person only they staying on reception clean the rooms and prepare breakfast The smell in lobby is stinky the glases in the room was dirty The price is awufull Do not reserve with them guys never Maks, Nothing
384967,Hotel Schild, I did not the ants in our room I did not like that our door to the garden would not open I did not like that a bottle of wine in the kitchenette was previously opened and filled with water I did not like that there was an empty juice bottle in the bedside drawer or cigarette ashes all over the kitchen window sill I did not like that there was a roll of toilet paper in the kitchen for no apparent reason I did not like that the kitchenette was poorly equipped I did not like that the soap dispenser in the bath was completely empty I did not like that the fireplace was out of order I did not like that my friend s bed two rooms over had broken bed slats I did not like the iron worked poorly , One of the gentlemen at the front desk was extremely helpful and friendly The size of our apartment was wonderful 
384968,Hotel Schild, Please mark a minibar Same hotels make a Wine as a present so thats why its really confusing, I loved the view and everything was perfect In next trip will stay in this hotel
384969,Hotel Schild, The overall ambiance was a bit flat but adequate or as might be expected given the price point , The staff were pleasant and helpful in providing travel information and calling a taxi when needed 
384970,Hotel Schild, Breakfast with frozen vegetables and very old boiled eggs NOTHING FRESH AT ALL I m really sorry becouse I did not make any photos Come on guys we are in 2016 and you pretend to own a 4 hotel FOR SURE after each breakfast session they freeze every slice of ham cheese vegetables I never saw such a way the boiled eggs has a very strange colour and smell It was some mozarella on the tray and tomatoes with ice snow flakes on them Normally price is 15 EURO we had special offer and pay 9 Euros person Including a 5 years child In rest nothing to make you happy in the room Old dust in every corner it seems the clean lady make it in a different way Old TV and strange zzzound I will not reccomand this hotel especially the breakfast PEOPLE CAN GET SICK from that , acquarium in the lobby
384971,Hotel Schild, It s a bit far from the center but the Viennese public transportation alleviates the problem between about 5 am to 12 30 am Just mind the gap , The staff is really great They helped us with an unusual request when we were in a pinch and the room was great as in size It s a great place as in quality 
384972,Hotel Schild, Too expensive for its location and services Wifi did not reach our room , That was the only one hotel available for new year eve with price less then 400 euro per night
384973,Hotel Schild, Just one voucher for wi fi connection per room Incredibly mean but this seems to be issue all across Vienna either connection fee of 25EUR day or limited number of devices Still very strange for 21st century , Good location in the 19th district of Vienna nice vicinity with vineyards Very helpful staff rich breakfast 
384974,Hotel Schild, Disgusting smell everywhere Looks like they try to mask a smell from insect detergent or something similar The furniture is old and dirty , Spacious bathroom 
384975,Hotel Schild, Staff not overly friendly on check in wasn t given a wifi code and when trying to ring for it from the room the phone didn t work Location is okay in nice quiet area however not many restaurants nearby we found one about 400 metres down the road but that was it Hotel restaurant wasn t open for dinner on the night we arrived , Large bathroom with separate bath and shower Undercover secure parking

384979,Hotel Schild,No Negative, The room was very spacious the staff was friendly and the neighborhood was great It was about 30 40 minutes by public transit to the city center but it was nice to be able to get away from all the chaos and enjoy the scenery of the nearby vineyards 
384980,Hotel Schild, Room categories aren t explained too well On arrival at check in the reception need to explain how to access the WIFI and room location was provided with pin but not told Garage is not visible one need to obtain a room key and ask for direction while impossible to park in front of hotel due to busy road and no space for parking , the hotel is situated in nice area however on a way too busy road Breakfast was nice and substantial Room was good size even though I was required to pay extra 15Euro it was worth it
