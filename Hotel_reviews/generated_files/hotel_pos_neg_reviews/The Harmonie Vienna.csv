338766,The Harmonie Vienna, I feel deceived by the room description of the Classical double rooms on booking com which is These spacious and individually furnished rooms come with a minibar a TV and a private bathroom My room was cramped and I had to move sideways to get to the bathroom and to the desk And I challenge anyone to sit two people comfortable in the two chairs I had not booked if the description had been correct ,No Positive
338767,The Harmonie Vienna, I cannot find any fault in this hotel Fantastic , This is the best hotel in our 8 city tour of Europe and ranks as one of the best in my travels across 65 cities in the world The hotel is not in the centre of Vienna but is an oasis in Vienna after a hard days touring We used Uber rather than public transport and most fares were 3 4 even from the eastern side of Vienna The rooms are not huge but the facilities are impeccable and modern and the decor is ultra contemporary and pleasing The hotel has so many pluses that I will not be able to cover them all but to start with the rooms are superbly decorated and extremely comfortable There is air conditioning a well appointed en suite comfortable bed and large screen tv There is also a minibar and tea coffee making facilities I asked for western style pillows and the maid arrived within minutes with a selection of pillows The hotel offers a hot and cold buffet breakfast with staff taking orders for tea coffee or hot chocolate If you are around in the afternoon the hotel provides free refreshments and cake Check in is perfect and the lift is modern and quick A very pleasant stay

338769,The Harmonie Vienna, Breakfast was a bit chaotic with not enough tables so a lot of guests standing around waiting and getting in the way of staff and other guests There is only a small bar with limited drinks available we wanted a glass of red wine and whilst there was 5 different bottles on display we were told we could only have a glass of house red as they were not prepared to open the other bottles so why have them on the counter , Beautiful hotel in a quiet area yet with plenty of eateries close by and only a 20min walk to the centre of Vienna Complimentary tea and cakes in the afternoon We booked a standard room but it was better than some of the superior Best Western rooms we have stayed in The gentleman on reception was so welcoming and gave us tons of information about the area couldn t have been more helpful We loved our stay here and can t wait to return

338773,The Harmonie Vienna, While everything about the hotel is great the proximity to the city center is one detractor when it comes to tourism or city break The hotel is 6 7 minutes walking distance from a metro station 2 3 stations to the Museum Quartier related , The cleanliness staff service room bed confort breakfast facilities Everything was more than satisfactory Staff went an extra mile when asked about possibility to have lunch and although it was extra hours they opened just for us

338790,The Harmonie Vienna, 1 Unfortunately at the very end of our stay 20 march 17 00 we were upset about the behavior of two ladies of the staff we did not have any conversations with them before that day The problem was that in the morning we asked the reception to book a taxi for us Some days before that we got to know that the taxi ride from Wien centre to the airport has a flat rate 35 euro for all the taxies When the taxi arrived my husband asked the taxi driver if it was a flat rate for the ride to the airport The taxi driver said no and they began disputing about that After a while they went to the reception and my husband asked the ladies about the flat rate They were very rude with him The answer was something like We are not taxi drivers we don t know anything ect Well honestly 2 taxi drivers told us about this flat rate just 2 days before that and also 2 couples of our group went to the airport before us paying 35 euro each Even if the ladies of the reception did not know about the existence of this special rate or if it does not exist they just could be polite with their clients It s a pity because all the other staff of reception and other areas were extremely friendly and always willing to help 2 It was a bit too hot in our room 504 , I liked that it is a new beautiful and very clean hotel The rooms were very quiet and the beds very comfortable Very good breakfast Very nice area a lot of nice shops and restaurants around We stayed there in a group of 8 people age from 4 to 73 years 4 rooms Everybody was very happy about the hotel we all travel a lot and normally book 4 stars hotels We all felt like at home Almost all the staff was very helpful and friendly 
338791,The Harmonie Vienna, Nothing, The breakfast spread was elaborate We are teachers and were travelling with nine students who also felt that this was a great place to stay The reception organised a birthday celebration for one of the students at short notice too 
338792,The Harmonie Vienna, TV quite limited in choice and no pay per view Gym was minuscule although there was a warning of renovation work The bad note I planned to eat in the hotel after a long work meeting at 9 p m they told me they had no place in the restaurant since there was only 1 waitress 4 people total in the restaurant did not seem that busy and that they would not do room service because of that Ok I understand you are in troubles but all they did for me was telling to order something online I mean you got to be kidding me is this a 4 star or what If you have problems you should try to minimize the impact on guests rather than basically letting them on their own I don t think I will choose this hotel again , Position Breakfast although I would have expected a real cappuccino not a coffee machine Room was nice and clean albeit a bit small
338793,The Harmonie Vienna,No Negative, The hotel is for sure a 4 star hotel I could say that it offers services as a 5 star hotel The staff is polite and very helpful One of the best hotels I have stayed in Europe city hotels

338796,The Harmonie Vienna, Rooms with baths have twin beds, Staff were excellent Very clean Good location Excellent breakfast for the rates charged by the hotel given the city centre location 
338797,The Harmonie Vienna, It may not suit everyone that the hotel is a 20 minute walk from the centre on a rather dull side street but it was fine for us and there s a tram stop 5 minutes away and a shopping street at the end of the road Our only issue was the position of the bath tap which makes it difficult to get in and out of the bath Very trivial , The reception and breakfast staff were warm welcoming chatty and always helpful fantastic The free tea and cake in the lounge each afternoon was wonderful to return to after a day s sightseeing We tried many of the restaurants mostly informal around the hotel recommended by staff and enjoyed all of them We were lucky enough to get a suite over the Christmas period for about 130 at the current exchange rate so can t comment on normal room sizes we had a bargain
