353945,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, The hotel is VERY well located within a 10 minute walk from the train from the airport and within walking distance of most major tourist attractions in Vienna The accomodations were excellent the breakfasts great with eggs prepared to order and much more and the staff very helpful especially Marcus who was at the desk A Great place to stay 
353946,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Elevator service for executive rooms is a nice idea but I really would prefer using the same elevator as other guests because it seemed that it was working better and faster Breakfast price could be a little lower then we would considered taking it Otherwise you could find plenty of places around to have breakfast for 18 EUR, It was my first time that I booked the executive room in this hotel chain and it was really worth it Everything from hotel location to wifi connection was perfect Staff was extremely pleasant and helpful Will consider staying there another night next time
353947,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Rooms are very old and needs renovations and it smelled like urine The room was very hot and the AC is very old and barely working I asked the respsionist several times to change the room but they said no The executive lounge is the worst lounge I ve been to in any hotel almost no food coffee machine always not working and very rude lounge staff no kettle inside the comfort room If you want to iron your clothes you have to go to the ironing room in the 5th floor, Perfect Location and room view 
353948,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, BREAKFAST it s terrible always lack of evething drinks sweets snacks service is terrible too waiters are very slow they don t clean tables after guests so you can see lot s of tables with dirty plates when you are looking for a new one to have breakfast The staff in absolutely disorganized and need to have a good manager So I can say that in general my mark to the hotel is 3 from 5 It s a good 3 star hotel but not 4 , We stayed in executive rooms with excess to executive longe The room was big and nice but the lounge is absolutely useless always poor snacks and unnesessary drinks that you can have in your room Don t overpay for the stay The hotel itself is OK with perfect location close to everything 
353949,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I wasn t too impressed with the breakfast bar There were no plates for the hot section missing items weren t filled up very quickly and the sections were not organised in a natural flow so customers easily walked in each other s way in a rather narrow aisle , The room was very nice and I was impressed with the fact that a 3 star hotel has staff to bring your suitcase to the room 
353950,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Though we had a non smoking room but the smell of the cigarette smokes enter the room The bathroom has no privacy no locker nor ventilation , Magnificent location and clean hotel The breakfast buffet is awesome 
353951,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, None, Super comfy hotel in the real heart of Vienna whether you re looking for history culture entertainment or shopping everything is just footsteps away Our Comfort Room was very large and quiet with a nice view to Neuer Markt Breakfast had a selection of various choices and was a perfect start for each day Overall good service and a very pleasant stay in Austria Trend Hotel Europa 
353952,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, It was a bit clumsy getting to the executive floors with a flight of stairs to the elevator which was rather slow and very hot We had asked for a room with a tub which the desk clerk acknowledged but the room did not have one , Breakfast buffet was very complete with omelettes made to order Location was great for exploring the central city and pedestrian shopping area The room was good sized and comfortable 
353953,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Breakfast is pretty basic and no complimentary tea coffee in the room, Great location Rooms are much bigger than other similar hotels Staff are really nice and friendly 
353954,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Bed hard against one wall Access awkward but probably enough space to set up room differently , Easy to reach using public transport and right in the heart of Vienna Walking distance to Stefansplatz and in the midst of activity and entertainment day and night Our room looked out on the fountain and the space around it A delightful European setting 
353955,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Nothing It was just perfect , Breakfast Staff and location was awesome The staff was just too keen on making sure we enjoyed our stay and I would surely book this hotel again while in Vienna

353959,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, We asked for a room with a bathtub the clerk at check in mentioned that we had asked for one but when we got to the room it did not have a bathtub The half flight of stairs necessary to access the very slow and hot elevator to the top floor was a bit annoying But otherwise it was a great place to stay , The executive room on the top floor was quite comfortable after we figured out how to work the A C The buffet breakfast was excellent with omelettes made to order and a nice assortment of choices The hotel is situated in a great location next to the pedestrian shopping area leading to the Stephansdom and near the Hofburg and museums We made little use of the executive lounge but it was convenient

353964,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, There were 3 A C units in the room but it seemed as though only 1 was working and it was not very effective The room was bearable temperature wise but not as cool as we would have liked , Perfect location Arrived in Vienna via train and then easily transferred to the public transit system From the Stephansplatz station it was an easy 5 minute walk down a pedestrian street to the hotel We had a great home base to easily get all over the city on our 3 days there Kids were on a pull out sofa in a separate area of the room not entirely closed off but it felt like 2 rooms The included hotel breakfast was fantastic Huge selection and the food was delicious 
353965,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The breakfast is expensive so we didn t take , It is located at the center of the city that you can walk to all the interesting spots There are supermarkets cafes and restaurants around the hotel 
353966,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The bathroom was very tiny and uncomfortable Poor location of towel hinges and absolutely no room to turn around , We like the room size we probably got an upgraded room and the views from the room

353973,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, It was really hot in the west facing room around 90F We had deliberately reserved a place with AC since there was a mini May heat wave We complained and a man with a wrench came up and fiddled for a few minutes It didn t do much good to cool down the room The cooler ran all night but it never dropped below 74F It got very cold 50F the next day so it wasn t a big deal For the price I would expect AC that works efficiently , The breakfast was good and the cafe staff were fantastic

353975,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The room is very worn and shows signs of heavy use The cleanliness was on the low side as well especially the floor walls and the bathroom The windows do not provide ample protection from the noise coming from the pedestrian street which is right below so the whole day it is very loud The bed is something usually found in 1 2 star hotels standard uncomfortable plank which provides almost no comfort at all The air conditioner is old inefficient and loud at whatever setting The staff was also not particularly friendly and helpful Overall not worth the money , The location is perfect however that s the only plus

353980,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, didn t like double bed pushed against one wall meant you didnt have side table or light for reading and had to climb out and down bed made it feel very squashed in, we liked the location the room was a bit small ut still comfortable the staff were very helpful and would recommend it
353981,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Our windows were facing windows from the office buildings directly across so privacy was compromised a bit during office hours , Excellent central location Walking distance to sights shops restaurants public transport Breakfast was excellent and staff were helpful 
353982,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I was asked to wait for the valet after close to half and hour I was informed the staff can take care of this issue which should have been done in the first place in my opinion Also the bed was too soft but that is a matter of personal preference All in all I enjoyed my stay here , This is the second time I ve stayed here The location is excellent The hotel is clean and modern The breakfast is great Opposite the hotel is an excellent pastry shop cafe called Ober Laa highly recommended 
353983,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The breakfast was excellent and the bar by the reseption was a meeting point in the evening but we was missing some evening nightservice for a light meal even it is a street kitchen just around the corner , Location Location Location The main square few steps away connected by the walking street And the rooms was perfect even the bed But most of all we have to give the staff 10 points My favorite lady in the reception is the most friendly and serviceminded we met travelling all over the world Thank you hope to visit this hotel again We was 9 persons in my family everybody satisfied Great

353987,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, On the 4th floor but still lots of loud road and construction noise early in the morning every day Several levels of stairs to negotiate to get to the lift and out of 60 or so tv Chanel s only one CNN in English Go figure , Outstanding location in the main CBD of the city Bus tram train and taxi all in close proximity Walked and used the hop on hop off bus for several days Offered a room upgrade for only 10 euro extra so ended up with a sizable room and b room Good wifi through out and a fabulous breakfast each day 
353988,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The room used to have alot of dust everyday maybe its the parquet flooring but would feel not clean enough , The room was very comfortable staff was always helpful and with a smile even prior to arrival by e mail The location is just super Bed is also very comfortable Would stay again 
353989,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, It is definitely not a quiet area If you keep your windows open it might be kind of noisy even at 3 AM Pillows definitely can use some upgrade You can have nice croissant and coffee or fresh juice at the nearby cafes for just 4 5 so 17 breakfast at the hotel does not make much sense , Very convenient location Bathroom towels are of a very good quality 
353990,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Lobby It would be good having a nice place where coffe and snacks can be served while waiting for the room and possibility for socializing with other people travelers , I didn t have breakfast 
353991,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Room was a bit small and not sound proof It will be difficult for people that do not have easy sleep since you could hear almost everything from the main pedestrian street up until the 4am More over i have requested a late check out 18 00 from booking com since my flight was at 22 00 They emailed me immediately saying that my request would be based upon availability of the room the last day it was Sunday and the hotel was not so crowed On Sunday they said that they could give me one of the two rooms i had booked up until 14 00 If i chose to stay more i would have paid around 60 euro not so professional i guess , The location of the hotel was excellent In the main shopping street only few minutes away from the main attractions of the city Very close to metro station for visiting attractions far from the city center Very helpful staff at the reception and very willing to help with the main city attractions and restaurants 
353992,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I can t say that there was anything that I did not like , The location was ideal the purpose of my visit was to shop and this hotel is right in the middle of the shopping district In addition I loved that you could open the window and that it was so quiet at night even though my room faced Neuermarkt Platz where cars came through Friendly staff great breakfast good room are just a few things that were appreciated I will come back to this hotel next time

353995,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Bed is so stiff and uncomfortable The elevator in this Hotel is so weird Couple of steps to reach the elevator with no ramp for wheelchairs or strollers Even though i booked a Superior Executive Room and requested a room with big windows I got a room with small window and the staff at the reception was trying to sell me a room for extra price to get a bigger window The quality and taste of food for breakfast isn t that great , Location is the best thing about this Hotel Right in the middle of the center Metro just around the corner and few minutes to other transportation means Bus Hop on Hop off Bus Horse and Carriage Right next to Stephanplatz square and 3 minutes to the Opera Many shopping stores and restaurants facing the Hotel The free mini bar and access to the executive lounge for the executive rooms were a good extra The staff in the breakfast room are very friendly and helpful

354004,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Only 1 channel in English CNN which was very frustrating and made the evening difficult Also no toaster in the breakfast room which was very strange and made having a slice of toast impossible , Great location and spacious room when the deluxe is chosen If you have the option the upgrade to allow access to the lounge is very helpful as allows a pop in point during the day for drinks and snacks

354022,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Please do not consider it as Did not like but just heads up if you are going to book room there there are couple of stairs from entrance to elevator That was not an issue for us to carry stroller and staff was ready to help but I suggest to check in advance if you have stroller or wheelchair how to get to elevators standard classic room has no free tea or coffee which usually you will find in 4 star hotels , Location is great we had a really nice view from room Staff was able to change our booking dates without any additional charges we had to leave 1 day earlier unfortunately It was a really great experience Price for breakfast is not expensive even if it looks like it Vienna center is really expensive area We had no breakfast in hotel though

354030,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The room was basic and the decor minimalist The breakfast served was the same hot food for 4 days The last day we went across the hotel for breakfast because we were tired of the same fare , The breakfast offered organic teas and coffees The ingredients for the baked food was sourced locally Staff was eager to help The main advantage to this hotel is the location which is excellent 
354031,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I paid 34 euros for valet parking per night and then found that my gas tank had been siphoned The desk people suggested I pay an emergency service for fuel 150 euros I told them that this problem was their concern but no one was willing to do anything I did receive excellent directions to the closest service station but left with concerns When you pay nearly 50 CAD per day for parking their response was inadequate I did make it to the service station and found I had 4 L in reserve Not a happy customer ,No Positive
354032,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, A lot of street noise especially from the K rntnerstrasse side of the hotel Breakfast is OK but buffet is not being refilled and tables cleared as guest come and go , Location could not be better Nice rooms although they seem well used Good service at reception

354035,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The bath was very small and I mean small would have been nice to have a soak after all the walking rather than a shower , The loaction of this hotel was ideal right in the centre enabling us to walk to all the attractions 
354036,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Plain cotton sheet without waffle detail would be smoother and more comfy The sofa bed was very very hard perhaps a mattress topper could be out on this when sofa bed is in use Breakfast staff a little slow and reluctant sometimes , Location is perfect 80 of the staff were very helpful and friendly at reception and in bar and cleaning rooms Breakfast was delicious Family room was a good set up just very noisy on Karntnerstrasse 
354037,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Coffee and tea making facilities in the room would have been a huge plus , Location was the draw for this hotel and we weren t disappointed perfectly located for so many sights museums galleries restaurants and walkable to the Prater even in November Check in so easy and all staff friendly and helpful I don t do breakfast but my wife said it was extremely good 
354038,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Security at the lobby may not be as good My companion s backpack was stolen despite being near it while engaged in a conversation , Very central location 
354039,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Could have used a tea kettle in the room and didn t quite enjoy the twin beds pushed together as a double , At a very good location without being too busy The staff was very nice and even upgraded our room It was a a good location for sightseeing but maybe a little far from the train station but still not too bad The room was comfortable but not a fan of the two twin bed to make a double bed 
354040,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Elevators need maintenance and it doesn t work without room card, Super location spacious room helpful staff Fast check in and out clean Hotel and always busy so my advice plan ahead and book early

354042,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The breakfast room is way too small for such a large hotel Also the staff was far too little in the busiest hours of the morning No plates no cups no food tables full of dirty dishes etc , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful The cleaners were all really friendly and did their job with a smile Executive lounge was really nice we use it every day

354047,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, The room was comfortable and clean I appreciated the environmental messages and hygenic products Staff were helpful in finding places to eat nearby 
354048,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Could have had better blackout curtains that went all the way across to block out the all night lights from the shopping street stores but I managed by using an eye guard, Great gluten free bread on request Warm delicious Great range of choice Fabulous location very central Quiet rooms Very clean Very friendly helpful staff
354049,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Costly breakfast A continental breakfast would be nice to have included in the room cost , Very comfortable bed Good location right at city center Chose not to do breakfast due to what I considered to be costly 
354050,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Executive lounge could be stocked better Decor in room not as luxurious as many other hotels BUT would stay here again, Ideal location staff very helpful All recommendations for restaurants absolutely delicious One of the lady at reception Definitely stay here again 
354051,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The mattress on the bed needs replacing it has a dip in it head side which is bad for the back The room aircon is behind the curtains so to benefit you need to sleep with curtains open Not practical The fridge does not get cold enough , Excellent location Close to underground and within walking distance to central Vienna attractions
354052,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Room was too cramped Double bed pushed against the wall due to tiny space making it hard to get in and out Room was simply too small even for a couple , Staff was extremely courteous and professional Location was excellent 
354053,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Not much to complain about the room was basic but in Vienna there is so much to do why bother for a swanky room You re never going to be in it , Best location EVER Wow We were so impressed I will definitely be back here 
354054,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, More space around Reception there is a bar area with space but it is not ideal if you don t want to purchase from the bar , Location is second to none and staff have a friendly approach at all times No hesitation in recommending 
354055,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Very difficult to find a parking place There is a public parking near by but is expensive about 34 EUR day , Everything was great The location is very central and only few min walking to major turist attractions 
354056,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Nothing was bad just remarks The breakfast costed 17 Euros per person quite expensive for people eating small amounts if you prefare small breakfast it perhaps would be better to go somewhere to the city The aircondition works well if you settle it NOT on the lowest temperature , Good localization great view from the upper rooms Nice rooms good choice for short staying in Vienna 
354057,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, We were due to check in at 3 but we could only check in an hour later We were given a room with a faulty door handle which prevented us from going in and out of our room without someone from their cleaning staff to come and unlock it for us When we pointed this out we were not given a different room but simply had to deal with this We asked for a quiet family suite and were given a smoking room which smelled of smoke and stale carpet We booked for a family of 4 and it was not until we requested for our sofa bed to be made that it was done despite checking us in late The sofa bed was not comfy at all It had a huge gap and our poor backs are still struggling to recover When we tried to close the curtains at night the curtains fell right off the rails The only positive is that we only stayed one night , We liked the location of the hotel and the fact it had double Windows which blocked out the noise from outside The cleansing staff that came to assist us to unlock the door were very friendly 
354058,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, Excellent location but very very hard to find as the address given is not for the street where the doors open onto You must walk behind to find the entry Very strange Great staff overlooking the main street so easy shopping Supermarket at the end of the street turn right out of the entry doors walk in the middle of the road and straight into supermarket which serves breakfast Atm machines everywhere Hop on bus the best option as a large distance to walk to all attractions we didn t take and missed some sights guess we will have to return hehe Great truffles Shop carefully wrapped them for us and we posted them home with fantastic help from the Post Shop about 5 min walk from hotel they arrived in New Zealand in 5 days in excellent condition We classed them as a letter even though they were in a Post cardboard box as the weight of the box was still in the letter class 
354059,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Old furniture bad smell staff were not friendly didn t feel safe you also need to take the stairs to get to your room a used room was given to us at the beginning used towels and coffee mugs were used which shows that there is no supervision at the hotel itself , Perfect location for shopping 
354060,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Pillows seemed a little old They were not that comfortable , The location was great It s in the center and the street is full of shopping centers There s a grocery shop near too We were lucky to get a room with a balcony which you could just see the fountain from Breakfast was good too Staff were polite and helpful
354061,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The executive lounge wasn t always clean and nearly all the time without any snacks So save your money in something that worths , The room was spacious more than any room I stayed before It was clean neat bright Great location in the middle of everything The staff at the reception was helpful welcoming all the time Thanks for the lovely stay Sure will stay here in our next visit to Vienna 
354062,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, Excellent location Right in the center of everything and walking distance or a very short train ride to anywhere we wanted to go The hotel staff was extremely accomadating for late check in directions and maps and even printing off train tickets 
354063,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Small stain at foot of bed and carpet Looked like spilled red wine , Location was excellent only 5 minutes walk from Stephensdom Breakfast was wonderful So many different choices 
354064,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Nothing to dislike, Very friendly staff all speak English so it s easy to communicate for non German speaking The location is excellent in the middle of town everything is within walking distance even for small children 
354065,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Can t say anything other than Great place, Comfortable Cleanliness the best location well trained and helpful Staff at reception and value for the money
354066,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Strongly recommend against using their parking valet service We had some unpleasant experiences with it , The location was excellent and the overall value was good 
354067,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, we got a free upgrade as we stayed with a toddler excellent breakfast including pre mixing your cereals with yoghurt location is just great nespresso coffee machine with decaf capsules
354068,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Worst place I ve ever stayed Tiny room no air conditioning and because you are in the middle of the town it is extremely noisy at all hours of the day so you won t sleep because you will either be too hot or too loud Staff weren t friendly or interested in their guests Bed was small The shower sprayed water all over the bathroom and there weren t enough towels provided to accommodate more than one person showering and creating a daily flood , The location was ideal for visiting attractions in central Vienna 
354069,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Avoid leaving your car at the hotel for parking They brought it back with several scratches and the parking staff denied that they made them even though we compared the before and after pictures and they were clearly not there the first time , The hotel has a great location and is clean Staff is very friendly I wouldn t classify it as a 4 star hotel though Air conditioning is really old and shaky and there is no air evacuation in the bathroom or at least it wasn t working 
354070,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, All was great although a little pricey for a night , Great sized room very large for Vienna and perfect for a family in the family suite Comfy beds great breakfast spread fast wifi and a winning location This is our second stay and we would stay again Get a higher floor for a quiet room 
354071,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Air condition is poor , The location war great next to main attractions located on the kartnerstabe street shops metro station within walking distance Staff is friendly helpful
354072,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, My suggestion would be for the hotel to consider in the future the replacement of the curtains with more black out curtains I have my doubts about the taxi service the reception called for me to go to the airport The driver charged me 43 in stead of the 34 fixed rate the reception desk mentioned , Very helpful and friendly staff The hotel gave me an upgrade and allowed me a late check out due to my departure time at the airport The room is silent and nicely decorated 
354073,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The room should provide for coffee tea making facilities i e a kettle for clients to use during the day , Excellent location for sightseeing shopping and transport very nice environment in the hotel quite comfortable room 
354074,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Breakfast choice could be a little wider for the cost Also replenishment and clearing tables a little slow , Location couldn t be better Staff were very friendly and helpful 
354075,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Bathromm small especially considering the size of the bedroom A shower would have been more convenient that a bathtub Breakfast quite expensive , Very well positioned in the center of the city Spatious room Fresh in spite of the hot weather 
354076,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The pillows could have been better The Airco had to work very hard to keep the heat 32 degrees out Other than that all good Location is unbeatable and the staff very professional and kind ,No Positive
354077,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Does not have a good lobby or terrace to hang around comfortably lack of gym or spa , excelent location good design great staff in the heart of Vienna and K rntnerstrasse very comfortable and modern
354078,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, In family room bath and WC was separate , Perfect family room good size perfect location exactly in the centre of happening street and everything is very near by Just sit at the window and enjoy all big shopping supermarkets are near in 2 min For location it s 100 perfect place for us 
354079,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Indeed a coffee tea facility in the room would be nice Not a problem though , I had the classic room it was more than ok compared to what I was expecting Bed was comfortable I didn t have breakfast but I know from my previous stays that it s amazing 
354080,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, VERY BAD HOTEL BY ALL MEANS VERY SMALL ROOM UNCOMFORTABLE BEDS NOISY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN THE STREET NOT SOUNDPROOF, ONLY LOCATION NOTHING MORE
354081,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, There were no sleepers in the room I think that sleepers are necessary in a hotel like this , The location is great one couldn t imagine better The breakfast is of a very good quality The beds are very soft and comfortable And the linens are nice The room and a bathroom is very clean Check in and check out is very quick Good value for money 
354082,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The reception staff was not too helpful and none of them smile at all The way to the lift has six or seven stairs and we had luggage which had to be lifted to reach the lift and also during check out , The breakfast was good and the room was quite big and the room had a terrace The best thing about the hotel is location 
354083,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, As other hotels in Europe small room No slippers in room no free water , Location is perfect just walk behind the hotel and you are going to be in Stephansplates area Breakfast was great and various Helpful and lovely stuff 
354084,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The TV coming on automatically when you enter the room was a bit annoying , The room was comfortable and the rain shower option was excellent The chef at breakfast was a highlight Having a freshly cooked omelette was a nice surprise not to mention her welcoming smile 
354085,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I like to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room, Breakfast is great The rooms are comfy Bathroom lovely It s location to Vienna Statopera and the shopping area is a huge plus 
354086,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Smack right in the middle of the shopping strip you could hear noise from the street till late at night Also the room was advertised as air conditioned but it was not It was a little stuffy in the room on some nights , The location could not be any more convenient with the metro station just 2 mins away and many amazing attractions shopping street and restaurants within walking distance I arrived at the hotel before the check in time but was allowed to check in early It is really rare I have to say but was highly appreciated 
354087,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, In room 1609 had to complain about the volume of the television in the next door room Why on earth they build tv in to the wall with it back to back with the next room is crazy , Easy access to Vienna sites good breakfast
354088,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The only thing was a problem was the existence of 3 5 stairs with no lift that was a bit of a problem because we have a child who still sits on a stroller , We very much enjoyed our stay and our room was perfect Best location in the center of everything yet no noise what soever Breakfast was perfect and offered a variety of tastes Staff were amazingly nice and helpful To conclude great price great location great hotel Recommended 
354089,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, shabby room dirty carpet no coffee maker no complementary tea or coffee in the room only 1 TV channel in English the others are German no bath accessories in bathroom only shower gel and liquid soap breakfast is not included Looks like good 3 star hotel , location good WI FI

354091,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, For a 4 star hotel one would expect some more room facilities such as instant coffe and tea making small water boiler and a few teabags and nescafes , The room was very spacey clean location superb The reception staff was very good given that they were trainees 
354092,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The only possible downside is the fact that garage is not in the hotel if you frequently need the car , Fantastic attentative and helpfule staff excellent breakfast room size location 
354093,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I would have liked an english speaking television channel perhaps BBC , The room was quiet and with enough space for relaxing as well as work I got my room before the expected time which was good because I was a bit tired after the journey from home and needed to freshen up 
354094,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Breakfast is expensive, Very helpfull staff have been in the hotel several times during last 10 years and service and cleaninless is always the same hotel at central pedestrian street at Vienna two minutes from metro
354095,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, rooms are not sound proof could hear people on floor above and next door, location was good close to train station and in heart of main shopping area and close to all major sights Comfortable nice size room

354100,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The breakfast variety is good but it is expensive We tried it once and decided to eat outside during the rest of our vacation The bed was too soft , We stayed during a snowy January The room was warm and nice The hotel is clean The staff were very kind and helpful The location is great a few minutes walk from all attractions and subway 3 minutes to St Stephen s Cathedral 5 minutes to Hofburg Palace 4 minutes to Wiener Staatsoper We would definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit Vienna 
354101,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The furniture are old and almost destroyed from the time old dusty carpets noise from the heating dust everywhere in the room Just not a 4 hotel, Location breakfast reception staff very helpful
354102,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Waiting too long at the bar to be served the barman was counting his money and talking with his colleague instead of taking our order No small shampoo soap pieces only generic liquid soap for a hotel of this class this is a little cheap , Very central location in Vienna Nice breakfast with all hot and cold dishes Clean rooms not too noisy despite the fact we were there for New Year s Eve

354108,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, rooms a bit small especially the bathroom when showering some of the water spill over into the bathroom floor they all now have those walk in showers kind of ok but always wet outside , Very friendly and helpful staff gave some good tipps for parking Location was awesome just a 5 min walk to the Stephansdom downtown Enough space for 2 suitcases to put down and open Didn t have breakfast so can t tell about that You have your own heating in the room can adjust it for your likeing 
354109,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, If you need a shampoo barh gel or anything alse you have to ask Bathroom is too small A little noisy , The location is great The bad is comfortuble 
354110,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Too expensive breakfast not worth the money The smell of smoke in the room and the stairs was not very nice , Really in the middle of the city on the shopping street Nice hotel bar 
354111,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Dissapointed with the conseirge They repeatedly asked me to come back a in 5 minutes few times I did he was busy then on break then he went off duty I just wanted a few tickets didn t get any help I was really disappointed I will not go back I will pay money for better service I felt unimportand Being kind spirited I did not complain to make a fuss until now since you asked , Great location clean 
354112,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, Only that there wasn t someone to help us with the luggage up the stairs to the lift , Room was very clean and the staff were very welcoming and helpful Also the hotel is right next to the central shops and square making it very easy to explore the city and not get lost

354114,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, cable channels in German except CNN bed cover child size no coffee in room coffee cup size appropriate for children no drawers just shelves breakfast always the same assortment of cheeses limited minibar limited and is not refilled A C is not user friendly, excellent customer service
354115,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, I have no idea how this hotel got a 4 star rating It s more like 2 5 The hose of the shower head was severely leaking which made it difficult to shower it was difficult getting out of the bath because of how high it is in comparison to the floor faulty wiring at the bedside lamp mysterious stains on the chairs water stains on the walls and 70 s decor Basic amenities were missing such as body lotion or a kettle with instant coffee and tea bags We rang the reception and asked for a kettle they said that they would look for one When we got it we were not given any tea or coffee to actually mix with the boiling water Overpriced , The excellent location 
354116,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien,No Negative, I simply liked everything A fantastic place with very nice and helpful staff The location is amazing a few meters from Vienna Opera House city attractions and nice restaurants The breakfast is one of the best I ve ever had I will surely be back at this Hotel again

354120,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, It d have been great to have sleepers gowns were provided bathroom accessories were refreshed after the special request , Perfect location metro station two min from the hotel all the main attractions are within 5 10 min walking distance Careful and hospitable staff all the requests were quickly and easily solved Nice benefits for executive rooms lounge water in minibar Nespresso coffee throughout the day Quiet and clean room nice view to the New Market square Very comfortable stay 
354121,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The room was cramped and could have been designed better the shower had little water pressure and flooded the floor every time it was used, Great central location and good breakfast
354122,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, The hotel looked dated Everything you needed but it lacked design and joy Perhaps mostly geared to business travelers The bathroom was perhaps the worst part Anyone older would have a real issue getting in and out of the tub the bed was not really comfy and there was no curtain or real door for the shower and the water went everywhere , The WiFi was excellent No need for password and it didn t time out like in other hotels The location was great Close to everything 
354123,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, No room service Separated beds bed sheets Size of the room is too small No kitchen in the hotel which was shocking for us , Location is the only advantage you can get Also free WIFI can be considered as an advantage

354129,Austria Trend Hotel Europa Wien, We arrived and apparently our booking was cancelled but that wasn t true I called booking and it was still active we hassled them and all went well at the end but after we were pissed off There was one lady on the front desk who is training don t bother asking her for information The idea of using a card for the elevator is tricky if u forget the card in your room or if it s deactivated you are trapped , The location was perfect if you don t care for luxury and you re more practical then this is a very good place to stay Ask Stephan at the reception for information places to eat recommendations etc
