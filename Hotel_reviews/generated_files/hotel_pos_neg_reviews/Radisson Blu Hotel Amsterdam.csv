437802,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, We received a beautiful room based on my special requests for quiet and distance from the elevator The staff were incredible and early check in was such a fantastic bonus Clean and Wonderful hotel 100 going back for another relaxing and peaceful stay 
437803,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Stairs at the doorway in the room which requires a tough baggage lift on check in and check out , Excellent location Spacious room for 3 adults Breakfast with good quality and variety 
437804,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Would have been better with higher shower pressure in the room A few restaurant staffs seems not to be happy to serve at breakfast perhaps she had a bad day before her shifts though , Excellent location Curtural landmarks and attractions within walking distances Fresh breakfast with good quality Friendly hotel staffs Prompt and sincere response to requests Good amenities in the room Spacious room for 3 adults
437805,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The bathroom was not cleaned up before our arrival the shower was dirty with hair on the floor Moreover we requested a late check out and the staff confirmed it till 2pm but the cleaning woman came to knock at our door at 11 50am Not professional at all not acceptable from a 4 stars hotel ,No Positive
437806,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I sure wish that I had known the Radisson Airport IS ALSO CALLED RADISSON BLU Everything I saw only showed Radisson Airport and then Radisson Blu was the downtown hotel Well we were told to take the free airport shuttle to get to the Radisson Blu hotel We waited nearly 45 minutes after an exhausting flight took it and when we got off I knew immediately were in the wrong place Of course the two hotels don t coordinate when this happens and apparently it happens often so we then had to pay a 75 Euro taxi ride to get to our hotel Ridiculous Our first few hours in Amsterdam was a mess because of this It should be made obvious that both hotels are called Radisson BLU , Although not in the central part of the city it is really close and easy to walk to most anything Wish the hotel worked with customers a bit more about transportation telling about the bus system and such Overall the hotel was very good affordable and clean and comfortable For a very high price you can get a wonderful breakfast 
437807,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast after 2 days is boring and not friendly Your coffee and tea is bad which is surprising considering the ample offer in Holland Your food choices are not enough for getting value for the money charged We stay for 5 days and the bed clothing was never changed After 3 days you stopped putting shower gel and other needed items , Location is good 
437808,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Staff at the hotel are so welcoming and couldn t do enough to make our stay as enjoyable as possible Would definitely stay here again A big big thankyou to Marjo on reception From arriving to leaving Marjo made sure we had a great stay Thankyou Marjo and all the other staff at Radisson for a great weekend We will see you again next year
437809,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like that breakfast was so expensive we ended up not getting it I stayed at the hotel before so I knew how good it was but we couldn t justify paying another 180 for 3 days breakfast for the two of us having already spent 688 on the room , The bed was my favourite part about my stay It was super comfy and I haven t had such restful sleep in months My partner really appreciated it too he had a broken hand so the comfort helped him deal with the pain and enjoy his holiday more I also loved the building itself the lobby is beautiful We had a room with a little balcony facing inside to the lobby and it was actually nearly nicer than if we had one facing outside The atrium is spectacular 
437810,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We booked a Business Class twin bedded room My husband can sleep anywhere but I can t The Bed was as hard as a board Feather pillows too soft and didn t sleep a wink Hotel provided 2 man made pillows the following night they were enormous and rock solid Duvet far too narrow Couldn t sleep with them either the beds in the next hotel on our trip were perfect good size firm but soft too wonderful pillows and large duvet It was just a standard room , Location
437811,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Had some scaffolding renovations outside our room but I understand these things need to be addressed taken care of it did not impact our room or stay in anyway , EVERYTHING OMGoodness the staff front desk restaurants bar ALL super friendly helpful knowledgeable to help 8 Americans staying there to see the most of Amsterdam Our Junior Suite was amazing for our 3 night stay prior to our cruise Meals in the restaurant were superb breakfast dinner The bar was equally as good Fitness Centre was good As a Travel Agent I would MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam to all of my clients and others as well 
437812,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel is square and windows were facing inside which is fine but you have to go all around the square of the corridor to reach your room which was in begining confusing This is just a minor remark you will see its nice place nevetheless , Very comfertable room and even though it was 3 of us on of the beds was roll up couch and the hotel provided extra cover cutions to help with that Nice The breakfast was amasing and very well organised 
437813,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing I can mention in here is the parking fee which was pretty high 55 euros a day but we were aware of that from the begging and still decided to stay here , The hotel in the heart of the city minutes away from all the main attraction points of the city It is located a couple of minutes away from the Red Light District The hotel comes with an enclosed parking lot that is extremely secured The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful We even had a small issue with our credit card payment and the receptionist in charge was super patient and professional and helped us solved the situation The interior of the hotel is absolutely beautiful The rooms are big and spacious and really nicely decorated in a typical dutch manner Needless to say the rooms look exactly like in the pictures if not better The bed is pretty big and extremely comfortable The room came with bath robes slipper and toiletries We even had a coffee machine and tea aside from the minibar It was an amazing experience that was worth every penny spent and I would recommend this hotel to everyone looking for accommodation in Amsterdam 
437814,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The toilet area very crowded shower floor slippery , The food was delicious room wonderful Bathroom clean WiFi fantastic The staff were very friendly and courteous 
437815,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The room was a little small especially for getting around with a walker No view although our limited expanse from the window did provide some plants on adjacent rooftop and unobtrusive exterior walls of surrounding buildings , The staff was very friendly and accommodating Greeted us with recognition after first day Concierge assisted with taxi tour tickets dining reservations at specialty restaurant maps etc Wait staff in dining room were polite and gave good service at breakfast and for several evening meals we ate there Bed was very comfortable with nice clean white linens An extra pillow would have been nice and I probably could have asked for one but did not Cappuccino available at no extra cost with breakfast buffet Nice assortment of eggs cereals meats cheese fruits etc on breakfast buffet We requested an accessible room because of limited mobility for me The room itself was a little crowded for using a walker but the bathroom provided a no barrier shower and plenty of space for moving Good wifi in our room and no difficulties in signing on Quiet for sleeping 
437816,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We didn t like arriving to find that our requested early check in wasn t available and that the room they did have planned for us was facing an alley They offered to upgrade us at a cost of 60Euro more per day but that included breakfast We agreed although we didn t want to pay that much and then found we had to still wait two hours After waiting the two hours the room was not available and we took the original room at the original price only to find out that the alley was not an alley but a small side walking street The room was nice but we are seniors and having to go three steps up and down from the closet and bathroom to the bed without warning was not nice I don t blame the hotel as much as the peson who checked us in as not being knowledgeable nor trying to meet our needs Overall however we had a nice stay enjoyed the location the restaurant for dinner was wonderful with a fabulous waitress Even with the negative comments I would stay there again but choose my room differently ,No Positive
437817,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, It has nothing to do with the hotel Bike traffic in Amsterdam is nasty You have to keep your eyes open, Great location and staff The breakfast was superb Make sure you book it with your room Bed and pillows are extra comfy 
437818,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The behavior of the receptionists Very unfriendly No parking for me in front of the hotel and they did not care about that situation Let us wait to long Very frustrating , We had a upgrade to a buiseness room Beautiful room In the middle of Amsterdam Night watch was very friendly and helpful 
437819,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room was a little noisy and as bed faced glass bath room door this disturbed my partner when I got up in the night so I would say lay out of room was a bit strange for such a large room , The staff were very friendly and helpful
437820,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I noticed the sink was blocked in the bathroom as we was only staying 2 nights it wasn t a big deal But as we upgraded the room to a business suite so this is not something you would expect when paying extra , The room was lovely
437821,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The worst stay ever every thing we need they charge us and plus while check out no staff to help imagine we took the bags to the loppy Need to work out on their behavior and staff, Just welcome note
437822,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with well spacious well laid out rooms Staff are very helpful especially Marjo who went the extra mile to help us Location is perfect and the breakfast is delicious 
437823,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast was so so and the reception and entrance failed to impress It all looked quite faded and the restaurant was quiet small No view from window Did not like the over bath shower , I was happy with the overall modern deco and cleaness of the room The door of the bathroom was ok gave me some privacy compared to some other hotel bathroom doors 
437824,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, not much really Check in was later in day given the room was not available that happens , The room was terrific and the showers strong Bed was very comfortable and the views spectacular
437825,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast service not very well organised had to wait a lot of time to be seated , Great location good service overall Good room service excellent food 
437826,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Stayed in superior room but bathroom tiny Shower over bath poor , Staff friendly Hotel in nice quiet side street although not easy to find Nice open reception area with lovely bar and restaurant within iit Breakfast extensive and excellent quality 
437827,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We only have coffee and roll for breakfast so did not have breakfast at Blu Price of breakfast seemed to be quite high , Excellent location Easily walked to virtually everything we wanted to do in Amsterdam Did take a taxi to a couple of distant restaurants Staff was very helpful Concierge went out of his way to make our stay great Really enjoyed staying here 
437828,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff were wonderful and so helpful Being our first time to Amsterdam we appreciated all the local tips and directions from the hotel staff The restaurant meals for dinner and breakfast were lovely The room was adequate for our overnight stay and very central to all we wanted to see Regards
437829,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, More variety with dinner menu , The staff at the hotel was outstanding They were so helpful and warm that after eight days they seemed like friends Every single staff member had incredible warmth and an ability to help whenever it was needed 
437830,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room face cocktail area No privacy Lousy facing , Booked double bed room Check in staff gave me single bed room Have to go back reception again It s frustrating when you are tired Then gave me what I booked 
437831,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing , Everything was first rate Outstanding Accommodations comfortable and well equipped beds fantastic staff uniformly helpful and knowledgeable restaurant lovely and the food delicious in short I can t say enough about the hotel And perhaps the best part of it all was the staff so lovely friendly gracious and helpful A very special bunch Our stay was perfect in every detail Everyone was so attentive it was unbelievable 
437832,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room was small considering a triple Step up to bathroom very dangerous especially in middle of night Wardrobe space only sufficient for two , Staff were faultless Made a special effort with my mums 86 th birthday which over and above what was expected 
437833,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The pillows were flat I should have requested additional pillows , The staff was very helpful and the hotel was clean The expresso machine in the room was awesome 
437834,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Typically overpriced why do city hotels need to be such a rip off Breakfast was reduced to 26e not a bargain When you pay 622e for a twin room for two nights very good is a minimum breakfast should be included these places a designed for rich travellers only , The beds were excellent and the hotel was in a quite location very close to most things
437835,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, junior room was a bit small for 3 people 2nd bed was a pullout couch and was hard hotel was very busy during the week I stayed I was sent downstairs for breakfast where it was not as good as upstairs, comfy bed clean room pullout couch was all setup prior to our arrival central location within walking distance to many shops
437836,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Our room overlooked a courtyard so no natural light and some noise from the bar even in the 6th floor, A modern hotel with extremely comfy beds and lots of character incoporating the old buildings of Amsterdam within the building 
437837,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, It wasn t even one music channel or radio channel on TV so we couldn t listening a music when we was in the room , Extremly polite and professional staff everybody spiking english nice bed quite room and very good breakfast 
437838,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Was disappointed that the ordered surprise cake for my wife birthday didn t arrive to the room till 2 hours later and I had to go down and ask reception about it Which ruined my surprise I had to tell her why I m leaving the room and made her wait to continue our day Ordered for 9am got it at 11am , Great location easy to access all part of the city 
437839,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Although it was a nice hotel clean etc I believe it was a little expensive for what it was Our booking did not include breakfast and we decided against adding it on as it was an extra 20 EUR per person It was much cheaper to visit one of the many cafes in the centre We only stayed at the Radisson as it was a special birthday trip and wanted that little extra luxury , The room was lovely exactly what we wanted The bed was extremely comfortable which mattered to us as we had busy days planned and needed a good rest overnight ready for the following days activities It was in a good location close enough to get everywhere on foot but far away enough to not hear the hustle bustle in the early hours The concierge service was a nice FOC extra as we had a late flight but still wanted to venture around the city the hotel held our cases at no extra cost so we didn t have to lug them about with us 
437840,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We ordered room service on our final night and it took close to an hour to be delivered The food was cold by this point The gentleman who delivered it was very apologetic and returned shortly after with a fruit hamper in way of apology , Our whole experience was exceptional The staff were very friendly and always happy to help with suggestions and directions It was in a fantastic location and wonderfully easy to navigate from We dined in the restaurant for Earth Hour and it was simply magical The ambience was delightful and the food exceptional 
437841,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Our recent stay at the Radisson Blu in Amsterdam was the most maddening experience I have ever had involving unprofessional and poorly trained hotel staff especially at a supposedly high end property like Radisson Blu The entire hotel staff has seemingly great difficulty with the concept of finding a way to communicate with a guest that doesn t involve insulting them deactivating their key cards or accusing them of financial improprieties The front desk staff made an error and lost our check in data Claiming they needed to speak with us they skipped right past slipping a note under the door or flashing the message light on the room phone instead they intentionally deactivated our key cards so that we had to come find them The desk staff and a trainee manager then made the situation worse with a cavalier attitude and no acknowledgement that we had been inconvenienced or the validity of our concerns about the potentially compromised credit card information They also claimed that no other manager was available until the next day when we would be checking out I drafted an e mail to an assistant manager the only contact information they would provide He then poured fuel on the fire by criticizing me for leaving the hotel without speaking to him we were in taxi to the airport before he arrived at the hotel slandering me by suggesting that our early departure 9 00 am was somehow an effort to avoid payment and then inexplicably introducing sexism misogyny into the mix by trivializing the conduct of the two ladies we had first dealt with The hotel location is excellent and the rooms are quite nice except that many of their Business Class rooms are in an annex building that is only accessible with two elevator rides and a walk through an underground corridor that depending on time of day can be a gauntlet of tables and or cocktail imbibing convention goers ,No Positive
437842,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The room way too smaller than expected For almost 300 a night I expect something better after flew for 15 hours But as the location quite central just be positive that i paid for the location , The location quite central You can take a walk to the main interests The room is clean with comfy bed and complete amenities 
437843,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The Nespresso machine in the room was mentioned in the room description but then there were only 3 coffee capsules in a room occupied by 2 people Could have done with some more drawer space , Really friendly cheerful and helpful staff especially at breakfast
437844,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Even though it says great location it s tucked away a little further to the city center than we had expected , The room service staff in particular were very accommodating when we had smalll special requests The hotel is more appropriate for business than it is for leisure having said that my family and I were comfortable and enjoyed our stay While this property is more expensive and is probably on the 50 50 mark on value for money but it is a very nice place to stay in Amsterdam 
437845,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, none , good varieties of breakfast waitress service very attentive hotel within short walking distance to shops Overall staff services are excellent and very helpful when asked 
437846,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Noisy housekeeping Concierge did not do a train booking as I ve requested No one explained hotel facility, Location The staff was concedirate in changing the room Internet was slow
437847,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We ate in the restaurant on the first night and both the service and the food were poor It took ages to get served we had long waits for drinks between courses and food Items arrived at random so that we couldn t eat at the same time and the whole service felt chaotic Some dishes were OK but my halibut was woefully over cooked and under seasoned It was a big disappointment They also don t have enough space for breakfast often there is a wait for a table and one particularly busy morning we ended up in the overflow space downstairs which was a chilly charmless function room that didn t have all the food in the main breakfast area Not recommended , The location is great and the rooms are clean and comfortable The reception staff are really helpful and professional Special thanks also go to Peter the repairman who patched up my mother s wheelchair
437848,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, On three of the four mornings someone from housekeeping either knocked on the door or used their key to try to come in before 8 30am while we were either still in bed or getting dressed We found this very annoying Something needs tightening up there The previous time we stayed Christmas 2015 reception was in the other building and there were always apples and biscuits for guests at reception and free coffee tea in the lounge near the door All these little extras seem to have disappeared now that the renovation is complete Would it really cost so much to provide them again ,No Positive
437849,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We stayed 6 nights suites were not cleaned thoroughly enough during our stay The suites booked were overpriced when considering the services provided Breakfast very basic , We had 2 suites Beds were decent temperatures adjustable in rooms to comfortable levels 
437850,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The price of the hotel , Everything was in order The reception desk and concierge were very helpful the rooms were clean with great high ceilings Couldn t open our window I like fresh air but I suppose this was for safety reasons Not sure the room was vacuumed while we were there our slippers were just in the same place randomly looked like the cleaner hadn t touched anything although the beds were made Plenty of tea and coffee and a coffee machine Comfortable beds Fairly quiet streets for the middle of Amsterdam 
437851,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Could of made more effort to acknowledge our anniversary would not say I was unhappy or was expecting anything in particular but felt as though considering how much we was spending to stay there more could have been done which would made our stay even more special , We upgraded ourselves to a business class room just before our trip which was beautiful and worth the money it had an amazing view of one of the canals Bed was really comfortable lots of space in the room for all of your belongings as well as to move around The staff were really helpful and welcoming considering we arrived early hours of the morning Location was great only 5 minutes walk from the main attractions Thoroughly enjoyed our stay would definitely return 
437852,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Tea and coffee facilities could have been better as only powdered milk available , The bed was extremely comfortable The room was very clean Location was fantastic 
437853,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Bathrooms too small and showers poor The decor in the rooms felt dated and the rooms were dark Everything was over priced especially the food and breakfast which was very average For a 4 hotel this fell well short Furthermore I booked this hotel by mistake on booking com along with 4 others The other four which were small independent hotels were prepared to refund me my booking and the Radisson was the only one that refused Very poor for such a large chain who clearly could have resold the room immediately , Beds comfy location good
437854,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Awful carpet in the bedroom , The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming I had a room on the top floor which was nicely decorated and had a fun layout with stairs up to the room from the door Very memorable The duvet and pillows were awesome wanted to take them home with me 
437855,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing room offering comfort in everyway I am a person that needs luxury in his travel and this hotel is no comprimise The location is amazing surrounded by everything you need within walking distance Customer service is better than expected always willing to accommodate where possible 
437856,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast When it was busy the staff couldn t really cope and iif I stayed there again I wouldn t have the breakfast again not worth the money You can get get much better breakfast outside On the second morning it was absolutely boiling in the dining room as they hadn t turned the air con on When I asked them too which they did it was so much better before that it was almost unbearable , The Business Class room was very nice Big really clean lovely bathroom Nespresso machine big bed Very modern Lovely 
437857,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I didn t like that my room window looked into the central foyer of the hotel it was a bit strange I would have liked a street view or something , Everyone was really nice and helpful The breakfast was good The location is great if you want something right in the centre of Amsterdam It s central but on a side street so you get the quiet too 
437858,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Very noisy in the street view room Bathroom had a strange smell to it and stained toilet and bath Television turned itself on and off Standard or decor in the room didn t match that of the hotel and exterior of the building , Very accommodating helpful staff Changed my partners pillows as he couldn t sleep on them Great for directions and lent me a phone charger Great location by the canal and easy walking distance to everything you would want to see and do 
437859,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The location is fantastic as you can easily walk everywhere in the central part of Amsterdam but is a little more quiet than the absolute centre We went out for breakfast both days and found a super local cafe Comfortable bed lovely linen excellent bathroom with good lighting although not the most powerful shower Great being able to park on site expensive but this is standard in Amsterdam 
437860,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, pillow was too soft but my pillow at home is unusual in that its a memory foam which hotels don t have i cant really blame the hotel for that , standard rooms were large and comfortable Underfloor heating in the bathroom was nice coffee tea facilities in room is always welcome Breakfast was plentiful and fresh staff were friendly 
437861,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We stayed for 2 nights Our room wasn t cleaned made up until after 3 30pm when we returned from being out Did clean it late p m when we went out again A real bugbear nearly all hotels ask you to use the same towels and tell you to hang them up you do and they replace them anyway , Good size firm bed Within old part of Amsterdam and walking distance of everything although only with hand luggage from train station Entrance is on a road not the pedestrianised bit so taxis can access it no problem 
437862,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The deposit of 150 that we had to pay on arrival and which t still hasn t been refunded to us even though it was supposed to really hope this is sorted asap, Extra comfortable very clean lovely breakfast
437863,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Not much bad to say The add ons can get a bit pricey like breakfast parking and room upgrades , This hotel has a great location and value The hotel is near all the action but far enough away to be quiet and calm 
437864,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, After specifically asking reception to make the payment due on the authorization they have authorized the amount again days after my stay there Unacceptable I couldn t have been more clear Their staff needs more training when it comes to payment Much more ,No Positive
437865,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is beautifully furnished It is very clean and the service is excellent Check in was hassle free Despite the central location the hotel was quiet and free of street noise 
437866,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, we had a hotel worker walk in on us at 8am on the saturday morning wouldn t like that again didn t knock first just came straight in whilst we were in bed,No Positive
437867,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing , Everything Location check in comfortable room breakfast was superb plenty of choices and catered for my gluten free requests Staff helpful and friendly especially Astrid 
437868,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The bed was very hard I had a bad back every morning there was only one pillow per person in the room we needed to ask for more coffee for the room Breakfast was very basic we completed our breakfast on two mornings before coffee was served the toaster was very slow it took almost 5 minutes to brown the toast The rooms were very tired and don t represent the star rating , We appreciated the how the staff welcomed us and dealt with our request 
437869,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Lobby impersonal and a transit area the lack of a lounge area within the hotel proper was a difficulty for us it would have been lovely to have somewhere comfortable to go and read a book Furnishings suffered from trendy design over function even in the bedroom a junior suite you were unable to lean back and rest your head on either the sofa or the chair what about comfort Would have loved a drawer Bedroom lighting poor unable to use lights independently and even with good glazing it was a bit noisy at night but perhaps to be expected as it was Amsterdam , We were there for 5 night and the staff were great nothing nothing was too much trouble for them and they were very obliging Fabulous breakfasts and the food in the restaurant was good service was very efficient Concierge and reception staff were exceptionally helpful Beds very comfortable Quality of the pillows and linen etc was great Location was very central and almost everywhere was easily walkable 
437870,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Some options at the bar are a bit pricey, Great Breakfast Ideal position for visiting the city Friendly Staff Enough space for working in the lobby with a laptop

437872,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, There could of been better use of plug sockets in the rooms as it was very difficult to style my hair and be in view of a mirror as the plug socket was in the wrong place but everything else was great , The bed was extra comfy and the staff were very helpful and friendly and even upgraded the room for us for free and gave us an early check in 
437873,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Cold room and had to keep ringing to turn temp up and down Bad service at breakfast luke warm coffee and had to look for staff to order and not getting what we ordered Not a once off as this happened every morning Very poor service though buffet was good , Location Clean Good choice at breakfast 
437874,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Rather expensive Would have liked the lighting to have stayed on a brief time in the room after removing the card to see to open the door etc , Information about the building the hidden church access the grocer shop Easy to walk to locations Under floor heating in the bathroom Printer attached to guest pc to print boarding cards
437875,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Having to use your door card to operate the lift I understand it s for security purposes but when you re 3 sheets to the wind it s so so so annoying, Easy quick check in We even got a complimentary pint of Heineken So that was a bonus 
437876,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Pillows are a bit soft, We had a lovely gift on arrival as was our anniversary Great stylish hotel in a brilliant location easy to get all around old town de Pijp and Jordaan 
437877,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, On arrival staff member yvonna was rude unwelcoming and very unhelpful not sure why she had her nose stuck in the air no need for it she works on a front desk Maybe why unhappy twat, Bed was next to a services compartment heard everyone s toilet and shower experience
437878,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast was poor missing items both days coffee cold The croissant and pastry were nice enough as were the meats and cheese The bread and fruit could both have been much better as could the coffee , The room was fantastic very clean and spacious with a very comfy bed Reception staff helpful A lovely bar for a nightcap too Perfect location for accessing all parts of the Central city Grachtengordel The Amstel and further South 
437879,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was excellent on the 1st day but the selection wasn t as good on other two days we stayed room was excellent but overpriced when they just pull down a sofa and charge you an extra 90 a night for your 13 year old son to sleep on it Nice hotel but you do pay a premium like any city , Hotel had a great location
437880,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, coffee sachets in room for people who dont like nepresso machine which i personally like great touch by hotel, Extra little touches like separate little milk bottles large selection fruit juices and water available really great selection at breakfast and staff lovely Great relaxing room and hotel with brilliant location 
437881,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Original room was facing into the lobby so no fresh air our request was dealt with very well though, Bed was super comfy staff did well to get us a room with facing out to fresh air
437882,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, when we first arrived we were told we had to pay in full before receiving the room and a 150 euro deposit upfront for the room The price of the room was also after rising when we arrived and I was very disappointed with the way we were told I had a booking confirmation with the total price and they told us it was wrong and charged an extra 40 I enjoyed the location and hotel itself but the value for money and the way the staff treated us was not worth it I m very disappointed and I think it was extrememely unreasonable to ask us to pay before even seeing the room and the ridiculous 150 deposit on top of that also It disrupted our entire weekend We were out of pocket for our break and had to adjust our daily budget which was a big inconvenience , The beds were comfy room was gorgeous and breakfast was fab Great location 
437883,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Asked to pay 50 per night up front as a security deposit Paid 20 for early check in and was charged 56 which couldn t be explained even by the manager but we were assured it will be refunded Check out was chaotic Separate que for check in check out would shorten the 35 minute wait , Comfortable rooms good size for a city break excellent location within walking distance to any location Free wifi was a bonus 
437884,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Stairs to coffee shop stairs to toilets and stairs down and across to other side of hotel so had to refuse the room with a view of the canal, Staff were excellent very helpful and friendly especially Karin
437885,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Not the hotel fault but City tax was sneaky should have been declared prior , Nice clean rooms with really friendly staff the hotel was spotless and very friendly

437889,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Soundproofing On Friday and Saturday morning there were groups of people loudly chatting in Dutch at 5AM in front of our room No they were not heading to the airport lol Unfortunately the door was not very thick or the gap at the bottom was letting the party in We almost called the desk to tell them but they left after about 10 minutes both times Thursday and Sunday were quiet Maybe its just Amsterdam that makes you wanna chat in a corridor at 5AM , The service is excellent in the hotel and bar plus the location right on the edge of the Red Light district is perfect to get to the museums and outlying places of interest Quieter than most hotels in the area I ve stayed at about 7 different ones in the Centraal area over the last decade Street noise is limited Bar food is excellent Did not eat in restaurant however last time we stayed there it was delicious for breakfast and dinner the times we did eat in 
437890,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We were badly let down by the concierge who disappeared at the busyiest time of day which resulted in us missing our transportation to the airport We then had to take a taxi which cost us an additional 50 over the price we had already paid , My wife cannot eat gluten and we were very impressed by the how helpful the staff were in providing gluten free breads and cereals

437896,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We had an executive room with adjoining door to a suite which had a very loud family in it Had to call reception at midnight who sorted it Not good for price we paid Breakfast area very congested and fairly limited though perfectly adequate Would prefer upgrade of breakfast area and provision to accompany executive room , Great location and good sized rooms in our executive room Bar very pleasant Staff helpful and late check out was a lovely bonus 
437897,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Minor downs Junior suite room s windows leak but they could remotely crank up the heating I had to tap the gaps with towels Sound isolation wasn t ideal u could hear people clearly on the corridors Though most of staff are nice one women told me to remember to return the umbrella the moment I was going to borrow it for the sudden rain And I just need it to load my luggages onto a taxi outside the gate Maybe they have had umbrellas stolen before or maybe it s a Dutch thing In my opinion it is RUDE to say that to a customer or maybe anyone Also at least she could have said please , Very good hotel for the most I thought breakfast was pretty good Dinner and lunch that the same restaurant serves was Good too Staff nice and responsive 
437898,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The business room we had was fairly large and very comfortable although the bathroom was very small We appreciated the coffee machine and free capsules in the room The buffet breakfast was of good quality and variety

437903,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, A few things that did not ruin our stay at all or make us not go back but a few pointers The main problem was asking for a king sized bed When we go their they explained that their was two separated and will be put together tomorrow Done as said but two separate quilts on our king size became a pain in the bum throughout the evenings Next door was very loud The deposit was alot of money and we didnt know until we turned up so make sure you prepare a deposit For some reason i hated the carpet with a passion but thats me being fussy But this did not effect our stay to much at all , The location was absolutely perfect had a comfortable feel to the place everything was perfect apart from the things I didn t like which I will state these The cleaners always left cute little things in your room like turning the towels into boats and folding things up for you without entering to much of your privacy The staff were very friendly and lovely people Just had an amazing feel to the place Me and my partner enjoyed it muchly 
437904,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast could have been nicer and hotter the rooms need updating and the room needs to be cleaned long before 16 30pm which was usually the case during our stay Very disappointing overall , I ve stayed at this hotel before and it was much nicer then the staff were friendly and the breakfast was worth having and paying that little extra for This time was so different staff on the reception area were unhelpful and dissmissive of general enquiries which were needed in order to get around the city more easily

437908,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The main building of the hotel where the entrance is the breakfast is taken and the majority of the rooms are is not the one shown in the pictures but a relatively new building in the same street The room that we stayed in a superior room was nothing special The decoration was a little bit kitsch plates hanging on the wall kitsch carpet many lamps and the bathroom though renovated seemed quite old fashioned I do not know whether all rooms are the same because to my understanding the hotel is a combination of several buildings As far as the breakfast is concerned I did not like that much the omelettes and the scramble eggs they were not tasty , The breakfast was excellent Great variety of products in a large buffet e g several kind of croissants fresh orange juice several kind of bread cheese and ham eggs and you can also choose from a menu if you want something extra The hotel is situated in the city center and it is close to everything The tv in our room was huge The room was very clean 
437909,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The wardrobes were too small We had to walk a long way to get to our room from the elevator , Interesting decoration with local components Easy to walk around

437911,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Management needs more training The day I arrived this lady checked me in she was management The day I checked out she had to be called to help out Something wrong with billing And being extremely rude to me she told me she didnt check me in When I know for a fact she did I told her to check the cameras She messed up my booking and the deposit on the room Over charging my card 700 dollars Then kept saying she didnt check me in When I know for a fact she did I couldn t forget her face and voice I was mistreated and by bill showed I ate and drank out of the minibar when we never had anything from it We still got charged as if we ate out of it everyday I had to ask multiple times for extra towls and cleaning services I will never revisit this location Ill try somewhere else , I liked the cleanliness and location in the area

437918,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast buffet wasn t the best and it wasn t as i expected it to be The fry up was all cold and wasn t even warm let alone hot The Junior Suite bathrooms were toooo small you could just about fit 1 one person inside , The hot chocolate sachets in the rooms were so good We had the Junior suite because there was 3 of us which was nice and we had a good view Overall a nice good hotel to stay and a great destination near damn sqaure walking distance 
437919,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, When I arrived they provisionally charged my credit card for more than EUR 600 two rooms Following day they charge the final rate Eur 605 on my credit card but they did not cancel the provisional rates This provisional rate remains on my credit card for 30 days which is more than ridiculous Many hotels actually do the same trick and I am extremely annoyed about this bad and stupid behaviour Car rental companies on the other hand really cancel the provisional excess charge immediately once the car has been returned successfully Why Hotels can t do the same I complain about this problem now for more than 10 Years without any improvement , The entire hotel has a very nice atmosphere 
437920,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Location was far from museums the area was quite busy in the evenings and therefore noisy Also a fair bit of construction noise during the day , Hotel was clean and safe

437927,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, upon our arrival we discovered that the room was prepared for 3 adults while we were 2 adults and 3 kids asked for the additional beds but only one was available on top of that a wooden hatch fell from the wall and hit my wife luckily without major injuries the management of the hotel offered us a dinner as a compensation but we have had to pay for the drinks it s enough to say so definitely not a suggested choice an unsafe place with ridiculous management ,No Positive

437931,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, You can hear the noise coming from outside But you choose a hotel in a city centre There will always be a construction work going on somewhere The sound isolation could be better , The location is just awsome in the middle of the old city centre Beds were extremely comfortable Breakfast was a nice set of fresh ingredients fruit salad was made of fresh fruit smoothies were self made smoked salmon was tasty and the omelette bar was an extra for a four star hotel Nice 
437932,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Poor sound insulation from the street but it s a quiet area so not a big deal , The location is good the staff are very friendly and helpful The room was fantastic we had a great stay here

437938,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Very fast complementary WIFI Location was good 5 mins walk to Dam square Staff was very helpful and prompt The way they clean the room each day is impressive 
437939,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room was freezing Heating didn t work No heated towel rail Pillows too soft Definitely not worth what we paid , Staff were friendly Great location Clean 
437940,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was great but the area seemed too small staff seemed stressed at times not overly polite , Front desk staff MaryJo was excellent polite efficient etc 
437941,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Just come prepared with your converter if you are American Not a complaint or the hotels fault just a heads up , Comfortable beds great location and the breakfast was actually pretty impressive 
437942,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, No storage or very little in the rooms Had to upgrade to Business Class Slightly better but still deficient Breakfast 28 Euros per person is below par Flow of people and food is poor Laundry is very expensive and below par , Staff Karin and Luis are excellent assets overall People at restaurant extremely friendly and efficient Location is very good 
437943,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, They offered me an upgrade for 60 euros per night but charged me 10 euros per night and never itemised the bill and I still have not got to the bottom of it , Service cleanliness and the facilities were excellent 
437944,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Was told that my car was not booked in and would have to move it I explain that it was booked in but they say is not on their system This was until I showed confirmation on my telephone and after 10 minutes of discussion it was ok to leave there but no explanation from the Radisson ,No Positive
437945,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, At check in I specifically asked to have one night charged to my credit card and the second to my travel companion s This wasn t done and created significant problems It took assistance of Joyce Van Geest to help resolve , Modern with traditional touches Joyce Van Geest was very helpful with subsequent problems encountered The breakfast buffet was the best ever and the evening meal was also very good 
437946,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Lack of leisure facilities pool jacuzzi etc The bathroom was ok however slightly dated Bed slightly too firm for my liking Value for money too expensive , The room was quite spacious Plenty of hanging space Nice foyer area Lifts were quick to arrive 
437947,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent location short stroll to restaurants and port area Close to the Red Light area Nespresso machine in room was a bonus enormous room and bathroom beautiful
437948,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really The only comment I can make here is that the location is not walkable from the train station if you have heavy bags so there ll be the additional cost of a taxi from central station , The room was spacious the bed was super comfy there were a good selection of TV channels the breakfast was top notch and the bar was one of the best hotel bars I ve been in The location is close enough to the action that you can walk to most places but far enough away that you re in a quiet area 
437949,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We had a car And the fact that there is parking right in the hotel is a major plus The fact that it costs half the price of the hotel room however is exagerated and overpriced considering what you already pay for the room itself , This was a great hotel with really amiable staff ready to help whenver you had a question even hiding a secret present i had bought for my aunt and uncle while we walked around so that i could surprise them later at the coffee table when we came back for a break The location is fantastic close to everything in the old center right by a canal so you immediately get the perfect Amsterdam view I travel at least once a month whether for work or leisure combined and i must say that i have NOTHING bad to say about this hotel Clean rooms with coffee and tea in the room for you comfortable beds nice helpful staff with a perfect location And the breakfast is an array of incredible delicious choice so if you have the option to get breakfast included don t hesitate for a moment You won t find better and it s way too expensive to spend one off And it should be noted that they have parking conveniently located at the hotel to avoid running around Amsterdam and risking fines 
437950,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, On the whole this hotel was fabulous only thing if I had to say if anything was it was a little pricey I guess it s true you get what you pay for , Location was fabulous couldn t fault room massive to with English channels

437952,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Make sure you don t have breakfast in rush hour around 9 they had to open also buffet down stairs and the selection there was way smaller than in main floor But there was no issue to take a round trip to main floor to load up the plate , Breakfast was very good The room was big very clean and had everything needed The staff was very helpful and service oriented with a smile Will definitely stay again
437953,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing in general except that we couldn t get a late check out as the rooms were fully booked But we left our luggages at the reception and went to the city center returned back before our flight time , The location is great you can walk for few minutes to the city center and many attractions like Bernand museum Anne Frank House Dam square and many more The staff are friendly speaking good English best staff are the ladies at the breakfast restaurant who are always smiling and helpful Thank you to all of them Big thanks to Sherly she is always running around to help the guests with lovely smile The breakfast is great the rooms are very clean and we loved the espresso machine provided in the room I was worried that the hotel was close to the Red District when we checked the map as we were with our kids but we didn t notice that during our stay when we walked around so no need to worry about this issue We booked an airport taxi online but then we found out that the taxi provided by the hotel is a bit cheaper Milan at the reception was very helpful we requested a canal view for our inter connecting rooms which was not available in our first day of arrival but he managed to move us to other rooms with canal view next day we left in the morning keeping our luggages at the old room and we found them at the new room when we returned to the hotel at the evening If you travel with kids inter connecting rooms is the best choice You can send a request to the hotel to get this confirmed after you make the booking We really enjoyed our one week vacation 
437954,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Don t go to the store across the street extremely over priced , Beautiful rooms The staff were incredible we arrived early and they were able to find us a room Gave us a wake up call and ensured we had a taxi waiting for us in the morning the day we left 
437955,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel was noisy through the night Was wakened in the early hours of the morning by people shouting and vehicles going up and down the street Was not informed about the extra tax we had to pay for each day until we got our bill when checking out , Room was nice and spacious Comfy bed In good location
437956,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Bar too dark and dismal Hence not many in Bed far too hard and uncomfortable Bathroom had not been cleaned when we first got to the room Disappointing that you can view builders old waste materials and other rubbish on roof through window adjacent to room 503 Some staff on reception very grumpy Overall very disappointed in hotel as it was chosen for my wife s 69th birthday celebration in Amsterdam Also blocked 150 on my credit card for incidentals I MIGHT use without asking my permission or even telling me about it Be difficult to recommend to anyone as no recompense offered and it was like it or lump it ,No Positive
437957,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, No parking possible at the hotel as limited spaces were full during our stay Alternative public parking was available at 15 min walking , Location in the heart of Amsterdam 
437958,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The minibar in the room was extremely expensive The breakfast wasn t great either Lots of variety but English breakfast side of it was not nice Also the tea was very weak even after stewing for 15mins , Lovely room in an ideal location
437959,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room facing the street very noisy Woke up several times for noise during the night Pillow too soft Bad smell in the bathroom, the location is absolutely perfect Junior suites with stairs and quite big
437960,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing to do with the hotel but nothing in Amsterdam starts until 10am shops tours rentals so visitors should plan accordingly I had assumed we could get an early canal tour in but not possible Overall I wish we could have stayed longer , This is a fabulous hotel in a great central location easy to walk to nearby city center sites and enjoy strolls along the canals The staff were also fabulous friendly courteous and helpful with information and directions as well as bookings Everyone speaks English so fluently in Amsterdam The breakfast that was included was an amazing buffet of healthy fresh fruits yoghurts and cereals hot foods cheeses amazing selection of breads and pastries and fresh squeezed juices and smoothies very impressive and delicious The room was very quiet and the beds were so comfortable I also appreciated seeing the efforts this hotel is making toward sustainability promoting local charities as well as environmental efficiency measures smart room towels smaller bath as well as promoting local foods fruits in dining We had such a short time there so it was easiest to get there and back to the airport by taxi with our cases but there are train stations within a ten min walk if you have more time The design of the room was really nice a classy room with all the necessities that also has subtle references to famous Amsterdam icons like Miffy and windmills etc Before coming I was a bit worried about walking through the red light district or around all the drug cafes which are nearby We did end up walking through by accident while out at night but it was so busy with people including other families and couples it was not a big issue There are some great falafel gelato shops and bakeries around which we enjoyed 
437961,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff was friendly and accommodating The location was right in the heart of charming Amsterdam The value for the money was incredible The room was spacious and beautiful Loved this hotel I will definitely book here again when I travel to Amsterdam 
437962,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable and the room a good size the coffee machine was great The bath and shower were good Everything in all areas was very clean The gym and sauna was a real treat Breakfast was amazing but you had to be really hungry to make the most of the variety and quantity available We had one evening meal which was scrumptious Staff on reception were very helpful 
437963,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, They couldn t accommodate an early check in That was a little disappointing , Location is good The room was quite big and the bathroom was nice and clean The staff was also friendly 
437964,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, It s not a critisim or a negative however I would expect this hotel to have a swimming pool and a steam room to give the guest s the ultimate experience they are in a Radisson Hotel , Location and staff were very helpful 
437965,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast buffet not great in terms of choice as restaurant was full Could of chose to wait for a table however we didn t want to waste time , Clean friendly helpful staff great location 
437966,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel s payment policy makes no sense They charged my card for the first night I proposed them to pay for our entire stay they accepted of course but asked for a deposit of 50 EUR per night 150 EUR in my case I don t recommend this hotel in Amsterdam , The location is perfect if you want to explore the city center All major attractions are within the walking distance 
437967,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Very expensive parking over the city paid 100 for 2 night , Great location near the center of Amsterdam Localy staff with good breakfast recomneded hotel
437968,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Twice we were locked into to our room Apparently the staff were aware of this problem not unique to our room and did have it fixed when we complained , On checking in Henk at reception was pleasant and efficient while not being officious but also a good salesman for the hotel 
437969,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, There was a bad smell in the breakfast area that you can t not notice during all days of our stay as well as the cups smelled very bad The options of the breakfast could be wider by adding some mediteranian options One more thing that I don t like about Radisson Blu Chain is the late check in at 15 00 pm but this is not the fault of this hotel but the chain in general Definitely I would stay here again but please improve the breakfast , The location is excellent if not the best situated in a calm street next to damn square 7 min walk and other main squares and very close to the red light district However it is perfect for a family stay and if you don t want to notice the district you just don t The staff were very friendly and helpful in all means We booked the buisness room and it was spacious with lovely decorations but with no view view to the facing buildings It also included 3 beds although we were only two They provide tour booking services as well as reasonably priced taxi services The enterance of the hotel is lovely a typical radisson blu enterance 
437970,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Morning breakfast with excellent choices but the staff that morning wasn t so joyfull , Reception staff is highly professional Nespresso in the room was a treat 
437971,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Only one USB plug from the TV and too high many hotel already provide more USB plugs for recharge the battery for Mobile cam and computer etc , Can get little bit early check in Can get little bit late check out Can arrange for service 
437972,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, My room was an adjoining room and the next door guests were making a bit of a noise The hotel staff changed me to a different room without any problems and I was much more comfortable as a result , The staff were super friendly and helpful After leaving they helped me to weigh my suitcase and fill up my beater bottle It is also superbly located only 5 minutes from the national monument and so I was able to walk everywhere Breakfast was very good but not excellent 
437973,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The room are nice but the view was not so nice We have to park 15 mins walk away and was pretty expensive 50 Euro day The room was pretty expensive for what they offer , The location is excellent The breakfast is very good and very rich The wifi was excellent The rooms are nice but not special 
437974,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, No vallet parking and the parking fees are really high plus there wasnt a parking space avilable for my car Then they told me even if it was my car was big so i had to park it around 20 mintuest away,No Positive
437975,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The iron was awful to use so I would suggest to anyone staying to take their own , Really good place to stay rooms are a good size very clean staff are very helpful friendly 
437976,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The price may be high but I think it s because of the name of hotel and the services as well , Good location near to the dam square Friendly staff our flight was at night so we did the check out and kept our luggage at the hotel when we came back to take them we ask for a place in which we can pray and they gave us an access to the fitness so we can go pray there we appreciate that Clean and good services
437977,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, The Radisson Blue Hotel is a very modern and clean property located very close to the main attractions of Amsterdam in a quiet street Highly recommended 
437978,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast was expensive Rooms were cleaned too late in the day we would arrive back at hotel after a busy day 16 00 approx and rooms still hadn t been serviced , Very clean rooms loved the Nespresso coffee in the room staff friendly
437979,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing serious in my mind but The staff at Reception should act more friendly maybe with a nice smile , Friendliness warmth of Staff at Breakfast Restaurant and location of the hotel 
437980,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Very slow check in service I mean really slow other than that for us a good hotel , Nice room with AC great breakfast selection onsite parking E50 day but if you are traveling by car what do you do Concierge staff brilliant and well informed on guiding you where you want to go

437990,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The pillows they were not very comfortable they squashed too flat There should have been minibar options in the fridge and fresh milk to go with the tea coffee facilities Powdered cream is certainly not acceptable in such a highly rated hotel The hot food at breakfast such as the scrambled eggs and bacon were barely luke warm and definitely need to be hot hot hot , Staff were super friendly especially upon check in out and at breakfast The breakfast options were extensive The hotel location was fantastic

438045,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Front Desk I hope the check in lady can smile more often and try to add some humor to her conversations I m not saying she was negative but adding little bit of a fun feel would be great for a country that is fun The TV in my room is considered outdated but I believe it may be on the next renovation plan I hoped for a Hotel car with a reasonable rate to drop us to the train station as we had luggage and it is kind of a long walk also the Taxi go to unnecessary routes and turns for longer trips to the train station so they get paid more or at least a car with a considerable rates to drop guests to Airport Again COMEDY CENTRAL English should be on the TV list , This is my second stay on the same trip if you ask me why it will be because you know what you get as you get what you want the Hotel condition the Room condition the HK service the Breakfast and the Location is close to everything the WIFI is convenient Overall I will stay there again but I d try something else on my next visit Concierge I m not sure if I recall his name but I think it was Lucas really friendly concierge attendant who gave us assistance and offered the Hotel s umbrella as it was raining well done Breakfast Love it it would be great if the waiter can take our egg orders instead of us queuing Front Desk Thank you for the upsell again

438049,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast format doesn t work very well The staff are great but there weren t enough staff or the process of getting you sat down taking orders for tea and coffee or any egg omelette orders were very slow and could be much better You wait a while for fresh eggs but then queue to add any other items in which case the freshly made stuff is then cold The quality and variety was fine but needs a re think Could be much better , The style of the hotel The rooms and the staff were all great

438055,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The food in the hotel was very pricey and in my opinion over priced for what was on offer Also the Radisson automatically deducted a 1 charity donation I have no problem donating to the charity however given I gave The Radisson over 700 for a three night stay I think they could match the donation and give something themselves Perhaps they do but I did not see this stated anywhere As with many hotels the hairdryer was very poor and situated in the bathroom no mirror in the room at the dressing table to do makeup and use straighteners , Staff were very friendly and helpful We requested a late check out and were accommodated promptly and we appreciated this

438057,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, where to start Upon arrival we asked for 150 euro deposit I have never paid a deposit at a hotel and have travelled to Amsterdam many times I was not advised of this in advance and felt it was a lot of money to request without prior notice or valid reasoning The facilities in the room were non existent and there was no mirror in the room in this day and age of hair straighteners etc to no have a mirror in the room is ludicrous The shower was clued in place I am over 6ft 2 and had to crouch down and lean against a wall to be able to shower and wash my hair The TV in the room had a great feature where every 2 minutes it would switch to the hotel advertising telling me about all the wonderful facilities I would be refused We were given a welcome pack advising we could borrow an umbrella if it was going to rain so we asked to borrow one as the forecast showed a downpour of rain expected to last 3 4 hours despite the advertising and welcome pack offering this service we were refused this service as this hotels staff are apparently trained to forecast weather and we were assured 100 it would not rain 20 minutes after leaving the hotel the skies opened up and we were drenched and had to buy an umbrella thank you for that I travel about a lot I have stayed in all types of accommodation from hostels to suites in 5 Hotels and never have I been so pleased to check out of a hotel I travel to Amsterdam frequently for work and leisure never would I recommend this hotel to anyone who wanted to enjoy their trip I do not feel I had value for money from my stay and if I had paid by credit card I would be asking my credit card company to reverse the transaction as I do believe I got what I paid for and expected staying in a 4 hotel , the location was ok and it wasn t dirty 
438058,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Few negatives I found hair in the minibar door when I opened it no tissues in the room it was only in the toilet I hoped to find the normal Comedy Central channel in English but it was available only in Austrian I don t know if the TV design is side ways but it needs to be looked at as it was disturbing specially if you spend most of the time in the room Room no 459 there was no view accessibility you should enter the other building go downstairs to go through a small tunnel to reach the other building where our room was at sometimes it s very disturbing if you forgot something in the room or so , The Pillows in the room were very comfortable the reception team were cooperative and made a successful up sell to the Business Class room inclusive of Breakfast Breakfast has everything you need the chef made my eggs the way I always like them the attendants were pro active and smooth The HK did a great job cleaning the room Late check out was offered by the team which is highly appreciated well done front desk I am staying again I just checked in the same room category

438125,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Not much to be honest The place is pricey but the premium you pay is worth it for the quiet and superior staff experience If I had one issue it would be a small one The bathrooms and showers are quite poor Freezing cold floors and low pressure showers Only a minor issue though I guess the other problem I had was the same as about 50 of the other hotels I ve stayed at Water I don t think hotels realize how much good will they can generate by providing a small bottle of water for free Instead of making me pay 5 for a small bottle from the mini bar They made 10 in total from me from that but it cost them a perfect score They get everything else right though , I m very fussy about my hotel being quiet everywhere I go This hotel was one of the quietest I ve ever been to It was fantastic Staff went above and beyond at one point Actual 5 star service from them The Nespresso coffee machine in each room is absolutely fantastic You don t realize how important this is if you don t have one at home Nice touch Small but important

438173,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We found abussive the price for breakfast 26 if at least they would have 2 types of breakfast options We like to have breakfast but not at that price , Really nice and big rooms Great bathroom and shower Wish ibwould have stayed longer Good wifi and really helpful staff
438174,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakafast is standard service efficient and smooth yet no personal interacton from anyone over four days water in shower was warm rather than hot So nothing screamingly wrong yet all contributed to it feeling just ok Did what it was meant to but no more , Very clean great strength of complimentary wifi 
438175,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Everything was great nothing to dislike , The staff is amazing Everyone was friendly and willing to help Located in central Amsterdam close to the Dam but in a quite area which was refreshing after being out in the city and noise all day There is a famous coffee shop on the same block This hotel is a great location and a place I will stay from this point going forward in Amsterdam The wifi is great as well 
438176,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing really found accommodation in Amsterdam generally expensive and this was one of the most expensive hotels we stayed in over several weeks in Europe Also they are currently renovating and there was some noise nothing at night or early morning , Had a junior suite which worked well for us parents and 17 year old Quite spacious and comfortable beds Good location for easy walking to lots of attractions Breakfast very good We also ate one night in the hotel restaurant and although perhap a little more expensive than surrounding places was very good food and service
438177,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, They are undergoing construction but when I had trouble sleeping in the afternoon jet lag they swiftly moved me to the top floor , Excellent location Rooms are so comfortable and booking com listed excellent prices day of Only intended to stay for 1 night but it was so comfortable I extended my stay to 3 
438178,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The carpets smell awful The hotel management should do something about it It hits you the minute you step out of the elevator and gets worse as you enter the room , cosy little hotel by dam and 5 munutes walk from shopping area Comfortable little sitting area at hotel entrance with coffee facilities Great staff and concierge makes you feel really welcome We got a great roomrate of 100 Eur per night for doubke room so real value for money Room service very convenient but quite pricy 
438179,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, There was nothing not to like At the time of our visit they were renovating the reception area but wouldnt put me off returning to the hotel , A very central hotel Helpful staff Very clean Our room a junior suite on the 3rd floor was lovely 
438180,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, There was a very noisy sounds from working inside the hotel every morning They should not book for people during these days Very bad experience , Location
438181,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Staff in general were not the most courteous and cheerfull people I have met It was hard to get a hello or a thank you off from them Front of the Building was being refurbished so we payed extra for a room upgrade and what we got was a window with a construction site view 306 Not to mention drillers at 09 am , Location was great Can walk everywhere Newly refurbished room
438182,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast extremely expensive for what was on offer not included in our booking so paid the 26 euro price Workmen were noisey at times during our stay , Location quality and cleanliness of the room 
438183,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The shock of having to pay upfront money for a deposit wasn t aware of that Luckily the staff made us a deal which was more comfortable with us due to the trip being a cheap short getaway , Lovely rooms friendly staff very helpful great location relaxed atmosphere 
438184,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, The location is within walking distance from the dam square Rooms are okay and hotel staff are friendly It was my first time to stay there and I would stay there again in my next visit 
438185,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Unfortunately it was a little noisy and there was scaffolding and work taking place diretly outside the room Hopefully that won t be there for too long ,No Positive
438186,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We didn t like the fact that although We asked for a twin room with canal view we given a double room we really had to stretch our necks to see the canal which actually ran along the end of the road we complained and were offered a twin room but no canal view no reduction in price therefore low value for money score , We liked the fact that although only a short walk from dam square it was very quiet 
438187,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, For the first night we had a wonderful room with a huge bed and TV But in the early morning we were waken up around 7 am because of the noise from construction works I called to reception they said that they are sorry and they stopped it for a while Then it started again and with new power After that our room was changed but I was not in the hotel till the late evening and when I came I found out that our new room is 50 smaller and the bed smaller too as well as it had shower instead of a bathtube and old Tv And when I called them again I was told that our room was upgraded to business though it s worth than a regular one In the end they didn t change me a room saying that they have only rooms with twin beds left So we were not satisfied with our stay at all , The room where we were allocated was awesome thought it didn t last long 
438188,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The only thing missing was that breakfast was not included in the rate we chose , The location of the hotel was great not far from Dam Square The rooms were fairly large with nice d cor and comfortable beds I particularly liked the pillow menu where you could choose your preferred pillow type such a lovely touch I would definitely stay again and would highly recommend o 
438189,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Two weeks before arival we made an upgrade to a room with breakfast included but this was not communicated to the staff at the breakfast desk No problem the first morning this was resolved with a call at the reception Annoying that we had to repeat this on the second morning when the staff again had no knowledge about the upgrade and we again had to wait until this was clarified Bad internal communication , The hotel is centrally located but not too near to red light district Business class is recommended for people who prefer quiet rooms 
438190,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Overpriced rooms Business Class not close to the ones presented in the pictures , Good location close to the city center Quiet rooms good breakfast 
438191,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Again the mini bar extortionate prices Remember to bring your own into room at night I had a snickers bottle of water and mini box of pringles that cost me 15 , Everything apart from mini bar prices Bottle of water 5 
438192,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, No bath robes in the room rang reception a couple of times but never received them through our 3 night stay For my first time in amsterdam I didn t know you had to pay city tax which I think every hotel should tell there customer , Room was lovely clean Fresh bath towels every day and Not far from everything I am writing reviews for a local Manchester paper about hotels in Amsterdam Radisson blu will get a good review
438193,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Hotel incorrectly pre authorised my debit card for 900 taking funds from my account When paying the bill funds taken from my account could not be used to settle the bill meaning we had to pay the bill twice Took a week for funds to be refunded to my account Completely unacceptable , Location was good 
438194,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Unhelpful Reception staff even bordering on rude My sick 82 year old diabetic mother had to wait over 5 hours in the lobby when no rooms were available and still had to line up to check in when rooms were available despite having done all the paperwork already In the morning the Receptionist was downright rude and unhelpful when asked for help to chase an airport transfer which hadn t arrived We would not stay here again ,No Positive
438195,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing to say here, Excellent Wifi connection perfect attention in the reception very comfortable room big bathroom with good water pressureand temperature Radisson never fail for us

438197,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel bar was nice however it was very expensive and that is why no one really used it if the prices were lower people would use it I think, The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was good
438198,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, bed a little hard breakfast not included in the price, good central location quiet nice extras like nespresso machine and this works toiletries 
438199,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Central location close to bars restaurants and attractions Help staff a very good breakfast Excellent service from waiting staff lovely fresh food with a wide variety Really liked the bar area and lobby Staff all spoke very good English Really liked that we could drop off luggage with concierge before check in and after check out Could not fault this hotel would recommend and stay in again 
438200,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, we ordered food at the lobby restaurant and it took so long for them to deliver and it was not delicious Got to improve on this aspect Otherwise it would have been a perfect stay ,No Positive
438201,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, We found ourselves stuck in Amsterdam due to a cancelled flight and the Radisson Blu were excellent hosts even upgrading us to Junior Suites as we clearly were looking unhappy having been stranded The staff were excellent and the facilities and location fantastic 
438202,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, 2 of us but room only had one bathrobe only one sachet of chocolate 2 of tea quantities fine if one person is staying not for 2 On commenting on this the staff member noted what we said but didn t seem interested in trying to please us yes we could have ordered more but we arrived late and very tired if the room is for 2 people it should be stocked as such Also request for fresh milk and travel adapter nothing happened for 20 minutes had to ring again to get service ,No Positive
438203,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The light coming in from the street into the bathroom then into the room kept us awake first night , Amazing staff great food and the cleanest hotel I have ever been to 
438204,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, On the last night we were woken at 3 30am by voices and the TV from next door but we were given a refund of 100 to compensate so all was well , The Junior Suite we had was fabulous Loads of storage a clean and well equipped bathroom comfy beds Great choice of food at breakfast too 
438205,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We stayed in one of the recently renovated superior double rooms which was great and whilst the bathroom was clean there was a slight odour around the toilet My first impression was that the bathroom had not had a refurb when the rest of the room had , Staff and location excellent Great hotel in the centre of Amsterdam but also in a quiet street 
438206,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I would prefer the shower to be separate from the bath and hotel bar pricey, The location was excellent dam square was only a couple blocks away Anne frank museum and the red light district was also a short walk staff very helpful the hotel was busy but no noise at night The room was very clean and each day the staff did a great job at refreshing the room 
438207,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Recently visited Amsterdam with my mother sister and enjoyed staying at the Raddison Blu Our room was a junior suite and it was nice a spacious the beds where so comfy the bathroom was beautiful Our breakfast was included and we enjoyed a cooked breakfast along with pastries and tea coffee freshly squeezed orange juice 
438208,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Poor insulation all the noise from the lobby was heard in the room at night Far away from trams buses Dark lanes to get to from the hotel did not feel safe at night ,No Positive
438209,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Due to time difference clocks changing we got locked out of our rooms before checkout , The rooms were a great size so comfy Great location to see all the sights
438210,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Concierge with poor education and of course rude , I had a very pleasant night at radisson I arrived there after a long day and when I left the day after I was very relaxed
438211,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Bar was very dark and understaffed for such a busy weekend but the one lady in the bar was cheery bless her , Position and very helpful doormen Breakfast was the best ever 
438212,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Staff could have been friendlier and the cleaner came in at 8am randomly , The interior was lovely Good concierge and good room size Quiet but central Would return and recommend 
438213,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Check was slow taking over half an hour Service at the bar on Saturday night took forever as only two staff on , Location Nice rooms and great breakfast 
438214,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, there was 1 guy on the bar on the sat evening a young guy in his 20 s he could not have been more rude if he tried he wasa the most ignorant person we met our whole trip ,No Positive
438215,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Found the temperature air conditioning control a little puzzling Breakfast a bit too expensive for the non business traveller to consider , Large comfortable room Good TV choice for English speakers Nice bar and restaurant in lobby 
438216,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Very friendly and obliging staff who allow you to be flexible in taking meals where and when you wish etc Clean and comfortable room a good breakfast and choice of bar or restaurant for dinner 
438217,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing, Excellent hotel in central location Rooms very clean and well maintained and quality fit out Staff allowed an early check in which was great 
438218,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Nothing bad reception staff ultra efficient but not overly friendly with waiters cleaning staff it s the other way round A bigger comfortable lounge for coffee would have been welcome after eating out but that s being a bit picky , Excellent location efficient staff and overall good facilities
438219,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, 1 Despite having requested early check in via e mail and after flying all night and arriving at the hotel we were made to wait until 3 pm sleeping in the lobby supposedly because the hotel had been full the previous night Once we FINALLY got in the room dead tired the carpet had not even been vacuumed and there were other minor things not ready 2 While we were waiting to check in we had checked our luggage with the porter When we went to pick it up the porter could not find our bags and he took us to where checked bags were stored in a stack out in the open of a parking garage open to the street 3 We booked and paid for a suite which by definition should be two rooms but the room was really just one room with a revolving TV at the end of the bed apparently to divide the room 4 Entering the room especially with luggage we took our own since everything in this hotel took forever to get done was hazardous Upon entry there were immediate sidewinder steps down into the room 5 There was a large dangerous unlit step up into the bathroom which only had one sink for the entire suite 6 The room was small with little walking area 7 To be brief the liquor at the bar and restaurant was automatically metered and the drinks were expensive and weak 8 There was a larger building across the street from the lobby also part of the hotel which looked better than where we were placed In essence I have stayed at many Radisson Blu brand hotels and this one simply did not measure up , 1 The location was quiet 2 The food in the restaurant was reasonably priced and fairly good 
438220,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Got a very expensive room which was deceiving as I thought the balcony would be overlooking the canals and the view was awful Would have never paid that much for a room without a view Plus it was in a different building across the street using a tunnel to connect and couldn t exit from building I was in fire hazard , The location was easy to find and close to everything a tourist would want 
438221,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, On arrival Stephanie recommended we upgrade to business class with breakfast The extra Euro 60 per night per room was not worth it , Location and room cleanliness
438222,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast just not good enough for a 4 star Radisson Blu Not enough staff at peak times not good enough range of foods and no egg service that s worthwhile the chef is never there , Location
438223,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Had trouble finding Hotel It was nice being close to centrum but difficult to navigate by taxi but would stay there again , Friendly staff very helpful great breakfast but very crowded
438224,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Only one elevator was working all week which isn t enough for a hotel this size , Great central but quiet location Super breakfast It isn t cheap but delivers for the price 
438225,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, We had booked A Junior Suite and an Amsterdam Suite and both were given in a different wing Would have preferred to be closer The Junior suite was a bit tight would have preferred more space , Nice hotel and Warm floor in the bathroom Plus good quality of Toiletries supplied Nice Concierge who was ever willing to assist and guide A nice Pub in the Hotel It was so nicely done and the ambiance was superb 
438226,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Air conditioning didn t really work they didn t change my sheets the whole time I stayed there , Conveniently located to transportation and dam square 
438227,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Room windows on the inside of the building make u feel like ur at an indoor swimming pool with the typical acoustics and humid warm air flowing in Service is really automated and impersonal Lots and lots of American tourists being processed all the time I m pretty sure they get a bad wage and a lot of stress , Location is okay and for the price we paid we got a fairly decent room 
438228,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, I find that the hotel could have more access facilities to dam square perhaps a shuttle service from the hotel at two fixed times a day would help , Overall room quality was very good
438229,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Parking fees were horific 55 euro per day but then if your dumb enought to take a car into central Amsterdam you deserve it, Hotel staff were very helpful and considearte especially Louis
438230,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, There are no drawers or shelves in the room on which to place clothes etc for my 9 day stay though the hotel helped out by bringing some shelves I was surprised at the sudden hike in room charge for Friday Saturday even though I stayed for 9 days , Location breakfast general mood inside the hotel
438231,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Only 1 lift seemed to be in operation during my stay and it took ages to come down to and from the ground floor The stairs don t seem to exist despite this everything else was so perfect , Booked a standard room and received a free room upgrade to a Superior room Staff were lovely
438232,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Check in was a nightmare and rooms overpriced for what they are , Some excellent service from some staff and from Marjo in particular with advice about a great place to eat in Amsterdam that met our specified requirements 
438233,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Did not use booking com to order a walk in shower Changed room at no cost for this Amsterdam always so busy with tourists difficult to get around , Excellent hotel Central location so most places within walking distance Use Amsterdacard for public transport and access to museums it pays for itself severaltimes over 
438234,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Perfect as usual Concierge system is great and very helpful to store your luggage untile check in time or after check out time Staff is nice and extremely helpful the room is spacious very comfortable bathroom also on expectations Everything very clean There is also a pleasant pub in the hotel and also a small shop inside for last minute souvenirs 
438235,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, no pool, Location was good Rooms where clean and bed comfortable requested extra pillows they asked type and delivered to room really quickly Staff at breakfast lovely really smiling and helpful
438236,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Slightly unhelpful staff when it came to paying the bill Overly complex process which caused us stress as a group of 4 who wanted to pay separately It was sorted eventually but not entirely to our satisfaction Hotel bar prices were ridiculous so recommended going outside for drinks and food Decor in the outdoors indoors hotel lobby was bizarre and could use updating , Well located in a small quiet street within easy walking distance of some lovely cafes and bars 3 coffee shops within a stones throw of the hotel no pun intended We found it a little too easy to stumble into the nearby red light district at first but once you get your bearings it s fine Well equipped rooms with everything we needed and as always the personal pillow menu 
438237,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The bed could have been a little larger and the room could have handled it Otherwise the room was well appointed , The location the modern clean lines and that we had a small balcony 
438238,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The breakfast could have been warmer although the selection of food was good , The staff were curious and extremely helpful the service was excellent the hotel was very clean and comfortable great location 
438239,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, They need a bell boy to help with the luggage of guest, The free wifi was simply fantastic and the location was great Close to almost everything you want to see in the centrum yet far enough from the noise
438240,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Staff of the hotel are so rude if you got late in check out even if it s 30 min they will come to your room and kik you out no matter what , Location
438241,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Toilet too cramped Door knob not easy to turn poor design Too expensive , Strategic location 10 mins to shopping areas tourist attractions and plenty of restaurants serving various cuisine
438242,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The hotel seemed a bit tired in need of a facelift , The location was very convenient and our room was very nicely appointed modern and very comfortable 
438243,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The space in the closet is rather small and not sufficient for a couple staying a week , The location of the hotel not far from the Central station and most of the important sites to visit and yet quiet and not crowded The interior design The value for money The staff client orientation 
438244,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam,No Negative, Staff very helpful especially after noisy kids running about late at night early morning We were moved to a quieter area of the hotel and also given an upgrade
438245,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast ridiculously expensive at 26 50 lots of places for breakfast within easy walking distance, Room and bathroom very clean excellent water pressure wifi reception better than average good quiet location 
438246,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Breakfast room insufficient for all guests we had to queue up for 15 minutes Never had this experience in any other decent hotel , Location is perfect Neighborhoods very nice
438247,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, No Parking service was available Had to park in a parking garage 10 minutes away from the hotel Requested rooms to be connected or opposite each other and did not get this Stayed for 1 night and Hotel was not flexible to extend late check out to one of the rooms till 3 pm though we checked in late in the evening , The room was clean The location is great They offered the use the gym utilities for the whole since they could not extend late checkout to us 
438248,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, hotel may be too close to the heart of the smoking and adult areas of the city 2 3 streets away for some families but can be easilly avoided , well placed hotel easy to find and accomodating staff we accidentally broke a bedside lamp whilst making the bed and notified the staff rather than a negative response they were very understanding and agreed not to take any further action wonderful hotel and cannot reccomend enough 
438249,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The booking com listing did not mention that one of the beds in a triple room was a sofa bed Any hotel in this price range should not expect guests to sleep on a sofa bed , Breakfast was fantastic The service at the hotel set the bar higher than ever before The location was excellent 
438250,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Reception in the beginning I had requested for early check in but it was ignored and their behaviour was terrible The lady attending me was good but her senior behaviour was not acceptable, Hotel was very comfortable A perfect home away from home
438251,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, WiFi was not working when I arrived but it was fixed really quick and worked great for the whole trip , I really liked the business room the location and the prompt response service from the front desk 
438252,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Bathtub was VERY dangerous There is no handle bar to hold on to Very hard to get into for a shower and easy to slip De Palmboom was disappointing Very pretty d cor but food was mediocre and expensive and service was haphazard , Staff were very friendly and helpful Our room was of a high quality 
438253,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Poor shower pressure Barman cynically tried to short change us giving change from Euro 10 instead of Euro20 He knew he had been caught out , Great location Nice bright room and clean Facilities to hold luggage
438254,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Paying a 57 cash deposit for the minibar at the arrival is like welcoming you by saying Welcome Mr Thief worst impression ever , Quit and very central location 
438255,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, Price of drinks in bar , Great location Lovely room we had a junior suite Staff friendly and helpful Great breakfast Lovely restaurant Planning to go back would definitely recommend 
438256,Radisson Blu Hotel Amsterdam, The car park is quite small so make sure if you take a car that you book well ahead We did this and I found the confirmation process easy and straight forward , Excellent hotel Good location for Amsterdam really very central and close to all the attractions as well as copious bars and restaurants Superb breakfast Facilities are more than adequate Overall the price was good and is on a par with what one might expect in London or any other international city destination
