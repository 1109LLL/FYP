462182,NH Amsterdam Centre, Stayed at this hotel three years ago and had a fantastic stay that s why I didn t mind paying over 700 pound this time around for only four nights That is a lot of money to spend on a room for a short stay Phoned room service which is meant to be 24 7 and theh had nothing to eat so actually had to phone a take away service for food as the mini fridge did not get re stocked or did the coffees and teas for the room Phoned down for extra and there was none Facilities just weren t good this time at all When paying that amount of money for a good hotel you expect to have coffee in the room and room service when it says Don t think I ll be staying again as even the staff were rude when complainging polity when I was checking out The amount of money I spent and all they could offer me was a free breakfast buffet if I stayed again when I couldn t even order myself food when I was there in the first place , Location is excellent
462183,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Lovely hotel very friendly and welcoming staff It was the third NH hotel during our trip I admire Everywhere was organized at the highest level Thank you 
462184,NH Amsterdam Centre, The staff were very busy and there was typically a line in the lobby The pillows were very lumpy Everything could use a good cleaning , The breakfast buffet was wonderful They had omelets and a self service espresso machine that would make a late at the touch of a button The location was perfect We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see Boat tours picked up right across the canal Many great restaurants were within a 10 min walk The garden was a fun place to let our child run and play 
462185,NH Amsterdam Centre, The bathroom was so small in my room you had to shut the door behind you to do anything brushing teeth one at a time etc , The hotel is in a great location and on the Schiphol 197 express buss route The staff were brilliant so friendly and helpful The whole hotel is kept to a very clean standard you feel good when you walk in We were lucky to have a lovely sunny day 27 degrees the air conditioning worked perfectly so we had a lovely cool nights sleep The fitness facility s are really good however the there are a lot of rules which are not mentioned on the website 
462186,NH Amsterdam Centre, I didn t like that the staff didn t tell me or guest I was with that they had a garden and I didn t like the way some staff members was looking at me and my friends the energy from them was not a nice feeling but the place was okay, The garden was nice but they could off had it open at night for guests for them to smoke
462187,NH Amsterdam Centre, Quality of room well worn and needed an update One of the lifts made a very loud banging noise at every floor every time it was used this was heard in our room and made it impossible to sleep We were moved after 2 nights to an equally well worn room The bathroom hadn t been properly cleaned when we checked in Used soap and open toiletries in the shower and the sink did not drain at all so the plug was pulled out by someone and left is the sink It still didn t drain Multiple spot lights out in both bathrooms All round shabby , Good location
462188,NH Amsterdam Centre, The power to my room cut out twice when I boiled the kettle the hotel had it back on very quickly but still it makes you wonder and there was a lot of construction going on immediately in front of the hotel which meant taxis and cars couldn t pull into the hotel and there was some noise and disruption associated with that , Location was good bathroom was small with shower over the bath which can be an issue for some people who are mobility challenged but with plenty of hot water 
462189,NH Amsterdam Centre, The hotel is very weathered Stains all over the carpets and furniture They had to change our room 2 times due to water damage and mold issues There was always dishes and beer bottles in the hallways ,No Positive
462190,NH Amsterdam Centre, Parking in Amsterdam is expensive and the hotel doesn t provide parking Cheapest we could find was 20 Euros per day free Sunday s This was quite a long walk from the hotel , We had a large comfortable room with good sized en suite Staff were very helpful and the hotel is in a good location to explore Amsterdam 
462191,NH Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast was good usual continental selection but on reflection I wouldn t pay for that again as the local eateries are that good and open really early There are many cafes bakeries and restaurants that serve breakfast relatively cheap , Location was spot on Close enough to travel everywhere by foot also good tram and bus links with a bike rental shop just a few minutes walk away Far enough away from the busy area for a good night s sleep 
462192,NH Amsterdam Centre, The room was very dated and shabby Stained furniture ripped curtains window sealed with duck tape Cigarette ends outside window Not what I expected from a 4 hotel Not described accurately on the web site Certainly not worth the money Breakfast wasn t worth 25 either , Location
462193,NH Amsterdam Centre, The AC didn t work in both the rooms that we had booked on the day we stayed had to cancel one of the rooms that my friend was supposed to stay my room AC also didn t work and when i called for assistance the lady who came already had a small Fan in her hand when she entered the room and then said we didn t know that the AC wasn t working how did she know to bring the Fan along when asked anyone can repair it she said its a weekend so we dont have anyone until monday A Star Hotel saying this reason is unbelievable so we slept that day in the same room because there was no other vacancy with the small Fan next day we were moved to another room which again didn t work with the AC overnight and it got heated up to 26 C again complained the manager on the day was helpful and tried to move us to an other room by evening better one of the Lot so in a nutshell we were moved to 3 different rooms in 3 days Not really impressed at all , GREAT LOCATION EASY ACCESS TO MANY ATTRACTIONS FROM HERE CAN WALK GOOD RESTAURANTS PUBS AROUND PUBLIC TRANSPORT OUTSIDE THE HOTEL 
462194,NH Amsterdam Centre, There should be more repairs and changes in the bathroom especially the showers is very complicated and not a good type More newer and modern furniture will be a plus Room was small and I guess this is the case in most of Amsterdam hotel, Location was great and close to the bus and tram stops Hotel staff are nice and amazing Price deal which I got 2 weeks prior to my stay was great Room was clean and neat AC was perfect
462195,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Breakfast is excellent the staff always happy and very helpful and we arrive before the check in and we want the room early to go to bed because of the jet lag and he give us our room at 10h00 in the morning thanks very much it was very appreciate The location is perfect around everything I definitely return to this place
462196,NH Amsterdam Centre, If you are travelling with pet the staff might stress you out i payed 20 euros for my dog a really tiny dog and first they told me im not allowed to leave my dog alone in the room after trying to explain i ve booked some tickets to some museums they said i have to keep my dog in a cage and that also applies to when we go for breakfast very dissapointed abou the pet policy rooms are very small comparing to what i ve booked on Booking the room is not part of a 4star hotel Rather a 2 3 star hotel, It is very close to everything 20 min walk and you are in the centre of the city 
462197,NH Amsterdam Centre, The temperature in the room was too hot the air con didn t work so we had to turn off and open the window to get some air in at night The room was okay size wise but not very well cleaned The bathroom tiny and hot Basic but certainly not 4 star Breakfast good but expensive at 25 ,No Positive
462198,NH Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast not worth the money but diningroom was clean and well run, The staff were fantastic it was a birthday celebration and they decorated our room with balloons and bunting fantastic customer service everybody was so friendly 
462199,NH Amsterdam Centre, The bath plug and other small things were not working When I asked the cleaner he apologised and said everything is old in the hotel unfortunately The price we paid at our time of stay was not what we booked in for through booking and not worth having basic accessories that do not work in the room , The staff were friendly and the bar is good they make a lovely hot chocolate 
462200,NH Amsterdam Centre, The hotel was very overpriced for what it was Breakfast was expensive with not a lot of choices offered The breakfast room seemed understaffed and lacking in items such as plates and cutlery and restocking of food items was very slow The concierge desk was sporadically staffed leaving the reception when there was staff available to handle enquiries Whilst it was not an over all bad experience there were certainly more minuses than pluses and we do not feel it merits the rating it has , The only redeeming feature of this hotel were the bar staff Lambere and Simeon who made the whole experience enjoyable 
462201,NH Amsterdam Centre, If breakfast was not included you could not eat at cafe except paying 25 each We walked to the little pancake house across the street and had a wonderful meal for lots less , Great location
462202,NH Amsterdam Centre, We paid for a standard room with a view First they gave us room 607 which had the view partially blocked due to the architecture of the building We requested a change and were placed in room 307 which had a clear view However both rooms had old furniture which looks a little depressing The breakfast buffet was good with the exception of the scrambled eggs which were tasteless One morning breakfast was being served till 11am and when we arrived at 10 20 am alot of items like cold cuts fresh fruit and pastries were finished and not being replaced which I thought was rude since a few other guests were walking in , I liked the convenience of taking bus 197 from the airport to the hotel for 10 euros for 2 people The bus stops across the street from the hotel 
462203,NH Amsterdam Centre, Wooden flooring means that you can hear people moving about in the rooms above Annoying when they are obviously packing for an early flight, Very quiet despite central location
462204,NH Amsterdam Centre, the tax i needed to pay at the end , location was great very close to the big casino car rental parking shopping resturants musem everything yo can ask for and more staff are very helpfull and happy to help 
462205,NH Amsterdam Centre, Rooms could be updated floors in the room were badly chipped and scored bathrooms are very small so small you could run a bath run the sink taps while on the toilet minor flaws I know I just want to give as honest a review as possible breakfast is well catered really suited for small familys or a couple looking for a quiet break dam spuare is about 10 to 15 minute walk with alot of restaurants shops and sites along the way or a tram or bus ride directly to the spuare right outside the hotel door , I loved that it was just beside a main park and across the street hat a nice area for bars and resteraunts and the bus and tram were outside the front of the hotel
462206,NH Amsterdam Centre, Hotel charged an upgrade fee from standard to superior room was told this as well as daily rate for a superior room for that night but receptionist failed to mention this to me so the final bill amount was surprising Superior room floor required a good clean but nevertheless was happy to be in a spacious room , A super hotel in a great location Breakfast was delicious lots of choice available Standard room was not very spacious therefore changed rooms after first night Upgraded to superior room It was very spacious with good facilities 
462207,NH Amsterdam Centre, Hardwood floor covering in the bedroom was a little chilly over a cold Easter visit , Excellent breakfast with huge variety of choice Staff worked hard to cater for the large number of people Location perfect for the museums and canal boats Plenty of trams the No 1 line you can catch right outside the hotel to the centre of Amsterdam and it only takes 10 minutes or so 
462208,NH Amsterdam Centre, The communication between the reception s officers was in confusion There was no control in their contact with their client so in morning they asked a certain point from us and in the afternoon they asked something different No professional behaviour against their clients , The location was ideal the
462209,NH Amsterdam Centre, Room was drab and in need of refurbishment especially the bathroom which had a cracked and stained ceiling Peculiar smell in the corridor of our floor and in the stairwell did not make a good first impression Not worth the price paid ,No Positive
462210,NH Amsterdam Centre, Room Iminitially booked smelled badly as if someone was smoking before decided to buy an upgrade and got a nice and silent room, Very nice breakfat buffet silent room to the backyard
462211,NH Amsterdam Centre, The reciption lady told us at the time of chick in that the third person will get free extra bed but he needs to pay 320 80 per night for staying I confirmed again that the price of the extra bed is free she said yes i told her if the 320 please let me know because i do not want it in this case She again confirmed that the 320 is not for the bed Upon our check out we found that this charge was for the extra bed and it was optional which we could have avoided They agreed that it was their mistake and they didn t deal with the case professionally , Room service is so fast
462212,NH Amsterdam Centre, Honestly I can t say one negative thing , Excellent location in the museum district walking distance to the Rijksmuseum Van Gogh museum Concertgebouw Safe pretty area Also very near the blue line boat tours for taking a canal cruise Elegant modern interiors Clean fresh rooms and modern bathrooms Fantastic breakfast buffet worth every penny 
462213,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The location of the hotel was great close to shopping streets and short walk to the museums It is easily accessible from the Schipol airport by Bus 197 and close to tram stops Was served by Marian during check in and she was a gem She noticed that we are a family with 2 young children and quickly offered to put an extra bed in the room Thank you for making our stay in Amsterdam a pleasant and memorable one 
462214,NH Amsterdam Centre, Standard room comfortably for solo traveller but may be a little small for long term stay for two Beware of cycle lane immediately outside the Hotel can catch tourists unaware , Warm welcome from reception team efficient service and informative with local information Perfectly located for touristic attractions and business activity Comfortable rooms with windows generoulsy opening fully allowing fresh air into the room a bonus when you ve been travelling all day 
462215,NH Amsterdam Centre, Nothing, Very warm welcome by the staff Room was very clean and spacious and had a great view We stayed on the 4th floor corner room Location is excellent Right next to Vondelpark 
462216,NH Amsterdam Centre, Quite expensive however it was similar to other prices in Amsterdam We asked for a quiet room but were put on the 2nd floor at the front of the hotel so the the noise from the street ie public transport stops was rediculous between 1 and 6am I could hear it through my earplugs , Great location near to museums easy walk into town 10 15mins great shopping streets close by airport bus for 5 outside the hotel great eateries such as Hard Rock Wagamamas Italian and a few others to choose from Very friendly staff Good breakfast 
462217,NH Amsterdam Centre, Room size and facilities on expensive side but it is centre well close to of Amsterdam, Good location Within walking distance of concert venue Plenty restaurants around to choose from so eat drink before or after concert possible Parking close by but expensive Museums close at hand through park 
462218,NH Amsterdam Centre, on arriving were sent to a room which had been used by previous visitors Bed had been sat on dirty coffee cups rubbish in bin and on the surface Reception had sent us to a room change without telling housekeeping We were transferred to a smaller room at back of hotel Very small and tired looking room Chipped old painted furniture and tired wallpaper Mould in grouting in bathroom bathroom need a steam clean The toilet was placed in such a small cramped space was hardly room to use it Tea and coffee was not replaced daily The tiny piece of soap was not replaced as it became a slither Pillows were different shapes and sizes The view was directly into the Hillfiger offices to the rear Breakfast was so expensive we gave it a miss The redeeming point was the friendly attitude of both housekeeping and reception staff throughout our stay A standard room may well be basic and have less features but should still be fresh bright inviting and have all the comforts for a restful stay The rooms need upgrading , Only staff at reception
462219,NH Amsterdam Centre, I brought my daughter who works in Amsterdam to breakfast one morning and I thought the charge of 25 Euros was excessive The room was advertised as having a view and that was somewhat of an exaggeration , Staff were very friendly attentative no helpful 
462220,NH Amsterdam Centre, Staff were not the best and very stuck up they also wouldn t provide extra duvets even though the room was cold , The rooms were very clean and well kept The location was good and near the trams 
462221,NH Amsterdam Centre, The staff were rude unhelpful and tried to charge things to our room that wasn t right They also only gave us 13euros back from a 50euro deposit because of city tax which was wrong and they only gave back the right amount of money once confronted So please make sure you check your room bill There is alot of building and road work going on outside so it can be loud and also it s not a pretty site , The place was lovely and great location 
462222,NH Amsterdam Centre, Super noisy I could barely sleep a couple of bours every night during my stay unfriendly staff dirty room and bad overall cleanliness very very slow wifi the slowest I have ever seen even the premium wifi that I paid for was very bad and I could not make a proper conference call I would never recommend this hotel to anyone , The location is the only thing that is worth it 
462223,NH Amsterdam Centre, Your taxi company is not good My driver to Schiphol was Michael and neither your staff nor Michael told me that he could not take a credit card The cost of 42 is too much and I overpaid him as I did not have enough and gave him and He wanted me to go downstairs in Schiphol and get This will put me off staying at your hotel again ,No Positive
462224,NH Amsterdam Centre, To noisy to many young travellers Gym not opened a lot of hours and limited to 8 people My toilet smelled urine The rooms where older than the image it provided on internet , staff was nice
462225,NH Amsterdam Centre, Access card not working everyday and reception had to reset it daily Very small room and hardly fitting path room View was not good at all Room had a smell in first day of stay, Location is great
462226,NH Amsterdam Centre, room flooring was coming out along with the edge of the wallpaper shower head was rusty Two single bed quilts in a queen size bed , friendly staff great location
462227,NH Amsterdam Centre, The situation with the massage was confusing two different companies with different working hours needed appointment the day before , Very nice hotel perfectly located 
462228,NH Amsterdam Centre, Our room was not ready by 3 or 4 or later than that so in the end we went out for the night and only accessed our room at 11pm, Hotel was lovely Beds were not comfy and pillows awful The cost of breakfast was extremely expensive 
462229,NH Amsterdam Centre, No where did it say on the site that I found that a 50 security deposit was needed at the hotel Unexpected payment to hand over on top off paying for the hotel when we arrived Staff were helpful but a little slow , Bed was extra comfy and room was spotless
462230,NH Amsterdam Centre, the hotel is simply very outdated as in everything the outside looks modern the inside with everything looks like 20 years old could not get the heating to work at all it needs urgent up to date furnishings , nice staff clean room location
462231,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Excellent location room was really comfortable and extremely clean staff very helpful Luggage storage room for when we arrived before check in and also for when we checked out
462232,NH Amsterdam Centre, Was not made aware of city tax 8 per room Was not made aware of room deposits 50 per room I am aware I get this back but it was a massive inconvenience had no electric in my room and was locked out my room on numerous occasions as the card key would not work , Lovely staff very friendly and helpful 
462233,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The location of the hotel was great particularly as the Airport bus stops right outside the door Also the trams are not far away to take you into the centre of Amsterdam The hotel staff were excellent very welcoming friendly and efficient The room was cleaned every day and was spotless Special mention of Maarten one of the barmen great guy good sense of humour 
462234,NH Amsterdam Centre, There was odd lighting in the room no main light but a couple of side lamps which didn t light up the room properly and as a result was dark and a bit depressing The room was very small only really had the bed and a desk in it and the view was terrible just a concrete yard and building , Tasty breakfasts comfortable bed 
462235,NH Amsterdam Centre, Breakfast dining area is too small therefore often very crowded Variety of food for breakfast is smaller than in other NH hotels Plus due to small dining space and many people food quickly disappeared and required regular refilling Taking into account the price of the breakfast I am not sure if the breakfast provides value for money ,No Positive
462236,NH Amsterdam Centre, Had room 635 Very disappointed Window handle broken off and window screwed at top Breeze blowing at end of window all night Bed jammed up at wall Very difficult for second person getting in and out of bed Did complain on day one and told it was the way building was built If I wanted upgrade would have to pay more had booked two rooms and expected both would be the same When checking out was given an upgrade voucher for a future use This did not help and I have to say could whole experience in hotel disappointing, Breakfast was excellent great choice of food
462237,NH Amsterdam Centre, Can t find a fault worth writing on here , Great hotel Perfect location for the Leidseplein Loads of bars restaurants and shops Lots to do Definitely consider this hotel next time I m in Amsterdam 
462238,NH Amsterdam Centre, The hotel could do better with the smoking area outside as it was littered and it s at the front entrance and the dustbin at the main entrance could be larger as it was overflowing at times and cleaned periodically especially when they have large number of tours coming in , The staff is excellent and very hospitable
462239,NH Amsterdam Centre, I forgot a wireless mouse on the room s desk by the TV and they claim it was not found Surely the cleaning woman must have seen it after our departure but nevertheless it was never recovered , Free coffee in the morning
462240,NH Amsterdam Centre, Liked everything no complaints whatsoever , We got an upgrade to a King Size room wich was awesome and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly Totally going to come back great experience 
462241,NH Amsterdam Centre, Had booked a double room for myself and my partner upon arrival I was told they only had single bed I ended up paying an extra 15 per night to upgrade to a double bed seems like a bit of a scam for this reason I would not stay again, Clean and comfortable hotel
462242,NH Amsterdam Centre, Everything was great thanks, Really central between museums and down town Facilities are comfortable really nice bed what stands out is the Staff as we had a problem with next door smokers and they immediately moved us to another room also wanted to check out late and they gave us a hand with that overall really nice experience
462243,NH Amsterdam Centre, They took my money without permission 150USD smoking fee because I was smoked a few cigarets in the room without telling me anything about this rule What a insolence My first hotel that I saw such an ugly customer service , Not relevant 
462244,NH Amsterdam Centre, The room was to hot couldn t turn down we opened the window but the noise kept us awake the air con work in my daughter room when we spoke to the reception she said it didn t work as it was cold out side ,No Positive
462245,NH Amsterdam Centre, When I booked I asked specifically for a quiet room because I needed a good rest after 5 days of work in Amsterdam I was given a room at the first floor between the ice machine and the entrance of the Mariott on the street Those 5 nights were hell i could not sleep I told the friendly reception people and they told me I could have a better room higher in the floors but more expensive they just don t care the room was not fresh the cleaning approximative found a long dark hair in the bathroom For me it was a bad experience far too expensive for the quality offered but when you have so many non returning customers it does not matter ,No Positive
462246,NH Amsterdam Centre, Corporate hotel syndrome nothing is very bad but nothing very good either Faceless beige room robotic staff ridiculously overdesigned shower and security box a demand to hand over guarantee of 50 euro plus full price when checking in clean looking at first glance but an inch of dust on the radiators which they expect visitors to see as you have to turn them on so probably not all that clean at all In fact my room was not cleaned on my second day there even though I did not use a do not disturb sign had to call housekeeping to change my towels Generally I got the impression of inadequate staff very likely to be inadequately paid , Excellent location Plentiful breakfast Good bed Coffee and tea offered Light blocking curtains 
462247,NH Amsterdam Centre, Way too hot inside the room and no window to open For some reason they took money as a deposit for the room nothing on the booking said they will for this kind of prics i can do better, Good location
462248,NH Amsterdam Centre, The rooms were very small and limits the number of nights that you would wish to stay at the hotel Breakfast range was poor and not good value for money , Very friendly staff at reception 
462249,NH Amsterdam Centre, Room service is very poor and staff unfriendly Rooms are very cold Having a gym was one of the main reasons we booked this hotel and it was closed two days out of three as we have been informed the gym is managed by another company ,No Positive
462250,NH Amsterdam Centre, The staff saying no fireworks on sylvester for security reasons lucky us we checked with local people, The entrance and easiness to arrive from the cs
462251,NH Amsterdam Centre, Only issue was the road works on Leidesplein but they will soon be completed , The hotel is in a good location Easy tram ride to the city centre Good restaurants nearby The staff were very helpful 
462252,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Location was superb with the airport shuttle bus stopping directly outside of the hotel The hotel was comfortable and very modern with everything you wanted 
462253,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and personally wouldn t stay anywhere else when I visit Amsterdam Perfect location for shopping and drinking and great tram access for the city 
462254,NH Amsterdam Centre, Tiny bathroom everything was a bit bangy open the bathroom door bang close the wardrobe bang a few strategically placed bungs would improve it greatly Also whilst the evening restaurant menu was very well priced the breakfast not taken was 22 95 A little overpriced when you re 10 mins from the Leidseplein , Great location nice room comfy bed loads of pillows decent tea and coffee Good service and quality in the restaurant for dinner 
462255,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, The location was excellent Right next to vondelpark Leidseplein all transport needs at your doorstep Staff were very helpful Shopping district within walking distance as well as museum district All around good hotel spot 
462256,NH Amsterdam Centre, The the 10 Euros each we were charged for the use of the sauna and steam room , Good location Nice room Staff friendly Nice touch decorating the room with baloons and bunting for my husbands birthday
462257,NH Amsterdam Centre, The price quoted for breakfast when we checked in was very high about 23 Euros When I asked about it on the first morning I was told that it was now more expensive 25 Euros although this had not been indicated when we checked in The manager said he was unable to reduce this price as the system would not let him As a result we took breakfast at the Marriot Hotel next door which was much more reasonable and flexible There were also issues with a room fridge not working and a room not properly cleaned ,No Positive
462258,NH Amsterdam Centre, During our visit the hotel clearly had some sanitation issues as the first floor was pungent with stagnant water sewage In our room the shower screen door seal did not work correctly and water went on the floor Our room was so dark that I would suggest bringing a torch Joking aside I would suggest brighter bulbs or more lights as it did not create ambience it just made it hard to see , The location was great if you wanted to walk into the centre whilst staying in Amsterdam There is a tram and bus stop outside so public transport is also no issue The hotel is nice fine average and as a whole that is not a problem but if you want something good then I would suggest somewhere else
462259,NH Amsterdam Centre, We had a corner room and had a huge post either side of the bed This meant getting in and out of bed was a little awkward Think the room layout could be better , Staff were excellent Very friendly from the moment we arrived We got a free upgrade Room and bathroom very clean comfy bed and good facilities in the room Generally a very nice hotel and would recommend 
462260,NH Amsterdam Centre, Road works while there no mention of this from booking com or the hotel this made transport connections more difficult it was noisy at night and early morning due to this the front of hotel was screened off for exterior works also so no window view , Near sights and places to eat
462261,NH Amsterdam Centre, Terrible smell in the hotel corridors Smelt like sewage Requested a room on upper floor but only a room on 1st floor available at check in 4pm Room was overlooked by offices opposite and terrible sewage smell in the corridor outside, Excellent central location Airport bus stops outside Staff very friendly and helpful
462262,NH Amsterdam Centre, The kitchen closes at 10pm it s too early No Bathrobe no conditioner , The service I asked for a quiet room not facing the street when I booked but the hotel didn t get this info when I arrived They still managed to find me another room at the last minute so I could get a quiet one 
462263,NH Amsterdam Centre, Gym has funny opening hours closed most of the weekend Was also handed a rag and bucket by one of the staff to clean the floor in the gym at one point which was odd , Excellent breakfast
462264,NH Amsterdam Centre, Severely scratched desk top also the wooden floor was deeply scored , Room was comfortable so were beds facilities tv tea making iron nice bathroom 
462265,NH Amsterdam Centre, About 2 months before I traveled I asked for early check in late check out a nice room as it was a special occasion I got none of the above My room was dirty small not that was shown online pictures Had to wait to check in also had to check out at usual time We got told the hotel was fully booked although when we went online it wouldn t let us book for a extra night Overall I was extremely disappointed with my stay I would aprieate it if you could contact me back to explain why this happened, Nothing much atal
462266,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Great hotel for business travelers or holiday makers on a short trip Paid 20 euro for an upgrade and was happy with room size plus the little balcony to check out the view Room service was good and bar in lobby as well but did not get a chance to try restaurant or breakfast 
462267,NH Amsterdam Centre, Hotel is kinda old and worn out Poor lighting in the room Not so good cleaning Shower and water heater irregular heating sometimes it becomes too hot or too cold without touching the faucet Same as water supply irregular supply of water Leak in the toilet Rooms are small No towel rack to hang towels Horrible experience with a very rude staff named lisbeth Just asked for a glass of water and and gave me a dagger look reprimanded to wait Sent email to manager to complain about the incident Will definitely not come back Too many construction in the area right now Tram might not stop in near the hotel Should start walking a few meters than the usual stop, Location Near leidseplein square Near the posh shopping district Near all the significant touristy spots in central amsterdam 
462268,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, good location nice breakfast kind staff small room but decent and comfortable they stored our luggage for the day so we had no trouble to wait until our flight late in the evening 
462269,NH Amsterdam Centre, The hotel is under construction and this wasn t mentioned when making the reservation Therefore there was a construction blanket on top of the hotel and the rooms weren t getting any light and all you could see out the window is scaffolding For a queen bed they had two single comforters which was really uncomfortable The heating system inside the room was working but the controller for the heating system was broken so it was really hard to navigate that Considering the price of 500 Euros for two nights this was the worst hotel stay for that price I ve ever stayed at , The location is central That s pretty much the only thing going for this hotel 
462270,NH Amsterdam Centre, Uncomfortable beds Scruffy decor lack of information on restaurants Housekeeping kept knocking on the bedroom door several times each morning quite early ,No Positive
462271,NH Amsterdam Centre, Construction on the facade of the hotel wit significant noise during the morning hours, We arrived real early with a 2 years old baby and the staff was kind enough to make sure we get a room for the baby to rest like a very early check in
462272,NH Amsterdam Centre, The staff lacked communication between eachother which caused us to have issues both times we went for breakfast being told were not in the list and issues with with late checkout being called numerous times to confirm it Room was quite dated floor boards chipped and changing colour Very strong damp smell in the corridor which slaps you as soon as you waalk out the lift stayed on the 7th floor but our view was purely scaffolding , We were upgraded to a nicer room free breakfast and free late checkout Staff were friendly Good location 
462273,NH Amsterdam Centre,No Negative, Close to Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum Great eating places nearby Excellent staff Without the help of Mercedes we would have missed our train to Brussels Very special thanks to her 
462274,NH Amsterdam Centre, Every time I had occasion to visit the front desk check in check out luggage drop off luggage pick up get a map it was a wait of at least 5 10 minutes Further the staff were polite courteous but certainly not friendly , The location was great very central literally around the corner from the Rijksmuseum and the Van Goigh museum a very short 10 minute walk to old town 
462275,NH Amsterdam Centre, No bike rental at the hotel, Excellent Location close to the nightlife but not in on top of it Staff were lovely and gave me two free drinks for my birthday which was a nice bonus 
462276,NH Amsterdam Centre, We paid for a double room but were put in a room that was even smaller than the single rooms shown on the hotel website There wasn t even room to get into the bed on one side so I had to clamber over my husband to go to bed The bedside light didn t work and the window was broken and wouldn t close so we were woken up as soon as the traffic started and couldn t get back to sleep because of the noise There wasn t even a proper bed It was more like a cot bed with an incredibly thin mattress I was quite disgusted with the room and the fact that we were put in there When I complained the following day there wasn t much of an apology but at least we were moved to a double room I was told that the hotel was busy which I don t think is an acceptable excuse for putting us in a room far below the standard we d paid for In both of the rooms the furniture and floors were quite badly scuffed and chipped and needed updating ,No Positive
462277,NH Amsterdam Centre, the fact that we booked 3 nights and only 2 nights were booked on the system was really annoying but it got sorted in the end and the staff were brilliant, everything was great how the staff paid for a night in the NH barbizon for us as they under booked us a night

462281,NH Amsterdam Centre, The only downside I would have is that when I requested a late checkout they were going to charge 15 euros and hour and the cleaners knocked our door at 8 30 each morning to ask when they could clean the room , This hotel was great Breakfast amazing Rooms were great and staff were really helpful

462332,NH Amsterdam Centre, We were just staying for one night and this is why we thought they will see when we checkout so they can clean the room So we were surprised and thought it was really rude that at 8 30 someone aggressivly knocked 6 times at our door and woke us up , We got a free upgrade due to our booking class being fully booked Front desk was really helpful and friendly Spacious room clean bathroom comfortable beds

462335,NH Amsterdam Centre, Room was very small and outdated Especially for the price paid Small bathroom Handle on one of the windows was missing this was just taped over instead of being repaired Had a bad night sleep because of a regular buzzing noise during the night The duvet was also very narrow small and of a horrible synthetic quality so I was hot and sweaty all night When we got up the next morning to have breakfast the hallway was filled with the pungent smell of marihuana I wouldn t stay here again , The staff at reception were friendly The location of the hotel is very close to the Leidse plein

462342,NH Amsterdam Centre, The cost of the breakfast daily was steep , It was so great that because I was checking in for my birthday they put up a banner in our room balloons and a bottle of champagne for free 
462343,NH Amsterdam Centre, The non affiliated but attached restaurant San George was dreadful Overpriced mediocre food slapdash service and uncomfortable seating I expect it to be gone in 6 months , The front desk staff were friendly and efficient The breakfast room staff were courteous and the breakfasts were good value Great location for the three major art museaums a quick walk Room decor was attractive while being practical

462347,NH Amsterdam Centre, When we went to check out they said we had breakfast but we never even went into the Restaurant I think if you order on a room number security should be looked at more We paid cash for everything as and when we never put anything on the room It was quite embarrassing when checking out The Hotel did apologise tho , Lovely clean room and comfy bed and once you were in your room it was so quiet 
462348,NH Amsterdam Centre, The smokers gathered directly in front of the entrance creating a gauntlet of smoke just outside the door The smoke often funneled into the lobby area , The breakfast buffet was outstanding All staff members were very helpful in navigating the city and offering suggestions Wonderful room We were very happy with our decision to book thru Booking com

462353,NH Amsterdam Centre, Due to technical problems on their part I didn t get a keycard to my room before 1 hour before departure Which meant the staff had to show me all the way to my room to let me in Most of the staff was really friendly but waiting in line at the reception for 5 10 minutes to get access to a room you paid a lot for is totally unacceptable The second day the staff started to ask for id every time I wanted to go the my room I m never coming back to nh Room is quite small There was 3 people sleeping laying down in the lobby at midnight which felt odd , Location was good 
462354,NH Amsterdam Centre, We checked into the hotel for a weekend and were advised that the facilities included a sauna spa However when we checked its operating times they were extremely limited After sightseeing they were already closed for the day Possibly if you wanted personal service it could be arranged , We thought that the location to all sites was excellent and the front desk staff Mercedes and co workers were extremely pleasant and helpful The hotel is situated in a nice quiet area across from one of the many canals
