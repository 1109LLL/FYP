93120,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Staff very not welcoming There was no doorman to help with bags or door They want you to settle upfront even though you ve booked online with a card The room was dirty and cold as the window didn t close The room was very small and smells cigarette The bathroom very small Everything was wrong and bad service from staff , Very bad hotel 
93121,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I got very small smelly room on the 4th floor and shower was broken In general the picture u see in booking doesn t really reflect the type of room u will get, Location and reception 
93122,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room was small for the price The pool was small and not for real swimming, The deluxe room was pretty small not at all like in the photos The club room however was quite big and enough for an extra bed The sauna steam room and jacuzzy were great The spa was excellent 
93123,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff were amazing from the moment we arrived We were greeted with a drink Then upgraded to a stunning room and a bottle of fizz and goodies delivered the 2nd day I was almost tempted to ignore the sights of our capital city and just stay in the hotel The club lounge is an added bonus tand we enjoyed the surprisingly varied continental breakfast 
93124,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The only problem I had was that as I need to use a walking stick for medical reasons there are no handrails at any of the entrances The smooth steps are also not ideal during wet weather So generally I would suggest that a review of accessibilty would be a good idea , The food from room service was excellent and reasonably priced Any requests for supplies etc from housekeeping were very promptly taken care of 
93125,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The bed was a standard double not as pictured on booking com certainly not extra large The bath was also not as pictured The spa package I booked was not written down and was unavailable The spa staff were unaware a promotion was even on The small pool at the spa was so tiny and dirty that it had jets to swim against which would have been great but they didn t work People were playing loud music and video chatting on their phones in the spa but when I mentioned this to staff I was told they don t have a no phone policy The masseur was nowhere near qualified or skilled enough for the price charged Ok for a college graduate freebie massage but I was pleased when it was over which was less than the hour I had paid for Wish I d asked for a discount in the spa for poor massage and broken facilities We ended up leaving early and didn t go back the next morning , Personal message before arrival via WhatsApp and met on arrival Birthday cake and flower petals in the room was lovely 12md Check out is great 
93126,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Replenishment of supplies in room toiletries tea coffee water etc was inconsistent Service in the Club Room was poor Hotel baggage labels left sticky residue on suitcase handles , very comfortable bed excellent air con great location problem with TV was promptly fixed 
93127,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing , Impeccable Perfect in every aspect Faultless Truly a wonderful stay Everyone from the Doorman to the Guest Experience Executive were warm professional helpful I had a luxurious single room with all the modern amenities required for a very comfortable stay Outstanding As for location there is no better in Central London in my opinion This is a truly Champaign Experience which I intend to repeat They have won a loyal customer Bravo to the Management Staff 
93128,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Wish it were cheaper but luxury comes at a price , Staff were amazing Room very quiet despite being in central London Air conditioning perfect Bathroom very nice 
93129,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Loved that the hotel leaves a mobile telephone in the room that you can take outside with u and use for calls internet google maps etc This was extremely useful because general wifi availability outside the hotel was poor Loved the club room too Most days we had breakfast there Was quiet and coffee and the small selection of food available were excellent 
93130,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The hotel tries hard to present itself as an upmarket venue We had several small complaints which were dealt with swiftly by way of free breakfast drinks and upgrade to a suite So overall we had a pleasant weekend break 
93131,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Gym could have had some weights e g a bench Perhaps hotel could do a deal with a local gym and allow guests ability to use the gym , Service and location
93132,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Our room faced back coutyard service entrance This was noisy at night with trolleys been pushed across and staff having smoke breaks This was a minor irritation , Very friendly and helpful reception staff Madelein offered to pay for taxi on our arrival as taxi refused to accept a credit card as payment We were upgraded to Club lounge which was very thoughtful Will definitely be staying there again Thank You
93133,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I was promised the in room fragrance and made my choice prior to check in Despite asking for it three times during my stay it never arrived , The room was very comfortable albeit tiny but then it s London The air conditioning was good and particularly appreciated during the heatwave when I was staying there In addition my flight got in early morning and they were able to give me a temporary room until my room became available
93134,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, From start to finish I can not fault the service from Montcalm Marble Arch the guest experience host Isabella was amazing Can not thank her enough for the guest experience we received The doormen at the hotel were also lovely and very friendly Hotel location and facilities were great 100 recommend staying at this hotel you will not be disappointed 
93135,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room size is only reasonable but the room is very clean , Upon arrival we were offered drinks and fruit when the staff was checking us in When we arrived at the room we found cake and a bottle of wine waiting for us we arrived so late and were still trying to adjust to jet lag so unfortunately we didn t really get to enjoy 100 of that wine We have been properly looked after during our 7 day stay The spa facility at the hotel is great but needs some upgrade The restaurant within the hotel cooked us a fantastic 3 course meal for dinner and that exceeded out expectation The spa treatments and the spa room were really good we did a couple message at the spa and we were offered drinks and biscuits and we truly enjoyed those 2 hours together Everything was fantastic The room was serviced twice everyday Location is great 
93136,The Montcalm Marble Arch, My only wish for improvement was the air duct placement in the tray ceiling caused cold air to flow right at us in bed If it was directed away from the bed I don t think it would have been a problem The last day we figured out a way to position a pillow just on one side of the airs pathway toward the bed and this helped , Well appointed room with great amenities Pillow menu and complementary water was appreciated The upgrade to a club room was wonderful The food offerings in club lounge for breakfast were perfect The staff is very attentive and helpful We enjoyed use of the nespresso espresso maker in the room With the hot temperatures outside the complementary bottled water and perfect air conditioning was great 
93137,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, This was the second time I ve stayed at this hotel and I really love it It s super comfortable the staff are friendly the property is nicely decorated and maintained I am especially happy the hotel is very quiet and tucked away I found it extremely convenient with the tube being right around the corner along with all the shops on Oxford Street 
93138,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Placed in an old building completely renovated the windows were quite small thus the room didn t have enough sunshine but considering you are out most of the day it doesn t really matter , Absolutely fabulous Modern design very clean great location in a quiet street The hospitality of the staff was great from the welcome drink complimentary fruit basket and room upgrade 
93139,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The wifi was a problem Peak hours imposible to use it the waiting time is too long to load a simple page not even talking about videos It would always throw your device out of the wifi if you re not using it iPhones or ipads which is very annoying don t know if it s just our problem everything was up to date but I think that since it s 2017 a hotel of such level needs to have a very powerful equipement to provide with great wifi The cleaning can definetly be improved for a 5star hotel removing white residue from the tap or any other bathroom equipment comes without saying as well as mopping the floor everyday or at least vacuum cleaning to remove the hair from the tile when needed There is no charger in the bathroom for the hairdryer that they provide so I had to dry it in the bedroom but then a lot of dust fell of the ceiling or the cupboard That was very unpleasant especially for a person with asthma Maybe instead of changing the sheets everyday they should improve the general cleaning of the room It is more of a neutral note but the phone that is given is not that useful It s a bit slow hotspot doesn t really work and during our week long stay we only used it once , The location of the hotel was very convenient for our touristic visit the tube was 3 mins away as well as Hyde park and 10 mins away from selfridges The building itself was in a quiet surrounding away from the busy oxford street Breakfast was good good variety of food and also good service Fruits are brough everyday and fresh newspapers too Staff was friendly after our complaints they made it up to us which is a very kind gesture of their Duty manager much appreciated Overall we had more of a good experience in this hotel 
93140,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, From the moment we enterd the lady in the reception took care of us although she was a trainee but i m telling you she was excellent for dealling with the gust i have never been to a hotel before where they will give you a room to rest till your room is ready how thoughtful was that honestly this is the best hotel in london the room was super clean the bed was comfy planty of drinking water the bathroom comes with a wc hoose shataf wich was perfect for us the size of the room was reasonable i m visiting london up to 3 times a year this was the best hotel i have ever stayed in London thank you so much THE MONTCALM hope to see you again and thank you for making our stay amazing Note the location of the hotel is perfect
93141,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Not a lot of plug sockets and some in very bad places For example couldn t plug hairdryer in and be next to a mirror at the same time, Good Location Great Facilities Friendly and attentive staff Anything you could possibly need during your stay is provided
93142,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Absolutely fantastic location service comfort cleanliness I would highly recommend this hotel Luxury accommodation at affordable prices I will most certainly be visiting again A stone throw from Oxford street and New Bond Street so a shopping dream I was upgraded to a club room which meant great coffee and popcorn available all day in the club lounge Adella and the team gave such personalised service I felt like a celebrity My expectations were surpassed I will be back to stay with you again 
93143,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff are extremely helpful and friendly Location is excellent within walking distance to anything you need Free fruits and water upon arrival which is a nice touch Relatively easy to get a taxi the doormen are more than happy to help you fetch one if there s non in front of the property door Last but not least the mobile with internet free calls is great for travelers as well though I didnt use it as I ve got a local phone still think it s a good touch Overall an excellent experience and would recommend to anyone 
93144,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The bathroom is not big which is OK but there are hardly no place to put your make up bags , This hotel is very very nice The service is exceptional from all of the staff They delivered bottle of prosecco to our room since it was my birthday there where rosepedals on the bed saying Happy b day for breakfast I had a cake etc Thank you so much I will be back The situation of the hotel is very close to Hyde Park and to Oxford street lots of nice restaurants close by 
93145,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Having to leave , Really quiet Fantastic attention to detail Super nice toiletries and added complimentary extras such a lavender pillow spray and a basket of fruit Not to mention to free upgrade to a suite As welcome as it was unexpected Comfy vast bed Choice of pillow type Everything really rather plush 
93146,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Elegance but a very reduced space Designed by interior decorator rather than by hotel expert telephone 10 inches away from shower but towels 3 YARDS away from shower , Location Metro station and High Park a few blocks away Pillow selection Fruit in room 
93147,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The facilities in the room are a bit low tech but the vibe in the building is more classic London, The staff was so nice we got a complimentary club lounge upgrade Perfect

93173,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The shower glass was not sealed tight enough to prevent water from seeping onto the bathroom floor Basic amenities like comb and toothbrush are not provided Lack of eateries that suits the Asian palate around the area , Lounge access with complementary continental breakfast and snacks and drinks during the day was a big plus for us Front desk and concierge services were excellent Check in and out was smooth and fast 
93174,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Arrived late and bathroom was flooded Alerted staff in morning told off for not telling them sooner however due to travel wanted to sleep asap after arrival Engineer saw to problem however left dirty towels from mopping up water in the bathroom Complimentary water only re stocked once and fruit in basket was mouldy Upon clearing items for leaving noticed that housekeeping had left half opened snacks in the wardrobe from minibar section Ours was still fully stocked as per first day as we had nothing Checking with staff when paying room bill these items had been added on to our bill which we didn t have Very angry at this prospect given that it was obviously housekeeping or whoever sorted out the leak in the bathroom and then tried to get away with it I m glad we asked for the itemisation of the bill and that the receptionist cleared this matter up , Concierge friendly and welcoming

93178,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The Montcalm has two hotels i originally booked the wrong hotel and i found out by coincidence when i called the hotel to inquire about visa payment Both hotels almost have the same name and its very confusing The Monte Calm Marble Arch Hotel while the other is Marble Arch Mont Calm I think it should be clear at website , Staff are really amazing and helpful Ms Vera is a warm and lovely person she made us feel at home and always exceeded our expectations Vera keep up the good work 
93179,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Mont calm hotel is a very nice and quiet hotel I had a problem with my room and I got upgraded to a presidential suite The staffs are so welcoming and very nice and the best part is that you can walk to oxford street It is a wonderful hotel

93182,The Montcalm Marble Arch, room service was too bad i have complained so many times but no body took an action specially that one day the housekeeper kept my room door open and there were my valuable belongings I spoke to the manager two times he kept saying i will see or i will check cctv but he did nothing the housekeeper didn t change bed sheets the whole week and didn t put toiletries many days and bew towels every day as well as complimentary water and coffee, location reception staff were very welcoming the bathroom or toilet has water hose spryer

93187,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Prepayment is required on checking in, Excellent location very close to Oxford Street and the underground train station Clean neat and quiet hotel High level of staff service both in the reception and in the dining room especially from Adella the Guest Experience Manager 
93188,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The only thing we didn t like which made us unhappy was the taxi cab which took us to airport from hotel however it s not related to hotel directly but as the hotel booked the taxi for us it would be better they consider taxi organisation sending good mannered drivers for hotel guests the taxi driver scammed us and shouted on us was very bad experience , Every thing from hotel was fine 
93189,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, I liked the hotels staff everything i asked fir they accommodated for whether it was a food prefrence or to the friendly doormen that went to the main street ti get us a taxi The reception where so professional and helped me with everything i wanted

93192,The Montcalm Marble Arch, complimentary water not provided daily when cleaning as promised though we remind them in the morning lack of space on the room comparing to price and star rates , toilet with hose modern decoration easy access to wifi
93193,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Attention to detail was poor with the housekeeping only ever left one shower gel it s a five star hotel with two people in one room why ration the soap Also the milk and water wasn t always replaced At there prices you would expect more , Good location
93194,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The furniture is need to be refurbish, The hospitality of the staff The nice organization they did in the room celebrating our anniversary The privacy quite room they prepared for us The breakfast buffet was excellent The new service they offer in each room a mobile phone with internet that we can carry with us as a guideline to us in London and also we can do a free call outside the UK 
93195,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing, Every thing was beyond expectation I mean I have been in london before I usualy stay for a one week vacation each hotel I used to stay in has got a one or two bad points but here in The montcalm hotel marble arch what ever you dream about they make it come true starting from the reception especialy Izabella I am going to miss her smile and her effort for trying to make my accommodation comfort and elite she decorate my room especialy for my birthday she upgraded me to a junior suit without asking a free acess to the lounge they made me feel like i am the only resident in the hotel and that was the very special thing about them the hotel was fully booked and they make you feel like you is the only resident they have I loved the bathroom so much I loved the bed and pillows it was very comfy the room was very nice and clean they clean the bathroom and replace towels and clean room like twice or more every day YES that is true AMAZING and Izabella every time she stops me and try to make you ask for any thing to make it come true as you wish for your comfy accomodation next time before I will book a room I will make first sure that Izabella is there
93196,The Montcalm Marble Arch, for us a longer stay , A real effort was made upon arrival We did want to pay for an upgrade and had contacted the hotel prior to have this arranged With regret as we arrived late the hotel was sold out We were offered a free upgrade the following day which I can say made the stay better by a million 
93197,The Montcalm Marble Arch, nothing, We have been here on a number of occasions now and are always so pleased The staff are welcoming and friendly and endlessly helpful The breakfast choices are A1 and again the staff work seamlessly and unobtrusively to make one welcome For a hotel just yards from the Marble Arch it is really good value Add to that the fantastic oversize comfortable beds even in the basic room Looking forward to going back soon 
93198,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room is lacking natural light as i have just half of the big window in my room on the second floor but very well equipped , I was really surprised by the quality of the hotel I like everything but food and staff are simply amazing Breakfast is really great Free handy phone provided by the hotel which could be used outside of the hotel is very convenient I ve met for the first time such a brilliant idea Complementary fruits water tea and coffee are also very pleasent 
93199,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The bed was extremely small for 2 people Bathroom looked good but was very uncomfortable The sink was way too high felt like it was installed by mistake in wrong place A lot of space but no place where to put accessories Coffee machine is hard to use because of nuts and other minibar things standing in front of it I also found several things which didn t work properly in my room I was asking myself why I should call reception to tell about all the things which didn t work in my room as if it s my job SPA was small and not all equipment worked Window in the room was very small Don t expect to see the sun or the sky , Room design 
93200,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Selection at breakfast for price was not great , The staff were excellent the bed was very comfortable the room was quiet the bar staff were friendly location is very good drink on arrival nice touch

93202,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room s are small even for London The entrance has steps so if you use a wheelchair or have someone elderly with you it could be a problem they have a ramp but it has to be taken out and set up each time so is a little inconvenient , Staff are very helpful Breakfast is good and you are in walking distance of Oxford Street Hyde Park and Park Lane It s very clean nice decor and finish to the rooms and it s very quiet at night 
93203,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, We received an upgrade of room on arrival and arrived back to our room after the Theatre to find a chilled bottle of Prosecco with strawberries dipped in chocolate What more could you need 
93204,The Montcalm Marble Arch, At start we had a room which we can say it was like a grave Very small and you even can not move in it After Marta came and offered us a bigger room with no cost as i had a infant with us so we need a bigger room The new room was not that much fancy The bathtab water whole was blocked and was not fanction properly Room was not that much clean as i found hair here and there But the hotel managment told us that they will do a refebrishment for the hotel next year , I liked the comfy bed and the hospitality of the staff specialy Mrs Marta as she tried to fix most of the issue we faced during our stay Her level of customer seevice is exteremly high The hotel gave us a bigger room and a free ride to airport

93207,The Montcalm Marble Arch, At times the Reception area and door were left unattended and whilst not a huge problem this seemed odd for this level of hotel , The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming we were offered a glass of Prosecco whilst we checked in It was my partners birthday and the room had been beautifully decorated and stocked with cakes and a further bottle of Prosecco for the occasion by the Receptionist Adella 
93208,The Montcalm Marble Arch, There is nothing negativa, Everything was perfect The staff was very friendly and helpful the location is the best one you can select I would like to thank all the staff and especially Izabella and Adela for their help 
93209,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The staff is not enough trained to deal with customer need The concierge wasnt so helpfull He was so nervous About me And a had a fraud on my pocket money officially from there , Hmmm nothing to tell u about that I specially like 
93210,The Montcalm Marble Arch, non, Honestly the main reason for me to book several times and stay at this hotel is the staff dealing with guests Good crew treated is why booking in this hotel when I visit London
93211,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The pillow is not comfortable to me its feather and low I prefeer high I got high but it wasn t big enough, The toilet bowl is so suitable for muslim way in washing 
93212,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, This is the extension for my previous booking at this hotel Everything are basically the same and thank you for the wonderful time during my stay here 
93213,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The breakfast food are good but try to change the buffet choices of food for the breakfast maybe once in 3 days , Great location near to Marble Arch Hyde Park and the shopping district of London Very friendly helpful staff my personal experience Angelina and Jerry TQVM 
93214,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Placed in a noisy room as it was by the elevators even though the hotel wasn t that busy No hot water in the morning So an awful stay I m a business user who has stayed at this hotel in the past but after this experience I ve cancelled my advanced bookings for the next several months and taken my business elsewhere ,No Positive
93215,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Tiny room with lots of unnecessary furniture that makes it really uncomfortable Bathroom is even smaller than tiny there is literally no place to put your tooth brush Poor housekeeping service on day two there was no replenishment of bathroom amenities and tea coffee Not too comfortable bed TV remote did not work I ve specifically asked for a quiet room and got the one next to the elevator Actually this hotel was my worst experience in London , Good breakfast very friendly staff convenient location
93216,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, On arrival my wife and daughter were offered an upgrade to a suite and received complimentary gifts in the room Izabela the Guest Experience Executive was extremely helpful and made our stay very special indeed I will be going back soon and would recommend it to all
93217,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The pillows were slightly uncomfortable, The door man remembered us after 2 years from our previous stay Staff were extra friendly and respectful Staff were well aware of special needs of muslims 
93218,The Montcalm Marble Arch, It was all perfect I can t complain about a single thing , Serious luxury we were attended to as though we were royalty The room was massive and had turn down service nightly We had access to a happy hour in the club lounge and a beautiful breakfast was included each morning The spa and gym were top notch and the staff was extra sweet to my 9 yo son It s also an AWESOME location tucked into a quiet residential street but only a two minute walk to trains buses and bustling Oxford St We LOVE this place We will be back 
93219,The Montcalm Marble Arch, One of the staff members struggled to pass on information and didnt really help us until prompted The swimming pool was smaller than expected and the heater on it didnt work The Spa staff neglected to pick up empty cups from the spa area , The bed was really comfy hotel was nice staff were friendly and they upgraded my room for free on check in Breakfast was great 
93220,The Montcalm Marble Arch, It took a little while to bring coffee different pillows Not used to asking if we want the bed turned down which seemed unnecessary They are obviously geared up to people expecting everything done for them whereas independent travellers like us don t need that But isn t it time the higher end hotels provided real coffee and milk as standard , Very attentive and friendly staff great facilities They realised it was my birthday and made a fuss of me complimentary pastries and proseco which was a real treat They also supplied filter coffee at our request Quite expensive compared to our usual hotels but then it was 5 star We didn t have breakfast there as our supply of fruit and biscuits was enough 
93221,The Montcalm Marble Arch, For a 5 star hotel and having booked a deluxe room the cleanliness was not up to luxury standard it seemed to be very rushed Not enough plug sockets with some being foreign The room was very dull even with the curtains open no natural light could get through Very strange shaped room Room service is a tad slow add 10 15 minutes on what estimated time they give you , Front desk and doorman was pleasant Food in the restaurants is lovely Building and surrounding area well kept Elemis toiletries are a nice touch 
93222,The Montcalm Marble Arch, They should allow customers to do late checkout at least until 1 or 2pm without charging an extra fee , I like the warm welcome and greetings of the staffs from the hotel as i was walking in Loving how they serve the customers with drinks upon arrival Liking how the servicing and hosting experience from the hotel door to my room door step i m just loving the experience of serving complimentary into my room And of course the guest assistance service of the self help mobile phone of having a guide of London of foods and tourist attractions Very thoughtful of the hotel management team Well done 
93223,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff was Amazing Best I ve ever experienc d in a hotel Very responsive and helpful everyone doing whatever they could to make our stay excellent Would highly recommend this hotel Close to couple small food stores and tube station too 
93224,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Leaving I should have stayed more , Excellent service Clean and quiet Perfect location Madalina in the reception is an angel Helped us out smoothly Thanks a lot 
93225,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Hotel was in an excellent location close to oxford street and Marble Arch tube station Staff at the hotel were excellent and couldn t have helped us enough Thank you for an amazing time 
93226,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the pool was very small but definitely a nice added extra There arent many hotels in central London that have any spa facilities at all , the staff are extremely welcoming and went an extra mile to make our stay extra pleasant All our wishes were fulfilled and we were treated with loads of extras as a courtesy which definitely gives the stay that extra value rare to find nowadays Very personalized approach of guest relations team is definitely the key point of this hotel Breakfast was amazing and so was the food and staff at the executive lounge 
93227,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Toilet would not stop refilling staff seemed to be very aware of issue as they were able to immediately without calling a plumber rectify the issue by going in to the hallway and fiddling with the cistern Not ideal when you have to go in the middle of the night then have to call staff to fix the toilet each time you flush Genius Perks Booking says you can check out 2 hours later 2pm the hotel says the latest you can check out is 1pm which is only 1 hour later than normal checkout they said if you want to check out later than that they will charge extra We had booked this hotel specifically for the late checkout as we were going to get ready in the hotel to attend an afternoon black tie event I insisted on the 2 pm check out and was told to check again in the morning to see if that was possible Again in the morning we were told we had to vacate by 1pm In the end the staff made an exception and allowed us to check out at 2 but to be honest I would expect that if Booking give you a perk for being a top customer this should be cleared with and honoured by the hotel I also made a mention of the request to check out late on my booking the hotel claimed they hadn t received that , Great location staff were excellent room was well equipped and luxurious 
93228,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The only issue I had was that as I booked through booking com on the day of my stay a pending transaction for the room was taken from my account to guarantee my booking Upon arrival I then had use the chip and machine to pay however this seemed to debit a different transaction whilst leaving one pending causing a double charge The hotel advised they had cancelled the pending one however this would take 3 4 days to show back on my available balance , Upon arrival we were upgrade to a premier suite Staff were super friendly and the hotel is luxurious Highly recommend 
93229,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The check in progress was very bad the wasn t ready I have to wait for about 45 min even we arrived on check in time unlike this previous visit The mattress cover wasn t changed from the previous gust , Location some facilities

93231,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The shower has a light feature but it wasnt working and the extra jets just wet the whole floor i could think of a much better fitting, The spa wasn t workin but they sorted me out more than made up for it and the breakfast is the best
93232,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Tiny room despite supposedly paying for a larger room So small that the safe took up the bedside table The lift was out of order too and one of the staff didn t even know where the stairs were , Modern amenitites
93233,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Expensive room is a little bit expensive traditional british breakfast is pretty expensive, Room is perfect staff members are friendly just near the Marble Arch underground station and Oxford street
93234,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Only criticism is the room did not have a window which was rather a shame but as everything else was great we didn t complain Overall lovely room but a window is something I like in a room I am a little claustrophobic and I would of liked a bath rather than a shower but these are little things which did not take away from the fantastic hotel the Montcalm is Maybe this is something that could be asked in checkin what is your preference , Amazing hotel with fantastic staff Loved all the little touches that the staff did For example we arrived a little before check in but staff were so accommodating and made us coffee while they sorted room On returning to the room after a long evening out It was lovely to return to a turned down bed lavender on our pillows slippers etc Breakfast was superb and throughout the whole stay every staff member we met was polite and helpful We would highly recommend this hotel and will be back soon enough
93235,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The fragrance machine in the room was Very weak and we couldnt really smell anything , Enjoyed the little samosa thingys in the club lounge They were pretty amazing

93246,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I ve stayed at a lot of hotels in London at least once a week When I saw a deal on this one I figured I d give it a go maybe because it was a deal and I didn t pay top price I was given a shoe box room who knows it was at the end of the corridor near the staff lift and stores While the staff where lovely and the bed was comfortable it just wasn t worth the normal price tag so many other way better hotels around Breakfast was ok Overall it s just ok disappointed really , Bed was good

93292,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The standard rooms give a cramped feeling Unfortunately another hotel that does not react to the guests special wishes , Situation is just great In general very friendly staff 
93293,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Poor hotel policy of charging 100 against our guests card and not refunding it for 3 days This was very unfortunate as we had paid in full for our employee to stay as party of her staff incentive scheme that in itself paying in advance was very problematic The hotel were not very helpful in relation to this they didn t make it easy , Lovely room 
93294,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The carpet in the room looked old and of need of a cleaning and vacuuming I didn t like the over priced dinner in the restaurant I ordered the lamb chop and it was lacking flavor and the vegetables were raw and under cooked It didn t not warrant the 80 pound cost I didn t like that I had to wait 30 mins to get my vehicle from vallet parking because of the delay I missed my ferry back to France , I liked the friendliness of the staff and the location of the hotel 
93295,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I stay here everyondon trip now and I think they should regularly upgrade loyal clients to bigger rooms which they dont , Great location staff rooms spa My favorite hotel in london

93300,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing, From the moment we stepped into the hotel they could not do enough for us both we was upgraded then they found out it was my wife s birthday and they bent over backwards for us they even put red petals on our bed in the evening saying happy birthday so when we got to the back to the room my wife had a big shock thank you so much for everything you did for us on our night stay on the 19th sept we will defiantly be back and we will tell everyone about you Thanks for everything Mr and Mrs Thompson
93301,The Montcalm Marble Arch, At the bar was charged on the bill a round of appletons rum or whisky shots which I was under the impression from the bartender that this was a free offer however both bartenders also had shots with us leading me to believe that they were free The other drinks we had were purely our choice which I was happy to pay for , The room we stayed in was lovely a big thankyou to the general experience manager there for making it all the more enjoyable and special 
93302,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The hotel looked very used which is understandable but could be maintained better Breakfast for the price didn t have a decent variety as compared to a continental breakfast The worst part is the price for the tiny rooms is not acceptable Got better offer in near by hotels and tube connects the whole city , The location mobile service for Saudi Arabia and the free cell phone 
93303,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The rooms were very dark no daylight It made it very difficult to do ones makeup etc Also no shelf in bathroom for my own toiletries etc overall rooms small but well equipped , Charming and very helpful staff and the hotel was calm comfortable and was a very pleasant stay It is set in a lovely select part of London in a quiet residential area 
93304,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The breakfast is really bad amd doesnt match with such a great hotel even the staff working in the breakfast 1 of them is very annoying Its the worst place i have had breakfast at till now , The room was great the staff the service the facilities was all great Very close to everything Underground station is only minutes away Very nice and calm hotel

93314,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I didn t like the Air conditioning it wasn t working well , It is one of the best hotel in the Marble Arch Aria I like the location the staff specialy the Brazilian guy i don t know his name the room design and lighting The Portable Mobile that you can take it anywhere which have free internet and free calling to some countries

93323,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Location was very convenient Facilities at the hotel were awesome Staff were very friendly It was expensive to stay here but I would definetly stay here again as it has been the best hotel I ve stayed in London Gym and spa facilities were very good and the breakfast in the morning I couldn t fault Very much enjoyed my stay here 
93324,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Spa was closed due to maintenance which was dissappointing Still overall we had a great experience from the hotel and service , Upon our arrival the room was really below our expectations However when i told this to front office managers Tarun and Rodica they tried everything to make us happy I am giving full stars mainly because of their kindness and sincere interest Location is great breakfast is also very satisfactory
93325,The Montcalm Marble Arch, It was not, Great location close to the attractions The building is beautiful clean polite staff clean room very good facilities Great breakfast 
93326,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The initial deluxe room we were offered was so small and definitely not what I thought I d booked In addition the bathroom was dirty However the front of house staff moved us to another room which we were very happy with ,No Positive
93327,The Montcalm Marble Arch, It is very expensive for breakfast or anything there the room was small when you have big bags and to eat locally you need to go to another area it is nice but not cheap, The hotel was very smart close to marble arch tube and Oxford street bed was comfy very clean
93328,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The food in the lounge was a little to geared to non UK Like to see more English options if possible, People were brilliant very helpful plus an upgrade too

93330,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Stunning hotel very professional and pleasant staff Junior Suite was incredibly comfortable Spa was very relaxing you forget you are in central London 
93331,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Only two small things I hated 1 the rooms are small you can barely walk without hitting something 2 No balcony , Pretty much everything specially the staff they were extremely friendly and helpful The hotel is super clean It s location is nice 
93332,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Much to my disappointment the exercise pool jets did not work the steam room had barely any steam the indicator green light on the jacuzzi didn t work Help at hand didn t have relevant answers to these queries and it was not resolved My club room didn t have a hairdryer much to my horror as I stepped out the shower , Staff were friendly and efficient Breakfast was lovely
93333,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Pillows were not at the standard of the hotel Not enough Eco friendly with the towels Didn t bother with the breakfast too expensive , Friendly staff
93334,The Montcalm Marble Arch, NOTHING, I ve stayed here on numerous occasions now and the the staff can t do enough for you so helpful and amazing with children they went over and beyond to make it an enjoyable stay 
93335,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I made my booking when I arrived London airport then I had to select the room but because it s quite very tided hour I couldn t get breakfast free which cost me more money ,No Positive
93336,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room was small, Comfortable bed they supplied an additional single for my son quickly brought replacement tea bags quickly were chatty in the bar great Mojitos Use of the executive lounge when I had to wait for my late flight excellent breakfast convenient location for the Tube
93337,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Had the most perfect stay here all the staff couldn t be more helpful We got a complimentary upgrade and prosecco on arrival Definitely recommend this hotel
93338,The Montcalm Marble Arch, As told earlier you need renovation Check your washroom s wood near wash basin Check your shower area s It s getting fungus etc , You guys need renovation ASAP
93339,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Rooms too small and claustrophobic far too hot not good air con we stayed in a basement room and felt like prison and awful pillows such a shame as everything else was perfect, Great business hotel perfect for the trip to London WiFi good and latest gadgets etc amazing bathroom but small
93340,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Breakfast expensive for what it was room on 1 floor which had no view and had to have curtains closed all the time as staff walk past the window and the sill is at ground level so not able to open the window for security reasons on the whole its expensive for what I had TV signal broke up, not much staff were friendly though 
93341,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Housekeeping could have been more efficient as at times the rooms were not cleaned till late afternoon But dealt with efficiently when informed, The rooms were well equipped with a super comfy bed Buffet breakfast was good Staff were very accommodating and friendly always someone ready to help 
93342,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room was below ground level small and hot yes it had all the usual bits and pieces and was no means bad but there are may much better at the price Food and drink a bit over priced especially breakfast The staff tend to just watch you and chat to each other rather than help but not rude I have stayed a couple of times and yes it is ok but there is better at this price range , Decent position near marble arch Which is not nearly as good as Mayfair for tourists etc but good Good for oxford street shopping and decent walks into the park and park lane 
93343,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Staff wildly inconsistent some fantastic some ignored you entirely Spa area was dirty not appealing at all , Fantastic location Spa in basement potentially a great asset 
93344,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, I travel to London a lot and this time i changed the hotel which i used to stay on and i am happy that i stayed on The Montclam It s the best in everything price location and comfort The staff was great too and helful 
93345,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Bar not opening until 16 00 was a real restriction and efectively cost the hotel money as our group was therefore forced to go elsewhere with our guests This should be seriously reviewed IMO , Excellent staff facilities and comfort Stayed here a few times now and has always been consistent Nicely understated yet excellent quality ideal for our foreign business visitors 
93346,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing , Me and my husband had stayed here before many years ago and decided to stay again When we went to our room we realised it wasn t the same as the one we had previously stayed in the concierge ring you 10 minutes or so after check in to make sure everything is ok with your room we mentioned that it wasn t the same they found out what room we visited before and moved us straight away to a junior suite for free Would highly recommend this hotel amazing location for shopping and superb restaurants We have stayed in other hotels in London but now we have revisited the Montcalm we won t go anywhere else
93347,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing, Lovely hotel just off oxford street marble arch and hyde park Perfect for walking everywhere to be honest Knightsbridge is 20 minute walk through Hyde park 
93348,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room we booked was a Delux Double We got a tiny room facing a wall and with a small bed After complaining to a very courteous and friendly staff we got free breakfast as apology and upgraded to a junior suite the following day What they called a junior suite was a normal size room facing the front of the building Three issues a this is not a 5 star hotel b their room description is misleading c breakfast was mediocre , Excellent staff
93349,The Montcalm Marble Arch, nothingwe were upgraded a suite because of personal reason the suite was beautiful clean to a high standard and I at all, My stay at the MONTCLAM HOTEL We took the trip because it was my partner birthday and it was also a very difficult time for us From the moment we walked in the ambience was very welcoming a modern building in the hart of the west end walking distance to most attraction the staff was very professional they paid attention to every detail all my requirements were mets could of not be any better we had a room with a stunning view peaceful night we were also upgraded with a suite because of our personal reason the suite was beautiful clean to a high standard The room was to perfection quiet and was a real get away I appreciated all there input and efforts they put in to ensure our stay was memorable I would like to say a special thank you to the managers Adella Makkdessi and Virag Lorincz for your help and support in overseeing everything and making our stay extra special I would also like say a huge thank you to all the staff of montclam hotel definitely return in the near future well done come highly recommended
93350,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Although very good Club Lounge facilities and amenities could be improved , Excellent hotel with excellent freindly staff and excellent location The free mobile phone provided with the room allowing you free calls in the UK and free International calls to many destinations and free internet was of an amazing value I would recommend this Hotel any time A great experience 
93351,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The aroma machine was disappointing, The concierge team was the most amazing people at the Montcalm Big thanks to them and will stay againg because of them 
93352,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Not as clean and well maintained as it used to be Stained towels and leaking shower screen , Staff are helpful and friendly and the location is amazing 
93353,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Firstly I would like to say that my husband and I are very relaxed and grateful people and i think this may have been the first time i have left a negative review We are very blessed to travel often with work and I always review the hotels we stay in On our arrival we were shown around our room by a lovely lady but at the end of our little tour she asked us to put a positive review on trip advisor as the hotel isn t doing that well at the moment When you spend quite a bit of money on a hotel thats the last thing you want to hear It all seemed fine to me until I checked the mini bar where a number of items were half eaten drunk and the wine glasses smelt of fresh wine which made us think they had just had a rinse in the sink I was not impressed thats what I expect when I go camping with teenagers not in a 5 star hotel The staff were very embarrassed and four door bell calls later the issue was sorted out by a very flustered lady I also went out for most of the day and pressed the button for the room to be made up and hopefully the mini bar to be restocked but when I can home in the evening this had not happened It made me feel like this hotel did not put much value on the basic expectations and I definatly didn t feel like this was a special trip as I had planned it to be Also they lost out on us helping ourselves to some yummy mini bar options , The location is lovely and we had a great night sleep The spa is ok but totally over priced 
93354,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I rather prefer street side view rather than the internal yard more switches in the room and a larger desk pls , The bed was wonderful room design is excellent fresh fruits an water tea set is very good new handy although i didn t test it but i ve appreciated the idea 
93355,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, We had a lovely stay and was upgraded to the Wow Suite due to a noise issue with our original room This added an extra touch to my wife s birthday and our wedding anniversary too We would definitely stay again The massage we had at the Spa was lovely too 
93356,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Not staying longer, Staff were very polite and welcoming making us feel special One of the nicest places I ve stayed in London were all round hotel experience was great
93357,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Very poor service by the doorman and trying to force us to take his illegal taxi when you check out If you refused he will become rude , Clean hotel in good location 
93358,The Montcalm Marble Arch, One thing which is not acceptable is the doorman will sell you illegal taxi to airport when you check out I advise all tourist who plan to stay in this hotel to be alert , The location is good as it is close to underground station The hotel is clean 
93359,The Montcalm Marble Arch, No single bed My room location was not comfortable due to the smoke that I smelled every night however I requested non smoking room, Location Bathroom facility specially water hose this what Arab need
93360,The Montcalm Marble Arch, It s just a bit 3 4 mins walk to the main road like it is kind of the beginning of the oxford street so you have to walk 10 mins to get to the middle but i dont really mind actually because trading off with hotel facilities and service i would rather choose to stay here rather than smaller room in the middle of oxford street at the same price , Location of course Hermes toiletries so fab Staff super professoional 5 star service Last time I used to stay at Radissom blu berkshire a bit further in the middle of oxford street but staff is not well trained and room is quite small
93361,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room is not very spaceious, The bed was really comfortable staff very friendly and very hight tech facilities location is perfect for shopping and food
93362,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room ipad didn t work Adjoining room door had broken handle and was stuffed with toilet roll No ironing board or iron in room had to request it , Location beds friendliness and efficiency of desk staff 
93363,The Montcalm Marble Arch, A wake up alarm that was inbuilt in the room and which I had not set or touched at all went off at 1am which totally ruined my entire nights sleep and the following day This was completely avoidable The hotel should ensure that this doesn t happen I complained to the duty manager and all she suggested was an upgrade next time and a complimentary breakfast next time which would not be sufficient to persuade me to return added to that when I turned the shower on I and the bathroom were quite fiercely and unexpectedly soaked as the cleaner had left one of the shower heads facing out The main thing guests want when staying away is a good nights sleep and value for money This hotel failed to get the basics right , The bad experience of being woken up and not getting back to sleep ruined my stay and the next day
93364,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Shame the Excerise pool wasn t working both times i went but thats only a detail for me, Staff was great bedrooms are great showers are great can fit two people in bath Easy SPA was great food fresh and delicious what more can i say Club lounge is great not to many people always had a seat
93365,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, This is how a luxury 5 star hotel should look like royal treat and fine touches For a special occasion we had a free upgrade and welcoming amenities Location cannot be better in London 2 mins walk to marble arch snd hyde park Breakfast is delicious and fresh I warmly recommend this hotel and will sure be back whenever I visit London
93366,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing all superb, Absolutely fantastic in all aspects staff were very a tentative and very friendly could not fault it rooms were lovely would definitely stay here again
93367,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the club floor lounge absence of direct light makes it a bit stuffy , the Management team Francesco Ankur and Rodica were outstanding very attentive and helpful truly felt at home breakfast was great too 
93368,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The rooms were good size for London hotels and very clean and comfortable Hotel staff excellent from Alex at the door to reception Have stayed in many hotels around this location and this has been the best by far 
93369,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Just nit picking now sound proofing could be better for street sound The bins in the bathroom could be heavier kept tipping over instead of opening , The staff were friendly and efficient The room was good with a very comfortable bed The power shower was fabulous Little extras like fruit and water much appreciated A member of staff accompanying you to the room as we arrived and explaining the features was a particularly friendly touch Perfectly adequate bar too In short for the price and location Fabulous 
93370,The Montcalm Marble Arch, i have nothing to dislike very thing was great, Loved everything about our stay the staff was amazing the room was fabulous They made it extra special for me and partner I 100 recommend this hotel I will be returning
93371,The Montcalm Marble Arch, ROOM WAS ADEQUATE IF SOMEWHAT POKY SHOWER IN BATH WAS AWKWARD TO OPERATE AND ENTER COMPARED TO A WALK IN ONE , GENERAL LAYOUT ESPECIALLY CORRIDORS WAS APPEALING BREAKFAST AND BAR FACILITIES WERE VERY GOOD
93372,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Exercise pool wasn t working properly but still a bit of a bonus to have a Jacuzzi and pool in such a great location , We had a very warm welcome to the hotel and they made up an extra bed whilst we were out so as not to disturb us Excellent service 
93373,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Bed was a bit small , The room was a decent size especially for london The breakfast was great and the bed was extra comfortable The location is excellent as well They also gave me a mobile phone to use free of charge including 4G throughout the stay 
93374,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I can t think of anything I do not like, The room always clean the bathroom always clean the staff extremely courteous its my first choice in london anytime anyday 
93375,The Montcalm Marble Arch, My only negative would be that the Mini bar prices are very expensive 6 for a handful of jelly teddies , The staff here are amazing nothing is too much trouble Lovely touches like complimentary champagne and cakes as a birthday treat Beds very comfy Location is great for Oxford street only a few mins walk from Marble Arch station Stunning hotel Did not want to leave 
93376,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing disappointed or to dislike , Classy and stylish hotel in great Central London location Great friendly staff Great room service and food Rooms a touch small but not cramped Rooms and bathrooms very well furnished and fitted 
93377,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The pillows were too hard could have had a mix of sizes Confusion over breakfast we were told we had already paid then when we checked out we were charged for full english when I only had toast and my husband had eggs and toast , Enjoyed the complimentary fruit and chocolates in the room Staff excellent 
93378,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I booked an executive twin which was really tiny for me and my son I expected an executive to be bigger and because I am a multiple repeat guest I thought that was poor service Pillows too hard not comfortable TV remote not working Everything has got too expensive for what the hotel offers , Reception staff are always very friendly helpful The location is great very central but away from the noise 
93379,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Pillow are not comfortable at all it would be great if you consider changing them to softer pillows or even have both hard and soft pillow so one can choose what is better for himself , Excellant location friendly staff very clean luxury rooms and almost everything was wonderful 
93380,The Montcalm Marble Arch, None, The location is great for shopping and sightseeing as the hotel is 3 minutes to Oxford St The staff definitely desrve a five star rating for their assistance and smiles 
93381,The Montcalm Marble Arch, car parking expensive, Very clean and comfortable rooms staff efficient and friendly nothing to much trouble Breakfast was well presented fresh and extremely tasty
93382,The Montcalm Marble Arch, When I booked the hotel I also booked the breakfast as well When we got the hotel we wanted to cancel the breakfast but the staff refused I found it very strange , I asked the hotel if they would do something as it was my wife s birthday The hotel gave us a very nice suite instead and bubbly and cake Very nice indeed Thank you
93383,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Club room breakfast is mediocre at best I asked if I could pay in extra for full breakfast and was told no, Great modern room and staff were very friendly and helpful
93384,The Montcalm Marble Arch, There was nothing to not like , Exceptional staff so polite and accommodating our room was upgraded without any prompting The rooms are spacious and clean and there is hardly any noise pollution from in around the hotel 
93385,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The pillows were a little uncomfortable, Just round the corner from Oxford St The staff were excellent and we were even upgraded for having to wait for our room at checkin
93386,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I would say the only problem was the pillows they were to high but you can minus this problem by taking one off , I loved the hotel and the staff it was very welcome and friendly with good hospitality The room was fantastic and I would say this is diffo up there with The MGM grand Las Vegas hotel room The room was big and the bathroom room is awesome The location was also a bonus with the restaurants and shops on your door step The parking is a good bonus to only 48 for 24 hours but the parking is free on Sunday s 
93387,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The breakfast buffet gets depleted and replacing items just takes way too long even all the fruit juices run out and take 5 10 mins to replace Other items just don t get replaced unless you ask even an hour or two before breakfast completes The Club room offering is a bit stingy I have asked for lemon slices to be provided before Tonics were run out on my first evening and despite asking were never replenished during the hour I was in there The drinks glasses are small feels like portion control My advice as a world traveller is don t see your Club Room as a expense control exercise when guests are paying several hundred pounds for their room to gain access See it as a way to WOW your customers I know some of the best Club Rooms around the world and I seek them out when booking Quite a small proportion of guests actually bother to use Club Rooms so treat the ones that do , This is a really nice all round boutique hotel in a handy location
93388,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Windows not double glazed so went to three different rooms until found an attic style room with a small window but at least no traffic noise , Bed was great The room had loads of extras great bathroom 
93389,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The front of house team were amazing Isabela in particular Very friendly and helpful They even upgraded us to the Royal Suite which is an incredible room with a four poster bed Really well located too for the West End of London 
93390,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I can t understand at a 5 star hotel how you can have adjoining rooms and not have the doors soundproofed The first night i was there I could here the ppl in the room next to me talking until 1am it was a joke I complained to the staff and they promptly moved me and upgraded my room which was greatly appreciated , Location staff and breakfast were all fantastic 
93391,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Everything was perfect , Welcoming friendly staff on arrival and throughout our stay We originally booked the standard duluxe room however we were then upgraded to the WOW suite to help us celebrate our 1 year anniversary We had rose petals scattered on the bed champagne and cakes The hotel was a pleasure to stay in very clean comfortable and will most definitely be staying here again 
93392,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Drinks in the Lounge bar were expensive however expected for the location and hotel star rating, Extremely friendly staff and all those little extras that really make a 5 hotel
93393,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Everything was perfect , A remarkable gem in a great location in London We have stayed in quite a few central London hotels but this was one of the most memorable and faultless hotel stays we have had the service room breakfast and facilities were all excellent At reception Angeline was extremely welcoming and accommodating We were given a surprise upgrade to the Royal Suite which made my husband s birthday celebrations extra special We absolutely loved the four poster bed with its fibre optic lights simulating the night sky And the deep jacuzzi bathtub with its mood lighting and the lounge access just made the stay wonderful A truly special stay we highly recommend the Montcalm We will definitely be coming back 
93394,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Only a minor comment Rooms are smaller than your average continental European hotel room but absolutely acceptable for Central London , What can we say Wow this is exactly what you are looking for if you want to stay in a stylish yet cosy place in the middle of London Staff Daniela was extremely helpful and showed us the room Great bar great restaurant Price might not be for everyone but we absolutely loved it 
93395,The Montcalm Marble Arch, had to ask to clean my room again and again during my stay and the double bed was small although we stayed in the montcalm room wich is considered the high standard, satff very friendly and special thank to Daniella on the front desk
93396,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The prawn tempura is just unbelievable So promise me you ll try it The room is big and clean and you can always find fresh fruits at lift well Honestly I just feel like home 
93397,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Its only a minor detail but the rooms on the 4th floor are very warm even with the air con set to its lowest temperature of 19 , The hotel service was great and they went out of their way to make us comfortable They upgraded my sister in law s room as it was her birthday and even gave her champagne on the house 
93398,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Lack of sockets to plug in straightners hair dryer mobile charger all at the same time Could do with a mirror in the corridor section by the socket to be able to straighten dry hair whilst looking in the mirror The bathroom could do with being refurbished slightly as ended up with a substantial puddle on the floor after taking a shower where it is obviously not sealed properly I was able to stay there for 175 but would not pay full price unless the room was completely to standard , The room was very comfortable and very clean The staff were very helpful and friendly Room service whilst there was fantastic Breakfast especially was amazing 
93399,The Montcalm Marble Arch, If anything the staff were slightly over the top in their eagerness to help , We liked the use of the club room We got back from our evening out to find happy birthday spelled out in petals and a bottle of prosecco a lovely touch 
93400,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing to complain about at all , An excellent hotel from the moment we arrived all the staff were warm friendly attentive courteous and very helpful Boutique hotel feel with great d cor Will definitely stay there again 
93401,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The food menu should be changed as i was in the hotel for long time and the same food everyday were served , You feel like you are at home The staff are very friendly They are always trying to help me to feel more comfortable The duty managers are also so kind to me especially to my kids they enter to my kids heart because of the treat and the way they are talking to them also they braught a gifts to them with chocolate and i saw my daghuters faces emotions with happiness and excitement Thanks Montcalm 
93402,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Everything The staff at the reception was extremely kind offering me an upgrade and taking care of all the details The location of the hotel was great nearby Marble Arch and even though the sourrounding streets were quite and silent The room very comfortable clean with fruit and all the facilities The Montcalm is definitely the best option to accommodate in London I will come back again for sure 
93403,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing , Everything Perfect hotel in brilliant location close to Oxford Street the d cor is superb hotel was perfectly clean and the room was spotless all the staff were amazing especially Isabella on reception who was extremely helpful professional and friendly nothing was too much trouble for her she is an amazing person to have in the Montcalm 
93404,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Very disappointed that we were put next to the lift in a small claustrophobic room The window for our room was only about 60 cms x 60 cms and was made of glass bricks so we couldn t see out Not the standard of room we expect from a 5 star hotel , Location
93405,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Breakfast the hot food wasn t particularly hot as it is kept in heated containers Would have preferred a proper pool not an exercise pool , From the minute we walked through the door to when we left we were treated like royalty nothing was too much trouble All the staff were friendly polite and couldn t do enough for us The guest manager was Janine and she was wonderful 
93406,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The only thing that could be improved for us was the breakfast experience I don t know if you were short staffed that morning but more staff required to clear tables and ensure tables relayed Our table had no butter no jam marmalade and we asked for more toast but it never arrived The bacon was not of the quality we would have expected It didn t spoil our trip at all and we will stay again but worth looking at the breakfast management , Staff were wonderful facilities excellent and the evening meal was very special 
93407,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The breakfast was not as good as the usual hotel that we stay at in Mayfair as they didn t have as much selection of fruit etc but overall we would definitely go again The club lounge is really something and nothing and needs to be developed a bit more , This break was my daughter and myself and we were upgraded to a suite which was lovely We had fruit in the room and water which was nice and a nice touch was handcream rather than chocolate at the turndown at night Good position for walking everywhere which we did 
93408,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the bed is not comfortable at all and the room is too small the rate is high for this type of room the view was awful, it is in a prime location next to everything
93409,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The booking wasn t confirmed due to a confusion between Montcalm and booking com It appeared that I had two bookings under my name This has happened to me while in Dubai I don t know what could possibly go wrong with booking com The TV wasn t working properly The standard rooms are too small to accommodate two persons ,No Positive
93410,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room wouldn t get warm enough and is very small The price is too high for the room size and breakfast is outrageous expensive , Staff is wonderful location perfect good gym great maintenance and installations 
93411,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, We stayed on Christmas Eve choosing this hotel for it s central but quiet location The staff were extremely welcoming and helpful Loved having a choice of pillow very comfy bed great night sleep 
93412,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Easier access to plug points by bed Red lights on TVs and do not disturb signs too bright when all other lights out , Good location Modern interior Friendly and helpful staff Great for a short stopover 
93413,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The property was not a 5 star hotel in my eyes The bathroom was poorly designed and cramped No space to hang a towel or place any toiletries The bed was uncomfortable and not long enough I am not super tall and my feet hung off it ,No Positive
93414,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Standard room is a bit cramped and could have been a bit more spacious Breakfast was too highly priced , Excellent location Very clean and comfortable room and extremely cooperative staff
93415,The Montcalm Marble Arch, tried the breakfast once and was very disappointed The quality of service and food are not appropriate for the hotel standard or money paid , the staff were extremely courteous and welcoming upon check Izabella the front desk member provided the necessary orientation and helped us to feel comfortable in our room the room facilities were always clean the evening visit by housekeeping always provided a relaxing environment 
93416,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I asked the concierge if I received a package which I knew had arrived He said no without checking After insisting that he checks he found it and didn t even apologize , The reception staff were very hospitable and helpful
93417,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff were very accommodating and understanding The hotel was in a good location and was only few block north of the central line red line Would recommend this to anyone who is traveling to London and I will be booking this hotel when I return back 
93418,The Montcalm Marble Arch, No issues to report whatsoever, An excellent hotel with a great service Rooms are a bit small but this is well compensated by a well designed layout and the quality of the finishings 
93419,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Size of deluxe room could be slightly bigger, Absolutely phenomenal customer service We had a deluxe room but got upgraded to the WOW suite Amazing staff and excellent guest manager 
93420,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The hot breakfast buffet was rather under stocked because things that had run out were very slow to get refilled This was a little disappointing because breakfast was actually very good otherwise , What a fabulous hotel The location was perfect for our visit and all the staff were friendly and helpful The rooms are very well appointed and comfortable The cocktails in the champagne bar are a must try 
93421,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff were amazing particularly Isobela on reception who arranged for my wife to have a fabulous bouquet of roses a bottle of champagne chocolates and rose petals on our bed all for her birthday and all for free Wonderful service and all the staff were very helpful professional and friendly I would highly recommend the hotel and have already done so to family and friends 
93422,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The size of deluxe room is small for 2 person, Perfect stay from all aspects Location Staff Hospitality Comfort Cleanliness Provisions in bathrooms 
93423,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The staff were so friendly and really made a difference to our stay We were celebrating a special birthday and we re upgraded to a suite Housekeeping put lovely balloons in our room and the lovely lady on reception helped us to arrange a gorgeous champagne breakfast 
93424,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Housekeeping staff were nice but did not have boundaries They walked into the room a couple of times even though we had the do not disturb light on The cleanliness was terrible The cleaning products included a bucket with small cleaning products in it and that was all It was definitely not suitable to clean the room properly I also noticed that during our 2 weeks in the hotel the carpet floors were not vacuumed once There was hair and dust collecting in the corners and under the desk They also kept returning the already used towels the ones I d leave in the bathtub back They did not change the towels until I purposely threw them on the bathroom s floor and spilled some water on them The overall cleanliness of the room made me feel as though it was a 3 or 4 star hotel The bed and pillows were uncomfortable , The staff members were great They were respectful and kind The concierge and the doormen especially were great They were very helpful The location was great The hotel was close to Hyde park Oxford st Regent st Bond st and Edgware Rd 
93425,The Montcalm Marble Arch, nothing, I loved the quality of the room location so close to Marble Arch and the attentive staff I have stayed here before and the Montcalm maintains its standards well 
93426,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I believe that the hotel should enable us to open the windows That might be a reason for me not to come back to this hotel The in room dining menu should have more food options , I liked the staff and the location The hotel is clean and comfy Good value for money 
93427,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Absolutely NOTHING , I have stayed in many hotels in greater London but I can confidently state that the Montcalm is the best amongst all Very friendly staff clean comfortable AND excellent location It will definitely be my ALWAYS hotel in All my future visits to LONDON 
93428,The Montcalm Marble Arch, 1 Room size 2 Smell of room first room was located in 4th floor and I complained about the smell and then moved to another room at ground floor with nice smell 3 Expensive, 1 Location 2 Room service
93429,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Wasn t informed the spa was out of action one of the main reasons for booking they did offer us guest passes for the spa at the Marriott however these where below expectation , Location cleanliness and attentive staff 
93430,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Film stars in hotel There were bodyguards everywhere which was intimidating and they were very rude had to ask one to stop standing next to my table at breakfast and one even shoved me out of the way by the lifts Ruined my stay tbh but I suppose not the hotels fault , Lovely breakfast very helpful staff nice feel to hotel 
93431,The Montcalm Marble Arch, We had gone out for the night and someone had come in and left shower products on our bed and took away the cushions from our bed this isn t a problem but a warning to the customers that this would happen would of been nice or even bring the products while we was still in the room The other thing is the price of parking I understand its London but at least the hotel should give their staying customers some sort of discount The price of things in the room should also be adjusted e g 6 for a handful of Haribo sweets, Everything was good the shower the heating even the fact we could open the window as many hotels don t allow this Its not far from Oxford Street either
93432,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The mini bar prices 4 50 for the one sip Coke bottles amused us lol, Staff very friendly and efficient And the room and fruit basket and iPad feature was amazing
93433,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the breakfast must be changed everyday not the same buffet The club also not various kind of sweet The cleaness of the room must be more efficent, I like the hotel Friendly staff specially who open the door very kind helping us
93434,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Cannot fault it , Everything Cannot fault the Montcalm staff for making my second stay here absolutely brilliant Upgraded us to a beautiful park lane suite and made our stay very memorable 
93435,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I lost my wallet in the hotel and asked the staff to help me looking for it but unfotunately they didn t care to help at all, Great location Toilet Breakfast Helpful Doorman
93436,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, It was the second time for me to live in this hotel and it was my parents anniversary at that day The reception had upgrade their room into wow suite for FREE and send some complimentary champagne to my parents room The staff are very kind and helpful they even suggest some interesting places that we could do The doorman was funny and told us to be careful when we go out at night The cosmetics in room was from Hergest very nice smell 100 customer satisfaction I should say 
93437,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Our room was far too small and uncomfortable No drawers for clothes and too cramped Not able to put light on in bathroom at night as it lights whole room , The staff were excellent Friendly and efficient Breakfast was very good 
93438,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, The service provided by the staff So welcoming especially a girl named Angela at the front desk The rooms were spacious and very clean with top class facilities minor details that embedded a really touch their hotel and guests 
93439,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room view same breakfast buffet everyday no early check in, Toilet hose the greetings guy on the entrance was very nice don t remember his name location concierge 
93440,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room was a little small Room service was inconsistent over our 3 nights stay we were given different number of complimentary water bottles and nespresso capsules every day on some days none , Location was great short walk from Marble Arch tube station and Oxford St Staff were friendly and helpful Lovely beds Rooms come with Nespresso Machines 
93441,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Only negative room a bit small , The staff were incredibly helpful and accomodating I asked for an early book in and late check out and they very kindly obliged That made all the difference to our stay 
93442,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Bed was not comfortable house keeping staff opened the room door without a permission Expensive and no breakfast so not value for money , Location was good Good room and clean toilet
93443,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The room had no view And what is visible from the corridors is unenchanting , The location is superb as its within metres of the underground and Hyde park in the midst of the shopping district Sleep was bliss as the bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel very quiet The spa is open til 10pm to unwind after long hrs shopping 
93444,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Having to leave , The friendliest and most considerate welcome we have ever had to a hotel Staff go above and beyond to ensure you have the perfect stay Room Service is perfect and the Guest Relations Manager is exceptional Rooms are beautiful so quiet for Central London Tube and Oxford Street a few minute walk away cabs always available outside to venture further afield 
93445,The Montcalm Marble Arch, We had very bas pillows There were either badly laundried or were very low quality They consisted of cotton or artificial fillers bundles Another disappointment was the Club Lounge where there were 10 15 seats I think Not worth having the Club Room at all , I am returning guest to the hotel I liked the hotel from my first stay indeed This stay was different though I found a lot of new staff members From my previous stays they used to have in the system my preferences but this time there was none in the profiles I preferred higher floor but my room this time was at 2nd floor with very small window to the back yard where there was some sort of generator which was loudly operated through the night for some reason 
93446,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Staff entering the room while we were in bed Being woken in the morning for breakfast in the room when we had not ordered it, The suite was terrific We were upgraded 
93447,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing only used it as a landing base but I will be going back again to try it again , As a solo traveller I was surprised to get a suite for the booked price The attention to detail was sublime for decoration to staff first time I have ever been offered a coffee to go on check out small gesture but big gesture 
93448,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Great location nice friendly staff nearby underground Marble arch Paddington train station and Oxford street SOHO I can warmly recomend this place
93449,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Queen bed size for couple is really small for 2 persons , Location is great nearby oxford street with quite corner Staff are very friendly Room furniture is very good comparing with other hotels in other hotel in london 
93450,The Montcalm Marble Arch, i had a late check out priority through genius with Booking and still staff called at 12 to inform check out time more over they kept calling and knocking the door , location and the idea of complentary fruits
93451,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Getting a little bit tired and cheap materials that don t age well maintenance required in some rooms , Very nice staff clean good location good sleep 
93452,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Great location Very central but quiet at the same time Standart room are too small but deluxe rooms are nice Friendly staff Luxurious rooms Overall one of the best in London 
93453,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room was a bit small which doesn t improve price quality ratio , The location is fantastic rooms are clean and modern although could be a bit spacier The personel is friendly and helpful 
93454,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the rooms were not cleaned on a regular basis and the corridor elevator were not always as clean as one would expect for this type of hotel, Good location and good price quality Staff was very helpful and friendly 
93455,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The door key system was unreliable I had to replace my keys four times over two days as they wouldn t work when I got to my room I am not a fan of synthetic duvets and pillows so was disappointed with that aspect of the rooms furnishings, The staff simply can t do enough for you They are all so helpful and responsive Such a pleasant change from some of the hotels I have stayed at recently The location of the hotel is surprisingly quiet and peaceful given that it is in the centre of London It is also great for access to the West End My room a Club Room although small was quite comfortable and was very clean 
93456,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Family suite is really a combination of a small sitting area in a narrow room and a relatively small bedroom not even kingsize bed so moving about is not comfortable Breakfast regularly running out of items so sometimes limited choice or longer wait , Nice modern interiors and well located close to Marble Arch
93457,The Montcalm Marble Arch, We liked everything , We got a free upgrade and the room was fantastic really clean and comfortable The breakfast was well stocked and the staff attentive 
93458,The Montcalm Marble Arch, This is a 5 star hotel The rooms are shockingly small literally can fit just the bed and table Same goes for the bathroom In terms of little touches that make a 5 star hotel experience no bathrobe no slippers room wasn t made before we got back and strangely no pen I commend them for having a spa but it s yet again short on space , Can t argue with the location Five minutes from Oxford Street 
93459,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Really nothing to find fault with, Excellent service and friendly staff Felt under no pressure to tip but really pleased to Personal touch of desk manager who showed us to our room Throughout the stay he remembered my name If I had wanted to take the dog they have an open minded policy and would accept if well behaved and not too large
93460,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Toilet kept running which was a minor annoyance Similarly priced hotel in the states would generally have come with a larger room and breakfast included but that s London pricing for you , Hotel is in a great location and had worthy amenities though I did not make use of the room service or Champagne bar The free fruit and biscuits were nice freebies it effectively means you get free breakfast for your stay and with London being so expensive you ll be grateful Bed was very comfortable waterfall shower was awesome 
93461,The Montcalm Marble Arch, 1 our room was placed directly next to a staff access door which was being used ALL throughout the night I will never use this hotel again However I used the Shoreditch branch and was most impressed 2 everything is over priced given the location you would expect a slight uplift but 20GBP for a sandwich is ridiculous, Location
93462,The Montcalm Marble Arch, We had a room in the basement below reception which was very noisy very small with one window looking onto a wall that was 2m away I complained and we were moved to a slightly bigger room still down in the basement with a view of brick wall , Location was great for shopping in Oxford Street
93463,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The water fruits tea bags which are complimentary were not replaced everyday we have to call the reception each time to replace them, Location staff facilities were excellent
93464,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Service very slow and inappropriate I ve been asking for laundry 3 times and nothing happened Safe didn t work and so heating icing room Not clean enough Found hairs everywhere , Not noisy
93465,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Towels were near the end of their life and it s a really small thing but the glass top on the bedside table was very dirty on the underside and it really stood out the room needed a little TLC, Excellent Staff who could n t do enough to assist us really friendly great service and name retention Breakfast was very good with great choice of different options The location is secong to none and Public Transport on the door step Recommended
93466,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, This is a nice and elegant hotel in fantastic location I arrived very early and they were kind enough to offer me a temporary room to rest in as my room was not ready yet due to my early arrival Rooms are very elegant and luxurius and have all the emeneties
93467,The Montcalm Marble Arch, We thought the cleaning was very lazy Some old food stayed in our bedroom 3 or 4 days before being picked up The AC set to 21 by default is in our opinion cold , The staff is great When we got to the hotel we were asked to pay in advance and when we got to the room to our surprise coincidence or not there was no water We complained to the manager and the lady was very polite and upgraded our room gave us access to the business club and free breakfast for the rest of our stay That s how you solve a problem Thank you 
93468,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, Staff were very friendly they made an effort to make the stay extra special when they discovered it was my wife s birthday with some complimentary champagne and treats Made our night perfect Room and facilities were immaculate 
93469,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I have stayed at the hotel many times and the house keeping has fallen off and if they don t pick up on this it would become very run down like the surrounding hotels The bathroom fixtures need servicing because they are leaking , I like the location the front house staff are very polite and customer service orientated 
93470,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Waiting too long to check inn May be about 4 to5 hrs I took 3rooms One of the room was very very small Reception told me we free un block your visa when I called my bank it was a block for three rooms Till this date The funny thing is I paid cash This is what made me so mad,No Positive
93471,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Orrible room dirty they made me pay extra room cause I did a double booking for their mistake actually because they never send me a comfirmation email,No Positive
93472,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Only one little thing that I could not open my window and get some fresh air it s nothing but I felt it would be beter if I could , The staff were incredibly nice the location was amazing you don t need any taxis to go around free wifi all around the hotel with no username and password only chose the network and start surfing the web I really loved my stay here I would definitely do it again 
93473,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The shower screen leaked onto the floor Communication could have been better we were promised a bowl of complimentary fruit however it never arrived We didn t particularly want the fruit however a five star hotel should not make such promises and then fail to deliver On check in we also requested a late check out and were advised that this would need to be confirmed by the manager We did not hear back and had to call reception in the morning to confirm Only a small thing but it is the small things that should make a five star hotel stand out , Very nice modern hotel centrally located friendly staff Excellent facilities and services Good room size and Sky Sports 
93474,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Very limited variety of breakfast menue Although we chose Montcalm Club room but it was quite tight , Friendly and hrlpful staff Friendly and highly response room service Great location 
93475,The Montcalm Marble Arch, I had to leave a day earlier after a stay of 7 days yet the hotel to my surprise insisted to charge me the extra night Cheap move Very small size room had to pay extra to get a standard size room for a couple small size cabinet Limited breakfast selection,No Positive
93476,The Montcalm Marble Arch, room size bathroom size amenities not replenished no towel hook no available surface for toiletries windows don t open tv hard to switch on, staff welcome fruit plate lighting tasteful decoration
93477,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Absolutely nothing , The hotel was everything one could want for in a break in London Close to many of the highlights London offers tourists Very informative staff efficient in their role discreetly in the periphery appearing when required Rooms luxurious all needs catered for clean and well stocked at all times again discreetly Food was plentiful and amazing quality produce cooked to perfection Priced more than the average holiday hotel but worth it if you value life s little luxuries whilst away from the realities of daily living 
93478,The Montcalm Marble Arch, was put in a lower ground room twice room was ok even though i asked beforehand that i d prefer an upper floor, the hospitality and service was great
93479,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Need some more options for breakfast espacially in the club lounge And more toiletries for every day , Clean quite hotel i like the sevices Location One of the best hotels I will definitely book again for next time
93480,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Was asked for payment up front which did not sit right with me for a 5 star hotel Breakfast was ok nothing special , Great location modern and clean interior staff very friendley and attentive Was there for 1 night and they gave us a superior room since we had to wait on check in for our room to be vacated 
93481,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The value of room rate was high, Staff were very cooperative and helpful Room was comfartable Location is great near to marble arch hyde park and oxford street
93482,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Nothing , Every thing The hotel is very luxury They upgraded our room to sweet with a very nice service The location is next to marble arch The stuff are very lovely and everything is perfect they deserve 7 stars not only 5 
93483,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Room was too small Barely enough room to open a suitcase with all the furniture in the room Barely 2ft of space at the end of the bed and as we were on the 5th floor rooms ceilings on the edge were tapered in Also when we checked in one room was ready at 2pm but the other one took 20 minutes and the third took 2 additional hours , Excellent position for sight seeing in London Cannot get better with closer proximity to Edgware Road and with all attractions a done throws away 
93484,The Montcalm Marble Arch, the staff is worse and cleaners take time to come the treatment was worse the other manager was fantastic but no , the stayed in the montcalm hotel for 4 times before it was fantastic but this year i was shocked because it wasn t good because the manager changed when they changed the manager it began to be worse and i dont think to stay in the hotel once more
93485,The Montcalm Marble Arch, Had to wait five minutes for doorman to let me know car parking was free on the road hotel is on Staff did not go above and beyond for a 5 hotel , The frosted mirror was a unique feature Superb location Room well equipped Quiet and peaceful
93486,The Montcalm Marble Arch, My room was in the basement and it was unbelievably humid Perhaps because it s in the same level as the spa This is the only thing that really bothered me , The staff are just to nice and cooperative They upgraded me to a suite and access to the lounge without asking 
93487,The Montcalm Marble Arch, The last time i visited this hotel was a year ago the hotel was really clean but now the cleaniness was downgraded pretty much the room service is bad service staff must be retrained or changed, The reception the location near oxford the breakfast and the staff of the restaurant and last but not least Alexandro oquido he is the soul of the hotel and the best thing really friendly really helpful he is the best if i would choose this hotel again is because of him he should be promoted
93488,The Montcalm Marble Arch,No Negative, I brought my fiancee here after having proposed to her earlier that day for spa treatment and overnight stay I told the staff in advance and was able to arrange to have the room decorated we also got an upgrade The staff room and everything exceeded my high expectation An top experience we ll always remember
