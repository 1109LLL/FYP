22155,Windsor Opera, Not applicable, All the people that work there are excellent We went to Versailles upon Checkout They guarded my luggage and took great care of us Trilingual staff French English and Spanish Gregg during the day and the night shift desk man were PHENOMENAL 10 stars 
22156,Windsor Opera, Kettle in room to make tea More bigger signage would have been good to see where it is , A woman at front reception sounded russian not pleasant rushing the instruction on arrival as if there was a queue waiting Not a good first impression seems the norm in France no kettle in room had to call for hot water to make tea lucky that was provided overall enjoyed the stay 
22157,Windsor Opera, Sound isolation was very poor Every time someone passed through the corridors you could hear it you could even hear what they are talking about Furthermore I have been lucky with some neighbors who decided that it is a good idea to shout at each other at 2 a m add to that the wonderful sound isolation of the rooms and you have got an unforgettable night in Paris P S No real windows were present either I mean there was one looking into a square inner yard 1 5x1 5m and you could easily look into the neighboring rooms ,No Positive
