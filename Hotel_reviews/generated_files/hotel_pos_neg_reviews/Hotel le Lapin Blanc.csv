185450,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Only complaint was that the beautiful shower didn t really work that well When we used the rain shower overhead function it flooded out into the room the drain didn t seem to able to keep up We were able to use the handheld sprayer but that didn t make for as nice of a shower One other thing worth mentioning is that this hotel is not on a charming side street or anything it is off of a very big street Blvd saint Michel which is noisy crowded and full of tourists and generic stores Didn t bother us too much though since it was so central and easy to walk to tons of restaurants was steps from Jardin Luxembourg , I have stayed in a number of tiny Paris hotels over the years but I have to say this is one of my favorites The room was really well designed to make the best of the small space with lots of thoughtful touches like a cute rotary phone complimentary macarons plus the colorful decor was charming The staff of the hotel was very helpful and friendly and the free beverages and snacks in the kitchen available in the afternoon was a nice touch In the summer Paris is super hot and sweaty and it was nice to know there was refreshment waiting for us 
185451,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Everything is great except the shower room s floor was a bit slippery and the shower was not strong enough , Good location nice room design big enough space in the room lovely decoration especially for girls 
185452,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, No obvious place to hang towels Couldn t get radio on tv Room was compact and bijou which might bother some people not us , Great location Nicely furnished and presented room Complmentary refreshments Nice staff 
185453,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Wifi was not working during most of my stay Shower room is not comfortable , The location is very good Staffs are nice and helpful It s clean although needs a few enhancements in the facilities 
185454,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, It was a little hard to find it The sign and directions could have been better , I loved that they left a little treat every night in a glass domed dessert plate It was just so cute It is central to the main tourist areas of Paris and the hub of public transportation Surrounded by wonderful places to eat 
185455,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The lift is extremely small which can fit 1 person along with 1 piece of medium sized luggage For me it was fine but for people with many pieces of luggages they would need various trips A stand to put in the soap shampoo etc in the shower area would be helpful The hand shower unit was very small and not satisfying I understand that this maybe to reduce water consumption but it s too small Laundry service is too expensive, Location is perfect with many metro stopes near by supermarket cafes and restaurants The staff are very welcoming and polite The free afternoon snack along with coffee machine A nice touch Got a complementary room update which was really quite and nice The bed is very comfy
185456,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, This hotel is absolutely amazing The staff can t do enough for example I requested free bottled water and the young lady brought three bottles including sparkling The cleanliness of the hotel is impeccable The location amazing I can t recommend this hotel enough 
185457,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Spaces in the hotel are limited The resturant got a very limited space My reservation was 40 square meters room Definitely the assigned room to me was not 40 square meters , The hotel got a Nice design and convenient location They offer in room breakfast option in case you do not want to go to the resturant 
185458,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, I loved everything , Amazing staff they were so helpful and made me feel at home Beautiful rooms extremely clean a pleasure to stay in And that bath Loved the free afternoon tea and access to a microwave whenever I needed it Great location 
185459,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, No conditioner or hair dryer in the room Did not know how to switch to rain shower , Nice modern looking rooms Clean nice view to the side street which was very European and quiet
185460,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The only little detail which could be improved is the quantity and refilling of the shampoo and toilet emenities, Beautiful quiet and pleasant room very clean and cozy soundproof windows Welcomed us with macaroons in the room and everyday new cookies were refilled Kind and helpful staff Upgraded our room Great location walking distance from many cites
185461,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, No view from room very small dining area Not enough tea and sugar in rooms Glad my husband wasn t with me because he wouldn t have fitted in the toilet , Decoration front desk and cleaning staff Comfy bed good shower 
185462,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, I was unexpectedly upgraded while staying here into a beautiful suite with a large comfortable bed and a huge bathtub in the room It was so clean and comfortable and the location was perfect I would 100 stay here again 
185463,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, nada i would be nitpicking on a single fleck of dust if i had to say something negative , the theme was fantastic on too of everything else best hotel i have stayed in ever especially in paris 
185464,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Shower is small , Great room with Alice in Wonderland theme Good space and very clean Location is awesome They left candies every day in the room as courtesy Nice staff 
185465,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The breakfast does not include vegetables , Clean beautiful hotel in a great location one of the best I ve been in Staff is very nice and helpful Don t hesitate if you re in Paris 
185466,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, No view, Excelent location The hotel is beautiful decorated The room was very clean The staff was helpful Loved the little treats they left everyday in the room 
185467,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The shower in room 33 was mouldy very common in Paris and caused allergic response in me But I could change room easily and the other one didn t have any problems , Great helpfull staff Super clean Nice small pastry in the room on arrival Good amenities 
185468,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, A few more hangers for towels might help Keep lights on for a minute after removing the room key card from its slot , The staff was very friendly and helpful The room was extremely quiet especially considering the cental location It was spotless and nicely decorated In the afternoon free tasty cakes pastries and warm drinks are offered to the guests This combined with fact the hotel is so central allowed us to have a quiet coffee break in the midle of our busy day 
185469,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The breakfast was a little pricey and lack of variety , The interior design was really cute and the front desk receptionist has offered to upgrade our room for free The macaroni left as welcome gift were delicious 
185470,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, The hotel staff was truly amazing Always smiling and helpful Breakfast is simple but very tasty and there s a free afternoon snack between 12 and 18 which can be helpful
185471,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The lobby and elevator are very small but still functional , The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating The hotel is very cute clean and close to the historical center 
185472,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Beautiful hotel the room was simply stunning and the decor had been carefully thought about throughout Lovely macaroons on arrival And just a few minutes from Luxembourg gardens and a short stroll to Notre Dame Will definitely stay next time we are in Paris 
185473,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The white washed walls and the Ikea typed furnitures makes the room feel quite cold , The receptionists are always welcoming and helpful They upgraded me to a junior suite which was quite spacious The Japanese style toilet is definitely a plus 
185474,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, When I pay more then 150 for a room it need to be very well decorated and finished I payed around 175 for my room and was under the impression pictures on Booking com I ll get a bigger shower area The woodwork good be nicer too have a better finish and didn t gave that ordinary feel to it In all nice job on the Alice look and feel than again it misses that luxurious finish you expect for 175 a night PS the beds are not that big so maybe you d like to book two rooms when traveling with someone you re not eager to spoooooon P, Okay first of all let me express my appreciation of the way this hotel managed to affiliate the Alice in Wonderland theme The room was nice and the drapes where so doing their job I slept like a baby so good The eat me surprise was welcomed by this female cookie monster And the location was great Note there s something called Little Cuisine Kitchen around the corner who serve the most delice and afordable luxourious burgers I ever had sweet staff too Do yourself a favour and at least order the Frenchie If I didnt mention the outstanding service by the cleaning staff I would nt do LLB any justice I love and need a clean room and they certainly lived up to the task Thanks Also I arived earlier and it was no problem The staff speaks English but if you re able and try to keep up with speaking French like I did you need to keep up with them or practice the sentence Quand vous parlez trop vite je ne comprand pas lol For fans of Alice in Wonderland also going to Disneyland Paris skip the Disney hotel and book Le Lapin Blanc I was in room 43 Pink Floor 
185475,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The breakfast was worse than what I would expect at a simple B B or even a youth hostel and completely inappropriate for a hotel let alone one with a price tag like this one The fridge is of course gorgeous but the awful cramped and low quality no choices breakfast was shockingly not in keeping with the rest of the thoughtful details in the hotel The breakfast is unfortunately a huge deal breaker which will keep me from recommending the hotel whoch is sad as all other aspects deserve 5 stars The breakfast deserves zero stars and I ve told people to skip it and get breakfast in the area I genuinely hope that the hotel owners will expand on a breakfast experience , The interior design made this one of the most beautiful hotels I ve ever stayed at and that means a lot The details are consistent and that bathtub the best couple pleasing feature as two people fit in side by side Waking up felt like waking up in a cloud due to the colours and the soft shapes and colours I m thoroughly impressed by the interior design doesn t just look good but actually has the effect it aims for 
185476,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Breakfast small choice aside to this very small breakfast facilities There was no problem during our stay to find a seat however it is very strange i think we got lucky As the place for all hotel to have breakfast is smaller than the accommodation room itself , Size of the room is really big as for Paris standards Perfect location for Parc des expositions direct RER line just 200 meters from hotel doors
185477,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Dining facilities are limited but there are so many restaurants in the immediate vicinity that s not a problem , Great location very comfortable and chic room helpful staff 
185478,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Breakfast room is a bit small and the buffet refill needs more care from the stuff, Great location very nice and spacious room loved the free macarons and espresso machine in the room 
185479,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The room is so small you can t even find a place where to open your suitcase We went out for diner came back at midnight the receptionist was standing outside smoking and he had forgotten to remove the security on the door we were locked inside for 1 hour trying to wake up someone on the 2nd floor to open for us Next day the management was not even aware and still after knowing they were asking us to pay extra 5 tax for our night Really shocking , Interior design
185480,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Hotel is situated in perfect place you can reach most of places of interest by foot and using RER from station Luxembourg you can reach Orly or CDG airports My room was small but decorated in beige tones what gives some light and brightness Bed and shower were absolutely OK Especially I like 2 things how this hotel is styled Alice in Wonderland style and how nice are people working there I had pleasant stay and have no single complaint 
185481,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Room has a very unconventional layout with the bath being on the same room as the bed which takes some tome to get used to Rooms on the St Michel side can be pretty noisy at night in spite of the double windows Very small entrance and reception which is pretty hard to miss and gives a very unlively feeling, Great location at the vibrant Latin Quarter 5 minutes from the Luxembourg gardens and the RER B station with great connection to both airports Big comfortable rooms with a view to St Michele Blvd
185482,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The suite had a first room that was basically empty It had a small couch but that was it Seemed like a waste of room and made the place look spartan Definitely would not pay extra for it as there appeared to be no difference other than this extra room There was no bath in the room unlike the regular rooms Furthermore there was no full sized mirror , We were upgraded to the suite which was a nice surprise The bed was amazingly comfortable one of the best ever for a hotel Super tech toilet also amazing if not a laugh Breakfast was nice and the macaroons in the room were a nice touch 
185483,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, the communal facilities are a little cramped, Our room was absolutely fab extremely large and well designed could nt of asked for anything more Really creative use of theme throughout
185484,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, no hair dryer in the room, Great location in the center and close to everything Easy to get to from Paris Nord just one easy train ride Room is small but very cute and nicely designed Wifi works Staff is friendly and helpful during check in out 
185485,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Lovely theme throughout great shower all necessities available Location within easy walking distance to metro station and Notre Dame cathedral Enjoyed all aspects of this cute and comfortable hotel for first visit to Paris 
185486,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Booked a superior double room as the site says it has a bathtub but unfortunately only some of these rooms do They initially placed us in a roo without one but luckily we were able to change The rooms with bathtubs are much more spacious and luxurious and definitely should not be under the same category price as the ones without Watch out for this , Amazing rooms very comfortable and lovely interior Breakfast was high quality and everything ran smoothly 
185487,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Breakfast is limited and the room is really small It s not worth it there are plenty of restaurants and caf s around , Decoration and Location are excellent We were in a deluxe room quite big including sofa Standard room may be a bit to tight for long stays 
185488,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, We had cold showers for 24hrs as there had been a fault with the hot water , The size of the room was very comfortable and the staff very accommodating 
185489,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Adorable For American expectations it is a small room but the space was used so well and beautiful proof bigger isn t always better There are larger rooms but it was just me and there was really no need The staff was so nice helping me understand how to get to Versailles very easy to get to with a Metro stop very near by and printing documents The location is about a 10 min walk to Notre Dame and with shops and place to eat along the way as well as close to St Germaine with more shopping and restaurants You might be nervous about not speaking French but everyone at the front desk spoke English I don t normally write review but it was so perfect I knew I was going to come home and write one Did I mention it was adorable Oh and I was slow to understand the theme Le Lapin Blanc when I did I loved it even more 
185490,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The bathroom was not as big as the pictures suggested and the breakfast was horrible We decided had to find better food elsewhere , The rooms were excelente
185491,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, The hotel is new very well located I got upgraded so I suppose the room I got was bigger than the standard ones The staff was really nice and helpful In a word the whole environment was very pleasant 
185492,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Nothing, Located in an elegant and quiet area well served close to restaurants bars supermarkets shops Staff very kind and prepared Clean rooms and brand new furniture Great shower 
185493,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, The room was charming with lovely details and cleanliness was top notch The staff were wonderfully welcoming and chatty and went out of their way to be helpful to us 
185494,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, NA, Staff were very friendly and they had upgraded us to a junior en suite free of charge because we arrived earlier than our check in time and were sent away for 2hours 
185495,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, had this booked as a birthday present for a co worker agreed with the hotel in advance to be charged for the room from my card and also the hotel promised a box of french macaroons which never happened i have all email correspondence to prove to anyone that the hotel is nothing like to picture the communication is brilliant in email only not in real life and on top of that my friend has woke up in the morning with flooded toilet that was leaking somewhere from the back all night not to forget bland breakfast very very disapointed, confortable bed
185496,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, The hotel had everything we needed Perfectly clean good size for Paris rooms with comfortable beds not noisy coffee maker in the room safety deposit box iron board to use upon request good breakfast and last but not least attentive staff Close to Notre Dame public transportation Near shops restaurants grocery stores to get something to snack or drink 
185497,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Nothing I could fault , The location was amazing Rooms were beautiful and very comfortable especially for a solo traveller Felt very safe also Wouldn t hesitate to come back when I return to Paris 
185498,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Na, Fantastic location Walking distance to Luxembourg gardens Notre Dame St Chapelle Louvre as well as market stalls Latin quarter and cheese and charcuterie shops Beautiful rooms comfortable bed and lovely service 
185499,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Actually everything was more than perfect until the last day of our stay Last day the lady at the reception desk asked me and my fiance that we need a taxi for airport transport We said ok and left the hotel to use our last day When we came back to take our luggages the driver was waiting for us inside the hotel Due to my previous negative experiences as a tourist I asked the driver about the fee and offered him 55 which was a fixed fee that we paid when we arrived the city The driver also confirmed the fee but on the highway he locked the doors of the car and threated us to pay additional 15 We ended up the trip at the police station cause we did not want to pay an additional fee that we did not ever talked before We were already missing our flight to Istanbul cause the issue was not resolved even in the police station so I called the hotel to asked them being witness cause all the negotiation process before the trip occured infront of the lady at the reception Unfortunately we did not get enough support from her and we had to pay 15 in order to catch our flight We really felt cheated and just writing this comment to warn everyone please be aware about the taxi company that the hotel is in cooperation ,No Positive
185500,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Free Wifi code was given only for one equipment , Best location in Paris Very close to Notre Dame and metro stations Lots of restaurants and cafes nearby Room and hotel decoration is very nice Beds are very very comfortable Very clean room 
185501,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The lobby was pretty small and so was the elevator but I guess this is Paris The rooms were considerably large , The location was perfect A short walk from touristic places The staff were very helpful and friendly I can t judge the facilities considering we didn t stay in the hotel much The beds were comfortable 
185502,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, I expected more from breakfast for that room price there is no place to put hygiene products in the shower you have to keep them on the floor and also shower drain is very poor as already mentioned in other reviews I also had a flood in bathroom And I know it s Paris but still I think it s overpriced , Excellent location friendly staff perfect room design and cleanliness I was also happy to get upgrade to room with bath 
185503,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The wifi is advertised as free but don t expect it to work Also don t expect the management or the hotel personnel to do anything about it when you bring it to their attention We observed the front desk staff giving us the impression that it was a known problem that has never been addressed We would have been more than happy to pay for wifi as it is such a useful service when traveling If we knew about it beforehand we would have chosen a different hotel At the end of our stay we tried to get some compensation for the inconvenience of not having a functional network but it was refused Everything else was fairly average reasonable I would say with the plenty of choices offered nowadays by Airbnb and more guest friendly hotels think twice before booking this one ,No Positive
185504,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Just got back from a fantastic trip for my daughters 18th birthday Couldnt fault this hotel rooms were spotless beds so comfortable and staff really helpful Its in a brilliant location in the latin quater plenty to do and see locally and really close to the metro station for easy transport for sightseeing quiet of a night which was lovely and we felt really safe Would definately stay in this hotel again if i visit Paris again in the future 
185505,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, They have an issue with wifi dropping off from time to time but this won t put me off coming back, This hotel is such a great find The location is excellent and rooms impeccable I have been there twice and will go again 
185506,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, i like it very much the location is wonderful and service is making me fell like home The most important is that the room is new and clean I will choose this one next time when i come to Paris 
185507,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Very unpredictable wifi often didn t work at all , The room and hotel was perfect the staff were great and very helpful The white rabbit alice in wonderland theme is captured amazingly and makes you feel like you are indeed in an alternate world away from the busy streets of Paris
185508,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, The hotel is located in the center of Paris and it os easy to go anywhere With a lot of restaurants around I was never worried about eating The staff are friendly and helpful They can always try their best to help you and get what you need The room was lovely I really had a good week I will definitely recommend you to my friends and colleagues 
185509,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Our only complaint was a very small closet for a 7 day stay but not likely that most travelers stay that long , Great location very clean and comfortable 
185510,Hotel le Lapin Blanc,No Negative, Great location walking distance to Notre Dame and direct RER line from the airport Many shops and caf s nearby Nice design very quiet room with comfortable bed Good WI FI service
185511,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The drainage does not function well I thought it s only our room like this at first but my friend s room has the same problem Don t know why this could happen in such a well designed hotel Every time we took showers the water just wouldn t go down and ran over the bathroom which is very annoying , Great design Clean room Kind staff We enjoyed staying here very much The handsome kindly helped us call a large cab to the airport on our day of leaving My hubby is a interior designer and he loves the design here a lot Many details in this room Definitely worth the price 
185512,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Bad wifi experience First night was totally nonfunctional then was fixed the next day but too painfully slow to do any meaningful web searches Had to go out and rent a hotspot , Great location and good room layout 
185513,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Room was small Toilet was behind sliding door within a metre of the bed which made it feel like you were sat on end of the bed when well you get the picture Stupidly slow wifi , Decore cleanliness and location were good

185516,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, Showers in the bedroom open no privacy ok if traveling with partner but older children not happy to shower with others in room , Bed was so comfortable Great with interconnecting room for five people 
185517,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, we had booked 2 x single rooms for our business trip On arrival were told one of our rooms was double booked as the staff had printed out the booking form on a double sided page and only booked one room realizing their mistake only the day before our arrival however no one called us in advance of our arrival We were told a room had been booked at another 4 hotel just round the corner The substitute hotel was good but it was disappointing that we were not in the same hotel and added unnecessary check in time to our already busy trip We should have been told when the mistake was spotted , The rooms were clean as described and comfortable The design is modern and fresh The concierge spoke fluent English and was very helpful and polite which is refreshing 
185518,Hotel le Lapin Blanc, The only thing I would find fault with is that there was nowhere to hang towels and no shelving in the shower to put toiletries , Location perfect for sightseeing shopping and places to eat and the hotel exceeded our expectations
