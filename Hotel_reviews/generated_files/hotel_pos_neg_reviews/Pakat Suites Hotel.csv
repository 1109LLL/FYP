382448,Pakat Suites Hotel, No kettle in the room Difficult to adjust the AC to get a comfortable temperature Did not get wake up call requested on day of leaving, Close to bevedere Excellent restaurant Sperl close to hotel and a good cafe nearby too Tramline to city centre close by Easy train ride to Vienna airport from hauptbanof station which was 10 minute walk from hotel
382449,Pakat Suites Hotel, Not very close to public transportation for family with toddlers or babies There was no coffee tea facilities in room Free breakfast would have been good for the price that we paid , Room was very cosy and luxurious 
382450,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is 5 min walking far from the underground and 20 min walking from the city center Jacques at the reception is really kind and helpfull more than the tourist info point 
382451,Pakat Suites Hotel, The room air conditioner and safety vault did not work Ceiling was slanted and at night getting up from the bed my wife hit her head to the ceiling twice while getting up from the bed , Initially assigned room was horrible although reservation was made about 3 months in advance We had to argue with hotel staff to get our rooms changed Rooms air conditioner did not work and ceilings were slanted and Was for better spacing It was unfortunate that hotel staff initially refused to do anything and we had to insist and had to threat the staff thst we would give a poor rating on internet Only after that the staff agreed to change our rooms 
382452,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, A friendly well managed hotel 15 min walk through quiet neighborhood to main train station Hauptbahnhof and subway line 1 Five min walk to Belvedere palace 
382453,Pakat Suites Hotel, Unfriendly untrustworthy unreliable staff Traveling with a 4 year old kid I asked for late check out the receptionist told me it nor ally would be 10 but this time it would be for free until 2 30 pm We found lot of traffic and checked out at 3 15 pm the new receptionist charged 30 formlate check out He did not listen to my explanations but mistreated me in front of other customers I spent almost 90 nights a year traveling 6 pr 7 times a year to Vienna and I have never felt so disrespected Travelers be advised there are much better options with friendly stuff better located and with good breakfast and cheaper AVOID THIS PLACE , When you aremistreated by the staff you don t like anything Pakat management should know this Awful experience overall 
382454,Pakat Suites Hotel, My room was downgraded without telling us I was looking for the sofa bed and finally learned from the staff that my room was downgraded The hotel staff manager then told me that they would pay me back the difference 18 euro despite my poor girl friend step on a sofa instead of a sofa bed ,No Positive
382455,Pakat Suites Hotel, I m a neat freak so I always find something which I don t like in terms of cleanliness , Nice room with a stylish bathroom tiles in dark grey colour The staff is super friendly and responsive Compliments to the team 
382456,Pakat Suites Hotel, Pillows Our room had two areas suite side so could fit at least 3 people tub shower on one side of room and toilet on other just a little awkward Several people around us smoked since they weren t allowed to in their rooms they were constantly on their balcony this meant we smelled smoke in our room and couldn t enjoy our balcony Kitchen lacked utensils etc, Staff were very nice Clean Breakfast was wonderful hot and cold choices Bed comfortable Room spacious Wi fi good Small kitchen very nice Toiletries
382457,Pakat Suites Hotel, Kitchen facilities were advertised and on arrival not even a kettle and coffee cup were available this was very disappointing , The location suited us as it was quiet but within easy access of bus and trams 
382458,Pakat Suites Hotel, I would have liked someone constantly at the reception and not an empty desk all the time The room is spatious has a nice large bath tub and a large shower The toilet is separate from the bathroom When I think about a business hotel I would expect a full mini bar not an empty fridge like we had Also a espresso machine and a water heater some tea or coffee capsules well all of this things were unfortunately missing As well as a bottle of water which is seen in the most hotels these days but not here The beds are really confortable maybe a too soft mattress and pillows for some We had a lovely breakfast everything was there and delicious , Overall we liked the position near to s tram station and 15min walk away from a metro station 2 supermarkets and a nice restaurant for a specific Vienna breakfast are near 
382459,Pakat Suites Hotel, Minibar would have been nice I do expect this in a 4 star hotel There was a fridge but it was empty A coffee and tea maker would be a nice touch as well Please do wash the curtains of the breakfast area as they really need a wash Or simply remove them , What a fantastic staff We got stranded on Christmas eve because our booked restaurant decided to be closed without informing us The staff came to the rescue and found us an excellent replacement Cleaning lady passed by EVERY day The size of the room was something I ve only seen in executive or presidential suites BIG Excellent wifi Sound proof Direct access to the elevator Good breakfast english and continental 
382460,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, I enjoyed staying in this hotel because very good location in the center very quiet nice new design in the apartment delicious breakfast underground parking place very kind and professional personal in reception 
382461,Pakat Suites Hotel, This is not 5 star hotel There was nothing in mini bar no possibility to make coffee in suit no extra mile for guests Only basic things like shampoo and soap On pictures on booking it looked like very luxury suit but when you enter the door it was far behind 5 stars Not even one small carpet in the suit overall gave very cold impression , Bath and shower extremely polite blond lady working on reception desk
382462,Pakat Suites Hotel, Room was a bit outdated obviously not refurbished recently No mini bar in the room not even forks knives spoons in the room only 3 glasses why 3 for 2 people Why glasses were different No interesting view you look at some cheap building across the small street No restaurant at the hotel , Just 5 7 minutes from Karlsplatz the room was clean warm convenient storage facilities nice bathroom 
382463,Pakat Suites Hotel, The breakfast which was OK cost 16 euro per person more expansive than any of the nearby restaurants No one bothered to tell us that at any point before we checked out nor was there a sign or any other form of disclosure about the matter We were told at check in that Breakfast will be served over there between x hour and y hour and that led us to believe that it was free as accustomed in hotels at our country of origin , The staff is friendly and the rooms were nice 
382464,Pakat Suites Hotel, No minibar Not very close to city center 10 15 minutes to metro station , Nice and large apartments good taste furnishing mattres comfortable Stillish I stayed several times in there quality was constant 
382465,Pakat Suites Hotel, I booked apartments with breakfast that included in the price I was very disappointed during check out when I should pay for breakfast additional price it spoiled all impression of the hotel unfortunately , Good location Very big and comfortable apartments Good wi fi Garage parking
382466,Pakat Suites Hotel, No complaints , I had the suite on the top floor which is very spacious nicely decorated and the best thing is the air conditioning it was 30 Celsius outside On top of that the mostly female staff at the reception in the bar and at breakfast were very charming and helpful I will choose this place again for sure 
382467,Pakat Suites Hotel, It s 15 minutes walking to the dowtown , The hotel is very clean with a modern apearance the furniture seemed new The bedroom is very big with a rea for TV separeted from bed The street is very calm and quiet Very nice hotel to stay 
382468,Pakat Suites Hotel, We have absolutely no complaints at all we would definitely stay there again if we return to Vienna , We found all the breakfast items excellent extremely good choice The bed was very comfy much better than a lot of hotels we stay in 
382469,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, It s not right in the middle of the city but it s very close to a tram line and it s a nice easy walk to get to most things The hotel was very quiet while we were there didn t see any other guests 
382470,Pakat Suites Hotel, The location is about 1 km from the Vienna Central station the walking is ok but it is not near, I like it that it is an apartment and it has kitchen Having to travel with a baby and need to prepare food so the kitchen is very helpfull
382471,Pakat Suites Hotel, Air conditioning functioned poorly ill equipped kitchen no toaster microwave non functioning oven, Evening receptionist modern facility Bathrooms
382472,Pakat Suites Hotel, Nice kitchen with no utilities Would be helpful if some utilities are added No kettle knives forks pot pan ect What is use of self catering without these Surely do not expect every guest to bring their own , Staff very helpful and professional Good location Easy walking distance to Belvedere and Karls Platz Good spread for breakfast Beautiful rooms 
382473,Pakat Suites Hotel, It is a bit pricey We didn t have breakfast it costs 16 EUR person and there are not so many options in the area just one small cafe in front of the hotel which serves only coffee no food pastry available but this is not a huge issue we bought some groceries and kept it in the minibar It might be nice to have a kettle in the room to at least prepare some tea coffee The neighborhood is not really lively embassies and residential area so if you are searching for coffees restaurants and night life this might not be the best choice for you , Rooms are quiet huge luminous and comfortable very well designed and adequately equipped Staff is available and friendly and they tried to accommodate all our requests Location is also fine the tram station Belvedere is right at the corner metro station is 10 minutes walking and in 20 minutes you can walk to the city center A very good place to explore Vienna if you are searching for a quiet place easy tor reach with public transport and far from the crowd 
382474,Pakat Suites Hotel, Bed is quite soft in fact i do not considered der it a real bed since it had wheels Oh the matresses used are not single ones but individuals put together also not the best choice , Rooms are great in this hotel space properly used 
382475,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, We ve been so many times at Pakat suites but is still keeping a very good level of service and quality rooms Very convenient location and parking is available Definitely is worth to make a choice for hotel 
382476,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was great although no sunny side up eggs hotel location was also great near Belvedere the bed could have been made from one mattress instead of two room was a little bit hot and the air conditioning was on max overall staff was smiling and was very helpful room was clean would recommend 
382477,Pakat Suites Hotel, Location is far from the U Bahn 10 15 min walk but the tram station is just 2 blocks away at the Belvedere Not a 5 star hotel everything is okay but nothing special The attache suite is not bigger than an average hotel room and there are only 2 sports channels on the tv , Rooms clean and nice breakfast very good thanks to the Hungarian ladies staff helpful 
382478,Pakat Suites Hotel, Unfortunately the elevator partially broke down and we were on the upper most floor, The staff was awesome The breakfast was great and the rooms were spacious and like little apartments Very nice 
382479,Pakat Suites Hotel, Room was planned not very comfortable to my opinion a small bedroom and a big lounge room Also it wasn t comfortable to go to a toilet that was also too small room near the room entrance, Staff is very nice especially in evening when we came All our needs very fully satisfied Also good price and location for parking
382480,Pakat Suites Hotel,No Negative, One of the friendliest staff I ve ever met they were very kind to our little daughter playing with her fulfilling all our extra needs during breakfast Room was clean big got a crib without asking for it It looked just like on the pictures usually they don t Bathroom was huge clean and very nice Would recommend this hotel any time
382481,Pakat Suites Hotel, Forgot to tell them that even after making sure the shower door was closed there was a lot of water on the floor room 505 , Separated shower and bath was excellent 
382482,Pakat Suites Hotel, I staed 2days in this hotel but i couldn t open the window for the days because the blind was broken i asked to fix it or change to the other room but the staff said just wait and there is no room anymore and they also reject to refund so i had to wait almost 3hours and finally the repairman came but just fix i couldn t touch the blind if i touch it broken again i m so afraid because this hotel is very clean and the mager s service was very good but they had to check the blind, good and clean facility
382483,Pakat Suites Hotel, the location is a bit lonely their was no cutlery and kitchen equipment although there was an oven in the room but couldn t use it , friendly staff quit location bit far from the main attractions clean hotel with a car parking not for free 
382484,Pakat Suites Hotel, Wifi connection is very poor or non existent most times in the rooms Breakfast although it is optional we found it to be overpriced also at 16 euros per person daily , We liked The hotel location room aspect staff 
382485,Pakat Suites Hotel, We booked a residence suit because we wanted to have a little kitchen in our room When we arrived we saw that there was no kitchen so we complained and they told us that they did not have residence rooms available and that they will fix it the next day I have the impression that if we don t say anything they would have charged us with the residence room price for an inferior category room The next day after we remained them about the room they upgraded us to a better one When we had to pay we told them that for the first night we should pay less as the room where we slept was an inferior one according to the staff we have to pay the same as we have been upgraded at the end we did pay the same But I do not agree with that as all we wanted was a room with a kitchen and we did not ask for the upgrade so if they do not have what we book they should provide us with something better without any extra cost and if we have to use an inferior category room because their mistake we should pay less for that night Internet did not work very well the strongest wifi signal we got in our room did not work we called to tell them and they said that they knew and that they will call a technician in 5 nights we stayed there they did not fix it We could use another wifi with a very little strength that it just worked in a little part of the room For the price we paid we expected a better service , Location is good close to a metro the central station and the city centre 
382486,Pakat Suites Hotel, My wife and I both love walking so it was good for us but if you don t it could be a little far out for some things , My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel our room even had a seperate toilet shower and bath very convenient Friendly staff would recommend 
382487,Pakat Suites Hotel, The value for money was good but the location was a bit of a walk from the main city centre The upside was that it was literally down the street from the Belvedere museum which houses the most famous Klimt artwork Wifi is like in most European city hotels dreadful , The rooms are clean and the area is very quiet 
382488,Pakat Suites Hotel, Nothing to complain about Overall a very good hotel for the weekend , Facilities and free wifi were great and staff were very friendly and accommodating Location was quite and a bit off the beaten track but not too bad if you have a car
