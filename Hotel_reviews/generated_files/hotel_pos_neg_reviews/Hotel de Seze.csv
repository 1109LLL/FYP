63149,Hotel de Seze, The only part which let the hotel down a bit is that we had a lack of sleep due to how hard the bed was but that was our only criticism , We had a spacious street view room with a huge flat screen tv which had a free movie channel which was brilliant The room was extremely clean and we enjoyed the added extra of Clarins toiletries which was lovely The location is perfect too 
63150,Hotel de Seze,No Negative, A fabulous buffet breakfast was offered with high quality fresh food and excellent choice The location of the hotel is perfect for being close to the Louvre many other central Paris attraction The spa was a wonderful extra to have in the hotel Definitely work using 
63151,Hotel de Seze, Rooms slightly small but have everything you could need Have to make space for two suitcases for two people, Very easy to access coming from overseas roissybus to opera district and a short walk Much easier and cheaper than a taxi
63152,Hotel de Seze, Nothing, Very friendly and helpful staff cosy rooms modern bathroom complementary nespresso coffee and tea great accessability of all major sightseeing spots 
63153,Hotel de Seze, The rooms were quite small with the toilet separate from the sink The hotel was definitely not a 4 star hotel it was more of a rennovated 2 1 2 to 3 star hotel There are very few restaurants in the neighborhood and this would be a better business neighborhood than leisure spot Housekeeping was spotty some days the rooms were cleaned really well some days they were only half cleaned Breakfast was what you would expect in a 2 3 star hotel Staff was helpful but had limited knowledge of the facilities or the area There is no concierge and some of the desk staff have spotty English so make sure you are only asking for basic things like a taxi or to check in or out etc Although the rooms are recently renovated they are already starting to show wear and tear Our room had stains on the sofa carpet and chairs etc , Bed was comfortable Room was recently rennovated 
63154,Hotel de Seze, Breakfast too expensive at 20EU Seperate toilet in room 20 too small like an aircraft size , Location value modern cleanliness Highly recommended
63155,Hotel de Seze, Airco was not really working very well getting hot water in the shower took a long time, Perfect location nice pie and coffee in the afternoon friendly staff
63156,Hotel de Seze,No Negative, Very chic boutique hotel It s centrally located to dining shopping and Paris cultural attractions The hotel staff was very friendly as well as accommodating 
63157,Hotel de Seze, No onsite room service Room service is ordered in the hotel but is delivered from a company out of the hotel so there is a minimum spend , Lovely rooms with great bathroom and fantastic shower Good location Friendly staff
63158,Hotel de Seze, If I had to the reception was very plain for a 4 star , The room was comfortable and well designed The staff especially Alex were very helpful and had wonderful recommendations 
63159,Hotel de Seze, Slightly larger room for a 4 would be expected, Room OK size for downtown Paris Large bed Nicely decorated and clean Large bathroom shower no bath Staff very helpful Great location minutes from La Madeleine Opera Concorde Place Vendome Quiet Free wifi good quality
63160,Hotel de Seze, You have to return your key to front desk every time you re leaving and ask for the key every time you re back It s a bit inconvenience for us , Perfect location Located only 3 minutes by walk from Metro Madeleine The room is very well decorated with facilities clean and stylish we really enjoyed the stay There s a free snackbar on the lobby which you could take a rest and enjoy some drink and snack for free 
63161,Hotel de Seze, Nothing, The reception team were always helpful and multi lingual Whilst a small hotel the staff to visitor ratio was high so everything was always tidy clean and a pleasant experience We took the Executive Room as rooms in Paris are always small and it was a good size new facilities and modern even a lift straight to our door The bathroom had a TV to watch in the bath as well as a massive shower area Breakfast was excellent self service from freshly prepared produce through a modern nibbles style but there was plenty of choice and eat as much as you want Cake and coffee provide free on an afternoon The location was near to the main shopping area 5 minute walk and very quiet from any road noise I would recommend this hotel with 5 stars 
63162,Hotel de Seze,No Negative, The front desk staff were extremely helpful Our train was at 5pm and we were kindly given one of our rooms past the checkout time as long as we needed it to keep luggage in and return to just before the train thank you Also it seems a small thing but so nice to have good shampoo and conditioner 
63163,Hotel de Seze, Room a bit small but really so what We were never there Bath was more than adequate Bed very comfortable TV had movies in English Use the elevator not the stairs , Staff was the best Helped with anything you needed All spoke more than acceptable English Location superb Madeleine Metro 100 feet from front door Multiple caf s nearby Breakfast superb at hotel

63166,Hotel de Seze, Price of the mini bar, Small ideally located and beautiful hotel What made this hotel was how helpful and willing the staff were particularly Leo who made recommendations for where to eat and even helped make our New Years Eve the best one ever by finding us the ideal venue to see in 2016 Clearing products and velvet walls were a nice touch
