18936,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The first room we were put in superior was lovely and had separate shower and bath unfortunately there were noisy children running around above us and I asked to be moved The second room appeared smaller and without separate shower which was disappointing Please note that the first room s shower drain I think it was 406 smelt terrible and we were able to detect the odour as soon as the door to the room was open and it was even worse when we went into the bathroom The drain needs changing or at least a professional clean Both rooms showed wear and tear We didn t dine in the hotel as there was so much choice elsewhere however if the prices had been more competitive then I think we would have done , We noticed there was a bed topper and this was really appreciated and made a difference thank you The toiletries supplied were lovely as were the slippers and bathrobes Free wifi fantastic Tea and coffee supplies were great too The spa and gym facilities were the reason we booked the hotel and were very good but it would have been better without children having so much access time The locality of the hotel was a bonus and near the St Paul s underground and 5 mins walk from Barts Hospital which is why we were there in the first place We felt safe walking around in the evening and took a sneaky peak at St Paul s from the 7th Floor of the hotel really great view 
18937,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I didn t leave my card details when I first checked in and wanted to use the mini bar I called down to reception to add my card details but couldn t get through I called 4 5 times with no reply so called room service and explained I wanted to add my card onto the room so I could use the mini bar but they couldn t help and offered to put me through I was then on hold again for 5 minutes without answer in the end I gave up as I didn t want to get dressed to walk down to reception for what should have been a simple task ,No Positive
18938,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Given the price of the room I didn t like having to pay for a bottle of water out of the mini bar it should be complimentary , Room was v comfortable clean Breakfast is great Staff very helpful 
18939,Grange St Paul s Hotel, the bed was a little too firm for me could not get a comfortable night s sleep, 24 hour cocktail bar restaurants on the property location free wi fi bathroom
18940,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Very nice hotel and very convenient for the city It was a hot day when I arrived and the air con in my room worked Happy days Very quiet room nicely furnished
18941,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room was gloomy and tired The bathroom was smaller than expected I would not stay there again , The reception were ok but could have been more welcoming 
18942,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Initial room saw us on the ground floor where we d always have to keep the curtains closed because of people walking passed and an unfortunate view They kindly moved us But we found ourselves then in an internal room with no natural light no sight of the sky and again had to always close curtains anyway as there are people directly opposite , Room service food was good Location is good And areas outside of rooms are good 
18943,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Couldn t quite work out how to adjust the temperature of the room Would have been good to have access to mini bar fridge, Staff were very hospitable still had access to spa facilities after checking out
18944,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was great We loved the location Right in central London but not as busy as some areas Restaurants and the river and public transport nearby We didn t have breakfast included and it was expensive so we ate out nearby The swimming pool etc were lovely and a real treat 
18945,Grange St Paul s Hotel, That i didn t stay longer, The location of the hotel was great 2 min or so walk to the St Paul s cathedral and lots of restaurants nearby you can visit If you plan to travel somewhere a little further away there is London Underground station which is not so far Takes 2 or so mins walk to St Paul s central station from the hotel and you can begin your adventure to the destination your looking to go to Rumpus Room rooftop bar is another awesome lounge we visited at night Just across the Blackfriars bridge Worth going to if you like city views at night and partying in style Also it was a birthday trip I asked for a small note wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday They went the extra mile and added a cake along side with that note Thanks to all staff and the hotel for making it a awesome stay 
18946,Grange St Paul s Hotel, AC was hot around 25 5 26 C degree unable to adjust lower bed room was facing the dining room only one upper floor different easily seen thru while the lights on we can watch them eating too cups mugs were not cleaned on the 1st day no serious attention to guests request almost late to airport the small taxi came while we ordered a mini van , Nothing mostly resto cafes shops closed early because business area after office hours they are quieter 
18947,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I would say this hotel was more of a 4 hotel Check in was clumsy the card was taken twice incorrectly and we even had a phone call during the day asking us to return and re do the card The whole process seemed confused and time consuming A negative first impression The rooms overlooked the breakfast atrium and other peoples rooms This felt quite strange and not something I had realised when booking One of the reasons I booked the hotel was due to the pictures of the large terrace over looking St Pauls Cathedral as this was a leisure visit with friends and there was nice weather planned When we checked in we found this had been hired for a private party so we never got to see this Instead we chose the bar in the lounge for a pre show drink and quick bite to eat The waiter was bordering on rude and the service was lack luster Food was ok to be fair and as expected In summary this hotel would be fine for a business stay and is 1 step above a Premier inn but fell short of my expectations and the price paid , Great Location Modern Clean rooms
18948,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Check in took too long Also they would not let anyone check in early not even by an hour I had to wait in the lounge and line up all over again to obtain a keycard The bathroom needs work I could not get cold water from the sink The glass partition along the tub is too small It runs only 1 3 the length of the tub itself leaving your backside exposed The shower head is not adjustable It only sprays straight down about a foot from the wall So to get under the water you have to stand at the very front of the tub pressed closely to the wall where much of the water is being sprayed The bed linens were not very soft , Rooms were quiet I had a lot of privacy My cocktail in the lounge was good 
18949,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Family room was a little cramped especially for 350 00 per night , Top location right next to St Pauls and the tube was a 5 min walk staff are very professional and pool is a nice bonus especially in London 
18950,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room was smaller than expected Bathroom was small and prone to shower flooding Air conditioning was awkward to operate and noisy Room was very dark quite different to expectation based on booking com photo The room rate was now significantly lower than we paid feel hard done by , Location
18951,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing we didn t like, Beautiful 5 hotel and facilities friendly and professional staff who go the extra mile Great view of St Paul s Cathedral 
18952,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Check in time wasn t clear then on arrival atg around 12 30 we were told it was 2 00 so put luggage in storage and returned at 2 00 to be told it was 3 00 on a Friday when I pointed out that we had been told 2 00 the staff denied it and the member of staff said she had definitely said 2 00 which was untrue this put the hotel in a bad light to begin the stay ,No Positive
18953,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I was bitterly disappointed as a major selling point the roof terrace there were no facilities You had to take your drinks from the ground floor to the 7th floor in order to enjoy the view of St Paul s In addition one of the two lifts were out of action on Saturday Night The experience was not value for money I entertained some friends in the evening and it was a let down , The only good things were the staff were very courteous and the location served my purpose 
18954,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room we had on the first night overlooked the breakfast area and with no nets we had to keep the curtain closed which made the room very dark I think for a room like this nets is a VERY obvious thing we were on the 2nd floor so only a few feet away from bored couples looking up and basically waving , The gym was excellent
18955,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was good but a little chaotic and expensive as an extra, The hotel was a great base to relax after a busy day touring The beds were very comfortable The rooms were clean and pleasant The surroundings calm pretty and relaxing A wonderful contrast to the city Would definitely stay again 
18956,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I booked this night for my birthday and I had the worst birthday ever the staff did not explain anything properly so I was over charged I am allergic to cheese and my food had cheese in it even though I said remove the cheese On the website there is a lot of false advertising Was not happy at all this was one of the worst birthdays I ve ever had , The cleanliness
18957,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Warning false advertising a double bed when they push two single beds together SHOWER FORCES YOU TO STAND IN THE PLUGHOLE AND STILL MISS MOST OF THE WATER AS THE SHOWER HEAD IS FIXED AND POINTED AT THE WALL WISH I HAD TAKEN PHOTOS VIDEOS THIS IS NOT EVEN 3 STAR NEVERMIND 5 ,No Positive
18958,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Everything was fantastic , Convenient location We arrived early in the morning after a 24 hour flight and were upgraded to an apartment a block away from the actual hotel This was fantastic as it allowed us to book in at 8 am take a shower and begin enjoying London Thank you for a wonderful stay We were so happy with everything Would book with you again 
18959,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The fact there was no parking at the hotel but where we did park We only paid 2 50 for 18 hours of parking Was more than chuffed considering we was in central London, The hotel was lush
18960,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The air con doesn t work great it was the hottest day of the year and my room was a bit stuffy , It was clean comfortable and modern Rooms were a really good size and the staff were really friendly 
18961,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff where surly and barely spoke especially in the bar area the lady who served us snacks and drinks at lunchtime was basically rude The evening bar manager was the same unwelcoming and looked like he didn t want to be there Receptionists at check were pleasant and helpful ,No Positive
18962,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, the breakfast was fantastic and the spa was spectacular me and my partner had a massage each and was very impressed then we spent about an hour in the spa and it was delightful
18963,Grange St Paul s Hotel, This is supposed to be an upmarket restaurant but it looks like it is cutting corners The style of the interior decorations especially in the public areas is frightful , The bed was comfortable 
18964,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bathroom was a little tired and so we re the spa facilities The room was noisy due to music coming from somewhere in the hotel , The room was comfy enough and the staff were friendly and attentive 
18965,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, My flight from Japan arrived at Heathrow early in the morning and I arrived at the hotel around 9 00am The staff kindly allowed me early check in and offered me a suite room with no extra cost We also enjoyed their swimming pool and sauna 
18966,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The shower leaked water through the bottom of the frame We didn t complain about it because we kept forgetting about it We didn t spend a lot of time at the hotel The tiles in the bathroom look like they need a good scrubbing , I love that they left treats for us the first day because it was a birthday girls trip The staff was very helpful The English breakfast was great 
18967,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room was a triple room and facilities supplied were for 3 people with exception of cups glasses supplied for 2 spoke to reception each day and was told would sort but on both mornings had to call room service as wasn t sorted Alarm went off both nights one night due to guest smoking in non designated smoking area other set off accidently but don t know by who , Location was very good 
18968,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The air conditioning in the room could not be set below 22 degrees well I couldn t set it below and at the time we stayed the weather was warm and as there was no windows to open we switched the air conditioning off Some people may appreciate a very warm room we can t, Good location Convenient to transport system Friendly staff Excellent leisure activities 
18969,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing, Right next to St Pauls lots of bars in hotel and within short walking distance of tube St Pauls Breakfast is expensive as expected but we went to Cafe Rouge on the corner 9 95 per person and views of St Pauls Would loved to have used the many facilities more but we were out most of the time as we did a walking tour in the evening from St Pauls tube with London Walks Hidden pubs of Clerkenwell Fire alarm at 5 30am was not pleasant but what can you do Someone smoking in a non smoking area Hotel is lovely and clean and rooms comfortable and well equipt I think you would appreciate this hotel if making use of all facilities including Spa It is a shame to only use it fleetingly 
18970,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bed was very hard Room was very nice but air con not working and fire alarm went off twice during the night over two nights waking us up on two occasions ,No Positive
18971,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff Poor service Small room Bathroom poor no bidet shower flooded bathroom no hand held shower poor extraction handle missing off shower control , Location Good common facilities
18972,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We were charged an extra 34 for an early check in when we had paid 560 for two rooms for 1 night I thought that was ridiculous especially as one of the rooms they downgraded Upon returning to the hotel the security guard was rude and refused to let us in initially as each person didn t have there own room key We stated our names and room numbers and he still made us wait for 5 minutes Not happy After that at 2 30am reception called our room about an incident I knew nothing about and started barraging me with questions whilst I was half a sleep Then they called back 2 3 minutes later and tried having another conversation with me in the middle of the night And finally to top it off the fire alarm was set off at 5 30am causing us all to leave our room I was very very disappointed and cannot display how angry I was that evening Disgusting ,No Positive
18973,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Not happy with second night s stay Little sleep Short fire alarm at midnight Loud noise in room at 315 am Staff assisted but when we spoke to staff on telephone staff hung up on us during conversation Noise started again 15 minutes later Noise related to air conditioning which was turned off and we were provided with fan Planned to leave hotel at 8 am Management offered apologizes but nothing else to make up for bad experience Left the hotel unsatisfied and tired We will not be returning to hotel , Clean and nice property 
18974,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The non smoking room smelt as if someone had been smoking in there recently , The bed was very comfy and there are some good restaurants nearby so no need to eat and drink in the hotel The hotels location is also great to get out about and explore the surrounding area and the rest of London 
18975,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Spent the day in the spa except the hammam suite was not in use There was a sign on the door of the suite saying that it was booked for a private party although we did not see anyone leave or enter the hammam suite all day Nobody could withstand the heat in the suite for more than 20 minutes let alone all day I suspect the suite might have been broken but instead of admitting this a phoney excuse was given I suspect anyway Also when in the spa a group of young male teenagers proceeded to take photos of themselves in the pool and using the facilities I found this rather uncomfortable and no member of staff seemed to approach them on why they were taking pictures in a spa I just didn t feel it was up to 5 star standard unfortunately However room was lovely and comfortable and the location is great for the theatre district , Room was lovely very stylish and bed was very comfortable 
18976,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I was on the fifth floor but unfortunately the view outside the window wasn t great just another building blocking my view , Stayed here several times staff are so welcoming upgraded me to a bigger room and surprised me with birthday cup cakes fantastic service 
18977,Grange St Paul s Hotel, When we tried to run a tab at the bar the requirement was that our credit card was to be taken away and kept at the cash counter According to the european laws at no time can the credit card be taken out of the sight of the customer A solution has to be found perhaps a pre authorisation without the customer having to part with the credit card , Location 
18978,Grange St Paul s Hotel, View could have been a little better Looked out onto side road but could see St Paul s cathedral when getting close to window , Cupcake left in room for my partners birthday celebration was a nice touch Nice quiet room good blackout curtains and comfy bed Luxurious feel
18979,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The rooms are a little dark but we only stayed one night so it didn t really matter, The hotel is in a great location We had a side viiew of St pauls The bed was large and comfortable The glass atrium in the centre of the hotel makes it very bright and airy 
18980,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Should have bigger tv it was very small Location is not central litle bit far from some attraction and main streets but busses and underground is just steps from the hotel, Staff were welcoming and smiling each time i enter the hotel hotel is nice and clean Starbucks inside the hotel Good size room
18981,Grange St Paul s Hotel, For a 5 star hotel the technology in the room is really out of date the TV was tiny and they asked for a 50 deposit just so we could unlock the pin to use the Bluetooth We only wanted to watch catch up TV on the bigger screen rather than our phone but we were told the 50 may take up to 6 weeks to return There reasoning was we could watch lots of movies and run up a big bill Ridiculous and I refused to pay it on principle I ve stayed in many lesser starred hotels in London where movies are free and you can use an I pad or such like to control lights TV etc This place needs to catch up with the times , Very comfy bed spacious and sound proofed room sauna and pool 
18982,Grange St Paul s Hotel, in the bathroom two of each bathroom products would have been appreciated as it was a double room with two single beds , the staff were polite and helpful the beds were very comfortable and roomy any minor inconvenience was dealt with immediately 
18983,Grange St Paul s Hotel, For such a superb location be prepared to pay the price not just of the room but all the extras breakfast Bar room service etc , Fantastic location within easy walking distance of St Pauls tube and very close to the Millenium Footbridge over the Thames Superb facilities modern clean customer friendly facilities Staff Professional friendly and willing to help Excellent room with a free upgrade on check in
18984,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room was too small even we had upgraded the mirror inside the cupboard was broken and the amount of dust not clean behind and top of the TV was not cleaned for a very long time the cables behind the tv had so much covered in dust , We like the location of the hotel and the front of reception staff were all friendly
18985,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The room service was quick and polite the beds were incredibly comfy and the shower was amazing especially after a long flight Despite arriving early I was given an early check in at no extra cost 
18986,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing , The hotel and facilities were fabulous The room was spacious and beds very comfortable but the best thing was the shower amazing Really helpful service from the concierge All in all fabulous stay at this hotel 
18987,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only thing that was disappointing was that we ordered our Full English breakfasts to the room and they were cold Apart from that everything was great , Everything the staff the atmosphere the decoration the Spa treatments are all fantastic
18988,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff were very rude for the style of the hotel I would say they need to train their staff better at customer service At check in the member of staff just walked off to do something for several minutes without a word to us just left us standing there The rooms were ok but perhaps require some updating as a little out dated , Great location
18989,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing really thought breakfast was a little pricey , Rooms lovely and spacious and very comfy beds Staff very courteous and friendly nothing was to much bother Spa was beautiful and very relaxing second visit to this hotel and looking forward to returning very soon Great central location 
18990,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The view into the atrium of the hotel and that it was limited daylight into the room Variability in friendliness of staff at reception , I enjoyed the gym and the spa The location was fantastic for running along the Thames 
18991,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It was great having ground coffee in the room but it would have been better to have the option of instant coffee including decaffeinated option , Staff were really friendly and helpful gave us an upgrade plus breakfast when we asked at checkin whether a fridge was available in the room We were able to check in early although we hadn t booked this ahead It was a great location for City of London we had planned to visit the Tower of London and Greenwich both of which we could get to easily walking boat After we checked out we could leave our bags and pick up later which meant extra time for sightseeing 
18992,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast at 23 pounds per head is way over the top , Brilliant hotel pricy but worth it Tube 150m away Great location Sky sports in your room 
18993,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It was our 30th Wedding Anniversary and I had let them know so was a bit disappointed that reception did t congratulate us or that there was not a card in the room This was our 3rd visit and I was disappointed that the personal touch seemed to be missing this time , The view of St Paul s is great from our room 428 The bed is large and comfortable and the room is clean 
18994,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Fire alarm went off at 2 30am Not good after you ve just run the London marathon and want to sleep , Attractive contemporary hotel The health club was great as it had a good sized pool and jacuzzi The view of St Pauls from the roof bar was stunning All the staff were very helpful 
18995,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We were asked did we want to get an apartment room but didn t realise it wasn t in the main hotel it was only a 2 minute walk but it wasn t as pleasant as our previous room there , Location and friendly staff
18996,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I was travelling with a colleague on business and we arrived at the hotel at 11 pm local time 1 am for us We had booked a Superior Twin room and noted that when checking in We got a room with one double bed We went back to the reception and asked for a twin room we were assured that the next one is a twin room It was a double We went back to the reception and were then told that Superior Twin in that hotel only comes with one double bed and we need to pay extra to get an Executive room with two beds Alternatively one of us could sleep on the sofa bed in the room We declined and proposed to give us both of the rooms we had already been sent to Regardless we were told that the hotel was fully booked We showed our booking but the staff maintained that according to their web page Superior Twin had just one bed When asked to show a print out of the web page it did not concur their position Until then still no apologies from the staff and no real proposals for solving the situation They obviously had an Executive Twin available but were not offering a free upgrade So we finally proposed that they could pull the double bed apart which they finally agreed to do We got to the third room an hour later The small beds were really uncomfortable since there were no cover mattresses and we got old lumpy blankets We had a third colleague staying at the same hotel She had booked a Superior Double When we got to her room the next morning we realised that she had a Superior Twin So Superior Twin rooms with 2 beds do exist in the hotel and the staff just blatantly lied on sevaral occasions , Great location for a business trip but not for vacation 
18997,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bed was uncomfortable when I asked for the quilt to be changed due to the first one being very thin and lumpy the sent another one the same up to the room,No Positive
18998,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast was cold and very over priced was not happy with it at all and had bad stomach rest of the day oh and one thing that is more of an annoyance really but there were no plug sockets by the bed so couldn t keep phone by bed which I find very annoying Staff were lovely and very willing to help though so no complaints there at all and hotel itself very smart and everything looked nice but the breakfast which i was looking forward to was the biggest let down Only had a tiny amount of cold cooked breakfast that was enough to put me off it really was that bad and sadly it really spoiled the stay , 
18999,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room was abit warm when we first arrived Som, The hotel was very clean and stylish The staff all very friendly and welcoming and the room we stayed in was amazing spacious and immaculate 
19000,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Very clean and elegant looked amazing from the inside and out Great location and our room had a good view of St Pauls Cathedral Spacious rooms and comfortable beds at an extremely good price compared to other upper end hotels in the City Didn t get time to use the spa facilities unfortunately but would definitely recommend this hotel to others 
19001,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing we didn t like really like if I had to pick a very minor detail the route from our room via the dedicated lift to the Spa pool seemed to take us through an area which seemed to be used for storage of boxes etc although this may have been just temporary so no complaints, The Service was excellent throughout our stay and a friendly attitude from the reception staff to the cleaner in the lift and our waiting staff in the lobby bar made it memorable 
19002,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The shower was a disaster style over substance The shower cubicle was small but someone had put in 4 different shower heads which blasted through the poor seal and flooded the floor every time We mentioned it to a member of staff as we left and he didn t seem surprised , Fantastic location great pool and spa area Simple but good sized rooms Reasonably helpful staff some warmer than others 
19003,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Toilets nr reception v poor dirty and unprofessional for hotel of this rating, Great room and floor 720 perfect view of st Paul s and away from lift blocks and noise love the sounds of the cathedral bells
19004,Grange St Paul s Hotel, N a, The consierge service was brilliant all staff were always happy to be of assistance even in early our of morning The spa was lovely and relaxing and good great value for money Spa treatments were fabulous 
19005,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast should of been included at that price Also asked for a room with a view however we had a view of the wall, The staff were very helpful the location was ideal and the rooms where beautiful 
19006,Grange St Paul s Hotel, requested a nice view from room not actioned, bathroom was best I have experienced at any hotel housekeeping exceptional sofa bed made up for child quickly on arrival and not charged extra for good rate for a London hotel room
19007,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Got a supposed upgrade from a superior deluxe room to a studio room in another building which we were not happy about Then when we paid we gave 40 more over to the girl and she didn t count it right and didn t give us the change and when we said to her we have her more she said we didn t and that she counted it twice but we knew we gave her more , Room was nice 
19008,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff were very poor and I was served under cooked poached eggs It took forever to get new eggs and by that time the family had finished their breakfast so we left , Good location
19009,Grange St Paul s Hotel, One particular member of the Reception staff took very long to allocate us a room despite us having arrived earlier checked in and paid Frustrating as we needed to get changed quickly and make a concert in time ,No Positive
19010,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Sauna and laconium in spa facilities did not work For the money I would have expected a bit more variety choices in room tea coffee facilities Did not like view from room feel exposed to atrium area , The beds were comfy and staff nice and helpful
19011,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Fast check in out lovely room very conveniently situated I keep coming back to The Grange St Pauls it s my choice when staying in Central London for business or seeing friends It seems quiet and relaxed as it s not in a main business or tourist spot The hotel offers a just what I need for a short stay clean comfortable room excellent breakfast and 24 hour bar and food All within walking of the City and a short taxi ride from the West End 
19012,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, It didn t really state that the roof top bar in the pictures were for private events only so little deceiving when you imaging sitting there drinking cocktails with the girls 
19013,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The booking in system the rooms don t ever seem to be ready an earlier than 3pm and can be later We had theatre tickets and it meant we were tight for time , Facilities and location 
19014,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff score would have been excellent however had evening drinks in one of the bars and had a bit of attitude from the bar tender Otherwise helpful and welcoming staff , Perfect location for all London tourist destinations Chilled vibe and had a quiet room for central London 
19015,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff could be more attentive professional and better coordinated coordinated When eight people present at the desk pay zero attention to customers busy with their things instead sonething is vlearly going wrong This is the reason why I will not stay here again , The hotel is new with comfortable sound proof rooms 
19016,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was a maintenance issue with our room prior to check in which meant we had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes while it was sorted out, The pool area is gorgeous and the roof terrace is amazing
19017,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, We were moved into the Grange Hotel Suites which were around the corner from the hotel This wasn t a problem for us and the weather was so nice that a brief 1 minute walk to the main hotel was fine to go and get breakfast they had included this free of charge because we were in the suites The bed was very hard but perhaps some people would prefer that Breakfast had a good buffet selection and the location is perfect The roof terrace on the 7th floor gives you a great view of St Paul s and The Shard 
19018,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Being a Londoner I am more than used to paying London alcohol prices in Mayfair Chelsea but charging 18 for a double Hendricks gin and tonic is ludicrous And on top of that it was served in a small catering glass with very little ice We couldn t help but feel this was a complete rip off The Spa was also very messy and not relaxing at all Floats and hoists were left around with rolls of tissues all over the place Not great for a 5 hotel offering spa facilities I will not be coming back to stay in the hotel or to use the spa , It was a birthday surprise and the staff ensured there would be some cupcakes in the room upon our arrival 
19019,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a fantastic central location near St Paul s Cathedral the Tate Modern and the Millennium Bridge We loved having breakfast at Cafe Rouge a block away Great atmosphere great location and a much better value for the money than the hotel breakfast 
19020,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We visited London for my sisters hen do just my mum sister and myself We checked in early at 10am but room wasn t ready so we ventured out and came back at 6pm We then found out our room had been given away so we were offered a double bed and sofa bed room and breakfast for free This was the only room available we were shown the room and it looked dirty and there was a dirty and used coffee cup We were then shown to another room which had to be ok as only other room available apparently We won t be returning in the future , The location was great and hotel was lovely it was just really disappointing how our booking got messed up 
19021,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The property was situated near to a tube station walkable to Southbank and generally in a really lovely location It has a great balance between central but closed off and peaceful the roof terrace is very exclusive and the view of St Paul s is out of this world ,No Positive
19022,Grange St Paul s Hotel, One young lady at the reception was not friendly and did not have an attitude of hospitality Breakfast is just OK but not work the money you can get better breakfast elsewhere Cook doing omlette and other egg dishes was bad just could not cook proerly Could not control the temperature of the bath shower was OK Although I used to stay in this hotel the level of service especiall level of service staff was frankly lower than before , Overall cleanliness and comfort of the room was fine Free use of bathlobe and slippers as well Spa area including swimming pool and gym facility is also clean and excellent Location is superb near to Queen Victorica St and other center business locations 
19023,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our view was a brick wall Towels were thin and scratchy Room could have used a bit of an up date Made two room service orders both were wrong , Location amazing and staff very friendly 
19024,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It always seems too expensive for what you get and not really 5 star standard unless you re in the rooms we can t afford We didn t book breakfast as last time was so disappointing , Wonderfully helpful concierge staff
19025,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The decor was dated and the bath had some chips in it The Starbucks franchise coffee is more expensive than the Starbucks accross the Churchyard, Room was very quiet
19026,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Some prices were a little high esp cocktails and be aware that key cards do not gain entry to every corridor Ask for a map for the car park although it is only 3 mins away you find yourself going in a circle , The room was spacious and light with a beautiful view of St Paul s cathedral especially at night best rooms facing outer side of hotel There are several restaurants to choose from and some great eateries 5 mins across the street The cocktails were first class and the staff were alert and helpful at all times the attention to detail at this hotel was outstanding If you are thinking of using the pool spa or maybe a full body massage this is the spot with several chilled Buddha corridors with no shortage of treatment rooms there are many treatments on offer with staff on hand to offer you beverages and snacks in the beautifully chilled reclining rooms with sofa beds and reading material galore The pool has a ham man and steam jacuzzi as well as sauna area all beautifully finished with sandstone tiles and perfectly kept This hotel is definitely worth a visit and you will come away with a real feel good factor 
19027,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Depending on which staff you spoke to at breakfast some staff were not very good at communicating not responsive to customers needs breakfast tables had missing saucers cutlery etc this let the whole experience down but on the plus side then you got staff who were extremely helpful and went the extra mile Bit too cold in the area by bar nearest the front door, The environment was really nice Very clean hotel Impressed with the way the door man would run to the top of the road to wave down a taxi from the taxi rank round the corner Atrium a fabulous space to sit and relax in and surprisingly not a cold space at all

19036,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The spa and pool is a little small with no lounge area The pool was also a bit cold so you didn t want to hang around in it and without a lounge area you can t really stay in the spa for very long It was also quite busy because of its size , Great quality hotel and very helpful staff Nice late night bar too 
19037,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast slightly chaotic tables very close together Staff at breakfast seemed more interested in clearing tables than attending to guests needs Would have been nice to be greeted at the hotel door and directed to reception which is not immediately obvious , Convenient location comfortable room bar and lounge staff attentive Excellent continental breakfast 
19038,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Concierge very helpful when arranging car to airport Loved the convenience of Starbucks at the lobby Great location for metro access sight seeing some dining having beers nice selection of pubs close by Majority of the places cater to businesses during the day so lots of lunch options 
19039,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Dirt dirt dirt I have never been to such a dirty hotel that is suppose to be 4 or 5 stars Dirty carpets stains on pilows bedding Its was ubelivable like a castle full of dirt and dust I gave up the idea of using spa and pool as I didnt want to risk, The location is amazing The lobby with glass ceiling makes great impression but the dirty sofas carpets etc takes all the good vibe On the contrary the food you can order in the lobby was good 
19040,Grange St Paul s Hotel, When we checked in a staff member placed us in an accessible room without a bath tub or enclosed shower She did not make it clear at the time When we came back later and asked to be placed in a standard room she claimed that she told us and we were changing our minds We corrected her several times and she never admitted she was wrong ,No Positive

19046,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Reception was quite busy and staff tended to continue dealing with previous customer issues even after they had called the next customer over A small issue but it affects the overall experience Additionally cleaning staff ignored me saying Good Morning and didn t smile Again a very minor issue but one which I haven t experienced in other five star hotels , Great location really good value for money facilities were top class The hotel was extremely clean throughout 
19047,Grange St Paul s Hotel, No information telling you that you can be seen undressing in front of your bedroom window assumed it was one way glass Also spa was unavailable apparently should have booked but didn t see anything when I booked online, Location service design of the hotel
19048,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bed dipped down in the middle and felt a bit lumpy which you would not expect for the price paid We did not like having to queue up for a lengthy period of time ca 20 minutes both to check in and to check out There was clearly not enough staff on the desk either time , The location was superb The room was very quiet 
19049,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The window was facing the inside of the atrium and there was a huge neon lit advertising pillar right in front of my window I could not open my curtains VERY dark room There were a couple of mix ups with the room reservation and mini bar Which were eventually rectified , The room was nicely decorated The buffet breakfast was good The location was good on the border of the business district

19056,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was average for the price First day tea was only offered from pre made jugs Only day 2 did we wise up to asking for fresh pot of tea at table Hot buffet was not reflective of the cost whereas the continental was very good There did not seem to be the option to order from a menu which many equiv rated hotels would , Family room worked well for 2 2 Birthday cup cakes for the children were definitely a nice touch Within easy walking distance of family friendly restaurants Clean modern and well presented

19064,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room and en suite bathroom were clean and comfortable However the carpet was worn in one place and lamp shades were cracked creased which detracted from overall good impression , We were visiting St Paul s Cathedral and Covent Garden so worked out very convenient for us 
19065,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast was very poor the hot offer was at best luke warm and what was offered was a poor selection I am astounded that you did not offer hot water and a variety of teas The tea delivered was pretty much undrinkable ,No Positive
19066,Grange St Paul s Hotel, he ipod dock is an extremely old one definitely needs to be updated as I could not plug in my iphone 7 Also the bathroom tap was pretty difficult to figure out but the maintenance people came pretty quick to sort it out , When my boyfriend and I stayed at the Grange they had upgraded us to a queens double bed room which I guess was good The room was nice the bathroom was very clean and had a make mirror We order room service at like 2am and the food had come within 15 20 minutes The chicken wings were the chicken wings I had had in a long time The cheesy garlic bread was also nice 
19067,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Can t think of anything , The breakfast was lovely Very spacious hotel considering it s in the middle of London It takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city Rooms are spacious and has everything you d need 
19068,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff could have been more friendly when greeting us for breakfast We had not booked breakfast and knew this was an extra charge and totally happy to pay but we were greeted in quite an aggressive manner, We were kindly upgraded to an executive room and a twin queen room which was unexpected 
19069,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There is a musty smell in the corridors We changed rooms once because there was also a musty smell in the first room we were in The decor is a little old The carpets It is a 5 star hotel but there was no cleaning service in the evening , The bed was very comfy Pillows perfect for me The shower fantastic with the jets 
19070,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Was dissapoint with are room view , The rooms were a good size and the bathroom was lovely the shower was great The bar food was very tasty and reasonably priced 
19071,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The ghastly light column in the entrance hall really detracts from the atmosphere in the cocktail bar It s far too bright and really tacky The steam sauna etc rooms in the pool area felt slightly shabby , The staff were lovely the room was very comfortable and quiet The location is great with some good bars and restaurants nearby Nice to have bathrobes and slippers to go down to the spa pool level 
19072,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Would like to have had an outward facing room if I had known we overlooked the central atrium I would have requested an outer facing room Just personal preference , Great location and a lovely 10 minute walk to the Tate modern Some decent well known restaurant chains within less than 5 minutes walk 
19073,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Breakfast was great I booked without but they said that they would upgrade me to a suite in a nearby associated property and give me free breakfast Wish i hadn t as good as the breakfast was other property felt isolated and didn t get the vibe of the main building 
19074,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff were not trained in basic communication skills No knowledge of the hotels event and food outlets opening times on NYE Maybe the hotelemployed temp staff for the holiday season Didn t feel welcomed or we were in the hands of people that cared we were there Again perhaps it was because it was very busy and the holiday season , Perfect location Great rooms especially the studios which are abit far from Main hotel but it really doesn t matter for the casual independent traveller 
19075,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Party on same floor 7th a little loud particularly guests going from bar on ground floor to roof , Staff were really helpful Spa facilities were fantastic 
19076,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The prices can be lower , The concierge people have been more than helpful Didzik Victor and Istvan They helped me find a ticket to an football match Above all they helped me with the documents I ve forgotten in the hotel and those documents were of vital importance to me I m more than grateful to them They are the reason your hotel will be of choice for me the next time 
19077,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Did not like the cost , Staff Could not have been more helpful After checkout I realised as I was leaving I had forgotten my walking stick When I told the young doorman he immediately went to retrieve it with no fuss or hesitation

19079,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was very busy There was a long queue and wait with my two young children , St Paul s Cathdral is literally on your doorstop Convenient location and quiet Great facilities Family room was a good size Hotel left two cupcakes for our daughters as we were celebrating our youngest child s birthday Was a lovely gesture 
19080,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The fire alarms in the room went off a few times on one night at 11pm and no one told us what was going on Another night at same sort of time lights in the room kept turning themselves on and we had a plane to catch next day so not much sleep only had 3 nights so our sleep was very disrupted , The staff were great and so was the location 
19081,Grange St Paul s Hotel, As a returning guest I also recommended the hotel to friends who were delighted They had a great stay but this time I was very disappointed with my bed and the linen It did not feel smell fresh and I spoke to the manager about this certainly the pillows and mattress protector need to be replaced I hope they have done this usually I am very pleased with my room , Love the hotel and its position 
19082,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Make sure you check your room prior to check in I booked a twin room and the description did not match the room I received I was given a very tiny and somewhat squashed obvious double room which had been turned into a twin room This was not well done because one bed was right under the lamp which I banged my dad on throughout the night I gave feedback but was to tired to swap rooms so was given a complimentary breakfast which wasnt a five star breakfast I much preferred the Tower Bridge branch This room was not value for money, The location of this hotel is nice The spa gym and swim in really good Staff are friendly and helpful The deco of this hotel promotes five star but the rooms don t reflect this 
19083,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Understand the need for subdued lighting in the room but a bit to low A light or back lighting of the thermostat control is need I had to use the torch on my phone to make adjustments to the temperature , Superb location Clean and spacious 
19084,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Lifts can get congested and can involve a wait A lot of staff visits to room such as checking mini bar and turn down service Seemed a bit excessive, Room comfort excellent very handy to St Pauls Nice ambience and generally quiet 
19085,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Reception staff talking amongst themselves laughing joking whilst there was a long booking in que not 5 star service Bar staff excellent helpful and friendly , Location cleanliness of rooms facilities 
19086,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room dark no natural light as internal room over looking interior of hotel Room not made up for second night of my stay no towels replaced etc Took a while to get served in bar on second night being ignored staff not aware who should be served next very poor service for this calibre of hotel , Great location nice room Good value for money 
19087,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The shower head squirted water all over the bathroom floor which was a bit annoying but that was the only thing , Lovely welcome by receptionist after a long journey Fabulous room and a great nights sleep 
19088,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Rooms furniture shows it s age rooms are dirty some stuff stuck on the table and has never been cleaned dirty pillows plenty blonde long hair in room not ours hotel entrance into west wing shabby and always smells like going into public swimming pool people put their dirty room service orders back on the floor and not being cleaned up for hours hours strange people walking almost naked across floors scary Service personnel didn t live up to even 4 star standards Restaurant Reserved table was given away wrong orders being brought to table pool water very cold sauna benches were soaked with water can just someone tell the guest to use towels in the sauna could continue but likely worst 5 star hotel we ve ever been, Location
19089,Grange St Paul s Hotel, the bathrooms could have been a little larger and no view even in the executive suite, the interior of the hotel was fantastic and nice rooms but very close to st pauls just across the road
19090,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The hotel it self doesnt fit the standard of a 5 stars hotel staffs communication water shortage in the middle of the night For me i think the hotel is overrated its one of the worst 5 stars hotel i have ever stayed in Despite the lower cost compare to other five stars hotels within the good location there is not much good things to say about it Some of the staffs are nice and friendly but seems not profession, The location was ok nearby st Paul The price ok for a 5 stars hotell
19091,Grange St Paul s Hotel, would of liked the opportunity to of used the mini bar but because my girlfriend checked in first I did not get the option, The hotel was lovely inside and worth every penny we paid the rooms were nice inside 
19092,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bar staff in front bar not very good and rude Minor point though still had a great stay Rest of staff were excellent , Location and very helpful concierge 
19093,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I have no complaints , The staff at the reception was very attentive and pleasant The cleaning staff was also detail minded I had a sweater which I hadn t folded before leaving the hotel in the morning yet it was folded and lay nicely on the bed when we came back There was no noise from the hallway The bedroom had a comfortable sofa and the bathroom was decent 
19094,Grange St Paul s Hotel, As a five star hotels I was a bit disappointed by the restrooms located next to concierge honestly disgusting Of course it s a detail only When I was there the hotel unfortunately faced hot water disruptions this had had an impact on water pressure afterwards , room is big enough very clean and quite charming Staff very polite and always willing to able 
19095,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Cold and distant front desk at the day of entry 50 pounds extra charge provision per day wasn t something I expected and didn t like the way it was explained to us , The hotel gives a sense of calmness Nice lobby very good wifi Very friendly concierge staff 
19096,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Spa was full of young children on the evening so we just stayed in the room Great facilities but maybe a family time would be a good idea , Incredible view of St Paul s and only 5min walk from Blackfriars if that Easy access to all of London Great hotel inside and very impressive with friendly staff Very good value for money 
19097,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room 207 described as an Executive Double 169 per night had internally facing floor to ceiling window onto the Atrium but literally faces onto the scenic glass elevator about 10 feet away which is constantly going up and down the Atrium This meant that anyone in the 2 glass lifts has a birds eye view into the room at all times we had to shut the curtains ALL DAY Room lighting is very dim so it was rather a gloomy stay Reception staff were not v polite and our checkin was delayed by 2 hours as our room was not ready at 3pm as promised in the booking not a good start no compensation given Pool is nice but nowhere to sit around it so you either swim or stand , Comfy beds nice decor great location
19098,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The hotel seems to have lost its gloss No one thing just a series of small things The TV not working in our room the inedible seafood platter in New Year s Eve the lack of cleaning after New Year s Eve one of the lifts being out of service the cleaner walking in without knocking There were more things We have visited this hotel several times in the past but don t plan to again , The location
19099,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Hotel was full for the New year breakfast is a bit chaotic we noticed things were less well organized compared to a few years ago Not everyone seems to understand English that well Sometimes there is a long wait for the lifts , Nicely located friendly staff Pool facilities are very good Easy to walk up Fleet street to the Strand 
19100,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Wouldn t change a thing, We were checked in by Esther who was so helpful and patient Our room wasn t ready upon our arrival but the general manager upgraded us to a club room gave us tickets to visit St Paul s cathedral and a massive ice cream for our daughter Faultless service extremely comfortable beds great facilities Would thoroughly recommend
19101,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Water was quite cold in the pool beds a little hard breakfast no where near what we expected was just the same a premier inn except it cost 23 per head Rooms a little gloomy and dark , Location excellent design of hotel fantastic great bathroom soundproofed rooms other than if you re next to the lift very good air conditioning thick light proof curtains 
19102,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Some reception staff do not have good customer service skills my room bookings were mixed up and my son was asked to pay again for the room I had already paid for which caused some embarassment after checking and confirming the room was paid for was no apology made just its ok the rooms were also miles apart as we were advised that one of the rooms had been rebooked so not great Despite this the hotel is nice the corcierge lads were very professional and the location is good , Good location comfortable bed spanear to room and facilities good 
19103,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing all good , Stayed before so knew what it was like the hotel is lovely used facilities this time very impressed with pool and room very relaxed would have liked to have stayed longer 
19104,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Found the 21 00 per head charge for a hot breakfast very steep We walked 60 yards around he corner for a delicious breakfast for 5 50 Not the same ambience I ll be the first to admit Hate even complaining about it as the whoe experience was wonderful , The entire hotel was wonderful The staff were plentiful but unobstrusive They were there if you needed them but otherwise your privacy was secured The whole place is filled with glass which gives an open clean experience The room was divine and a wonderful view of St Pauls and the top of the Shard The turn down service was a lovely surprise We have decided to spoil ourselves here again We travel a fair bit and this is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed Thank you 
19105,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing , The location is truly excellent Three subway lines and two national rail stations are within walking distance We are stunned by the St Paul s Cathedral every time we leave the main entrance Lots of dining options at vincinity 
19106,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The lights within the cupboard were temperamental at best Staff also entered room before there was a chance to answer door which felt like a slight breach of privacy , Comfy bed and a good size room for a couple Excellent concierge service was provided allowing us to leave our bags with them at multiple points during our trip Bathroom was clean and a good size for the amount of people within room 
19107,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bed had old mattress which sunk into middle pillows that should have been thrown out years ago Bathroom was not cleaned properly and sink blocked most unhappy and moved room for 2nd night, Pool and leisure facilities good
19108,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It s our second stay Some of the glass floor panels are damaged and frostedo which is a health and safety hazard For breakfast again poached eggs are done in a different location so had to have fried One long dark hair in the bath My fiancee is blonde , Excellent Location Staff were very helpful and friendly 
19109,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The spa explained above , The spa is not worth visiting It was one of the main reasons i booked the hotel It had a very cold pool saunas not working My gym has a much better spa I felt really let down as it was expensive 
19110,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Reauired a double bed but it was two single beds pushed together so gap kept occurring throughout the night which became uncomfortable , Staff were very welcoming and friendly food selection in bar was very good 
19111,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing I would highly recommend this hotel , Very friendly helpful staff Room was a good size with all the facilities you would expect Good service in bar and restuarants Seamless check in and check out Overall a very pleasant stay and a great location 
19112,Grange St Paul s Hotel, nothing, Hotel was excellent and location amazing for the area we needed to be in Arrived back from our Christmas Party night at 3am and ordered food that was amazing and reasonably priced Thank you 
19113,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Check out by 11 when you can t check in until 3pm, Room was a little bit of luxury with lovely interior great shower comfy bed brilliant views of St Pauls and the Shard
19114,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room overlooked by two floors of office workers Overall hotel was pretty naff felt like a pimped up Travelodge Lots of office parties Poor value for money wasnt the five star experience we d been hoping for , Location
19115,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I have no complaints on this occasion , Very comfortable and quiet Had a good meal in the dining room and a nice breakfast Staff were very helpful and friendly The location was excellent for visiting the West End as there was a good choice of buses nearby Would be happy to stay there again 
19116,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The shower in the room was quite poor It was so close to the wall over a bath that you couldn t get underneath the main water flow unless you were leaning backwards The room also smelt quite musty upon arrival and there was no way to get fresh air into the room as the windows did not open , The staff were fantastic and you can not fault their professionalism 
19117,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I suppose like everywhere drinks were a bit expensive and i thought 23 each for breakfast was too much especially when there are plenty of places to eat 2 minutes walk away around St Paul s Cathedral, The hotel staff were friendly and very helpful The room was excellent with a very comfortable bed and large shower We ate in Benihana restaurant Japanese and the food was very very good Overall an excellent time at a great hotel will definitely recommend to family friends and work colleagues
19118,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Facilities at the Spa were lovely but poor communication about our booking brochure on line not truly representative of what was actually the treatment Corporate party on the Saturday evening made foyer and bar very busy, Rooms very comfy well appointed and spacious Had a room for 4 adults and all had a great nights sleep Staff attentive and willing to help 
19119,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Don t expect the personnel except the concierge to smile or be helpful The bathroom is tiny The noise of the underground ensures that you don t fall asleep before midnight and wake up a few hours later We managed to change bedroom but only after long negotiations This hotel has no soul , Nothing to report
19120,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room 369 was next to the lift and it could be heard every time used reported that I would like to move rooms no response was told engineer would be to sort it No engineer and no move or contact from staff Room not cleaned on day one on our return at 10pm had to wait for it to be cleaned , Bed was comfy pity kept awake by lift noise
19121,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We found some of the bar staff quite rude which is not what you would expect from a hotel of this quality , Fantastic hotel with great facilities and a great location
19122,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We got upgraded to exec room but shower was awful and not to the standard I would have expected cold plastic curtain There was no bath which we were told about but was very disappointed I have stayed in better hotels for much less even in central London , The super king size bed
19123,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, I liked the room to the welcoming cupcakes to the spa all of the facilities and the relaxed atmosphere Celebrating my anniversary here was the best pick
19124,Grange St Paul s Hotel, however this time we were put in rooms that are usually reserved for long stay guests and we fKind it extremely inconvenient to walk through the streets nearby to get back to the hotel building for breakfast and to use the facilities , We have stayed here many times and think its excellent value for money great location lovely rooms and good facilities
19125,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Less chlorine in the pool dirty plates in the stairwell, Room was upgraded and perfect view of St Paul s cathedral from 602 will request that room again 
19126,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bar menu had a poor selection of foods for people with gluten and lactose intolerance so I decided to leave the hotel for all my meals House keeping knocked on the door twice in the morning even though I said I would check out closer to 11am The rooms are very small , A friend recommended me staying at this hotel and I m glad that I did The location and the hotel itself is great The staff was friendly and easy going It has free wifi available for all guests 
19127,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room was v dated and not particularly clean dusty The service at reception was slow and at times the staff while friendly weren t knowledgable unable to answer if there is drinking water in room or ability to put coffee on room bill Overall aside from pool and gym I don t see how this qualifies as a luxury hotel particularly in london and as such not great value , The pool gym and location are good 
19128,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Lifts are not sufficient for number of people in hotel We spent a long time trying to get to our room or reception because of this , Lovely comfortable hotel Lovely room service breakfast

19131,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Shower was blocked and flooded bathroom and bedroom walls in studio apartment were very close to the bed we both hit our heads on numerous occasions over the weekend room service was overpriced and very appalled by the quality of the food bed wasn t as comfy as we both expected for a hotel of this standard, The modern design was lovely and the tablet with all functions of the lights and temperature of room was useful
19132,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was very busy as the hotel was full so we had to wait sometimes for bacon etc Otherwise the food was good for a buffet , Lovely location with wonderful views of St Paul s Very comfortable room and generally good service 
19133,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Everything perfect , Booked the hotel for my 2 daughters birthdays They were upgraded to an executive suite with 2 queen beds and came in to cupcakes and a happy birthday message It really made their trip Very jealous that I didn t go with them They said the staff were fabulous and couldn t do enough for them Many thanks to them all We would strongly recommend this hotel for quality service and its central location when visiting London 
19134,Grange St Paul s Hotel, No sooner did I get in our room I could tell it was musty smell the chairs were dirty tired bathroom was really small no shower only over bath pubic hair was on the toilet roll the tv was so small facing no where near the bed I just couldn t stay here went straight ditto reception asked for my cash refund which I payed no more than ten minutes ago they would not refund me they gave me a different room with a walk in shower better bed was horrible we both woke up with stiff backs but the staff put us right off never go there again will tell my friends not to when they do awful ,No Positive
19135,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Like most London hotels the prices are a bit extreme Charging nearly 200 nt and not including breakfast extra 27 pp nt is a bit much still the pub across the road does a wonderful cooked breakfast for a fiver including tea coffe , This place is well positioned opposite St Paul s has wonderful facilities and spacious rooms The staff are very attentive and friendly as you would expect from a 5 establishment 
19136,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Paid 285 for a night and not even a bottle of water in the room Tap water was luke warm so that wasn t a good alternative Couldn t see if any could even buy from the mini bar as it was locked as I had said I wouldn t be needing to pay a deposit to use it as arrived at 1am and would be leaving at 8am so thought wouldn t be needing mini bar I was there for business so fine but very corporate certainly not a place for a romatic mini break in London, Location was good
19137,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The room was facing a derelict building Very noisy from 5am as the rubbish from the hotel was collected on the street outside our room, Loved the location
19138,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Extremely poor lighting and two broken lights in our room A little rough around the edges needs a deep cleanse No view from the room Weren t told there was a dress down service in the room so felt uneasy when I returned to find that my room had been moved around whilst I was out There was a party on downstairs during our stay which was very loud and went on quite late I would not award this hotel 5 star , Friendly welcome all the necessities provided Wifi was good Room service was excellent
19139,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Need to raise the standards We wre allocated a poor room first time before reluctantly complaining Whilst room was changed and was subsequently great we wre edisspoited as a returning cusopmer we had to push for it The staff seemed disinterested and I felt the Hotel since the last visit has lost its soul previously caring nature, Location nice pool
19140,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The quad room we stayed in was very small Hard for four people to move around , The location of the hotel is convenient but outside the main touristy area of London If that is your main intent Public transport is close by for easy travel 
19141,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast wasn t included yet it said breakfast available I read that as available It was a birthday treat to stay in a nice hotel ended up in the annexe so didn t get that BIG hotel experience , Great location nice room clean
19142,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The check in staff were a little aloof and busy sorting out things for themselves The queue for check in was in a tight gap Breakfast was very expensive at 23 per head there are plenty of great places to get a full English just in the St Paul s area for half the price , Really quiet for a hotel in the City Excellent location right next to St Paul s Cathedral Good room and bathroom size My room had a bath 
19143,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Make sure you get a breakfast included in the price of the room It was a fortune for my 3 kids to eat every morning , Great location close to shopping and public transportation 
19144,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff was a little untrained Someone walked into my room whilst I was getting changed He had knocked on the door once and then just unlocked the door even before I could say wait a minute please I rushed to the door as he was about to come in and I said that I wasn t dressed He apologised and waited outside while I got my dressing gown on Then he came in and said that he was here to check the minibar which was locked so I don t quite understand what there was to check and then left quickly after apologising again I just thought that it was quite rude , Great location 
19145,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Good location Nice attentive staff Got an upgrade to a better room in the older part of the hotel The room wasn t up to my expectations and time was too limited to change Still giving a good review because the case was followed up and solution had been offered Assuming that the new part of the hotel is quite good

19148,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The lights in the Room were a little confusing there was a nack to working out how to turn on the one you wanted without turning them all off or the one across the room on Early check in or late check out wasn t really an option or at least not made clear , Extremely friendly staff who understand the concept of excellent customer service Great rooms Fantastic facilities 
19149,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing its was all great and made my wife s 70 birthday complete I am younger just for the record , The staff were excellent location first class and could not be better

19153,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Cold pool , Rooms are very well appointed and the facilities are excellent You can use HDMI to watch Netflix etc via your own smart devices which is great if you have children or you can t wait to watch the next episode The location is brilliant with quick and easy links to shopping theatre and dinning

19157,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Pillows could have been a bit better but having said that I still slept ok To me this was a good 4 star standard hotel which is fine if you ve only paid 200 ish pn for the room I would expect better if I had paid much over that , Location was really great Choice of 3 bar areas which was good Good soundproofing to room 
19158,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Lighting in room poor for reading Sink was cracked Shower door pushed away bath mat and caused wet floor Soap wasted as replaced after first day, Quiet room
19159,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The bed was big and comfortable The room was relatively spacious and the hotel in itself is just beautiful Check in and check out was quick and smooth
19160,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Problems with arranging taxis from hotel foyer Doorman had to run down the street to hail black cabs there seemed to be a long wait for many guests may be this could be addressed , First visit to this hotel and we were pleased to have a room upgrade on arrival Rashid on desk made us very welcome Lovely spa facilities and very friendly staff 
19161,Grange St Paul s Hotel, A hotel that calls itself 5 star not to have water and for the milk in the in room mini cartons to be curdled is just not on , Location perfect rooms comfortable
19162,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Pillows on offer were too low for me When i asked for higher type of pillow I was told that all the hotel offers is 1 type of pillow which was too low for me and therefore I did not sleep well I do not feel that this is acceptable for a 5 star hotel although I am not expecting a pillow menu of course , Location and service was generally very good 
19163,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Only two central lifts so it made getting from upper levels to the ground floor tricky at checkout time , Great location minutes from St Pauls and the tube with lots of local eateries Room size was good Best bit was the swimming pool and Jacuzzi The concierge were really helpful and all the staff were very friendly 
19164,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We went down to the bar which was only open to guests till 11 then the public could also join a member of staff asked to see my room card I thought this was rude , I asked for a cake secretly to be put in are room for my partners birthday and they kindly did
19165,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Length of time we had to wait checking in Put on extra staff at 3pm and again 11am for check out We were given an automatic upgrade however when we got to the rooms they were not correct double we wanted 2 twin beds I had to return desk and another two rooms were allocated elsewhere When I asked for a complimentary Breakfast to compensate for the hour and half it took to get the whole thing sorted I was told I already had an upgrade When I pointed out that was their choice at the original booking and not something we requested it fell on deaf ears , Location
19166,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I ve stayed at a great many hotels in London this was the only one that didn t allow early check in seemingly a policy and not simply because the room wasn t ready They did invite us to shower and change in the spa which was lovely but it was rough not being able to nap a bit after a long overnight flight , The location was amazing We loved being so near St Paul s cathedral it s kind of magical Lots of great dining near the hotel And the hotel was very nice It didn t have the charm of some of the hotels we ve visited in London but had some great amenities 
19167,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I orded a drink for my wife and was charged 11 for a Baileys with ice To much , Great room Very good Hotel I recommend this hotel Im a London Taxi Driver andit is in a very good position in london 
19168,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I was told we d been upgraded we hadn t Some of the furniture was damaged We asked for additional milk and were told to contact Housekeeping or Room Service The much crowed about Sky Bar was closed We told reception staff that there were French Fries spilled on the floor in the corridor two hours later there had been a half hearted attempt to clear them it looked more like someone had tried to kick them out of sight I accept the lifts will be busy at check out time but to have to stand for 15 20 minutes frustratingly watch lifts either flash past or be too full isn t good especially when there s another lift within 10 yards shame it wasn t sign posted I m sure it ticks all the boxes needed to classed as 5 star but the lack of attention to detail means I ve stayed in better 3 star hotels, Check in was quick and efficient and although we were well before 3 pm we were allocated a room we were even told we d been upgraded we hadn t The guys on the door were always polite and pleasant 
19169,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Fantastic location right next to St Pauls Cathedral It s an amazing experience to go to one of the choral services Very close to underground links to theatres and the west end and minutes walk away from the Millenium bridge and the South bank area Can t think of anywhere I d rather stay when visiting London 
19170,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing , Having let the hotel know that it was my wife s birthday and they delivered a couple of cupcakes to our room a lovely surprise when we returned from the theatre 
19171,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room service price rediculously high I asked for egg on toast and coffee and got charged 30 00 I said on the room menu a breakfast was less the answer given was it had changed price Staff on reception are often rude an unaccomodating I asked the doorman where the nearest clothing shop was and got directed to Oxford street despite there being a shopping centre across the road next to St Paul s Very poor value for money the food is terrible Cheese bord tiny bits of cheese and the chicken curry cheap cuts of meat , Location is good 
19172,Grange St Paul s Hotel, t , comfy bed the upgrade to an apartment was an unexpected and appreciated pleasure I liked the pool although I thought the step into the Jacuzzi was an accident waiting to happen Our overall impression was good and I would come back again
19173,Grange St Paul s Hotel, For a 5 TV in room was way too small shower knobs were very seized up and difficult to adjust No complimentary bottled water in room which I would expect in a hotel of this standard , Location is great good leisure centre pool Comfy bed 
19174,Grange St Paul s Hotel, My only issue is room service breakfast was only a bit warm and not hot as it should have been, Everything was perfect great hotel great staff great location great service
19175,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff they seemed to be not sure of what they was doing Especially the spa The porter didn t carry our stuff to our bedroom we was left to carry it And there is no valet u have to go around the block to park in an expensive ncp Don t take your nice cars The cafe rouge outside is rubbish Not much for lunch on offer , The bedroom was comfortable and offered exactly what it said Shower was great The hotel appearance was nice and the room service staff was attentive Breakfast was great you get a lot for what you pay 
19176,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Only thing we had an issue with was the fact they took a pre authorisation transaction which was nearly double the amount of the room which then left me overdrawn Don t know why they took the money in the first place or tell me what they were doing , The bed room was lovely very spacious and clean The bed was so comfy Got dressing gowns and slippers too Can t fault the actual hotel
19177,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff are mainly untrained young people Checkin and checkout was a catastrophy Waited each time half an hour for my turn and then didn t even know how to handle their own software In addition I could not reach the room service by phone at 11 00 pm in the evening when I needed another toothbrush Breakfast a bit of old jam and bread not worth the money No one came to offer a second cup of coffee or tea during breakfeast Don t want to be too picky but for this kind of hotel and money you pay I expect sth much better this was more worthy to a youth hostel or budget hotel, great location great rooms lousy staff
19178,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Mini bar locked despite the receptionist taking a cover charge off the credit card was opened upon request Only one bath towel but reception send a hand towel, Very large bed and well appointed room Clean and comfortable The Spa as always was excellent for the size and standard of the hotel 
19179,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We had a room overlooking the restaurant and therefore felt we could not open the curtains as people could see into the bedrooms from both the restaurant and the other bedrooms facing us I would not want one of those bedrooms again , The quietness at night that allowed for a good nights sleep after heavy days of walking and sight seeing 
19180,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Where do I start The whole hotel does not have Phone reception Literally I expressed I had to call my childminder allot and no phone reception in all of the hotel you have to wait outside for phone calls Second they will not take a cash deposit for the minibar so you aren t allowed to access it without paying by card Rediculous I offered them 100 pounds cash The food is disgusting and overpriced 30 for some scrambled egg and a coffee to the room , The pool that s only advantage 
19181,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Grange St Paul is 5 stars hotel but the service is far from being what you would expect The rooms are big and very comfortable but half of the rooms those of the inner court which are nice do not have cellular coverage this was told to us by the night manager which is very strange as this hotel is in the City of London mainly for business customers Value for money was good as at the end of August the rates were not high for London Location is OK if you want to be around the City like visiting the Tate Modern which is a great building and see the Royal Stock Exchange but it takes time to get to the main tourist attractions of London As I wrote the service is almost not there Unfortunately I broke one evening a teeth and had to go to an emergency dental care The hotel does not have a list of medical doctors and emergency dental doctors although this is a big hotel part of a London s hotels chain even in a small 4 stars hotel in Oban in northern Scotland they do have Dental care list The concierge does help with printing airline tickets and this kind of service but the whole stuff lack even the minimum kindness of a hotel , Location for City attractions Front desk attitude room is comfortable Rates were reasonable 
19182,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The bed was really big and extremely comfortable and the room was bigger than expected The spa and gym facilities were very good also It was a perfect location and a lovely walk to the restaurants across the Millennium Bridge the view was amazing Very easy to check in and out the whole process of booking was so easy They even left complimentary happy birthday cupcakes for my boyfriend 
19183,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff were rude to the extent that there was no thank you or please in sentences Could be because a lot of staff were Eastern European and didn t have the british formality, Elegant hotel with good sized rooms and excellent gym and spa facilities
19184,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Disappointed the skybar closed before the 11pm time stated on a Saturday night, Nice and comfortable a great view of St Paul s out of our bedroom window friendly and helpful staff
19185,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our window looked over reception so we had to keep our blinds down all day Poor service in the bar took the girl 3 attempts to take a snack and drink order for 2 and we were given the bill before they would serve us , Two queen sized beds in our twin room Leisure centre is lovely decent sized jacuzzi and pool for a city centre hotel 
19186,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was no view and I asked for a view Some of the staff were a bit flippant , The location was good Room was clean and tidy Some of the staff was helpful and friendly others not so 
19187,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The welcome from a lady called Norilyn at reception who checked us in was exceptional Friendly and charming to say the least The room was amazing and the hotel is beautiful couldn t have picked a better place to spend my weekend 
19188,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff could have been friendlier and more helpful in their service and approach I asked for a room with a view and got a brick wall literally Air conditioning wasn t working properly The TV was on a fixed stand so unable to watch it while getting ready or in bed I think you are missing an opportunity with the roof top bar needs some TLC and more drink options Cocktails would help We didn t realise on booking it that the location wasn t great no nearby restaurant s or bars , Bed was comfy and the pillows were soft 
19189,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Quieter floors for not so rock n roll guests x x, Upgraded due to chap in front of us at check in having a moan up Room was awesome and so was brekkie Can t wait to go back for another special b day xx

19193,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Checking in was for ever and the same for checking out the receptionist kept disappearing and the room was not cleaned over the days we stayed, The location and the food and the room was ok the shower was excellent over all the hotel was amazing to look at
19194,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bathroom was very small We had to call maintenance for our shower and bath as both temperature regulators were faulty Also we could not be provided with a small fridge and the night duty manager was not happy when we asked for the automated chiller to be emptied so we could keep some water and juice chilled , The location and the lobby areas of the hotel The staff at reception were very pleasant and accommodating 
19195,Grange St Paul s Hotel, booked the double deluxe room and stated 392 square metres i am not sure who measured this but it was normal size hotel room also our room over looked the main entrance with rooms on the opposite side having to keep the blind shut for most of the stay plasma lcd telly in the room was small and couldnt move it so awkward to watch from one side of the bed not enough milk sugar coffee in the room for 1 person never mind 2 , location of hotel was great close to st pauls catherdal and plenty of eating establishments close by also 5 minutes walk to st pauls tube 
19196,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was nothing that we disliked about the hotel We had an amazing couple of days there and would definitely go back , The staff couldn t do enough for us The rooms were beautiful and the rest of the hotel was stunning with bars and restaurant on site The architecture of the hotel was fabulous

19199,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The towels were not 5 star Flat and thin It would have been great to have access to the roof bar as the weather was lovely and the views would be spectacular My room faced into the hotel , Only had the room deal so didn t try the food and I didn t get time to try the pool or gym Best part was location Very easy to get around 
19200,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Price of breakfast to expensive for us, Bed very comfy Spa and changing room very high standard has everything you need even straighteners steam room the hottest I ever been in fab location for st pauls and visiting city plenty of restaurants on your doorstep 
19201,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Absolutely untrained staff who can t make a proper jug of tea for two people they actually put one teabag in a litre of hot water Our room was allocated to us and to another couple who opened the door while we were naked Waited in the bar for 1 hour for our meal to find out that it wasn t ordered on the first place , The area
19202,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bed extremely hard and uncomfortable No complementary water only offered to regulars even though I have stayed here atleast half a dozen times Room decor is also extremely dated and what is expected of a 4 star hotel Television very small and not easiest to view from the bed Lastly not all staff have a great grasp of English which should be unheard of in a 5 star establishment , Location is perfect and pool steam room is a very nice treat

19211,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The lighting was quite poor in the room by the full length mirror it was very dark felt like the full length window which over looked offices allowed them all to look into the room I didn t want to pull curtains because it was the brightest part of the room but felt like we were on show would have loved the option of a view would have been better to have had a 12 o clock check out instead of earlier Training staff were left to their own devises could see she was struggling and her colleague watched on and ignored her with out any help Left disappointed, Was looking forward to staying and location It was an ok room Training staff were friendly

19222,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The internal rooms look over the atrium and are therefore not very private with the curtains open The lifts are quite slow and there are only 2 in the main reception area therefore getting up and down during peak flow times can be time consuming The breakfast was not included in the room rate , The rooms were well appointed and the bathroom shower was excellent Fantastic central location within a short walk of central line tube stations shops bars cafes and restaurants Polite friendly staff 
19223,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Afternoon tea food was ok but staff didn t come over to us once to top up pots of tea etc I had to go to bar to ask, Hotel in general good liked the decor
19224,Grange St Paul s Hotel, 14 pound for a gin and tonic Check in at 4 pm and check out at 11 you can pay by the hour for late check out just another example of being ripped off in London hotels i was given a room with an excellent view at 4 pm, Excellent gym pool Excellent location Excellent food at bar Great staff very friendly and helpful Located around lots of restaurants and cafes
19225,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Some reception staff could have been friendlier Quite dismissive at times I wasn t even asked how our stay had been even though we had been there for 5 nights Reception staff obviously don t get on with reservation staff Quite a dispute between them when we tried to book a further night Most of the Bar staff also very off hand , Great location Near the tube station Lovely room and very good cleaning of our room daily 
19226,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Restaurant and bar very busy with corporate events and hence service slow Served flat house champagne in the bar had to send it back Didn t bother with breakfast and walked down to borough market instead Rooms comfortable but feel they are more suitable for a business stay rather than leisure , Location
19227,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Size of the room was too small and bathroom shower was super tiny you could barely stand in it and water leaked out of the shower door making the floor super slippery , I liked the location
19228,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bedroom facilities not checked hairdryer not working and alarm clock alarm not cancelled Waiter in Novello restaurant for dinner has not been trained well No knowledge of menu or appreciation of time needed to review menu Steak not served as per menu with broad beans Breakfast coffee service slow and tables not laid fully For a 5 star hotel it is not acceptable to have multiple staff who do not speak and understand English especially in restaurants I have a few tripa to UK coming up and would like to stay each time but these points cause me to hesitate , Comfy Bed bathroom well equipped space 
19229,Grange St Paul s Hotel, On arrival we were put in a twin room when booked a superior double but one call to reception and we were in an executive room for the inconvenience Great service , Excellent bed great spa lovely staff
19230,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The hotel room was not as well cleaned as expected and nor were the bar area toilets The bar food service lacked service finesse for a 5 star hotel , Well suited and catered for travellers with young children Good location next to the Thames and quiet 
19231,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Air conditioning too complicated and unreliable so room too warm at night no hand shower mirror on wall too high to view when sitting at dressing table, Location Health Club
19232,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Expected room to be bigger for a Superior Double cost but I guess it s in London , Great location for visiting London Great facilities and nice rooms
19233,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The Check In process very long queue despite having already checked in but room not available at the time They should have a desk for Key collection only , Overall the location is great and within easy reach of the tube station 
19234,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It would have been nice to see a brighter colour scheme in the bedroom to mirror the reception area , The reception area is spacious well appointed The room was of a good size with a comfortable bed Top ups of coffee milk etc were excellent There was never any need to ask 
19235,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The property is huge so make sure to request the rooms to be next to each other if booking more than one we spent ages trying to find each other s rooms running around between different blocks , Amazing location beds very comfortable the iron and ironing board in the room was definitely useful the staff was friendly and very helpful 
19236,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The room was large and well appointed unlike many hotels in London and the location is very convenient if you fly into City and have work on the eastern side of London 
19237,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Took 35 minutes to check in then we were given the wrong room despite being asked if it was a twin we needed breakfast was very poor Spa needed some seating around the pool, Great location Hotel was beautiful and very clean 
19238,Grange St Paul s Hotel, On arrival walking into the hotel with the Euro 2016 football on the dead flowers in the floral display at reception and the cigarette ends on the floor in the outside bit as we made our way to our room immediately made my heart sink The dead flowers and cigarette ends had been removed by the morning but as a first impression it made me feel disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary and it didn t feel very 5 We d also had a complimentary upgrade to a room that had disabled facilities The receptionist said the room only had a lower sink and more space In fact the bathroom also had a disabled shower seat and hand rails here and by the toilet which if truth be told made us feel old and was an instant romance damper on our first weekend away without the kids in 2 years So beware of upgrades Also we were on the 5th floor and the lift temperamental and painfully slow at times so we opted for the stairs more than once , The location of the hotel was perfect The spa and gym facilities were very good The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet We didn t eat at the hotel so cannot pass comment on the food but it looked fine 
19239,Grange St Paul s Hotel, hot food although lovely could have been hotter A supervisor or head of housekeeping sort of gave us a telling off and upset my daughter but maintence of room excellent although not consistant, Special requests were taken and granted and staff overall brilliant Beds fabulous and room so comfortable Felt special and just loved being there Really special treat for myself and little girl as a girls weekend away 
19240,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Wish we could have stayed another night , Rare weekend away with friends for 40th birthday was made extra special by the friendly helpful staff comfortable rooms delicious food relaxing spa and general ambience All made a memorable experience and one we will repeat next year 
19241,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Not being able to visit the roof top bar because there was a private function This should not be advertised as a guest facility if it is not available for guests , Location was great
19242,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was a great rooftop bar but it was always busy with private functions , Great location I was attending a wedding at St Paul s and the location was just perfect 
19243,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Really bad hotel Nothing works properly very dirty and disorganised staff Constant flow of small problems Also very kitschy and bad taste from restaurants to elevators ,No Positive
19244,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Studio apt on ground floor with full length windows onto street meant there was no privacy unless curtains blinds were closed making room very dark Breakfast was adequate however staff seemed unable to cope with full dining room quality and understanding of English was very poor , Location
19245,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast on Sunday was not very warm plenty of choice but not as nice as Saturday s, Shower was great to ease the days walking around a busy London
19246,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Spa area wasn t very relaxing as there were children splashing about and racing in the pool whilst we were there , Very friendly and attentive concierge staff Very modem hotel design Nice bar area View of St Paul s from our room Very comfortable bed Very good massage treatment 
19247,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Was looking forward to sitting on the roof top bar and seeing the views but only for private functions looking forward to the night club but was closed Staff where lacking in knowledge of drinks not knowing what cider was room was not made up during the day Overall For a 5 hotel poor advertisement of facilities and very expensive for the service we received , Loved the location manager dealt with our complaint with a free breakfast for two 
19248,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room was poor not 5 star Broken bit of shower on floor when we arrived and had a lot of problems with the plug sockets tripping the fuse box constantly which was a pain during our stay Concierge were very good and sorted it out but it kept happening about 4 times without us even in the room Think we were just unlucky Spent 400 for one night and breakfast which is a lot when everything isn t perfect Swimming pool was very busy too , Loved the breakfast although expensive 92 for family of 4 Loved spa facilities especially the lovely hot spa Loved the little touch of muffin birthday cakes left in the room Gym was lovely and dance studio teenagers loved the health and soa facilities 
19249,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bar food on one occasion lovely and on another not good at all sharing platter The bar staff had a tendency to be slow serving but overall the staff were very attentive The sports bar was booked on one occasion and guests were not permitted in, Fabulous room view lovely roof terrace when available for guests spa very good lovely pool Great location in a beautiful part of the city close to the tube shops and lovely restaurants and a two minute walk to the Millennium Bridge Overall excellent and would stay again 
19250,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The reception staff were a little strict not as pleasant is they could be, We always find the hotel is very comfortable and an excellent location and good value
19251,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Expensive spa treatments and the tea at breakfast was awful I genuinely never usually have a problem with many places but please please someone look at the tea you are serving people in the morning There should be a pot of tea on the table not someone filling up your cup as if it s coffee because mine was terribly brewed , The spa was fantastic but the treatments were quite overpriced 
19252,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, We stayed in the hotel for our wedding anniversary We absolutely loved the place It is very conveniently located close to Covent Garden The Strand and Trafalgar Square The staff were very friendly the rooms were comfortable and very nice 
19253,Grange St Paul s Hotel, internal signage was a bit hit n miss eg no information in lifts on what facilities on each floor spa etc, Excellent location next to St Pauls and views from room awesome 
19254,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The quality of the food at breakfast there was only non fat yogurt in a pot perhaps some fresh greek full fat yogurt in a bowl perhaps some interesting granola The waitresses did look like they had an early start Low grade sausages and bacon not really cooked , Location was excellent 
19255,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Lifts were slow , We changed rooms as the first smelt heavily of smoke and this was done with little hassle to a better one A lady on the same floor and I met in the lift saying it too so when we went to the desk together they must ve known there was a problem 
19256,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Very busy pool not the hotel s fault but pool area felt small for the number of guests We asked if we could get a room early Were told no as we already had an allocated room number which meant we had one of the nice rooms this is a secret according to the receptionist Didn t really believe that and I m sure it was just the receptionist s way of getting us off her back True to form the room we got was small tiny twin beds one of which didn t look like it had been made as was all lumpy Aside from a white sheet no other covers on the bed I have stayed in far better rooms at this hotel which is why I know to be disappointed standards seem to have fallen generally Client facing hotel staff receptionist concierge spa staff are not overly friendly and often quite curt Booking com overview of the hotel said it included a continental breakfast but at check in we were told no breakfast was included , Clean hotel friendly cleaners see my comment about client facing staff being much less friendly and excellent location Spa is also nice although can get crowded 
19257,Grange St Paul s Hotel, theres no alternative choices of the spa massage usually fullybooked all the time or lack of masseuse i dont like the view in my room facing the wall of the other building, the staff were very helpful and friendly
19258,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Industrial doors opening at 8am in an adjoining business but that s a minor point and not something the hotel could do anything about , Great location I wanted to explore this historic part of the city enjoy an out of my ordinary level of comfort and style very happy guest who will be back o 
19259,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Although I had to pay for an upgrade And the room was nicer then the first one I had My room was tired and required decorating The wall paper was lifting up and I think the last night my room was over priced, The Staff wee excellent the view was very good albeit I had to pay for an upgrade
19260,Grange St Paul s Hotel, iPod dock was not upto latest iPhone spec Spa was a little disappointing Thought the pool was chilly and hot tub had no jets for shoulders Also thought there were loungers to relax on but having seen it it is obviously too small for that , Gorgeous comfortable twin room Amazing shower and bathroom Staff extremely helpful Location was brilliant 
19261,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There s nothing not to like, Love everything about the grange St Paul s we stay here everytime we visit London which is quite often with and without the kids the rooms are fabulous spa is fabulous must eat at benihanna lovely atmosphere in all of the hotel staff are fabulous too Can t wait for our next trip 
19262,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The view from the hotel room was the Starbucks inside the hotel very bizarre as I have never experienced opening the blinds to see members of the public drinking their morning coffee before Would have preferred an outside view The bath needed a larger shower screen as it tended to leak all over the bathroom floor The tv was small and located offset from the bed so was not ideal for viewing purposes , The location of the hotel was perfect right next to St Paul s Cathedral within easy walk of other London attractions The staff were friendly and helpful and were efficient in helping when we had an issue with the tv Modern decor with a trendy twist Good spa facilities 
19263,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The pool facilities are very limiting and the breakfast service is not as well prepared and some of the other Grange Hotels , Staff were extremely helpful and accomodated to our needs well Even offering us a room upgrade 
19264,Grange St Paul s Hotel, One guest asked for small gift to be left in the couples bedroom Which It wasn t the grooms sister in law was very upset lots of guests some were offered breakfast upgrade BUT I was told this meant moving to another building which I explained not good as I was responsible for getting the bridesmaids into their dresses yet it was attached so would not have been a problem if it had been explained properly The bridal suite was not cleaned At All very bad service , Liked the decor and location was ideal for the wedding we were holding 
19265,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Very poor food from the room service For 30 the pizza and chips wasn t that great Also the showers real bad design , not much to be honest It was very airy in the entrance that was a nice feature 
19266,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We did not book the Spa in advance hence no appointments for the whole of our weekend stay advise booking in advance , staff very welcoming spacious light lobby and lounge area proximity of Thames and St Pauls 
19267,Grange St Paul s Hotel, arrived at 5pm rooms not available when available not clean long wait at lifts in morning over 10 mins no drinking water in rooms for high cost rooms no mobile phone reception in rooms high charges on land line difficulty in obtaining land line, location
19268,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Location, Location 5 star accommodation no way near to 3 star We found food under the bed which shows higenic standard of the hotel We booked room for 4 people but everything was prepared based on 2 people Sauna was not working but there was no apology basically our weekend was ruined 
19269,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Hotel is very clean staff are helpful I ask for a few items which was sent which helped as it was my birthday breakfast was amazing definitely would go back again
19270,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Stayed last year and the croissants and pastries were the best I d ever tasted This year they were quite disappointing, Brilliant service from start to finish
19271,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The drinks were a little pricey but it is london , We went for my husbands birthday and very much enjoyed the spa and complimentary birthday cup cakes Everyone was really friendly and helpful 
19272,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room was ridiculously overpriced Drinks also very expensive at the bar 40 for 3 G T s We were taking our grand daughter for her first trip to London and struggled to find a hotel that would accommodate 3 in a room Although the room was very nice it was no different from any other and in hind sight it would have been far cheaper to book 2 double rooms We were charged 263 for a triple room The guy booking in next to me was quoted 115 for a double Wouldn t stop us going back but we re a little wiser and poorer , Location was excellent room was good and bed very comfortable Great facilities

19275,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The facilities were excellent The hotel was in an ideal location in the centre of London with lots of restaurants locally and shops The staff were brilliant really friendly helpful Would definitely recommend this hotel for somewhere to stay in London and will be considering going back 
19276,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I did not take breakfast but my partner did and he said it was a bit over priced for what there was there Perhaps it was just his taste , Classy looking establishment very comfortable rooms You have everything you need It is not a great location at the weekend because the city is so dead but it was convenient for me because I was attending a course nearby 
19277,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, 5 star hotel with everything you would expect I got a deal so in fact probably paid a three star price Room v very quiet V good Location fantastic In the city and a minute from St Paul s 
19278,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room temperature was hot 25o and only way to control this was the noisy air conditioning , Manager was very accommodating to a last minute request I had to use the roof terrace for a special occasion 
19279,Grange St Paul s Hotel, More could be made of the sky bar as it was more of an outside area to which you could take your drink as opposed to a bar , Hotel is in a good location and the spa facilities are great given the central location 
19280,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Room overlooked St Paul s cathedral and was a 2 minute walk to the Tube or the Thames Clean bedroom and bathroom and comfy bed Perfect inexpensive weekend hotel in London Will definitely be back

19283,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I was extremely disappointed and went to reception and identified the issue to Fredricah who assured me someone will get back to me Nobody bothered , The property has very few faults 
19284,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast poor value and noise in room was awful could not sleep asked to be moved and manager pretended it was nothing then said he had no space been 5 today mess would not return to stay, Check in seamless and Spa
19285,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Crazy sensor mini bar system lost to remote and looked under the bed and there was a sweet packet and some other rubbish left under it, Comfy bed nice room good shower and bath 
19286,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast not included no water free in room first bottle not replaced afterwards no toothpaste in room, Option for lights in the bathroom being low as well as full shower 
19287,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There were stains on the throw and cushions and what looked like splattered blood on the ceiling in the bathroom When I checked out I wasn t even asked how my stay was I had meant to write to the hotel but hadn t had time , Great location
19288,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Fab rooms great location beautiful hotel Loved the pool and spa facilities Avoid the glass lift takes forever as it stops at every floor use the lifts to the side of walkway Central atrium is very pretty Overall really decent hotel
19289,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Waited 15 mins for a coffee in the sports bar rest of my party were having a drink and watching the football I then waited another 15 minutes for milk by which time the coffee was too cold to drink Response from the waiter was it s not my fault we are busy , Location and faclities
19290,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Pillows slightly lumpy , Great location room very clean superb bathroom comfortable bed staff helpful friendly fun having a Starbucks inside the hotel which never shuts Never seem to have time to use the Spa 
19291,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Compared to other 5 star hotels we felt this was poor It was more expensive that I would usually pay but we haven t had a holiday for a while so were taking a couple of extra days after my work conference and wanted something a bit special The room we stayed in seemed tired and dull the pillows were not very nice or comfortable and the shower leaked through the doors There was not any complimentary water which would have been nice and seems usual in other hotels We assume we paid for location and peace rather than anything else , The location was really good and despite being so central it was very quiet The bed was reasonably comfortable and there was space The staff were friendly and helpful although this is a big hotel and so it didn t feel particularly personal 
19292,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The majority of the staff especially the bar staff were miserable and very very slow , The hotel is great location is great and the facilities are superb 
19293,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff are shockingly bad the concierge is unflexible and isn t interested in providing a true concierge service they remained of the opinion that one laundry collection per day was adequate and that no express service was available for anything handed over after 8 45am , Room service was good 
19294,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Air conditioning could have been easier to adjust, Very efficient check in out procedure High standard of fixtures fittings within the room Comfy beds Excellent service at the Globe restaurant 
19295,Grange St Paul s Hotel, air conditioning instead of windows to open it woke me up in the night and dried my skin out over 3 days Poor mobile signal and DODGY wifi which was annoying, clean and comfortable polite and cheerful concierge on the door brilliant location for the Tate Modern Globe and Bankside generally A suspicious bartender in the bar who wasnt as polite as he could have been dont THINK i look like a gangster I m a 49 year old female bookkeeper lols
19296,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room was much too hot 23 degrees C and it took ages with help to get the temperature down to a level where we could sleep comfortably Also the room was rather dark I d requested a room with a decent view but did not get one , Swimming pool is really pleasant Room was spotlessly clean Location meant that we could walk to many of the places we were visiting 
19297,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast prices are a little too high especially when you are paying for 4 adults, The bed was really comfortable Normally when staying in a double room the beds have been used for single occupancy and you can tell by the mattress I usually end up rolling in the middle 
19298,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There is no phone signal in the rooms and the wifi is appalling Makes this place useless for business trips The beds are incredibly uncomfortable and they provide only one firmness of pillow soft even when you ask for firm pillows they send only soft pillows The concierge is the least flexible I ve ever come across Around 4pm I asked the concierge to wash two shirts for me for the morning and they refused because I d missed the 8 45am cut off The interior facing windows are novel but offer little privacy so once you get over the novelty of seeing into other people s room it s really quite irritating having your curtains closed the entire time The price was ridiculous 215 night for an exec room when the only difference between that and the superior was a sofa rather than a single seat chair Having paid an extra 85 night for The Ritz a few weeks prior I m struggling to understand how the Grange can justify the minimal price difference This is far from a 5star hotel and I would not recommend this place to anyone , The bar downstairs is quite cool and the location next to St Pauls and the Tate modern is very good Room service was on time and everything was delivered correctly the scallops were very good 
19299,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Why do you put so many cushions on the bed are they really needed , I enjoyed the peace and quiet as I have a very busy life and go to the Grange for a peaceful night s sleep
19300,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff were rude and had attitude problem making you feel unwelcome towards the hotel My checkout wasn t until 1pm however I was unable to access my room with a key after 11am I did an early check in and when I went to retrieve my room keys after 3pm the check in time one of the rooms was still not available The receptionist was rude and not apologetic about the situation , The hotel was in an idea location close to coffee shops and restaurants and the station The facilities at the hotel were very good 
19301,Grange St Paul s Hotel, One of the two main lifts was out of use which was a bit of a pain during busy restaurant hours A small issue though , We spent two nights here for our wedding anniversary and requested a room with a view to help make it a bit more special The hotel obliged by giving us a great view of the cathedral and left two cupcakes in our room with a lovely Happy Anniversary message 
19302,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I personally thought hotel lacked character, Booked a suite was given a small double went and complained room was changed to A large suite with a view of St Paul s Was asked at booking if special occasion emailed to say hubbys birthday have stayed at lots of hotels in London for birthdays anniversaries etc and always something in room complementary cake wine Here nothing lol 
19303,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We were not treated well by the staff and that included the Manager The staff charged us twice when we extended our stay Refused us breakfast and apparently is was to included but it was which we were told by the manager could never happen We had someone come into the room in the middle of the night shouting security this was also dismissed Finally the manager admitted to making up for this and we never heard from him I tried to get his email but he was reluctant , The location is great the hotel decor is really nice The rooms are clean and comfy 
19304,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Wifi was poor unable to connect and when connected kept dropping off Breakfast was disappointing quality Check out was slow Lifts were slow And on night 1 there was a weird generator noise in the room 214, Large comfy beds Lovely spa swimming facilities
19305,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Had to move from 1st room as overlooked by office workers Air con confusing , Did not eat in hotel Loved the pillows but too many cushions to accommodate at night 
19306,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The price of food and drinks was a discrace Paid 250 for 2 nights should have been 500 and breakfast wasnt even included, Spa and pool was nice room was clean and comfortable
19307,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast was terrible and not what I expect of a 5 star hotel this was via room service The toast wasn t good and seemed to be quite cheap bread and sausages The scrambled eggs were not to standard , The location was perfect and in listening distance to the chimes of St Pauls The staff were very friendly and professional and assisted me as I was on crutches and wearing a knee brace 
19308,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff charged me twice for the room Not cool Despite me telling them that I d already paid they charged me a second time Staff training required , Location is amazing and the room was fabulous Bed extremely comfortable and a three headed shower is always a bonus 
19309,Grange St Paul s Hotel, My only gripe was the bed It was so hard I did ask for this to be seen to but was not contacted over the last two days of our stay , A lovely hotel with very friendly staff in a great location Easy access to cafes buses and Underground 
19310,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Small room small shower Hot chocolate spilt by barman got no apology Upgrade offerred prior from 2 bed room to 1 bed room Double charged breakfast It is London but room with a view of a wall , Pleasant swimming pool spa area building with airy atrium and location all good

19314,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bed was not comfy Both me and my wife woke with sore backs each day Also a window which could open in the room would have been good The second lift being out of order the whole week , Pool sauna etc very good Size of room Location was perfect 
19315,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Very slow check in We were told there was no room ready for us and we were shown to a room in a building off site as a swap We didn t like it returned to reception and a room was suddenly available only 15 minutes later Felt like you were trying to relocate people because you had over bookings and I was just a little irritating as it made our check jn slow and protracted No compensation was offered for the discomfort , Fabulous location Wonderful facilities very comfortable 
19316,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Seemed a bit tired and in need of an uplift and enlivening Room was a bit dark lacking natural light , Convenient position quick check in and check out Did exactly what it said on the box very quiet and spacious room just did not have enough time to appreciate it 
19317,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Unqualified receptionist who booked us in did not check details and she tried to take payment on credit card a second time even though we said we would pay cash Also do NOT like that they hold a payment on your card for at least 4 days after you have settled the bill in CASH The view from our bedroom was a brick wall The corridors are extremely hot The hotel bar appears to allow anyone and everyone to enter For an apparently 5 star hotel the client le is far from that and the bar was very busy and very noisy at 1 45am No complimentary water in our room we had to go to a local M S to get some The bathroom was quite small , The bed very comfortable The cleaning staff very pleasant

19320,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I booked for a superior twin room we were initially given the wrong room king sized bed etc The new room was lovely but it did not look as sumptious as the pictures on your site for superior twin It was smaller though comfortable I was a bit disappointed though , Location comfy beds very helpful staff leaving luggage while away flufy white gowns 
19321,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Loud staff they were moving furniture late in the evening I called reception and they said it would stop it was an hour after until it did so it was 11pm at night I wanted an early night and didn t expect to be kept awake ,No Positive

19324,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Food and drinks at the hotel are very expensive Unfortunately there were 2days where our room was missed from the cleaning list and not because we d put the do not disturb sign up it was unexpected and unpleasant at the end of the day to get back and have to sort it out with housekeeping staff in the evening Also we were overcharged by approximately 25 for extra papers and mini drink bar items which we never had when we raised this with reception staff they were pleasant and apologetic in making a full refund but it made me wonder how many people are caught out by not checking the bill , Fantastic location

19327,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The breakfast at 23 each is a little overpriced I do appreciate that it is London but you don t seem to get anything more special than you would get at a premier inn
19328,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Not clear instruction on when you signing out the hotel and how to do it had to wait in the que for a long time, I liked the location and the vib st the hotel staff were friendly when we arrive
19329,Grange St Paul s Hotel, They pushed two single beds together and put a thin mattress topper on top The beds kept sliding apart causing a groove in the middle I woke up with back pain The throw cushions were stained with something I dread to think what it was , The hotel was beautiful nicely decorated and spacious 
19330,Grange St Paul s Hotel, the quality of the rooms was well below what i expected old in need of upgrade connectivity was really poor wifi in room refused to work both days general upkeep in areas not great lift was jamming and stopping Hotels can look nice front of house but if the areas where we stay does not match the first impression it is a huge dissapointment , service was very good in patches overall very pleasent atmosphere created by the team
19331,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Incompetent reception staff Weird system that consists of LOCKING the fridge unless you pay 100 extra on guarantee is the Visa card not a guarantee I woke up in the middle of the night thirsty and because the receptionist didn t explain their internal pathetic rule of locking fridges l ended up drinking the tap water ,No Positive
19332,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Room facilities very good Bed was extremely good Nice bathroom Great location to explore the city Close to Blackfriars and St Paul s station Hotel close to bars restaurant and attractions in City 
19333,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The bed was really quite uncomfortable too hard The hotel itself is nice however location for a weekend break isn t the best so little in the immediate vicinity and particularly a lack of decent restaurants St Pauls is just a bit of a nuisance to get to and from ,No Positive

19337,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Pool was open to children after designated times Good for families bad for solo business travelers Not a major issue , Requested a room overlooking the Cathedral which was duly satisfied Staff were attentive Rooms and hotel were clean and elegant Huge variety of bars and lounge area For London location is probably best I have stayed in Perfect for both business or leisure 
19338,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Although the room is good I do not like the fact that when you give them a card as a guarantee they take money out of your account for your room fee plus extra for damages straight away but when you pay they don t refund the money for 5 7 working days Why can you have money instantly withdraw but they can t refund straight away ,No Positive
19339,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The hotel and swimming pool felt a bit overcrowded Yes we stayed on a discounted rate for the room but it didn t appear a good value for money We ordered breakfast in and not only the order was mixed up two lattes came lukewarm and pastries tasted like leftovers from yesterday When complained desk staff was helpless manager unavailable Promised to call me back never did Overall left a bitter taste of the whole stay I would never stay again and would not recommend to a friend There are plenty of other really good hotels in London with similarly good locations but better service , Spa facilities are very good spa staff is welcoming and helpful Location is convenient five minutes from the tube station
19340,Grange St Paul s Hotel, On the more expensive side in terms of value for money , Lovely hotel very comfortable and good size rooms with a bath seperate shower Location is brilliant on the doorstep of St Paul s 
19341,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Arrived 2 00pm and had to wait until 3 30pm for my room which had a guaranteed 3 00pm check in Had two you g children with me and was offered no gesture Indeed I had to complain to the manager at 3 30 that I had been left standing around The lady on reception was abrupt towards me , Facilities and location
19342,Grange St Paul s Hotel, breakfast was a bit pricey and the bacon was very tough , a great location very clean we asked for a room with a view of St Pauls Cathederal and we were not disappointed as the receptionist was very helpful and the room had a great view 
19343,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing It was amazing Would have been helpful if the cleaner knew English as we wanted her to clean our room but she didn t understand what we were trying to say, It was just perfect Especially the spa 
19344,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Honestly Couldn t of been better , Excellent staff made to feel very welcome and special extensive local knowledge and fantastic facilities within the hotel
19345,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast for 2 is 46 00 and 1 glass of wine almost 10 00 Very pricey but many alternative options available locally , Room spacious Loved double beds in twin room Staff service excellent Gorgeous hotel Well positioned near tube for shopping sightseeing and eating out Food and drink grossly overpriced Would definitely stay here again but won t eat drink here as loads of options on doorstep 
19346,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was rubbish and for 40 a rip off My husband ordered eggs benedict and where they must have been microwaved her burnt his mouth, Lovely hotek
19347,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Bed wasn t particularly comfortable , Large modern and spacious rooms Fantastic gym large range of machines and equipment Pool and spa area great as well 
19348,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The breakfast prices were high but other than that it was lovely , The location was great with enough pubs and cafes around if you didn t want to eat at the property 
19349,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The terrace bar area was closed locked It should be open at all times It looked like the view of St Pauls from the terrace bar is spectacular particularly at night It was one of the reasons I booked this hotel and was gutted it was locked The web sight brochure is NOT clear on this , Closeness to St Pauls Cathedral Bar area s Pool and Spa facilities 
19350,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I wouldn t say Benihana restaurant was the best but it was ok After the spa we didn t want to leave the hotel but the meal was very heavy and a bit overpriced for what it was , The staff were really friendly and helpful and we had special touches added to our room because I d mentioned it was a friend s birthday 
19351,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The fire alarm going off with no explaintation or answer from reception when calling them , Hotel is lovely nice modern decor Friendly staff and nice location
19352,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Perhaps it is missing that something extra in the rooms i e a basket of fruit or at least a large bottle of water mints on the pillow , Excellent service polite and helpful staff convenient location 
19353,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was a nightclub downstairs which was holding an event which didn t look like a very nice crowd at all When we returned from what was an amazing night up at Maddisons for there NYE event we ended up seeing fights people with bloodied noses there faces smashed in from what looked like being bottled Who ever runs that event needs to take a good look at what type of people they are allowing to party below a 5 star hotel that s for sure , The Grange St Paul s is a hotel I ve stayed at many times before once again on NYE I was not let down by how nice the staff were A real beautiful hotel with a nice bar that stayed open Til late after we returned from Maddisons champagne roof top bar Lovely shopping centre based close by for all of my last minute shopping requirements the gym spa always satisfy me when I stay here Really nice hot steamy steam room 
19354,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only thing I didn t like was that I couldn t find a price list for the minibar so I was wary of using anything in case I got a nasty shock , Excellent location Nice big room Very comfortable
19355,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We did not have breakfast at the hotel I might have been tempted if there had been a menu in my room , This was the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in We were spending a weekend at the theatre at The Barbican and it was only a short walk from the hotel to the venue We swam in the pool at the hotel which was lovely The changing facilities were very good We booked in very easily were earlier than check in time but able to go to our room We are both quite tall so chose a room with twin beds so we could sleep well Both beds were doubles so we could sleep without our feet hanging out of the bottom And the beds were REALLY comfortable 
19356,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room wasn t cleaned by 16 30 on the Saturday afternoon which meant we had no time to relax as we had to get ready for a pre arranged meeting Also the staff in the main bar were just too slow After complaining to the manager they reduced our final bill by removing the cost of our breakfasts , We have stayed here several times before and love the location as the hotel rooms with the wonderful view of St Paul s cathedral 
19357,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Good location rate and facilities Great to be able to use the gym and pool for free as a hotel guest Everything was modern and clean and rooms were a decent size for the city at the price we paid 
19358,Grange St Paul s Hotel, They hosted a rave in the sports bar on our second night starting from 10pm till early morning keeping us both awake on level five not just us kept awake but many guests complaining and staff unable to get the party of 30 people at this rave to turn the music down and no ability to get it closed down This was that loud on level five vibrations could be felt and base music heard and the dj shouting through his microphone paying to be kept awake is a novelty not likely to catch on We are awaiting a refund for that night still Also the spa needs tlc and not very clean And a good idea to clean bath mats in the rooms occasionally , stopped here before and loved it very big rooms lovely looking excellent location 
19359,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Upgrade is not worth it because there is absolutely no difference between the standard room and the upgrade So I advise to book the basic room U can t really opens the curtains because the hotel is surrounded with offices and residential buildings from each side so privacy is not an option Staff is not really helpful they don t come from hotel schools so don t expect anything sophisticated And a smile from the front desk wouldn t hurt Elevators are always busy way too many heavy doors in the hall ways accusing the spa is very complicated no signage to guide you I think for that price you can find a better value for your money , Central location very close to St Paul s central line stop convenient to access easily all over the main attractions Hotel is well facilitated but not worth a 5 stars Very nice view from the rooftop terrace over the st Paul s Cathedral it s a shame they don t serve drinks on the terrace 
19360,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I had to ask for room in main building as I am not found of other part of hotel , Location location location Comfortable rooms bath and shower option bath robs in room 
19361,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It s a shame there isn t anywhere to relax by the pool or in between sauna and steam rooms The nearest place to get a cup of water was in the gym which we felt was too far away too it One of my party had to wait 45 minutes for her massage too as they forgot about her despite her reminding them 3 times , Lovely spa very nice relaxation area quadruple room very comfortable with a lovely bathroom Slippers and bathrobes were a nice addition to the room and the beds were very comfortable We really enjoyed the on site Japanese restaurant A real theatrical experience 
19362,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff not attentive eg removing used plates during breakfast serving drinks I think they were understaffed for Christmas , Great location for Christmas Services at St Pauls
19363,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The charge for breakfast at 23 for cooked was too high I just went around the corner for a petit dejeurnet, Very quiet lovely rooms and nice ambience
19364,Grange St Paul s Hotel, we had breakfast on the final morning of our stay whilst there was a good selection of hot food the plates were cold so the food was only just warm when we ate it, very helpful staff a comfortable room and only a short walk to the underground
19365,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Part of the spa has been closed to usual residents where over previous years it was always open , The standard of the rooms from basic to superior are always exemplary The leisure facilities are very good when compared to any hotel of similar cost and particularly in London 
19366,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Stayed here one night in advance of my daughters exam at a school in the morning Had a great stay Staff were polite helpful and friendly We both had a great stay there I used the pool which was great
19367,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was nothing to complain about The only thing that could maybe be improved was the docking station didn t have a connecter for our iPhone 5 s so we couldn t play music whilst getting ready but it wasn t exactly an issue , We had such an amazing night and the hotel was stunning Definitely want to come back Everything from booking to checking out was so simple and hassle free and for the price we paid the experience we had was unreal 
19368,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Cooked breakfast was definitely not worth 25 It was a buffet and the bacon was rock hard and tasteless There is a chef to provide fried eggs and omelettes but he ran out of eggs and had to go back to the kitchen to get more during which time the rest of the food got cold , The location is excellent the room was large and very clean and the bed very comfortable 
19369,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was a party at floor 1 or 2 over the New Years eve By 2 am there were bottles chairs flying around security just sat there and did nothing Also why would you a card pre authorization that would last for weeks , Location is convenient if you re a tourist 
19370,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, We liked everything The Japanese restaurant and staff was a great experience first time for Japanese dining My daughter and I absolutely loved it Rooms were clean and had everything we needed Really can not fault this hotel It was a perfect over night stay 
19371,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Nothing the air con was a little noisy and they need to replace the cheap lampshades as the plastic behind the facia of the shades are split and starting to look tatty for a 5 hotel only seen when lamps are on , The location how clean the room was thoughtful gesture off birthday cake and plate decoration in our room as was my birthday the staff member who helped with our parking on last day as was a private parking area a well run hotel Daily paper at door a nice touch no complaints Nothing about the hotel but a car park is but 3 minutes walk away and cost only 2 50 per day at weekends yes per day and 2 per hour at other times great price for central London 
19372,Grange St Paul s Hotel, No complimentary water in rooms Mini bar locked Wifi not very good Disjointed building Not 5 standard in any way , Location Comfortable bed and pillows Concierge service very good 
19373,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room overlooked the see through lifts and eating areas where people could look into your room The only window Couldn t change the temperature in room it was set on 25 degrees too warm Very commercial feel get in check name get out , We enjoyed heated pool sauna facilities downstairs However mostly greeted by miserable staff 
19374,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only negative was the hugely inflated prices for any food or drink whilst staying at the hotel My wife was not well so I ordered two bottles of water from room service our mini bar was broken and wouldn t open and the bill came to 16 Bit ridiculous even for London , The location of the hotel is superb and allowed us to easily walk into town and to nearby restaurants The room was clean and well presented and the staff couldn t be more helpful 
19375,Grange St Paul s Hotel, I would not describe this as a luxury 5 star hotel The furniture in our room was of poor quality and partly broken The staff are stressed and often unfriendly partly because there are simply not enough of them We had to queue for 20 minutes just to check in When we came back to our room on the second day at 4pm it still had not been cleaned Getting a drink at the bar in the evenings also took a long time Very disappointing For the price we paid I would espect a much higher standard , Easy to get to and from by bus Several good breakfast options nearby that are much cheaper than the hotel breakfast Great to be near St Paul s so long as you don t mind the bells all night Quiet room 
19376,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The fact we booked a superior room and got an apartment room over the road and round the corner wasn t pleased as we wanted the experience in the hotel was In a room with a window but it was a skylight so that put a downer on our trip felt like we was just bunged into the worst room We was given complementary breakfast which was fine but only made it to one sitting so wasn t really bothered about having that as a sorry for putting u into our crappest room in the hotel , Great location nice hotel spa sauna steam room ect
19377,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Too many people at the same time at breakfast makes it like a football match, Great location for the city friendly staff good sports facilities and pool
19378,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Air conditioning units buzzed all night next to our room which was near a stair well The manager gave us a slight discount the next day for this We didn t order breakfast just as well it didn t look great Go locally for some excellent eateries , Great location next to St Pauls 
19379,Grange St Paul s Hotel, very disapointed that we had no access to roof top facilities or basement night club This was majored on web site but this is reserved for functions , great location for exploring london very good spa facilities
19380,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only negative experience we experienced were the bar staff who were slow unenthused and bordering on rude , Lovely spacious rooms and the vast majority of staff were extremely helpful and friendly 
19381,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Stayed in a 3 person room Was under the impression that it would have two double beds but was a dble and a sofa bed The main double bed was VERY firm and the mattress on the sofa bed was so thin you could feel the metal bars through it Would have been better in both instances to sleep direct on floor Our check out was 11am and twice housekeeping knocked on our door at 9 15 then again at 10 even though we told them we would be out by 11 Not good as we wanted a restful stay We did speak to the Manager about the poor quality of a 5 hotel , Location excellent
19382,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was no record of us paying cash when we checked in so when we were checking out they had no proof that we had already paid for our stay , The veiw of St Paul s from our bedroom was beautiful We were offered a free upgrade to this room 
19383,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was nice and the area is also really nice and peaceful not so busy like other parts off London the staff were very friendly and lovely as well I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again to
19384,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Room allocated wasnt the best cleaning could be improved Food ordered for room service very average, Great location convenient for short breaks with very good transport links
19385,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The swiming pool which was to cramp , Staff in reception were very polite Who upon asking for a possible upgrade which they were very happy to look in to 
19386,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Location very convenient for my work Great value for money on the deal I got this time Very nice room good amenities everything you need within walking distance 
19387,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Staff students with no energie in hotel bar are very slow they don t ask you if you would like something but you have to call them by yourself not good for a five star hotel Room had a dirty sheet and view on a neighbour building I guess the sheet was overlooked The roommate tried to come into the room at 6pm when we were resting , Nice room with a lot of equiptment You get a shower and bathtube which is nice Location is top right next to St Pauls cathedral no problem finding the hotel Nice staff at the reception Good value for money 
19388,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Really hard beds but the pillows are like sleeping on clouds My partner thought it was fine but I m used to something softer, Brilliant staff nothing was to much for them Changed our room to one with a view ordered us taxis booked our meals and were generally just so helpful and polite The room was spotless every time we returned and then the beds were turned down at night for us 
19389,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Privacy was a problem as the inside of the room was visible from the lift and atrium when the curtain was open , Location cannot be beaten Many good dining options around including for breakfast 
19390,Grange St Paul s Hotel, As 2 female friends travelling together we had booked a twin room but we were allocated a room with one kingsize bed No other twin rooms were available so a team was sent to convert our room as the king bed separates into two singles but they didn t do a thorough job One single bed was left with a kingsize mattress topper on it meaning it couldn t be made properly the other bed had no mattress topper at all was only roughly made Bedside table left in the middle of the room phone left on the back of the sofa The room should have been converted and properly before we checked in which was late at night so there s no excuse for it not to have been done in time for our arrival , Very stylish spacious hotel in a great location 
19391,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The view from our room was appalling It completely looked out onto office workers who could not help but see right into our room so we had no privacy or view whatsoever This resulted in us having to keep our curtains fully closed at all times which caused a somewhat claustrophobic feeling Very sad At busy periods the lifts two would often be unattainable and you were kept waiting You sometimes could not get into them as they were small and so when busy they were full I could not find the stairs , Excellent staff Nothing too much trouble and very polite and attentive 
19392,Grange St Paul s Hotel,No Negative, Warmly welcomed excellent room and facilities and all staff were really helpful A little bit of luxury in a great location Will definitely return 
19393,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Checking out was incredibly slow which is very frustrating The main glass lifts were very busy and therefore slow although there are also lifts each side of the hotel but they are not very clearly marked and weren t mentioned at reception , Location was fantastic The rooms were well equipped 
19394,Grange St Paul s Hotel, It isn t the most five star a five star hotels and you re not exactly made to feel particularly special or anything but if you re aware of the hotel s shortcomings and are able to make the most of its best features then it s a good stay , The location is great and the swimming pool was just what we needed 
19395,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was very disappointing Not value for money eat at Cafe Rouge next door instead , Perfect location for St Paul s and surroundings Spacious room Nice bath room
19396,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room was next to the lift shaft and we experienced noise from the lift till the early hours then from breakfast time we complained and was given another room , Location ideal for our purpose a f mily party 
19397,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Price was high 226 not including breakfast and was charged 30 for two double Jack Daniels , Very clean central hotel bar staff were a bit slow but ok the hotel lacked a sense of warmth with the large central atrium it seemed like you were in an airport rather than a hotel 
19398,Grange St Paul s Hotel, You have to go outside to get to the pool and sauna A little inconvenient as it was quite cold when we left the pool , The service was very good Very comfortable and spacious room 
19399,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Inadequate loos near luggage area Main seating area wasn t serviced a da bit cold, Closeness to St Paul s and other places we wished to visit The Spa was excellent
19400,Grange St Paul s Hotel, One of the central lifts was broken the other was therefore very slow Other lifts available though , Location is excellent Although busy staff were very efficient and friendly Very clean good size room with super comfy bed 
19401,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast is very expensive considering how much the room is breakfasts should be included , Location and the function we attended was in the venue so we didn t have to walk too far to our room which was great 
19402,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The hotel didn t know if our room was ready at 8 p m A lot of standing around waiting for a room at this time of night The room was booked three months earlier , Location fantastic 
19403,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Long queue on check in with only one receptionist on The chap we had didint give us much info at all Ate in the GLobe restaurant which was very good except for my shop bought ravioli which was disappointing as rest of meal very tasty We upgraded our room amd thought breakfast was included and not another 40 Also upgraded room was nothing special and looked just the same as a superior double Is oo1 an executive room as the receptionist did have trouble finding us a room , Good location friendly staff
19404,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Lifts were very slow didn t help that people were using them to get from 2nd floor to 1st floor restaurant area Noise from air con was a nuisance as it seemed to be pre set allowing for temperature to rise to a certain level and then kick in being so close to St Pauls Cathedral I would have thought that the Windows would have had double or triple glazing to keep the noise of the bells ringing unfortunately not , Fairly central in London literally minutes walk away from St Pauls tube station Staff very good 
19405,Grange St Paul s Hotel, A deal on Booking com leads to a tiny smelly room leading to a disappointing experience Shame on you both, Great location Previous visits have been a pleasure
19406,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We had a disappointing room size considering we paid for an upgrade the room was similar to the size we had on a previous stay in the front end of the hotel which not upgraded , Location was great and the bed was comfortable facilities were brilliant 
19407,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Some difficulty in getting staff to understand what you were saying as their command of the English language in some cases was poor , Location and comfort 
19408,Grange St Paul s Hotel, They gave us a room with workmen jack hammering in the ceiling Left some property behind They denied it was there until we physically returned to the hotel to insist they look ,No Positive
19409,Grange St Paul s Hotel, From the moment I arrived I was told that breakfast wasn t included in the price but when I booked it the person said it was My room had a leak from the AC but it was clearly an ongoing problem as there was a huge mouldy stain on the carpet The room was dusty and the USB port was broken I made a complaint and I don t feel like it was taken seriously ,No Positive
19410,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Not worth the money paid Staff were not very polite Room relatively small not value for money however great location food at restaurants within the hotel not great Did not feel like a 5 star ,No Positive
19411,Grange St Paul s Hotel, no car parking breakfast cannot be recommended They are not able to make a coffee that they have to present a starbucks coffee for you Their own coffee is warm brown water I wanted privacy but they disturbed me 4 times after that the staff needed a torch to made the air condition setting the extraction fan did not work overall no 5 star hotel, It was quite but no nice view
19412,Grange St Paul s Hotel, This is a comment rather than a criticism the hotel was very busy with corporate clients which made it a bit on the noisy side but although stretched the service never snapped , Great location a stone s throw from St Pauls and the Millennium Bridge All the facilities comfort and efficiency you would expect 
19413,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The beds are really really hard The rooms are not quite the standard a 5 star hotel should be, The location is great We also liked the food it was very good
19414,Grange St Paul s Hotel, No breakfast included in the price of the stay Towels in bathroom were not 5 star , The position of the hotel was ideal On good bus route to the West End 
19415,Grange St Paul s Hotel, There was nothing I didn t like about this hotel , The location was excellent and close to the metro Vey luxury hotel with free pool jacuzzi and sauna Rooms were big and very nice and comfortable Everything was perfect 
19416,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Instant coffee in rooms is dreadful 1 of the UHT milk was separated and off , Fantastic shower though opening the door did move the floor towel Staff really good Blackout curtains blind worked well 
19417,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only thing I did not like is that during our whole stay it was events and parties at the roof top bar so we couldent have a drink there one singel day there during the whole stay So thats very dissapointing , Comfy hotel Very central Definitly to be recommanded 
19418,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Still awaiting an email response 12 days on to my enquiry about item possibly left behind by us after check out Some of the breakfast waiting staff needed more training , Stunning location and decor Very friendly and welcoming front of house staff Extremely clean and comfortable accommodation 
19419,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Breakfast was decidedly average and not 5 star standard Too much self service e g make your own toast not enough choice no pancakes or omelettes to order drinks luke warm not hot and served by the cup Not good value when compared to similar properties , Great ambiance and sociable atmosphere in the bars and public areas Availability of food until late in the bar is a plus 
19420,Grange St Paul s Hotel, the bar service was non existent and our room wasn t cleaned despite going to reception and requesting same Breakfast extortionate everybody eating in Hush, The proximity of the hotel to everywhere
19421,Grange St Paul s Hotel, We got upgraded this was actually a down grade from the standard room I have stayed in previously and the room I booked was actually meant to be a upgrade on that which means the room I got was a upgrade above that It was not , Great location really delicious breakfast 
19422,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The only thing I found quite surprising for a quality hotel was that we were given a room that was occupied by someone else , Location and helpful staff 
19423,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The staff struggled to understand when we had a problem My boyfriend asked for flowers to be in the room when we arrived but there was none The breakfast was delivered wrong and then we had to wait 20 mins for the right items leaving the rest cold Some of the reception staff in the spa were incredibly rude Also staff kept entering and knocking on the door when we had the do not disturb sign on , Location amazing bed was huge and comfy Very clean not a spec of dirt anywhere 
19424,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Went for a morning dip in the pool and it was pretty cold no amount of lengths seemed to help get warm , Rooms were very modern spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous and bright 
19425,Grange St Paul s Hotel, The ladder in the Jacuzzi There is a sign saying watch for the high step it s not a step it s a ladder and yes I fell in and had several minutes of wondering if I d broken the foot I d just twisted The sign needs to warn that it s a ladder not steps This was the only problem at this hotel and I would stay there again , Great staff good location although business area pretty dead at night Nice pool area with steam sauna laconium etc see single issue under what I didn t like

19431,Grange St Paul s Hotel, Our room was cleaned only in the late afternoon evening around 6 30pm and one day was not cleaned at all although we asked for it to be clean when we were out of the room between 9am 3pm One of the children had an accident in bed one night and we needed to wait around two hours for someone to change our sheets mattress We were offered free breakfast after we complained We tried to find the costumer service to talk about it and get some sort of refund instead as we needed to leave early the morning the free breakfast was suggested to us but they were no where to be found Also as a big family we needed to wait for each other quite a lot around the hotel There were too many times when we got approached and been given the impression we re not welcome to just stand there , Location was great Few staff members were very helpful The Japanese restaurant in the hotel was amazing 
19432,Grange St Paul s Hotel, When we arrived we were told our room wasn t ready and to come back at 2pm We went and ate in the bar and had very poor service from the one staff member Once she brought our food we never saw her again I went back to the front desk and once again our room wasn t ready and I was told that check in is after 3 I told him the first person told me to come back at 2 and their website said check in starting at 2 He just gave excuse after excuse and we were left to sit around in the lobby for another 45 minutes or more while we waited for a room Understand we had just arrived from a very long overnight flight from Canada and just wanted to get to our room At no time were we ever told we were entitled to breakfast eventhough I thought it was included The doormen were friendly but they were almost the only ones , The room was very nice and the location was great The food from room service was good 
19433,Grange St Paul s Hotel, 1 Didn t act like a 5 star hotel 2 The Grange St Paul s It s a place to get your head down 3 No understanding of customer service Which is a shame for a 5 star hotel 4 House keeping does not knock before entering the room So you get woken up by a stranger in your room 5 Internet although complementary keeps falling out in the rooms Very annoying We went out an purchased local Sims from O2 that kept us connected 6 Late checkout charged at 20 an hour Really As opposed to we ll see if we can accommodate you like all other hotels do Also in their policy is if you checkout after 17 00 you will be charged for the full nights accommodation as opposed to a half day rate Sounds like you are being robbed 7 Checkout is too early at 11 00 should be 12 00 8 General manager failed to show up despite two requests for him 9 TV remote did not work Despite reporting it no one came to fix it Despite being here for over a week 10 The slowest door opening in a lift Try it it will drive you nuts London 5 star hotels Well none seemed to have got the memo Compared to the rest of the world LONDON has a lot of catching up to do Maybe they should send their staff to Asia and UAE for pointers Or just pickup a book on customer service and how to treat your guests Overall Disappointing The Grange St Paul s just doesn t get it And they are oblivious to that fact Not the worst hotel but there is a lot of improvements can easily be made Checked out of here and went to the Conrad St James Awesome so far they get it Call them for some pointers , Room size was good Location was good too
