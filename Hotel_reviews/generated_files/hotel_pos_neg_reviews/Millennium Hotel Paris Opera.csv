37733,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The breakfast was standard could be in a 2 star hotel The room was very small with no place to lay things on although it was a Club room The hotel needs complete renovation to keep a 4 star standard , The location is excellent The staff is helpful and friendly 
37734,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Limited menu in Bistrot Hausmann Would have appreciated complimentary water in the room Sometimes the English Breakfast tea bags were not restocked and teapots were occasionally unavailable , Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast choice was very good 
37735,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, I think the lobby needs to be refreshed a bit but overall was great with loads of character Breakfast was bit basic , I loved it Upon arrival I was upgraded to bigger room with balcony Great location to walk around Paris Rooms were quite french and classy 
37736,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera,No Negative, Exceptional staff who were very attentive and accommodating The food was outstanding and perfectly cooked presented Our room was very clean spacious and had a great balcony Breakfast in the room is a must Highly recommend this hotel 
37737,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Old Classic rooms carpets require some sort of renovation, This is not the first time I stayed there I stay because the location is Excellent for me 300m from Galleries Lafayette and 200m from my client office 
37738,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Rooms could be improved, Very good location as it is in walking distance from almost everywhere in Paris Old fashioned building Fast check in out
37739,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, N A, Everything comfortable and cosy rooms which were spotless Very grand entrance area and very helpful staff we were able to check in earlier than stated which was a bonus after our journey Also everything is very accessible from the hotel including 2 metro stations in close proximity Would definitely recommend 
37740,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Wifi connectivity was intermittent and often dropped while one was working , Staff are very friendly and super helpful room service offering was perfect food was prepared perfectly and always delivered with a smile 
37741,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, No convenient store nearby No bottled water provided Asians are still not comfortable drinking water straight from the tap Coffee tea was not replenished daily Cups were not washed daily Wifi was very very very very very bad, I like the location
37742,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The shower didn t work more than a dribble but we put that down to old French plumbing which we are used to However cleanliness was perfect and there was always plenty of hot water and clean towels for a bath or we used the bath shower hose No problem , The location decor comfort and staff were all excellent Walking distance of many interesting attractions and shopping but a step away Food was very good the evening we ate in and we enjoyed an apero in the bar by the fire a number of times because it was so comfortable Tea and Coffee facilities in the room were very welcome Lovely stay and we would happily book there again 
37743,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Hotel is TOO OLD and it s not good value for money, Personnel was nice and gave me a free upgrade But for that price all rooms should be like the upgraded one 
37744,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Breakfast could have been better luckily this was included in our upgrade but would have been upset if I had paid 25 each for this , The staff were great location was great it just was the cherry on top of an excellent weekend in Paris Upgrade when we arrived and as we arrived early stored our cases and on departure for the day as well Access to the executive lounge was a lovely addition as well and was nice to have on our first night before heading out into Paris Access to the metro is fantastic think it was max of 20 min to get anywhere we really wanted in central Paris also 1 stop from main lines to Disney which was great on Saturday 
37745,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera,No Negative, although I have requested a high floor room I was given one of the lousiest room the hotel has overlooking a ceiling of the bar room is fully crowded with furniture you can t move properly room number 119 its absolutely disgusting
37746,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Would have been better if breakfast included in the room rate not as an additional extra when booking through booking com , Excellent Location Grand Hotel Style A pamper weekend enjoyed by all the girls 
37747,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Breakfast start at 6 30 but only half of the buffet was ready Scrambled eggs arrived as i was finishing breakfast whatbis the point to pay for it Also another work colleague booked same type of room 2 weeks before arrival amd paid half price So i feel an idiot for paying double Thank you booking com , Good staff very pleasant
37748,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The staff were quite underwhelming in terms of being welcoming or accomodating They had a doorman who just stood there and watched as we struggled in the door with our bags He also didn t help with taking bags to the room so not sure what he s paid to do We sat downstairs at the bar for like 15 minutes without anyone coming past to greet us or take an order They weren t busy no one else was there but they were open So we ended up leaving Disappointing staff , The hotel is quite elegant They ve done a reasonable effort to keep it maintained but you can see it s age in some respects It is well located particularly with respect to the shopping district opera and also where the Rouseybus airport shuttle drops you off from the airport The sitting area and bistro looked nice but no one was ever in there so not sure of the food 
37749,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Very bad experience We thing we did not like was the Do Not Disturb sign and they still went our room The sheets were dirty and service was bad Expected more from a 4 star hotel , Nothing much

37752,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The hotel was once a wonderful place however it needs a face lift regarding the general appointments Worn furniture rugs and damaged paint on doors etc it is difficult for staff to maintain a first class appearance when the basics are lacking The property has great potential if they spend a bit upgrading , The location is very convenient 
37753,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Dated decor carpets particularly which can be upgraded without losing the classic look and feel Rooms are small baths can be upgraded for more comfort Kettle and tea coffee can be better provided I found some lapses in cleaning of the room , Great location near Opera Wifi works Nice lobby Good place to stay for business and tourism and invite people over for a meeting Few minutes from Gare du Nord 
37754,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Getting temp right on the shower was a little hard to figure out, Charming hotel with Belle Epoque feel on a quiet street with easy access to two Metro lines 
37755,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, No toothbrush in toilet kit Minibar fridge is not cold enough Missing sugar for coffee and no tea in the room Revolving door turn too fast and dengerus bit , Very combinience location Good size big room with big double bed Lighting in the room is good too Cute bathroom and big thick towel 
37756,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Check in and check out staff seemed somewhat disinterested and on both occasions walked away from a long queue , Great location Very good value for money and quite comfortable 
37757,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera,No Negative, I have been to this hotel once for business and twice for pleasure the hotel is 10 minutes from everything not too touristy and not too residential the staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are large and well appointed

37759,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Breakfasts a little chaotic had to keep getting up to obtain the right cutlery standard coffee not very good quality but cappuccino very good however machine was broken second day wait to get croissants no teaspoon for coffee, Decoration of public areas and rooms 
37760,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The service from checking in and checkout by front office especially from a highly train staff which is from front office manager was poor and rude So I wouldn t recommend if anybody want to go on holiday and get your day ruin by individual especially by the hotel that you will be staying during your holiday or business , Nothing much but the front office manager was very rude and no sense of customer service at all So wouldn t be staying at this hotel again

37763,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, I stayed here in 2014 and on this trip I felt the hotel is looking a bit tired The room only had one bedside lamp the carpets are very old and the ceiling in the bar area needed fixing after what looks like a water leak , Great location super quick check in and helpful staff
37764,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, As much as I appreciate the charm of an old Parisian hotel s antique interior I think that management ought to make an effort to ensure that the bathroom faucets sinks tubs and toilets maintain their lustre and are cleaner in appearance , Overall the quality of staff employed was very high They were professional friendly courteous attentive and gave great advice The location is perfect It s ideal for cost effective and efficient transport from your hotel to various monuments and attractions in the city 
37765,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, reception in the morning via phone not the best friendly approach metal parts in the bathroom to be cleaned look like dirthy needs to be shined, location

37769,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The concierge service was either non existent or over stretched Which made parking our car very difficult The Bar service was very poor and took second place to the restaurant service It sometimes took 15 minutes to get a drink Although tea and coffee making facilities were in the room the items were not replenished every day and had to be requested at reception , It is a traditional french hotel very clean and in a good position 
37770,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The bathroom was pokey and in need of an upgrade Poor lighting Difficult to properly flush the toilet Very high sided bathtub which could be dangerous for people with flexibility issues I almost tripped getting out after my shower If I had I would have cracked my head on the marble sink Not good The room was too hot and the air conditioning didn t seem to work Thank goodness my room was not street side and I could open the window , Great location A nice hotel in a lovely old building Classically decorated Very French with lovely furniture and classic prints of beautiful Paris buildings etc Close to metro train stations and the river The room was clean The bed was very comfortable Interior room so no street noise No view either but for an overnighter view didn t matter The price for location and type of hotel was good 
37771,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, In room wifi service was not reliable , The hotel is located in a convenient location for public transportation and an easy short walk to the opera house shopping and restaurants The rooms were very quiet and comfortable for sleeping

37773,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Nobody offered me help with my luggage on arrival nor on my departure so I had to struggle all alone with my heavy suitcases not once was I offered any assistance from the staff very poor service The bathroom was awful the shower over the bath is very old fashioned I ordered a club sandwich from room service which wasn t good at all the lettuce was wilted and brown and the turkey was unevenly cut The fries were good but then again those were probably pre cut and frozen I stayed for 3 nights each night my room was made up differently I strongly believe that a hotel should have consistencey The bed should be made in the same way every time and the pillows fluffed to perfection , The one gentleman at the front desk not sure what his name was was very helpful with my query about sightseeing tours even offered me a map so that I knew exactly where to go 
37774,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Service is absolutely not for a four star Millenium hotels Staff and service are not caring for the customers If you get the service at all expect to follow up at least 4 times Absolutely not recommending to anyone Breakfast overpriced an old facilities , Can t think of anything I liked other than the location
37775,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, There is a general lack of maintenance and the decor is a little dated, Although the general presentation of the hotel could do with attention there is an obvious feeling of class and quality The staff is a cut above the other hotels I stayed in locally and overall I found the hotel pleasant to be in

37779,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, however the hotel s rooms are horrible I had to change my room twice The first time because the door s lock and shower did not work and the second time because the heating system did not work in it I eventually gave up did not change the room again just changed the hotel altogether , The location is perfect and the staff is very helpful and friendly 
37780,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, Have to say we took coffee in the bar and it really was not good So maybe they need to look into this , Perfect position for walking to most of the attracions

37783,Millennium Hotel Paris Opera, The worst attitude towards me by the reception staff I have ever experienced in my life Extremely rude and unhelpful Unfortunately I dont know the names The worst breakfast I have ever eaten Extremely old and small rooms it is an overall problem of Paris but not in 4 star hotel In the night the whole lightening stopped working in the room had to call for technical guy In the bathroom the door of the shower was broken and barely closing Overall very bad impression from the hotel which looks so representative outside Will never recommend it to somebody Extremely dissapointed , Cleaning ladies are very polite and nice Location is very good
