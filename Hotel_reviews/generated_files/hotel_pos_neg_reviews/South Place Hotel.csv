137888,South Place Hotel, No negative comments , Staff were friendly and helpful yet discreet Coffee was great Food and drinks also well prepared and well presented VERY convenient location 
137889,South Place Hotel, Ummmmmm Mini bar prices were too high for us which is a shame as we would have been tempted with a g t and snacks on a couple of occasions , Good quality hotel the room was very good all fixtures and fittings top notch everything worked I travel the world on business a fair bit as well as holidays this is one of the quietest and most comfortable rooms I have stayed in the last 40years excellent 
137890,South Place Hotel, No complaints whatsoever , Very comfortable and spacious rooms and the bathroom had a great powerful shower The location is ideal if you re working anywhere near Liverpool Street Moorgate The overall feel of the hotel is more boutique but you have the service levels and facilities of a larger hotel There is also a great restaurant and rooftop bar The staff were very helpful and I found their room service and same day laundry service very useful There is also the option to have a hairdresser come to the hotel if you have a special occasion although I would recommend booking this in advance of your trip if possible Free newspapers were also supplied on request including the FT I will definitely be staying at this hotel again next time I am in London for me it is the perfect sized hotel with all the home away from home comforts that you need 
137891,South Place Hotel, The blind in our room didn t work so we were woken at about 4 30am when the sun started rising, Location was good bed was comfy bottled water provided Liked the huge shower

137894,South Place Hotel, No Iron and ironing board in the room, The beds were very comfortable and the window shutters to keep out the light was a bonus toiletries were good in the bathroom breakfast is waitress service so no queuing at the buffet in the morning breakfast choice was good and tasted excellent would definitely stay there again 
137895,South Place Hotel, We were not offered our complementary glass of elderflower fizz when we dined in the chop house restaurant felt it should have been offered instead of us having to ask , The staff were all very friendly room modern bed very comfortable and the breakfast was excellent 
137896,South Place Hotel, Location is not the best for tourism Weirdly the toilet was too high I am 5 5 and my toes just touch the ground the sliding door to the bathroom is very heavy and hard to open and close and although the sink tub shower hardware is beautiful it is difficult to use if hands are wet or have lotion on and lastly the tub is so big you cannot lay back and relax without sliding down under the water unless you are a good 6 tall , Loved the staff atmosphere and rooms were very well suited Lots of little extras and turndown service every night Great lounge and rooftop lounge Overall if it were not for the location I would definitely stay again Good value for the 
137897,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Staff was extremely nice and welcoming Great atmosphere in lounge area Beautiful restaurant wellness area and rooftop bar Rooms were very stylish and comfortable 
137898,South Place Hotel, Everything was great , The hotel was fabulous Great location Very helpful staff was treated very well from the moment I arrived special thanks to Nasir Room on high floor quiet Very comfy bed too Would definitely stay here again when in London 
137899,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel very slick and modern beautifully finished and very well equipped rooms Staff are very attentive and well informed about surrounding area Ideally located and well priced for such a central location 
137900,South Place Hotel, It is in the business area of London so not necessarily best placed for weekend guests , The facilities were great and excellent service from the staff 
137901,South Place Hotel, If you want to sleep peacefully forget about that place They play music all night long very loudly with stupidly loud bass which resonates in the room Could not sleep all night and it lasted until beyond 1am when we had to wake up early the next day It s more of a night club You also have all the drunk guests from the bar who go outside to smoke and they yell when they talk and wake you up There is also a pub just opposite the hotel which compounds the nuisance The hotel staff in particular at the reception ate just arrogant almost rude, The hotel rooms are quite nice and modern
137902,South Place Hotel, Many of the local shops pubs and restaurants seem to be closed over the weekend limiting the choices somewhat Having said that we had a very nice meal in the hotel s own restaurant , The staff were very accommodating allowing me to stay as soon as I arrived at about midday Since I had come off an overnight flight this allowed me to grab a couple of hours extra sleep which was much appreciated 
137903,South Place Hotel, Upon booking this trip I informed them it would be for my girlfriends birthday they agreed to provide some welcome drinks which was very kind However we never received them I also asked for a room with a nice view they said they would accommodate for that also again we didn t receive that We were given a room with no bath and a disabled shower and toilet The room was poorly decorated and very gloomy The breakfast which I paid an extra 50 for was average at best the English muffins were stale and the full English breakfast was mostly stringy fatty pieces of bacon with no other real variety of extras Also the 50 gives you a 30 spend per person which we fell 6 under as our bill came to 54 The hotel then tried to charge us 14 for going over our allowance which wasn t possible Also before informing you how breakfast works they pour you a glass of 4 50 freshly squeezed out a bottle orange juice All in all this was a horrendous stay and I wouldn t recommend this hotel , I wasn t impressed whatsoever the value for money was appalling and I couldn t take any positives away from this hotel 
137904,South Place Hotel, Nothing , Breakfast was very tasty Extra touches to the room towels changed on a regular basis complimentary drinks and cake yum Staff were very attentive and so friendly without going overboard 
137905,South Place Hotel, The pillows were absolutely horrific Soft scrunched up easily warmed up However if my only complaint is pillows you know it s a good stay My only other gripe is that if you are not familiar with London this is halfway around the circle line from the famous central London but the local area is well worth exploring Take a side street and end up in a beautiful new part of the city , The Room Spacious beautifully decorated with modern features 4 touch panels to control lighting including mood lighting one touch button blackout blinds very large bed we chose the kingsize room Television had enough channels to keep you from boredom a few more may have been nice We had an enjoyable time searching the rooms many nooks and crannies for oddities extras Special Mention Bathroom Oh My God If you are a couple looking for a romantic weekend break this bathroom is perfect for you Enormous bath more than spacious enough for two excellent decor and large amounts of bubbles shampoo etc inclusive The service Eagerly waited on hand foot absolutely no complaints about the service 
137906,South Place Hotel, Someone thought it was a good idea to wash the windows at 5am Because inwas jetlagged I was awake to hear it all may not have awakened me otherwise though , Great vibe here Funky deco friendly and relaxed international staff fabulous food especially at The Angler restaurant 
137907,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Every detail was covered I was amazed to see a fresh lime and lemon for the mini bar crystal a toaster fabulous beds and small health club They even have a Michelin starred restaurant Unfortunately it was booked but I ll go next time The concierges were so very excellent especially Nadar He looked after me as I imagine a fine English butler would 
137908,South Place Hotel, Thieves I paid in advance via Paypal On arrival I advised I had already paid They requested my creditcard in case I used room service The thieves debited the room rate again ,No Positive
137909,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Very friendly efficient relaxed staff Excellent steam room sauna and gym just what I needed to kick back And a good choice of gins although I didn t have the stamina to do them justice 
137910,South Place Hotel, Only had one of each 4 coffee flavour a bit mean when two sharing a room with same coffee taste The lightning panel in room not clear know they had pictures on but if short long sighted they were still not clear The sliding door to the bathroom area was very stiff and with nails not easy to open once got closed something to grasp would be better The controls for the shower to put shower on you had to go under the large rose so either got a very cold start or burnt if too hot depending how the previous occupant left it controls could be put on the opposite side to the rose Limited menu in the anglers restaurant know it is fish based but I am allergic to most fish partner loves it so he d have fish and I d have steak No so had to go down to the very loud dining area on ground floor noise from the bar , Bed was very comfortable the pillows and duvet absolutely first class The meals although a bit pricey were of excellent standard The helpfulness of the staff great 
137911,South Place Hotel, the location of my room facing another building bit this is probably because I requested a quiet room, Staff are very friendly and helpful make you feel genuinely welcome 
137912,South Place Hotel,No Negative, We stayed for our silver wedding anniversary The staff could not have been more helpful friendly they spoiled us rotten We found a specially decorated plate bearing cake in our room at tea time then a beautiful heart made of rose petals on our bed at the end of the day These touches made us feel really special thank you for your care 
137913,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Fab location lovely decor friendly staff very welcoming great room and extras e g lovely toiletries etc will definately stay here again Only 3 tube stops from St Pancras 
137914,South Place Hotel, Nothing It was very good, Location was excellent for my needs The staff were amazing and really friendly Especially the reception desk and the head waiter in the Chop Restaurant
137915,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Me and my partner loved Everything I m already planning my next booking Fantastic hotel and enthusiastic staff who are always on hand to help Our only issue was the heating being too hot technical fault and us being moved rooms The staff went out of their way to compensate for it and ensured our stay was perfect Disregarding the issue that could not have been helped we would still rate our stay as 11 10 I look forward to staying again Thanks
137916,South Place Hotel, To be honest we liked everything about the hotel The only thing that my husband would have liked is some baked beans with his breakfast, The hotel was really comfortable friendly modern and staff really professional we went for a family celebration and it suited all of us
137917,South Place Hotel, We arrived too early to check in and Left our two items of luggage with them Sadly only one case made it to the bedroom So then the usual hassle ensued panic calling down identifying and then retrieve Could only sit at bar for drinks as entire seated area reserved for private parties , The hotel bedroom was beautifully appointed Sophisticated hotel design Extremely friendly Sardinian barman 
137918,South Place Hotel, The noise from below if you opened the window, We were going to a party in the city and this was two minutes walk so very handy The comfort warmth of the room was my highlight
137919,South Place Hotel,No Negative, The bedding was very soft and luxurious I looked it up online to buy in the US and it was 1000 The bar and restaurant were also busy every day and were obvious hot spots not like a typical business in a hotel 
137920,South Place Hotel, I wish I had booked more days , Rooms are big and beautifully decorated top notch technology You will find everything you need in the room from popcorn to a fully sized bottle of vodka and gin an ice bucket cutting table with a lime and a lemon condoms all sorts of drinks from wine to beer to soft drinks glasses to enjoy your drinks an amazing entertainment system minibar with everything etc Impossible not to enjoy the extremely comfy bed and the balanced deco of the room The bathtub fits two people extremely inviting for a relaxing bubble bath Dim the lights and just enjoy In the premises you have two restaurants one is Michelin starred and two bars a games club with books pool table board games comfy chairs sofas and a bar Breakfast in the room a little expensive but high quality products definitely worth it They deliver at the exact time you want Staff can t do enough to please you my wife had a birthday and we were offered a dessert cake very good one with a happy birthday message and a bottle of champagne together with a card signed by all the members of the staff that evening Location is perfect walking distance to Liverpool Street station There is so much to say about this hotel it is simply amazing and we will definitely go back 
137921,South Place Hotel, This is a hotel for technically advanced guests The lighting requires real competence We Managed to awake to flashing lights in the entryway on two mornings Then came back late In the evening to an unmade room because a no entry signal was on Despite the advanced electronics the refrigerator wasn t cold , Breakfast was perfect Good Scrambled eggs fab smoked salmon and excellent bread 
137922,South Place Hotel, The only thing I can think of was the lighting was complicated to work out , The room was beautiful The bed was huge and comfy The bath was big enough for 2 and the room service was first class The reception staff were friendly welcoming and helpful It was a fabulous experience 
137923,South Place Hotel, Nothing wrong at all, Very very comfortable lovely attention to detail in room great design features great bed beautiful bathroom with enormous bath 
137924,South Place Hotel, Unfortunately breakfast was underwhelming and really not up to par with the extremely high quality of the hotel otherwise , Absolutely amazing experience One of the nicest hotels I stayed at Very cool style helpful and friendly staff exceptional amenities etc 
137925,South Place Hotel, Loud music at a function on Sunday night went into the early hours and beat of the bass could be heard and felt throughout However the staff were excellent at responding and did try to resolve the matter , Staff were outstanding and care was excellent We will definitely look to stay again and recommend highly 
137926,South Place Hotel, Mildly disappointed in the breakfast Pancakes were too thick and not cooked through and crispy bacon is meant to be crispy , The decor the atmosphere the attention to detail and the friendliness of the staff 
137927,South Place Hotel, I had a special deal and had a room that was adapted for people with a disability still very elegant and stylish very spacious walk in shower no bath Ok but would like to have known , modern elegant understated d cor high quality electronics very large bed spacious room quiet area at the weekend
137928,South Place Hotel, Taps difficult too turn on in bathroom but this is a minor detail, Staff were extremely helpful and attentive Lovely food of high standard Alot of thought has gone into the design and comfort of the hotel
137929,South Place Hotel, We stayed South Place Hotel 2 years ago and everything was really excellent This year especially in the restaurant the food and service did not always keep up with average service of the hotel two hamburgers ordered as medium well turned up beyond well done Another incident another day we ordered an icescream scoop instead of clotted cream but got the clotted cream When we told the waiter he immediately apologized took the plate came with what we assumed was a new plate with icecream The problem was they never changed the plate just put the icecream on top of the clotted cream That is not good service , It is a very nice hotel the first time we went there we loved it and had never stayed at a hotel where everyone was so serviceminded Tjis time two years later it is still good but not as good 
137930,South Place Hotel, We had to leave , We stayed at the hotel for two nights as it was our wedding weekend and the experience was out of this world We cannot put into words how professional but friendly all of the Hotel staff were and how this made our celebrations so much more special Thank you thank you thank you soooo much x
137931,South Place Hotel, I paid more for the rooms than I have ever paid before and to be honest they were the cheap seats Both rooms were noisy chairs being moved on the floor above and there were niggling little maintenance issues that should have been dealt with I would not book rooms on the 6th floor again , I love the friendliness of the staff and the smell of the hotel as you walk through the door
137932,South Place Hotel, Breakfast was not that good in selection, Location of hotel is very good Staff were excellent however breakfast was not to the mark for such a good hotel
137933,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Arrived two hours before book in time but still got checked in to an upgraded room A drinks was offered on arrival and we were taken to our room and shown all of the touchpad lights and automatic blind etc It was my wife s birthday and as we were unpacking a member of staff knocked and bought in a plate with a chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday piped on the plate along with a card from the front desk staff It was a great W End and the staff were fantastic and went above and beyond to make it very special especially the concierge Andre Thank you It s a fantastic location 2 minutes walk from Liverpool Street and only a 15 minute walk from the trendy Shordich area Will definitely go back Dave Miriam
137934,South Place Hotel, The hotel would have scored top marks but for the fact that I had to try ringing room service 6 times before my call was answered Usually the service especially that provided by the room service team is amazing and efficient so I will assume that I just picked a bad moment half an hour in which to try and place an order and that this was a one off I have already booked to stay again in a few weeks , I regularly stay at the South Place its probably my favourite hotel in London I love the style of the room and shared spaces the exceptional service provided by staff and the impeccable levels of cleanliness and comfort A real gem at a competitive price 
137935,South Place Hotel, Lighting was poor Too complex to operate and geared for romance not putting on your makeup or reading Design trumped ease of operation from lighting to taps and door drawer handles The bar and restaurant were super noisy Even the lift imposed music from speakers in the ceiling , Bed was lovely and room was well equipped 
137936,South Place Hotel, I genuinely cannot think of anything , Wow this hotel is really fab However it was the staff who really stood out for us and in particular the concierge Dominic He was so efficient and pleasant and nothing was too much for him to sort We had a number of requests and he literally had everything organised within 1 hour So impressed with him 
137937,South Place Hotel, There was a bit of noise from the bar on the Friday evening however it did not last late into the evening as I d originally feared Quite ex down by around 9 Lightening in the ground floor hallway from reception to the lifts and restaurant was a bit dingy Would have preferred it to be lighter so more easy to see where I was going , Staff were extremely attentive and provided excellent service even going as far as to escorprt me out to my taxi with an umbrella when it was raining Food in both restaurants was very good Angker exceptional as you d expect from a Michelin starred restaurant Loved the design of the room practicality blending with comfort and modern design Little pull out shelf that exactly fits a breakfast tray easy to work touch panels for lights and other room features Lobely amenities in the bathroom Free wifi close proximity to Liverpool Dt Station 
137938,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Excellent service all round Staff were extremely helpfull and very professional Loved the garden bar I was made a unique cocktail which was increadible We will be back 
137939,South Place Hotel, Nothing at all , Great location just between Liverpool St and Moorgate stations Staff were really helpful and friendly The rooms are so well designed they really have thoguht of every little detail Hotel is really well designed reminds me of a Miami South Beach boutique Also the beds have to be some of the comfiest I ve ever had 
137940,South Place Hotel, The only negative was that on the Saturday night there was a wedding reception in the hotel which went on until 1am at which the music was so incredibly loud you could hear every word and feel the pounding of the bass in our room 2 floors away When we phoned reception they said they would ask them to turn the music down but nothing changed , A real feeling of luxury extra large comfy bed a choice of pillows all the amenities you could want an excellent TV and media centre that you could connect Kindle Fire stick etc up to clever lighting and excellent black out blinds 
137941,South Place Hotel, As hotel guests it was a bit disappointing not being able to get a table at The Angler restaurant upstairs as it was fully booked , Great buzzy atmosphere We had the Wilson room very large comfortable bed amazing double shower and complimentary soft drinks from the minibar Would definitely visit again 
137942,South Place Hotel, Pillows were so thin Only during check out we ve learned that there were other pillow options we could ve asked from the room service , Great location clean and comfy room helpfull staff 
137943,South Place Hotel, We had some issue with communication between the hotel and booking com It made check in a longer process , Modern Hotel with air conditioning and spacious 
137944,South Place Hotel, Breakfast was pricey and the bar downstairs a little noisy , Very comfortable stylish hotel located in the heart of the financial district the square mile Bed was extremely comfortable and the room was stocked with all the necessities Very conveniently located a two minutes walk from London Liverpool street station
137945,South Place Hotel, We stayed over the weekend and on both nights the 1st floor outdoor bar and 7th floor restaurant were rented out for wedding thus limiting the range of facilities we were able to enjoy Noise levels were a pretty major annoyance Both nights we feel asleep to a thumping bass originating from the wedding parties taking place on the 7th floor we were on the 5th floor This went on past midnight Not to be a party pooper but given that this is a 5 star hotel surely some sort of limit on the volume of music curfew for playing loud music better soundproofing shouldn t be too much to ask for Inconsistent standards of service Some of the staff we encountered were completely gracious and delightful but others seemed a bit confused and poorly trained which unfortunately marred the experience for us Examples include a waiter who got curt with us at breakfast when we sent back our iced coffees the kitchen put sugar in them without us asking for it and a waiter in the Spies Society lounge who was inexplicably reluctant to take our orders and suggested we move down to the main bar instead what is the point of setting up a 1st floor lounge with drinks menus on the tables then Special mention goes to a woman ostensibly in some kind of events coordinator role who snapped at me in a snotty voice Excuse me this is a PRIVATE SPACE when I popped into the 1st floor outdoor bar to have a look The bar was empty at the time and it was not obvious that it had been reserved for a wedding In any event her manner was completely inappropriate and made me feel like an intruder when in fact I was a paying guest of the hotel , Great rooms bright good sized and well decorated Particularly loved the bathroom with its rainwater shower and large bath My partner and I were celebrating our 5th anniversary A complimentary slice of cake was waiting for us when we checked in which was a thoughtful touch Very well equipped minibar The 1st floor Spies Society lounge was a lovely place to relax 
137946,South Place Hotel, Only teeny tiny criticism I have is the pillows on the bed are very flat not much head support Overall bed was still very comfortable though , The staff and accommodations were wonderful Comfortable room amazing shower and shower products blackout shades quiet delicious breakfast downstairs yummy room service neat cocktail lounges scattered throughout the hotel Highly recommend for business or leisure Our stay was a mix of both 
137947,South Place Hotel, Zero issues , Fantastic reception staff bar and restaurant staff and concierge Free upgrade due to our 25th wedding anniversary lovely welcome surprise on arrival in room Superb comfy bed great bathroom exceptionally clean room fantastic service during our whole stay Chop House restaurant has great food and ambience Amazing cocktails We will return A big thank you to all the staff 
137948,South Place Hotel,No Negative, E V E R Y T H I N G no but seriously I have no words for how amazing this hotel actually is We were speechless when we walked into our room Got to the reception was given complimentary glass of champagne then got told our room was upgraded as it was our anniversary I don t know where to even begin with the room Let s just say it was perfection felt more like our own apartment so cosy so modern absolutely beautiful interior design We had two showers two sinks a massive bathtub a HUGE mirror in the bedroom We had lamps hanging down from the wall which look amazing also had led lights making the bed light up underneath Free movies to watch on the TV and also got complimentary soft drinks from the minibar Oh not to forget the most beautiful spa i have ever seen been in Highly recommend this hotel honestly cannot wait to go back I want to move in It was worth every single penny we paid to stay 
137949,South Place Hotel, Maid opened bedroom door just after 8am Too early even on a week day , Lovely modern rooms with luxurious touches like excellent toiletries very well designed bath and shower thoughtfully stocked mini bar and blackout blinds Extremely comfortable bed Pleasant staff 
137950,South Place Hotel, The lobby is quite small and the carpet in the room was not clean as expected , The minimal interior decoration and the eames chairs are fancy in deed Can t still believe that there are 5 bars restaurants in that building 
137951,South Place Hotel, Leaving could have stayed for every, Everything absolutely everything was superb From the welcome and check in to the service and food in the restaurant 
137952,South Place Hotel, Small drawback pillows were very soft little filling and no extras in wardrobe , Large clean room Nice extras with soft drinks included from mini bar in our room rate Modern hotel clean and fresh throughout 
137953,South Place Hotel, Breakfast options are limited to a la carte choice nothing bad food was very good just somewhat weird , Staff was extremely polite and helpful room while not too spacious was very comfortable and well equipped Moorgate tube is just around the corner and 10 minutes walk get you to Bank station as well 
137954,South Place Hotel, Excellent Hotel and I would stay here again without a doubt however if you are wanting to be in the heart of the tourist sights it s situated more in the financial district but all of London is easily accessible by Tube Taxi or Bus it is walkable if you are a keen walker , Fantastic rooms I would definitely recommend a stay here beautifully furnished and very comfortable The Angler restaurant on the roof is a must 
137955,South Place Hotel, My room wasn t serviced during my stay although my son and his partners room was , I love the friendliness of all the staff and the modern interior of the hotel 
137956,South Place Hotel, nothing to fault , there was a problem with our booking that could have spoiled our stay but the staff and management dealt with everything extremely well full marks nicely appointed modern rooms good food decent gym buzzing atmosphere around the place also liked the electric blinds in the room that were very effective in cutting out light allowing for a long lie in 
137957,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Modern comfortable and welcoming Great location well appointed room thank you for the upgrade and hospitable service Will definitely return and recommend this hotel 
137958,South Place Hotel, Bar food bad value for money Small portions Don t mind paying high price if good , Never stayed in much a modern hotel and it lived up to all expectations Great mod cons in bedroom took a while to learn to work Sure younger people would find it easy Good place for London Museum was very interesting 
137959,South Place Hotel, If you want to go out and have some evening entertainment you need to know where to go nearby it s not a location where you step outside and see life Luckily the staff were helpful here and could point us in the right direction, Tons of character incredible friendly staff and slick relaxing rooms We went for our anniversary and they really went the extra mile for us in a lot of ways 
137960,South Place Hotel, Parking in the neighbourhood rather expensive 49 day , The staff in this beautiful luxurious but lively hotel was top Nice restaurant and bar Room perfect nice bathroom double shower and bath products 
137961,South Place Hotel, Non alcoholic complementary arrival drink Lots of events on at the weekends in the various bars garden which meant we arrived on a sat eve to a bit of a busy party atmosphere not relaxing This was ok though once we had refreshed ourselves and were able to join in Our room was the floor above the bar but we could hear little noise , Very comfy bed Good decor Helpful staff Good room service 
137962,South Place Hotel, The staff at the rooftop bar were unbelievably slow considering there were a lot of them However an apology and free drink were offered The bed linen is a material that is quite noisy every time you move , Staff were exceptional beds were comfortable immaculately clean lovely decor free soft drinks from mini bar blackout shutters Very quiet Rooftop bar
137963,South Place Hotel, Used soap unpacked and shampoo was only filled half of the bottle Felt like someone used my room before I check in or they didn t clean it well,No Positive
137964,South Place Hotel, Indifferent service in terrace bar and very poor food offering , Very friendly and helpful reception staff Contemporary comfortable room and bathroom Very good restaurant
137965,South Place Hotel, The residents only bars were not open either evening on our return one evening we arrived back earlier at the hotel specifically to visit the garden bar Some information regarding opening times would have been useful Only one of our rooms was ready on arrival we had requested early check in so were informed that the keys for the second room would be brought to us this did not happen and as we had a full itinerary on a tight schedule this resulted in part of our group checking in after 11pm not great customer service , A cold drink on arrival after travelling was most welcome also the tour of the hotel facilities was a nice touch Wonderful bathrooms with large bath and excellent shower 
137966,South Place Hotel, Needed to be a mountaineer to get into and out of the bath , bright bedrooms with interesting artwork comfortable clean fast broadband lively bar bistro Service orientated staff Close to virtually everything but still quiet enough on a Sunday morning to open the window and let the fresh air in 
137967,South Place Hotel, Wasn t anything I didn t like my only comment would have been the breakfast in the room service was quite expensive 5 for a orange juice is a bit of a push, Room was very nice great extras in the room very nice bathroom some really good touches in the room automatic black out blinds earplugs just encase even though the room was very quiet Pleasant and helpful staff all and in all very nice indeed Great location for visiting the Barbican Good restaurants close by 
137968,South Place Hotel, On this particular stay we were unfortunate to be disturbed by very noisy maintenance work on a Sunday I would suggest you check this has been completed before you book It was also a shame that the Angler restaurant was booked for a private event as this is a superb venue to dine in Nevertheless I would return without hesitation , My husband and I have stayed at South Place Hotel many times The staff are superb the facilities are beautiful modern and comfortable the beds are divine the amenities in the bathroom and mini bar are to a very high standard it is really difficult to fault this hotel and it should be noted that I am extremely picky 
137969,South Place Hotel, I had difficulty in getting the shade lowered before I went to bed It kept starting and stopping and I had to keep repressing the button It took 10 15 mins to get my room dark enough to sleep It was late and I didn t really feel like reporting it I had to change rooms because my initial room was opposite a noisy building site I had asked specifically for a quiet room so was a little irritated that I had to immediately ask to be moved , The staff were friendly and did everything efficiently and without fuss I was impressed with the bed it was not too hard and I had a good night s sleep with both hard and soft pillows to choose from I had asked for peppermint tea which had been provided The walk In shower had plenty of room and the water was hot and powerful The TV was a good size and made watching from the bed easy and comfortable The change of room was done efficiently and without fuss I waited a couple of hours in the original room but that was not too inconvenient 
137970,South Place Hotel, Nothing , This is a great hotel The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful I had a problem with my to which was all sorted within about 20 mins of calling reception The staff really can t do enough for you 
137971,South Place Hotel, I couldn t find a hairdryer Probably could have asked for one but thought there may have been one automatically , Lovely room blackout blind great and lighting in the room was good Night lighting was brilliant Free in house movies a nice touch 
137972,South Place Hotel, Service in the open air bar on the 1st floor was very very slow on the Saturday night and certainly not up to the hotel s usual standards , I loved the free room upgrade and the handwritten welcome note from the manager is always a nice touch The room the food and the staff are always amazing 
137973,South Place Hotel, It s a high end hotel and quality costs fair enough But the minibar prices O seriously I really wanted a chocolate bar but since it was friday evening I couldn t contact my bank and ask for a second mortgage , Upon arrival the room wasn t ready The receptionist whom used well chosen words together with a complimentary Caf au lait created a very beautiful and professional distraction Thumbs up Overall very nice interior in the lobby room restaurant professional staff 
137974,South Place Hotel, one of the towels wasn t very clean and had some stain on it , Staff were very helpful and friendly Location was pretty good too Nice interior and design
137975,South Place Hotel, Breakfast could have been better for the cost The knives in 3 South Place were form over function Couldn t cut but did give us a giggle , The quality of the room and the attentiveness of the staff were second to none So many thoughtful touches in the very comfortable room The staff made our stay 
137976,South Place Hotel, The stereo system didn t work as supposed to Bluetooth didn t connect but am just being picky, Nice feel to the hotel great location and good minibar
137977,South Place Hotel,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay for one night wish we could have stayed longer Everything was perfect from the room to the food We will definitely return in the future 
137978,South Place Hotel, I wasn t blown away by the in room dinner and breakfast would have liked a bit more for the price of the food , Overall experience was amazing from the incredibly warm welcome upon arrival to the surprise birthday cake in the room Staff were so friendly and the facilities at the hotel were great I used both the gym and the steam room Really strong wifi which is rare for a hotel Room was so comfortable and the black out blinds meant I got a good sleep 
137979,South Place Hotel,No Negative, A stunning oasis of boutique luxury in the heart of London Comfort beyond expectation style and calmness in equal measure From the relaxing tranquil surroundings of the garden lounge bar with waterfall backdrop to the rooftop restaurant and terrace with its stunning birds eye views of the Capitall South Place has been meticulously designed to create the most amazing environment for you to enjoy Having stayed in many of the finest hotels around the world we can honestly say that the quality and level of service that you will receive is exemplary Finest food wine and cocktails chic unique spaces in every direction We believe this combination of luxury and affordable prices is unbeatable 
137980,South Place Hotel, No milk for tea in tray and although they asked if I wanted a free paper in the morning one didn t turn up, Escorted us to room and explained room safe location etc very helpful staff
137981,South Place Hotel, Nothing, It was fantastic Great place to stay Very classy and upscale I would stay here again no questions asked The staff was exceedingly friendly and made us feel right at home during our stay 
137982,South Place Hotel, The stay would have been perfect if it wasn t for a misunderstanding regarding the snacks in the studio I was told upon arrival that they were complementary but was asked to pay for them after I left At the end the fee was waived This type of issue can negate the positive experience intended from the room upgrade , 2nd stay at South Place hotel I was upgraded to the studio which is bigger than the standard room The hotel is top notch from the professionalism of the staff to modernness of the design and decor the food is good
137983,South Place Hotel, A couple of the staff were rather condecending , Overall very friendly staff Special touch once they found out it was our anniversary Facilities were fantastic 
137984,South Place Hotel, Pillow menu could have been more obviusly available as the pillows provided inthe room were very soft, Fabulous great location wonderful rooms with a superb bathroom 
137985,South Place Hotel, Bar staff very rude and tell lies to manager when they do not want to serve you anymore Night manager did not care or believe what we were telling him and would rather the paying guest leave hotel in the middle of the night rather than try and sort out the situation Have stayed here many times but will never return shame on you South Place should have stayed at the Andaz, Rooms are nice
137986,South Place Hotel, Had potential to be amazing but very poor communication systems within the hotel led to a catalogue of small errors which together spoiled our very special weekend, Location and buzz
137987,South Place Hotel, Nothing, Excellent location very helpful and friendly staff rooms were amazing and staff went the extra mile to make it special for us Had a lovely stay 
137988,South Place Hotel, , I arrived way too early for checkin and just wanted to drop off my bag The friendly receptionist provided me with a room within seconds at no extra cost Gym and Sauna are open 24 7 and very modern as the rest of the hotel too Proper building quality and windows not comparable with the typical squeezed and dirty rooms in most established Hotels in London Great stay thanks a lot 
137989,South Place Hotel, hopefully the construction work outside will be completed very soon otherwise everything and everyone is just perfect in south place hotel , My 2nd time staying in this hotel there was massive construction work going on and it was already very very noisy from early morning until late afternoon for the first 3 nights my mom and i didn t have a good rest and sleep due to this but the hotel staff were endeavour to arrange another quiet room for the rest of our stays just because of this i will definitely be coming back although i know the construction is going to last long besides very good shower which i think is very important to my mom and i thanks to housekeeping and every single staff working in the hotel and very delicious brownies and macarons upon check in and out from the hotel manager thanks very much 
137990,South Place Hotel, More information about the facilities and entertainments in the hotel will be useful I got a very good price approx 220 GBP a day so it was a good value for money Still sometimes the price is 350 which is not a great deal The operation of the TV could be a pain sometimes the response time is poor , The hotel has a great location in the City wich was very convenient for me not perferct for sightseeing really The room is spotless not a single complain about it The staff is very firendly and reacts immediately on any request The Angler restaurant is really amazing definitely worth visiting 
137991,South Place Hotel, too crowded at night they have a good bar but too many party people come after working hours, very good location right at the money and lawyers distric not many shoping outlets but good for my buisness trip
137992,South Place Hotel, This room was a bit dark we usually have an outside room with a bigger window Minibar not getting cold enough , Great hotel lovely staff good location 
137993,South Place Hotel,No Negative, The staff were super friendly on check in and thier helpfulness really endless They found out ot was my brithday and they literally went outof thier way to make sure that I had the most awesome stay ever I really felt like a VIP and they were so patient with my endless barrage of questions and the requests If I really had to say a bad thing it was that I had to wake up the next morning to check out The staff though as they knew I was having an event the night before really pushed the limits for me to let me stay as long as possible to gather my things and the young gentleman who had to trolly up and down with out 1000 bags and boxes thank you so much The reception made me laugh the whole way through and I even got special treatment from thier front of house management Kavita who made sure I understood that her team was the best they are they truely are I m ex hotmel management by the way so trust me I was super duper impressed Keep up the good work I m sending everyone to you 
137994,South Place Hotel,No Negative, Perfect location right in the City of London 2 minute walk to the nearest tube station Moorgate and just down the road from London Liverpool Street Station Staff are wonderful Room was beyond perfect loved the big bathtub Everything abour our stay here was exceptional Would definately stay here again

137996,South Place Hotel, Air conditioning in the gym was quite warm , overall the service was top notch It was the little touches such as fruit delivered on arrival A dessert delivered to the room on the last night of our stay In addition the staff allowed for early check in 
137997,South Place Hotel, Minor issue The restaurant is a popular place for power breakfast so it is extremely busy with locals lots of interviews and business meetings happening around you not the best way to start the day from a hotel guests perspective Minor issue 2 boy that B O TV they have in the rooms is over the top and ridiculous So much money wasted on a TV that can t do the most basic things easily e g change channels What a technological disaster I gave up and didn t watch TV for the 5 days I stayed there , Service Staff is very professional well groomed and attentive The front desk manager promptly clarified questions I had about my bill in email explaining to me the breakdown of charges I came out ahead Kudos to her Location Right near the tube and a 2 minute walk away from tons of restaurants I don t know all the areas of London well but sure seemed like a convenient location Restaurant Food was excellent Just one or two minor service hiccups forgot to bring my coffee and awkwardness dealing with payment but for the most part the quality was outstanding 
137998,South Place Hotel, Loved Everything , It was my husband s birthday and with no prompting we were given a free room upgrade and a card and chocolates were delivered to our room The staff were great 
137999,South Place Hotel, TV didn t work well seemed dated in comparison to everything else that I saw , Excellent luxury hotel with broad range of facilities Large comfortable room with a great bed 
138000,South Place Hotel, We had one of the inner rooms on the 2nd floor I had asked for a quiet room Unfortunately the music from a party and from the bar was so noisy that we could not get to sleep Breakfast menu seemed a bit dated A wider range buffet style with more fresh fruit and veg would have made a big difference as opposed to the tired uninspiring English breakfast choices A more sumptuous breakfast would have justified the prices and upped the hotel to another category , Staff were really helpful when we needed to change room due to noise from parties in hotel one of the breakfast orders was wrong but was rectified quickly and without any fuss Up to date tech facilities Wonderful bathroom facilities 
138001,South Place Hotel, Breakfast service was a bit hit and miss one waiter responsible for that brought wrong breakfast even after taking our order when we asked for extra toast for two people he brought ONE slice A bit surly and unapologetic I d choose to have it in my room next time , Loved the east end location and proximity to spitalfields Room pristine and hotel gave a lovely dessert treat to my husband as it was his birthday Booked in at Thd Angler fabulous also The Hugo Boss store nearby is exceptional with first rate service 
138002,South Place Hotel, Very slightly disorganised check in I don t usually stay at the weekend but they could have done with more people on the desk , I ve stayed many times it s always very good The rooms look great and products are very nice The hotel has excellent places to eat and drink

138006,South Place Hotel, Mainly the service, The hotel was great Good atmosphere and facilities However we waited 40 minutes to be served cocktails at the bar When they did arrive they were wrong We then got woken by a maid at 9am knocking on the door This was a saturday morning Great hotel let down by a few simple things

138010,South Place Hotel, 100 taken from my card just in case the room got damaged Four days later the credit has not appeared back in my account Most hotels just take an imprint not funds , Staff were very attentive Real attention to detail in the room A lemon and lime in the mini bar is great idea Lighting in room was state of the art Really comfortable bed 
138011,South Place Hotel, We had to wait for house keeping outside the room for over half an hour which was unfortunate The room wasn t as impressive as I was expecting considering the rate per night and therefore not entirely full value for money as there are other equivalent hotels in City that are cheaper options to similar standard Also I was slapped on the head from a drunken guest at the ground floor bar and I asked the staff to maybe not serve him drinks and to escort him out Not only did they let him finish his drink he also had time to harass to other young ladies before they asked him to leave which I thought was bad , Great service from front desk and reception staff Quick response to getting iron and iron board ice to the room etc Food and breakfast was excellent Overall a good experience 
138012,South Place Hotel, Our view wasn t great but that s the area more than the hotel , This place is really funky and stylish There s cool art everywhere and the decor in general is very modern The staff are very helpful and more importantly it seems to have enough staff that you are never waiting for ages for service
