163825,Nottingham Place Hotel, The bathroom was very small and uncomfortable The wood floor looked as unfinished job and had paint stains, The location of the hotel is perfect Close to Malyborne high street many options of bars restaurants and 10 minutes walking distance from Oxford Street We had the Duplex room We had nice city view The reception was in another building which on one hand makes you feel like home similar to apartment building but less comfortable when you need to go there 
163826,Nottingham Place Hotel, Not very fond of some elements in the room i e glass sliding doors for shower and toilet but that was in line with the overall design of the room , Excellent location if you want to be a street away from Marylebone High Street and just a few minutes away from Baker Street Oxford Str etc Small room in line with central London accommodation but still comfortable smart and compact layout Having said that it did say it in the description i e minimalistic design but for a short stay I did not mind since the room was overall very clean The room did not have a view but it was very quiet Very friendly stuff 
163827,Nottingham Place Hotel, Duplex has quirky layout Tried to be a high end boutique hotel but didn t quite work Example bathroom very nice but sink so tight to the wall that when I brushed my teeth I almost banged my head on the mirror when I went to rinse Kitchen tap is set so low and sink so small it s hard to get a cup or glass under there to fill with water Also plumbing problems with room above resulted in water coming in through our roof for 2 of 3 days when their shower was in use Staff gave us a reduced rate for the inconvenience so satisfactory outcome , Comfy bed Large area 
163828,Nottingham Place Hotel, A bed with a headboard Breakfast included , The room was small but nice and the bed was comfy and it wasn t too far from the tube which made transport really easy The staff were very friendly welcoming and helpful 
163829,Nottingham Place Hotel, Felt quite small and I couldn t get my pram through the door without removing a wheel so not great for babies and toddlers , Location was great Staff were very helpful and friendly 
163830,Nottingham Place Hotel, I didn t mind it but others may have not liked or could have physically struggled with the stepped arrangement of the room especially having to step down into the bath shower , really nicely designed unusual classy modern comfortable staff were great 
163831,Nottingham Place Hotel, Read the small print normally when you book a hotel there are certain facilities This isn t really a hotel as we know it There is no bar no restaurant etc If you want breakfast its delivered to your room as there is nowhere to eat We arrived at the hotel and after checking in we were brought back to the front door and the girl pointed down the street and said your room is in that building Not my usual hotel experience If you are into caravans then you would recognise the space saving features that the room entails We really did not like the toilet that had a sliding glass door in such a small room As we could not just run back down to a reception on leaving the hotel we called to the main hotel and asked reception if they had given us the best room they could have It got really awkward as the receptionist got quite defensive She went and got the manager and he was the same challenging us Both the receptionist and manager became quite rude I would not visit again or recommend this hotel ,No Positive
163832,Nottingham Place Hotel, Leak from bathroom in room above woke us at midnight but leak though heavy was confined to the bathroom so not a disaster , Beautiful studio apartment feel Space to work and sleep airy and light Designer feel Lovely bedding and very comfortable sleep Staff were great and were able to let ud check in a little early I had just had surgery nearby 
163833,Nottingham Place Hotel, We were very pleased with the hotel potential visitors should know that it is a small establishment with only a few rooms not your typical large hotel While the price wasn t cheap it was good value , The Nottingham Place Hotel was ideal for our 2 day trip to London The room was large recently renovated quiet and very comfortable The location was very convenient for sight seeing transport 
163834,Nottingham Place Hotel, Only one mirror in the room which was in the bathroom girlfriend found iit difficult to straighten her hair Romm 114 Overall very nice place to stay with friendly staff,No Positive
163835,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Staff were very helpful and friendly The rooms were lovely and spacious and the location was brilliant with lots of nice restaurants and bars near by 
163836,Nottingham Place Hotel, The lack of opening windows made us a little claustrophobic , Location great and the staff were very friendly and efficient The room was very modern with all the facilities required for an overnight stop
163837,Nottingham Place Hotel, We ve made a reservation for a room with patio and a fire place in the picture but we ve got a normal one without patio and without fire place I think it is not normal to say you sell something and give something else in return , Everything was perfect The staff very very kind hotel with nice design room clean and beautiful Is very near to Baker Station a lot of restaurants next street We walked everywhere and it was a pleasure 
163838,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room was very small and one of the windows didn t have curtains so it was hard to sleep with such a bright room in the morning , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful room was lovely with great amenities and there was no city noise as is common in London city hotels The hotel was also in a great location a 2 minute walk from Baker st station and 10 minute walk to Oxford st We d definitely stay again 
163839,Nottingham Place Hotel, We were given a studio room It was stark and small Could hardly walk round the bed it was so small No bed head so pillows kept falling off It was like sleeping in a cupboard I wouldn t book this again, The location
163840,Nottingham Place Hotel, Funny bed set up facing the wall Could do with something to brighten up the bare natural walls which is throughout the building and bedrooms hippy chic it a little Wifi was a bit weak , Very clean and comfortable room Bed was super comfortable I had a duplex room across the road from the reception The bed is weirdly positioned immediately facing the wall with the wall being the foot of the bed but it was deceptively long I m 2M tall Good space with a downstairs lounge area with a sofa bed 
163841,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, The location is great and easy to reach by Underground stop Baker Street The neighborhood is lovely the hotel is surrounded by beautiful houses and a lot of nice places to eat from breakfast to dinner Oxford Street is a 10 15 minute walk along pretty shops bookstores and restaurants The staff is super friendly and very helpful Maybe because it isn t a very big hotel it all feels very amicable Our room was across the street from the reception so it felt as if we had our own apartment in the city The room was small but big enough for the time we spent inside It all felt very new no dusty old stuff but pretty glass doors a comfy bed a huge separate shower and blinds that let you sleep like a baby 
163842,Nottingham Place Hotel, nothing, quite nice very nice beautiful good 
163843,Nottingham Place Hotel, Breakfast cost is quite high , Staff very very nice available and really interested in exceed expectations of the clients I felt at home and I m sure I ll be back to this hotel 
163844,Nottingham Place Hotel, still a little small for the size as to a so called suite , room has a mini kitchen with microwave oven and fridge inside receptions are warm and friendly who would arrange staff to help fetch the luggage to the destination apartment due the the reception desk is a little far away from the room 
163845,Nottingham Place Hotel, The bathroom was tiny for a superior room to the extent that I wouldn t stay again due to it , Nicely decorated hotel and up to date modern appliances Good welcome and all round nice experience 
163846,Nottingham Place Hotel, A 4 00am fire alarm and the acceptance of reception that it was ok these things happen she said, Peaceful outside considering the location 
163847,Nottingham Place Hotel, Only one thing I can mention rooms got very hot at night but the duvets were very thick maybe supply thinner bedding or layers Air con didn t seem to have much effect , Staff were very helpful rooms were very clean great location 
163848,Nottingham Place Hotel, Just a tiny thing but maybe a piece of fruit with the breakfast would be a good idea , This is a small comfortable hotel with such friendly staff and beautiful decor There is no dining room so a continental breakfast is served to your room in a beautiful picnic basket There is complimentary tea and coffee in the reception lounge area as well as tea coffee making facilities in your room The toiletries in the ensuite bathroom were the beautiful Elemis range The hotel is a five minute walk to Baker Street station and is situated on a quiet elegant street of Victorian terraced houses
163849,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room was a bit smaller than expected from the photos but this was not a problem , The studio room was nice and comfortable The staff were all very friendly and helpful making the stay really pleasant 
163850,Nottingham Place Hotel, Blackout blind that didn t close fully the second night and got woken up at first light Sunken bath was a serious slip hazard because of poor positioning of doorway Clothes line so high it couldn t be reached Aircon didn t appear to work and room too hot opened windows but staff had shut when I got back Steps up to bed are a trip hazard during the night Toilet kitchenette all a bit too narrow and so easy to knock into walls when turning Paint chipped and it all looks very worn, Microwave and location bed was super comfy 
163851,Nottingham Place Hotel, This is not a hotel I repeat this is not a hotel I had to walk several houses down the road to get to the property It should be advertise as a guest house not a hotel So you would hardly keep walking back to get a tea or coffee I call this false advertisement Every time someone walk across the room above the noise was loud really frustrating this is not what I paid for , Nothing
163852,Nottingham Place Hotel, The position of the bed meant that it was so close to the window it was difficult for the second person to access , The location was excellent for our needs The staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast was delivered on time and was enjoyable 
163853,Nottingham Place Hotel, This hotel is one of those London hotels which has a second building which is where I stayed My building didn t have a lobby with free coffee cookies etc the other thing is that there are a lot of stairs involved in this hotel both getting to the room and inside my duplex It was very architecturally interesting but maybe not for older people While the room had ample rooms and facilities the feeling of the decor was a step below IKEA , This hotel is located a 5 minute walk from the Baker Street tube station and in a little cluster of hotels on the same block as the Princess Grace hospital For the money it is big It appears to be meant for a small family that might want to stay longer term because there was a microwave refrigerator dishes and utensils I stayed in a duplex so there was separation between a sitting area with a TV and the sleeping area upstairs which had another TV 
163854,Nottingham Place Hotel, One of the male receptionist maybe he is the manager was so rude to his coworker who was receptionist as well He was shouting at him calling him an idiot He should be well behaved infront of the customers Shoudn t he Soundproof will be good idea I couldnt sleep in the morning cause I could hear whatever happening in the hallway Breakfast is not included will be value of money if its included Wifi signal is not strong enough , Location Helpful staff 
163855,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so kind and friendly and helpful The room was larger very clean and stylish and the location is fabulous with great shops restaurants and bars on its door step 
163856,Nottingham Place Hotel, It s not really a problem but it is a caveat I had to point out This reservation has NO free breakfast The reviews and the hotel website can be misleading , The highlight of this place is the location which is awesome Close to everything The duplex was very good value for money You feel like you had two rooms for the price of one The staff was very friendly and hospitable They did all they can to help The room design is made to be more practical than luxurious Everything works very well but you won t feel like you are in a resort 
163857,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Room was fantastic bed was comfortable the staff were extremely helpful friendly knowledgeable Easy walking distance from marylebone station bakers street underground Madam taussauds is a 5 min walk 
163858,Nottingham Place Hotel, The heating wasn t warm enough and the hotel isn t soundproof enough We could hear the people in the room nextdoor taking their shower , Great location and confortable bed 
163859,Nottingham Place Hotel, Nothing that i can think of , Staff was amazingly friendly lovely hotel entrance was clean clear and looked lovely Love the small stairs to the rooms Old in size and look from outside and up to date inside 
163860,Nottingham Place Hotel, Bathroom good looking but uncomfortable getting into the bath tub is not a sport for everyone Rooms are considerably smaller than they appear in pictures, Staff was excellent Room design very original Situation excellent 
163861,Nottingham Place Hotel, The ad about parking on booking com was misleading It states that parking is available but there is no parking I had to use a public car park not close to the hotel at a very high daily rate One of the windows in the room had no curtain which meant that the walk from the bed to the bathroom was overlooked by a residential neighbour sitting on his balcony only a few yards away I think he got more of a view than he bargained for , Very clean and very helpful and friendly staff 
163862,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, staff were so lovely and understanding of a difficult situation with a friend in hospital they were so kind and accommodating and flexible in our requirements
163863,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Staff were friendly and very accommodating of our request to move to a room with better WiFi reception we were working remotely while in London even upgraded us for free to a larger room which was amazingly sunny spacious and tastefully decorated It really made our stay special Also we really enjoyed breakfast in the room the portions are healthy and plentiful Would definitely stay here again 
163864,Nottingham Place Hotel, At first I have booked a studio room however it was really nothing to breath inside and conditioner was broken I was told that all rooms are the same However I was offer to switch to another one which was a higher category and to pay extra 40 pounds per night I accepted it cause studio room is so uncomfortable and tiny My room was 112 and until 12 pm it is easy to hear what other people downstairs are talking about and the sound from bathroom from the closet room was pretty loud , nice small breakfast directly to your room some coffee juice pastries and yogurt good wi fi My room 112 was quite big especially for London awesome design and extremely friendly stuff Your team is gorgeous
163865,Nottingham Place Hotel, The male receptionist was extremely rude when we arrived and when we checked out even making a remark about the room we had complained about saying he thought it was to our style We didn t know what he was trying to get at by saying that to a young couple Wouldn t stay there again for this reason, The style of the second room we were placed in was very nice
163866,Nottingham Place Hotel, I would have liked a curtain on the window the room was a slightly irregular shape and the area around the door between the bathroom and the bed area had an uncurtained window which wasn t very private This was my only criticism , Comfy bed nicely decorated quality fittings helpful staff
163867,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Great welcoming staff always available and helpful Room was big enough and comfortable well heated and apparently also equipped with a c And location location location Various bus and tube lines very close by as well as Regent s Park and other London landmarks within walking distance 
163868,Nottingham Place Hotel, Our room was very very hot upon check in but we soon cooled it down using the aircon Our room was also very dusty in places especially on the side tables lamps also when we went to use the glasswear you could see the ring of dust left behind Also feel although offered coffee in the reception it would be much preffered to have the choice in the bedroom especially as this is classed as 4 star , Great location wonderful staff beautiful decor spacious warm great value Upon arrrival we were greated with a friendly face were seen to very proffesionally Our room was not ready as we arrived very early but our bags were securely looked after we were offered a delightful coffee in reception before going off to explore London The reception team were very helpful throughout our stay even supplied my friend with a phone charger as she had forgotten her own We were always offered a coffee whilst in reception too The decor was fabulous Could not fault the contempory style Great mini bar if you so required Our room was very large felt comfortable Bathroom was also spacious but a bit bland compared to the decor throughout rest of hotel Would love to stay again for longer next time 
163869,Nottingham Place Hotel, The tv could have been bigger and over 11 for breakfast seemed a little steep, The bed and pillows were soooo comfy Everything was clean and well presented we paid 270 for 2 nights for 2 people so the price wasn t bad at all 
163870,Nottingham Place Hotel, The air con was broke noisy and leaking, Was a great hotel the staff when we got there was so helpful and both of them went out of there way to help us with information for places to go and clubs to visit the only problem was the air con was playing up and making a lot of sound and leaking all through the night I did explain to the people working at the time but nothing was done so with the sound of it all a very poor nights sleep
163871,Nottingham Place Hotel, Nothing, Lovely bright and spacious room with very good bathroom toiletries Staff extremely helpful and would absolutely recommend this lovely hotel Also so central to everything Will be back for sure 
163872,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Had a wonderful stay in the duplex suite Very roomy and clean Staff were really friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble Hotel in a very nice area close to everything The continental breakfast was fantastic and plentiful and brought to our room Would definitely stay again 
163873,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Amazing concierge and staff faulous and convenient location in Marylebone beautifully decorated rooms My new favorite home away from home in London 
163874,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room could have done with a socket near the beds and mirror It would have been nice to have coffee and a few more milks on the tea tray , Generous sized room accommodating staff very clean and great location 
163875,Nottingham Place Hotel, A duplex room is not suitable for an old couple like us we will try a double room next time , The breakfast was fine although we did not like the cereal and there was not enough milk
163876,Nottingham Place Hotel, It was perfect , The stand out for this hotel is the amazing staff Friendly helpful and approachable Perfect location within 5 min walk from tube stop and central to other London sights Beautiful and comfortable hotel with modern decor and large room facilities I can t wait to stay here again 
163877,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room was quite small cosy but suited us as we were not in it for long On check out no one at reception I was told they were at the other hotel , Lovely friendly staff Carried bags to room Comfy bed mini bar and tea making facilities in room Coffee available in reception Good location for Princess Grace Hospital which is where we were heading Close to Baker Street tube and 10 15 walk to Oxford Street 
163878,Nottingham Place Hotel, Assumed the breakfast would just arrive at the door but guessing you need to order it Would of been nice if a member of staff told me on checkin, Rooms where great and different to anything I ve stayed in before I really enjoyed my stay and will use again
163879,Nottingham Place Hotel, We stayed in a studio which was comfortable and well appointed but of a slightly quirky layout and possibly not suitable for elderly visitors , Location was perfect for Princess Grace Hospital which was only about 100 metres away 
163880,Nottingham Place Hotel, Tiny space hot room Hotel in 2 buildings so had to travel with a massive suitcase between reception and my room in another building breakfast not included so not great value for money , Comfy bed
163881,Nottingham Place Hotel, Nothing not to like, A great bespoke quality Hotel offering great value for money The Management team and the Hotel staff were welcoming and very helpful The location provides and excellent base for exploring central London Our trip was for the New Year 2016 2017 
163882,Nottingham Place Hotel, No bar area to sit as not 100 clear in description that it s an apartment hotel , Good selection at breakfast delivered to room with fresh coffee and juice Good deal for family room Comfortable clean and great location for Marylebone High Street and Regents Park
163883,Nottingham Place Hotel, Toilet wasn t very private A little bit of soundproofing wouldn t go amiss We could hear all the movements from neighbouring rooms which means they could hear ours , It wasn t as expected so a new experience for us Very unusual duplex accommodation
163884,Nottingham Place Hotel, Zero complaints, Every interaction with the staff at Nottingham Place was great E mail s were answered promptly special requests were honored and the room was just right for a short visit to London The location is outstanding with transportation great food and drinks all within walking distance Awesome stay 
163885,Nottingham Place Hotel, Me and my friend booked a double room with two single beds The hotel informed us weeks before our arrival that we have been upgraded The room was in another building across the street Nottingham place No 24 as all rooms bookable at the moment The whole interior of this building looked as if it is still under construction In the rooms no carpets as indicated on the homepage wall paint on the floors and our second bed turned out to be the sofa with the linen hidden in the coffee table Unfortunately also really dark due to the small courtyard but at least we managed to escape the cellar room they offered us first So we did not really had the feeling of being upgraded Everything else was fine , Very well located in a really nice safe and quiet neighbourhood Close to subway Regent park Madame Tussauds and Sherlock Holmes museum Helpful and friendly staff in the hotel Clean 
163886,Nottingham Place Hotel, every thing was so bad First the receptionist was so rude and unhelpful the size of the room is too small every thing is small The bed and sofa was uncomfortable Actually it s not worth the money This is the worst experience I had in my life , unfortunately nothing maybe the location 
163887,Nottingham Place Hotel, I didn t like the idea of paying 150 00 for a room which was not even in the hotel but another apartment accross the road In what I would imagine would have been a bedroom was turn into a bath area toiltet area kitchen area Bed was very uncomfortable had my pillows keep falling off the bed because it had no headboard or against the wall lots of raised area supposed to make space but had to walk sideways to get to the bed I hated the room and for the amount I paid for, There was nothing that I like about the room that I was offered
163888,Nottingham Place Hotel, sofa was really noisy woke my husband and child up each time I turned around and they sleaped on the upper floor , great location hospital at the end of the street always good to know proffesional help is near extremely friendly staff my husband who was in London few times before insists that accomodation was much better than most 4 stars in London continental breakfast was excellant
163889,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room is very small but amazingly packaged , Location for my purposes Room is more like a mini apartment with kitchen fridge microwave sink cutlery and crockery also large flat screen TV and AC Great Resturant s close by circa 5min walk
163890,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Although currently under renovation this did not disturb our stay in the slightest The rooms were located in a building across the road and were lovely clean and comfy The staff could not be more accommodating very friendly and nothing was too much trouble Would definitely re book in the future 
163891,Nottingham Place Hotel, Building work was taking place the day we arrived This continued until 10pm which was fine but started up again in the early hours of the morning 1am and before 8am Once reported to reception this stopped , Everything was very clean Nice comfy little suite Even though it was quite a small space everything we needed was there Shower was amazing The staff were very nice and apologetic when we complained about noise from building work 
163892,Nottingham Place Hotel, The glass sliding door to the toilet didn t close fully or offer any sound proofing The decor was poor Chipped paint on door frames etc Considering it was an executive studio room the only real difference was an extra sink and a microwave The bed was not king size as advertised and there was very little extra space , We were in an executive studio The location was excellent right near Marylebone High St The room was in a quiet building The bed was comfortable and the shower was great Good solid blind kept out the light in the morning Good value for money 
163893,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room size no information left about services the view was of another room window the shower was slightly unsafe to get into , The black out blind
163894,Nottingham Place Hotel, We stayed at a distinct building address of the main hotel building in the same street The room floor is very rustic The lack on room floor finishing gave us a impression of not very good cleaning Not the same room in showed in the picture , A good option for London Very good location nearby to baker street station Nice staff The room is very compact and had everything we needed 
163895,Nottingham Place Hotel, The bath was difficult to get into as it way sunken and not much room I did feed this back to the hotel on checkout and not every room has this so next time I would request not to have this My Mom stayed in the Duplex room and that was fab , Overall I loved the studio we stayed in The rooms are fairly small especially the kitchen area but it s perfectly adequate and I don t look to cook anyway It s perfect if you want to make hot drinks and heat something in the microwave or even get a takeaway as there are plates etc Location is amazing just minutes walk from Marylebone High Street which is a stunning place to stay Staff were accomodating They are refurbing the main house so we stayed in the property opposite so it wasn t any problem
163896,Nottingham Place Hotel, This hotel Is not what was described in their advertised pictures The hotel looks like a deserted place The room s floor and in fact through thr hotel s floor are all wood plank The room feels like a blunker and wooden enclosure Equipment like TV is dusty like no one maintaining it and cleaning it House fly in the room Personally I don t recommend this hotel , There is nothing I like
163897,Nottingham Place Hotel, the sunken bath in my room may be difficult to use by people with mobility difficulties not a problem for me , my room was well equipped and very stylish the bed was very comfortable the location was perfect for my requirements I d be very happy to stay in this hotel again 
163898,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, A lovely place to stay and fantastic location first inpression by staff gave us laughs and felt very welcomed Will highly recommend and thankyou Nottingham Place Hotel 
163899,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Really close to everything we needed so we were able to walk everywhere Room was really nice even though compact but hey that s London 10 15 min walk to Oxford Street and less than 2 mins walk from tube and various attractions 
163900,Nottingham Place Hotel, Facilities could have been better We are vegetarians and we needed to cook food for our child Lack of cooking stove and toaster led to some difficulties , Location is perfect
163901,Nottingham Place Hotel, AC was not working properly Some times the reception didn t pick up phone calls due to renovation in the resumption area as explained by one of the staff members ,No Positive
163902,Nottingham Place Hotel, Lots of tv channels didn t work I was in the annexe across the road Bit too narrow and felt small although plenty of space overall Didn t appreciate the loud drilling which begun at 8 20am Shower tap was tricky to operate Not enough room to put the ironing board up Inadequate hanging space for clothes , Unique design quirky rooms 
163903,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room was a little underwhelming taking into consideration the room description on the website and the overall price of the room Floors were supposed to look rustic but actually appeared unfishined and dusty Sliding glass door for toilet was not clean and screeched when pulled back Shower bath was very close to head of the bed , Good location Was ok for a one night stay but wouldn t stay here for several days Staff were friendly and helpful and left us to our own devices unlike many places to stay in London 
163904,Nottingham Place Hotel, The hotel has 2 entrances on the street we went to the one that wasn t reception first which could have been made clearer prior to check we were a late check in and had a lot of bags and a young child, The deluxe room we had was small but very quirky and interesting We were closer to Oxford Street than we had first thought Nice area
163905,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room was a bit crude unfinished no moulding chipped paint Air conditioning didn t work The bed sits on the floor rather than a bed frame , Fantastic location quiet and the staff was wonderful The coffee machine in the main office was great 
163906,Nottingham Place Hotel, Received an email advising we had been upgraded The upgrade was a small claustrophobic box with one window that looked straight into the room opposite when I asked to see our original booked room viewed on the website we were told it was being renovated hence the so called upgrade Very disappointed , Great Location
163907,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room is tiny Zero soundproofing of wc as the door is glass and is 1m away from the bed Key card for the building wouldn t work and had to change it twice a day which meant crossing the road to go to the reception , The location is very good a minute walk from Marylebone high street and 10 mins walk from Oxford street Very nice room design with comfortable bed Small room but well designed to acommodate luggage etc 
163908,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Great location with good eateries very close Lovely touch from staff a gift for my mum this trip was to celebrate her 70th birthday Rooms small and compact but very comfortable would book again 
163909,Nottingham Place Hotel, We didn t get what we booked the so called kitchenette consisted of a kettle microwave in a space no bigger than a small cupboard the bath shower was very dangerous you had to step down and in at the same time while hanging onto a hand rail The room was very small made worse by the steps at the end of the bed to the already small floor space you had to pack and unpack on the bed not enough room beside it, Position the young gentleman at the front desk Waldemar was very pleasant and most helpful The room not studio was clean
163910,Nottingham Place Hotel, A slightly more accurate description of the room but to be clear the room was excellent , Smart use of space clean and modern surroundings with polite and helpful staff Would stay again and already recommended to friends 
163911,Nottingham Place Hotel, Poor design for bath shower Hard to get in and out even using the rail Shower head was not a good spray Toliet door was not soundproof so you could hear everything , Good location to station Room was cleaned well daily Staff were helpful to accommodate us 
163912,Nottingham Place Hotel, Noisy in the morning Don t know if it was other residence or building work next door, The room was compact but very well designed to accommodate bathroom and kitchenette facilities 
163913,Nottingham Place Hotel, You d be in trouble if you had any minor disability the bed is on a riser and space is very tight indeed Working the shower the sliding door to the shower and the electronic blinds requires some real detective work apparently being close to Baker Street has been taken seriously , The room was small but cleverly designed The staff were friendly and extremely accommodating providing a high quality Bose old style iPod dock was quite impressive I didn t take advantage of the breakfast option because it s rather expensive but there are many alternative breakfast emporia within a very short distance so that s not a problem 
163914,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, Staff were really friendly especially when we arrived we were checked in an hour early and when we checked out we were able to leave our bags and collect them after we had finished doing our shopping and sightseeing Location was excellent literally a stone through from Madame Tussaud s and Baker Street station which had links to everywhere we needed 
163915,Nottingham Place Hotel, Only a couple of minor things Could have done with mugs rather than small cups My partner showered before bed and drips continued for quite a while keeping us awake , Marylebone is our favourite location lovely area and great links from Baker St tube so this was perfect We stayed in a studio one minute from the main building Our room was very compact but had an inventive layout 
163916,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room was very noisy right beside lift across the road from actual main building faulty iron and no apology when I asked for a working one Don t bother, Good location
163917,Nottingham Place Hotel, we had a room for 3peapel the room was nice bout lots of stain on floor and the furniture need to upgrade and little expensive, staff very friendly and helpful good location and easy for travel
163918,Nottingham Place Hotel, Rooms are small but it s to be expected in London and poorly illuminated , The staff is great the hotel s position is perfect to visit central London 
163919,Nottingham Place Hotel, Stayed in hotel away from main building Felt as though you were a second tier patron , Location Room adequate given standards of accommodation available in London Tea making facilities and mini bar 
163920,Nottingham Place Hotel, The man who greeted us at 10pm was not so helpful although we had checked in and our bags were in our room he asked for proof of our names driving license and it took 15 minutes to get to our room and I had a small child who was tired He was not too friendly or welcoming , Victor who welcomed us was very attentive and could not do enough for us making us feel very welcome and giving us lots of information Greeted us with a smile and helpful a credit to the hotel 
163921,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room s furniture and accessories are a bit exhausted and room walls are not sound proof , We got the duplex simple smart design The location is excellent and in a quiet area yet still in central London and close to the underground station Buses Breakfast options are all around a bit expensive though 
163922,Nottingham Place Hotel, The hotel part in 24 Nottingham place is very small and uncomfortable the bathroom did not function well and the staff was hard to find and extremely limited It did not really feel like a good hotel, Intersting and innovative setting
163923,Nottingham Place Hotel, This is not actually a hotel This is just a place for 1 night and no more A dirty room with a lot of broken things and spots everywhere The lift was out of work An awful experience , The staff was polite and helpfull 
163924,Nottingham Place Hotel, The tiny and steep stairs to get to the room and the dirty rugs The lack of lights in order to find the room like walking into a dark maze , Location and the attention to detail in the amenities of the room 
163925,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room very nicely decorated and well equiped but needs to be refreshed furniture sofa carpet Room not well isolated against noise from street Window next to bed could not be closed properly window lock missing with no blackout curtains Problems with internet connection in the room maybe because in the highest floor of building Rooms are better in the modern building opposite side of street but with less charm Some changes are needed to keep the already high attractiveness of your hotel location prices , Very attentive and kind reception desk evening and night shifts helped me stopping a sound coming from electricity box in the room Multilingual staff Room very nicely decorated Cleanliness Location
163926,Nottingham Place Hotel, It was very warm in our room and We couldn t really work out the heating , The gentleman on reception was super friendly and our room was much better than expected Very cosy and comfortable Also a perfect central location 
163927,Nottingham Place Hotel,No Negative, I have been to this hotel twice the check in process is quick and the staff are super friendly The room space is great which is also fitted with the regular facilites needed 
163928,Nottingham Place Hotel, Extremely high price without breakfast shabby furniture and carpets no curtains on the windows broken light in the bathroom no bathrobes or slippers as advertised , Location 
163929,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room d cor and carpets were a little bit tired in the part we stayed in 37 It is in need of decorating The shower water pressure was poor , The location with it being so close to Marylebone High Street and the tube at Baker St 
163930,Nottingham Place Hotel, Our room had lots of large stains on the beige carpet Looks like possible flood damage and really put us off The curtains and screens also could be done with a clean as they were all grey around the window ledges The hairdryer in the room is awful They have tea coffee facilities and nice toiletries so it made no sense why they would not give you a proper hairdryer rather than one of the white box things stuck to the wall , Excellent location for what we needed to do Based around a lot of nice bars and restaurants and not far from the high street Lovely toiletries and the bed was very comfortable 
163931,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room was extremely shabby a renovation is really necessary 300 pounds paid is really too expensive for this one bedroom suite the elevator just carried 1 person 2 persons overweight ,No Positive
163932,Nottingham Place Hotel, It was quite noisy It would benefit greatly from better windows as the noise was from outside which is not the fault if the hotel as they can t control it but can control double triple glazing , Lovely friendly staff good range of facilities in room including hair dryer n iron with board plus Elemis toiletries and a fab shower with 5 different functions 
163933,Nottingham Place Hotel, Not really a negative but the hotel is looking quite tired The carpets in our room were quite heavily stained which let the room down a little and the walls furniture has seen better days Bathroom had one of those hair driers attached to the wall that takes forever to dry your hair , Great Location Close to tube Madam Tussauds Helpful Friendly Staff Decent sized room for London Mini Bar with reasonable prices Free wifi Ipod Dock Screen separating the sofa bed from the other bed
163934,Nottingham Place Hotel, Carpets were threadbare You need a degree to work the shower Very tight space between the wall and shower door was difficult to get in Breakfast not included at that price Breakfast was extortionate The lift was an adventure thats for sure , Was close to baker street underground Had Elemis toiletries Polite staff 
163935,Nottingham Place Hotel, Nothing, Love this place great staff willing to go the extra mile great location stay with my 2 young children great food places within short walk or tube very close by ill admit the place could do with a bit of a refurb but ignoring that it s great value for money
163936,Nottingham Place Hotel, Room was extremely hot when we arrived and took a while to cool down Breakfast expensive for what it was , Well kept in a nice row of properties Staff at reception very friendly and knowledgeable We felt very welcome even shared a cup of coffee with them on ur checkout morning 
163937,Nottingham Place Hotel, We had a mouse situation Few seconds and then it was over The guys at reception said it was a problem in London and hard to say where it came from But it checks for food and goes away if it doesn t find any They were quick to attend to it and even offered me another room so I appreciate it their efforts to remedy and assure , It was clean I stayed in the pent house It was much smaller than what it seemed in the pictures Yet it was well maintained 
163938,Nottingham Place Hotel, The carpet in the room heavily stained and we went to use the toilet only to be greeted with a clomp of hair the would have been removed from a shower drain, Staff and location
163939,Nottingham Place Hotel, Nothing to note about the hotel itself Slight stench of sewerage at times in the street but this can be typical of London , The location itself was fantastic within walking distance of 2 tube stations and Madame Tussauds Not a huge hotel or chain but the staff are definitely friendly and were available to help with even the daftest question 
163940,Nottingham Place Hotel, The terrace would of been nice to sit out only for pigeon droppings the carpets need replacing The bed could be a bit bigger but I guess the room is a bit too small to allow for that , The location is perfect Loved the old style of the building The room itself had all the major requirements and was spotless Loved the fancy shower I had a kitchenette so could get a few bits in Tesco around corner The staff are very approachable and helpfull
163941,Nottingham Place Hotel, The room was not located in the hotel itself it was down the road on the opposite site an after thought if you are claustrophobic then DO NOT stay here The lights in the shower didn t work the shower head sprayed everywhere the hairdryer was a 2 pin plug we are on England not Europe the room in my opinion was an after thought to the hotel and a quick renovation for more rooms it was in my opinion NOT and executive room far too small and claustrophobic for my liking and will not be booking to stay there again even the paintwork needed refreshing and the was no artwork on the walls very basic, not much at all the room was very small
163942,Nottingham Place Hotel, There are two locations for this hotel in the same street The one we stayed in needed maintenance which was only partly attended to as it is shortly to be refurbished We were offerred a room in the newer hotel but it meant that we had to climb narrow stairs Not at my age , The location was fantastic The staff were extremely helpful 
163943,Nottingham Place Hotel, the sink in the bathroom is too small we ordered breakfast and was not delivered so we had to call them again we did not finish our breakfast and the leftovers were taken away although it cost 11 50 it would have been nice to leave them in the flat so we could have eaten later on in the day , location bed
163944,Nottingham Place Hotel, The bath could have had a bit more of a clean but not a show stopper, Location was perfect such a short walk from the tube fantastic restaurants in Marylebone nice room with plenty of space and big comfy bed
163945,Nottingham Place Hotel, Strange layout bit tatty in places and could do with some refurbishment , Location was great near to Baker St tube Quiet road and near lovely bars and shops 
163946,Nottingham Place Hotel, We booked a suite this second time twice the price to a studioroom and figured it should be even better But believe it or not it was worse The room was old and worn the carpeted floor was dirty stained and teard The shower was small and the showerhead had no water pressure at all it was like having someone peeing on your head from the ceiling The furnitures where old nagged and scratched and the wardrobe door was about to fall off any second We even found vermin Disgusting Even the walls were stained overall with I don t even wanna know what Time for an update and a renovate for sure , I have stayed at this hotel before We stayed in one of the Studiorooms the first visit and they where small but alright The location is good and the staff is very friendly and helpful 
163947,Nottingham Place Hotel, Bathroom sink was so badly designed that you could not wash or clean your teeth properly Split level bedroom was cramped and slope of roof made it feel very claustrophobic Noisy sounded like the people in the room next door were in our room , Location to Princess Grace Hospital

163950,Nottingham Place Hotel, I was surprised there were no cooking warming microwave as it is billed as an apartment It would benefit from nespresso type coffee facility in the room this is available in reception The carpets in the room were beyond tired They were not dirty but stained and fraying , Good location close to Marylebone High Street 
163951,Nottingham Place Hotel, The Stairway to the rooms were very tired the carpets seemed a tad grubby so my level of expectations were starting to slip there was an air conditioning unit it wasn t very powerful there was a separate stand alone fan which was used fully in an attempt to cool the room The TV remote was a bit of a mess with batteries on show an attempt to repair had been made by the hotel The carpet was very grubby frayed in places The duvet had what I can only describe as a blood stain or red wine stain either way not something I expect from any Hotel let alone a 4 hotel The Bathroom had wires hanging out of the cosmetic mirror the shower was pointless no power in the spray the head wouldn t higher up The stay was ok We didn t come to London to stay in the room 24hrs so it served its purpose but when booking a highly star rated Hotel you have expectations which weren t met, The Hotel location was great within 10 minutes of Marylebone Station 20 minutes of Oxford Street and 30 Minutes from Bond Street and Piccadilly when walking The reception foyer was very inviting modern the staff were extremely helpful and polite
