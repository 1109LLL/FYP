292450,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, My room on the ground floor didn t exactly have a great view The window was level with the ground outside and didn t feel particularly private It was also hard to get the temperature right in the room , The bed was large and comfortable bathroom was very open plan and very clean 
292451,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, The hotel staff was amazing and while the hotel is a predominately gay hotel the hotel is very heterofriendly and great for couples or singles regardless of sexual orientation 
292452,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Check in time was a little late for my preference wasn t able to check in until almost 5pm, The overall feel of the property was relaxed staff was extremely friendly accommodating 
292453,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Very inexperienced staff rooms weren t cleaned daily until evenings no atmosphere or music at pool cheap amenities in rooms poor furniture no luggage rack Very disappointing ,No Positive
292454,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Not much space for storage especially if travelling with larger luggage Balcony rather symbolic Early breakfast with a limited choice still no major complaints , The breakfast was very nice and varied A swiming pool on the roof was pleasant if on a small side Overall a great experience right in the centre of it all in Barcelona recommended 
292455,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Breakfast was not very nice quality of the food was just not good Definitely not worth 15 Instead try OMA Bistr a few blocks away for a great breakfast at around 10 try the bagel con huevos benedict there , Great Hotel nice and clean room comfy bed The rooftop pool and lounge are not super big but I loved it anyways Staff was very welcoming and nice Thanks Dan 
292456,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Only thing that could have been better is having face towels to use Also larger and better soap Other than this no complaints , The staff was excellent Javier and Tony were the best These guys suggested places to go eat and were very down to earth Also the hotel is in a good place to move around Easy to catch taxis or just walk to your destination Great job Barcelona 
292457,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The pool it s a lot smaller than in the pictures There was no room service there was no ice machines available on floor the pillows were terrible Check in was not until 3PM with no flexibility what so ever The hours of the sauna and gym were only till 9 Pm, The location was very central
292458,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Doors and walls facing the toilette and bath was made by glas Even if you re travelling with your partner you need some private space The payment to the hotel was unbeleviable The staff couldnt explain what they charged me for and the only thing to do was to pay I talked to them afterwards but no will to explain or willingness to solve the situation , Nice and clean
292459,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Great stay great facilities including bar and pool all staff extremely accommodating and welcoming Really nice atmosphere at the hotel Receivied a free upgrade to a premium room as it was my girlfriends birthday when we arrived Room was spotless with very good air con Would highly recommend

292461,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Our cash was stolen from the closed safe of our room Although a door blocker that wasn t there 3 hours before clearly indicated that somebody entered the room during our absence and the safe code had been altered the hotel manager remains adamant about the fact that it would be impossible waiving any responsibility for the theft with system records showing that only our own keycards had been used to open the door and arguing that only himself the housekeeper and the maintenance manager know the universal code to open room safes Bottom line he is up till today insinuating that we would be lying but is himself na ve enough to believe that burglars don t know how to open doors without keys and that no one of the above mentioned managers could have inadvertently revealed the universal safe code to other staff members as actually did the maintenance manager when he used that code as we were ourselves watching Up till today the Axel Group direction doesn t even appreciate that minimum goodwill compensations would be appropriate They are so actively hetero friendly that LGTB eventually are becoming the minority probably due to ambiguous marketing communication deliberately fooling the LGTB community in favour of an obvious need for urgent return on investment The water of the pool was disgusting so full of mucus semen and whatever that one could not even see the bottom No wardrobe in the rooms which obviously have not been designed to accommodate more than a one night stand or a quickie The open bathroom may be design but not functional at all it s indeed not easy to shave when the mirror isn t hanging in front of the bathroom sink but perpendicular to it and you got only two small hooks to hang 4 wet towels , If anything that would be the free Wi Fi 
292462,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Some guests where a bit shocked especially the families it is an adult only hotel , Great place to meet people roof top open 24hrs Relaxed and friendly staff place where you can feel welcome and comfortable Love the toilets in the room romantic friendly

292465,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Pool area and sky bar a little small 7 30 closing of sky bar seems a bit early especially if out all day and then want to enjoy some drinks in the evening by the pool , Good location Very friendly staff and a good atmosphere in the hotel Very clean and kept to a high standard 
292466,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We should have booked a non smoking room Didn t think of it up front , Very similar decor theme to the first Axel hotel Enjoyed the pool deck to cool off Friendly staff 
292467,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, I did not like having masseurs trying to sell massages to me as I left the breakfast room as I left the hotel to go and when sunbathing on the roof terrace It s the kind of hassle I d expect in a third world country not in a European hotel , Breakfast was good
292468,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The guest guide in the room stated that we could call for euro adapters for electronics and they would be delivered to the room The female staff at the front desk said yes we have them and to come and get them When I went down to get them she discovered that there were none in the drawer told me to go out and purchase them myself and she pointed a direction out the front door Clearly she is in the wrong industry The AC in the room was poor hot and no air movement I asked about the availability of a fan She only said that maintenance would come and they did Maintenance guy Spanish speaking only was pleasant The filter was clogged with a thick layer of dust dirt REALLY GROSS SEE PHOTO He also discovered that the venting was leaking air and came back with aluminum tape to seal it up and I am assuming a clean filter The room appeared clean but the air we were breathing was being sucked thru an inch of dead skin cells and dirt ICK I was starting to feel that this was a sub standard hotel and I brought my partner back down with me to discuss with that woman as he is fluent in Spanish and she was a little argumentative and dismissive After arguing with her in the lobby lots of people looking on she called the manager who arrived several minutes later He was pleasant and they credited us our breakfast big deal we would not have been able to eat it as we were leaving at 3am and offered an amazing 10 discount 50 would have been more appropriate and two free drinks We went up to the pool deck for the drink and the female who was arguing with us at the front desk was up there having a drink not sure if it was alcohol or not Thankfully she left shortly after we arrived Shade canopy for the pool bar was broken and the only umbrella up there was being used to shade the bartender from the intense direct sun Great views of the neighbors hanging laundry , The design of the room was really innovative for such a limited space but the amenities and poor service at the front desk did not justify the price Maintenance poor 
292469,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Wifi was a little clunky I had to log in to work and it was way too slow in the room But once I relocated to the business center it worked fine It was also very hetero for a queer hotel But I expected that given previous reviews so it didn t really bother me Definitely much more straight than the Berlin version of Axel , Rooms were lovely Bed was comfortable Loved the little balcony especially in the mornings and evenings Location was perfect with the subway right outside Great coffee shop next door Gay bars are within a couple of blocks It was everything I expected from Axel Hotels

292471,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Smoking was allowed around the pool and some guests insisted on smoking whilst in the pool which is very antisocial defining separate smoking and non smoking zones would be nice , Stylish and modern smaller hotel my room facing the treed garden behind the hotel was super quiet Room was not large but well equipped Friends planning to share a room should note that the bathroom is partly open to the bedroom toilet is behind opaque glass however I thought the design very practical and stylish fine for singles couples but may not suit some friends who don t want to see their friend naked I had to leave early to attend a funeral and staff were super helpful to assist Breakfast buffet had a good variety of both hot and cold selections

292504,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Some of the rooms on the ground floor are adapted for people with disabilities which is a very good thing but it also means that both shower and toilet lack doors so every time I showered the whole bathroom toilet area was completely wet So when booking or upon your arrival ask for a room with a closed shower cabin a closed toilet if you aren t disabled it is , The standard room located on the ground floor was 26 square metres felt really huge for 1 person There is lots of space around the bed and in the bathroom area Plenty of space for clothes and shoes too and many hangers A nice little fridge minibar and a safe AC works silently is very efficient The best part of the hotel is without doubt the lovely swimming pool with jacuzzi with nicely warm clean water accessible around the clock Swimming at night with just stars and the moon above our heads was amazing Oh yes I m going to dream about it now The gym is rather small but oh so lovely in pink and the steam room is nice too Many sun beds a bar that opens in summer months I suppose the roof top terrace must be a busy place in summer Breakfast buffet is lovely much worth the price pastries ham cheese yoghurt juice milk cocktails scrambled eggs bacon even apple pies many fresh fruits every morning Also the buffet is served until 12 00 o clock on Saturdays Sundays very convenient I especially enjoyed the music played at the breakfast buffet in the reception area Lana Del Rey my favourite Adele Lady Gaga and many more The guys working at the hotel are all extremely kind helpful special thanks go to Ricardo very service minded professional speak good English and above that they are handsome cute Thank you for a nice stay at your hotel I hope to be back in the summer

292522,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, maybe a small kettle to make some tea coffee would be handy Small note be careful with your belongings when sightseeing I ve learnt the hard way got my wallet stolen but I still loved my Barcelona experience can happen anywhere so just be mindful when going out what you can leave behind just leave it at the hotel , The room was funky modern mirrors all over so if you are with friends it might not be for the shy ones when it comes to taking a shower etc Great facilities The rooftop bar mini pool and gym are great Fab location can walk to many sites or just jump onto metro 1min from the hotel Fab staff and just overall very cool place would stay there again There s also a cool cafe just opposite the hotel on the street corner lovely breakfast great coffee And a little shushi place on the same side just a few doors down amazing food great prices 
292523,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, my window was facing small internal courtyard so you couldn t actually keep the curtains open for privacy thus you have to stay with artificial light even during the day the breakfast actually is a bit poor for 4 S hotel, very clean and modern room good position for visiting the city

292534,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Pillows are quite uncomfortable I would suggest as in other Hotels to provide a different range of pillows according to the customers needs Some problems with the cleaness of the towels and the dumping of the shower But the overall evaluation is pretty good , The position the terrasse the room were ok 
292535,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, I stayed at this hotel with my family and I didn t know it was actually gay friendly and the pictures and advertisement were not very good for people who visit with family , The room was clean and the hotel was near by the city centre
292536,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Some guests were very disrespectful and spent the night screaming in the hallway There s really not a lot of space to store your stuff The breakfast can be much better , The staff the pool and the good environment around It s very well decorated and the shower was very big 
292537,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The only things I could tell us the pillow where a bit too flat n soft for me but it very personal and subjective however still good Hetero friendly hotel Good but Maybe a bit too much , Really nice place room are nice and cosy with good size The staff is nice rooftop bar n pool are a great place to relax and make friends 
292538,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The toilet and the shower without privecy even for a couple it s too much I didnt like the fact that they dont have enough towels at the pool the AC was not good enough , I like the location and the staff are very nice 
292539,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, As I was on my own it wasn t a problem but for those who want privacy the bathroom is not closed off from the room The toilet door and walls are frosted glass , The roof pool was one of the best hotel rooftop pools I have ever seen 
292540,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Alarm clock was set to 6 in the morning and had very confusing interface to shut it down Nightmare Breakfast is nice but not that great as described in other reviews , Central location normal but not great neighborhood new building really nice rooftoop bar with a pool

292543,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, I just think 24 to park the car in the garage is too expensive should be for free , The location is perfect the room was super clean the staff was excellent Every single thing was perfect 
292544,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, the air conditioning system was not working properly, the room is very comfortable spacious and well equipped The staff were very nice and helpful plus they offered us a free room upgrade for being regular customers 
292545,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Not one thing, Staff were so helpful with fun and interesting things to do in the area The hotel is so modern but classy at the same time The manager Adrian was so helpful and friendly with whatever we needed Couldnt of had a better stay somewhere else
292546,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The staff is either uninformed or everyone there just makes up their own info concerning the hotel Very confusing to deal with a staff contradicting eachother on numerous occasions A bit tourist trappy to hide until checkout that VAT is not included in the so called breakfast promo price that they communicated us at the reception This kind of silly practices are copied from seediest of Benidorm hotels Not comfortable at all to put the mirror next to the wash basin for e g shaving Small rooms with no place to store clothes in a decent way , Quite an original gay concept and at the same time very heterofriendly In fact most of the guests were hetero couples The shower flooded our small room but this was fixed quickly 
292547,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, When checked in on July 10 there was a cotton quilt But there s no cotton quilt on July 25 When asked FO he said we should ask in advance if we want Then we made up the bed by ourselves Quite inconvient , 1 minute s walk to subway Nice staff
292548,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The receptionist was rude when we tried to check in one hour after check in time He spoke to us as if it wasn t his problem that the room wasn t ready and after offering a free drink didn t follow up with the offer Any receptionist in these circumstances should be apologetic to customers A second receptionist was nice and told us we would be upgraded for no extra charge but the room didn t seem to be much different to the one we had paid for The room was nice and modern but had little to no storage for clothiers , Great location and nice rooftop area with a pool and small gym
292549,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, I booked the highest rate room which suppose to have a bigger french windows that are shown in the photos that they stretch across to the corner of the room indoor veranda what was given to us was the room that is one level lower We complaint later and then they said they made a mistake and that they will offer us breakfast instead to make up for the extra charge and the mistake they did Basically they made a mistake and we had to pay for it by letting us pay for breakfast that we didn t want or need in the first place what they should have done is offer us a free breakfast and refunded us for the extra change of the room type we paid for and never got Other things were with the hotel was super hot no AC in common areas the room was very hot for 3 hours after we have checked in as the AC will only go on after you insert the room key into the room key slot the closet is just a rack and no tea or coffee machine in the room I have noticed this about gay hotels is that they take pink dollar for granted and offer the minimal as premium while you can get these things in a 3 star hotel that is not gay The only thing about this hotel is that it s gay theme look and people who go there and that s it nothing special about it at all The pool and gym are very tiny that is silly to call them facilities sorry , The overall atmosphere was fine
292550,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Reception made me wait for my room by 1 hour The reason was housekeeping didn t prepare the room which was not acceptable The reception and staff had attitude The towels and robes were not new misrepresent the room sizes online Value for money is severely lacking While we waited all luggages were in the bar area ,No Positive
292551,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We arrived at 1 00 but couldn t check in until 3 00 but they did look after our bags There s a bar on the roof terrace not always open but no lounge bar not that i found anyway , Small gym but has good quality equipment for once in a hotel Nice rooftop terrace with pool and sunbeds Good breakfast selection Rest of hotel is typical of chains in that mid range not budget but equally not top end I d guess about 40 guests gay and 60 straight 
292552,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The buffet was great but the eggs had dried out and turned green The hotel is a hike to the center of the Eixample district , Every staff person from the desk to restaurant to the cleaning staff was energetic friendly and professional The rooms were trendy and nice but offered no privacy for friends traveling together

292554,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Booking com could have done a bit more to explain that this hotel is aimed principally at homosexual guests The photos in the lobby were a bit too much for a straight couple , Clean and friendly staff with good facilities Breakfast was first rate and the area is authentic and unspoilt by tourists 
292555,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Good location very nice and helpful staff everything was fine However breakfast could be better nothing special for this price tea and coffee really poor
292556,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We had higher expectations for the rooms as they looked great in the pictures online but when arriving the room felt quite empty and not as opulent as what we would have expected from a 4 hotel Also certain amenities such as complimentary water and coffee in the room was not offered by the hotel We also asked for an iron and board and the unit that was supplied spewed water all over the place yes this is replaceable but in a 4 establishment these should have been checked guests shouldn t have to request another one It s the small details like this that will put us off staying at the hotel again , The hotel is great and we enjoyed staying there as the location was perfect to get around the city via the metro The front desk and bar staff were very friendly and helpful when ever we needed anything The pool area and bar a definite win for the hotel guests

292571,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Would have preferred the pool a couple of degrees cooler as it s VERY warm and the roof could do with some loos which may come once the bar opens in the summer , Staff here are fantastic For hotel loved the roof top pool sunsets laid back guests Lots of English speaking TV options a great buffet breakfast with lovely scrambled eggs bacon as well as fresh fruit pastries As a sole female traveller I chose TWO as its gay hetero friendly I wanted a hotel where I could use the facilities freely without the burden of man hassle Location an easy walk to La Ramblas though a longer hike to the beach I was happy with that as there s so much to see 
292572,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Nothing that I can think of , The customer service of the hotel staff The cleanliness and the responsiveness Adrian Dominguez was brilliant right from my check in to check out he was very helpful also helped me a lot understand the city routes better and places of attraction 
292573,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Well the sexual tendencies is a personal matter but making it the hotel identity that is too much This matter makes it a not a recommended choice for me as a straight human being they could ve been just hetero friendly like the rest of the hotels in the city but not bragging of it like this the way made me feel a stranger being there, overall it is one of the best hotels in it s class very well decorated extremely neat and clean I loved it

292575,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, One of our shopping bags just disappeared from the room with 150 Euro clothes in it It took 4 hours for the personnel to tell us that they don t know anything about it so we had to go to a Police station and write an official complaint Poor room service on in the evenings Poor facilities a rooftop pool is basically a mid size jacuzzi , Rooms are relatively quiet and cosy Reception personnel is friendly Clean 
292576,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, I didn t like the free shampoo I know it s free but it s a really bad one , The staff was really nice and helpful Breakfasts are great at this place don t miss jamon and salmon The area is quite posh and lovely the hotel is situated super close to the tube station and airport shuttle bus stop 
292577,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, If the sky bar available in the rooftop would be better and maybe the hotel can organize a daily party would be good for the in house guests coz this is a theme hotel how about Gym , Good location and nice staff thanks receptionist Ricardo and Breakfast staff Andrie for the nice service the room is so tidy and also big i like this hotel so much the wifi also very fast breakfast is ok 
292578,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Overall very pleasant experience however apart from Ricardo who was very helpful and approachable the rest of the reception staff could come across a little bit short Very mean glasses of champagne as well whenever I have ordered one they only pored half lol The Sky bar wasn t finished but the website did not mention that prior so I was quite disappointed that every time I wanted a drink I had to go down to reception where receptionists said that they are not bartenders although they stand behind the bar lol
292579,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Nice Hotel in a nice neighborhood close to all that is happening Rooms were small even after a upgrade but with a nice shower and comfy bed Rooftop bar was not open yet so not as vibrant as the main Axel Hotel 
292580,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, My holiday was ruined when I caught my car on the wall when trying to get out of the parking Large cars cannot get round the bends in one go Guests should be told the parking is not suitable for large cars Both reception staff said it is very difficult to park a large car but did not offer to help It has become a very expensive stay It also cost 24 euros per night I also felt uncomfortable with the type of hotel this is It would help to warn potential guests , Modern and clean
292581,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, more hangers and a shelf for the clothes would be practical, friendly staff perfect location next to metro station Rocafort and close to the airport bus stop yet it is quiet at night Also the neighbourhood is lovely unique modern design of the hotel

292584,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The transparent door of the shower should be possible to dim Some things should stay private , Great facilities well organized room clean location is perfect right next to the subway station close to gyms restaurants sights Wifi is fast

292588,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We were expecting more for that price We got a superior deluxe room and IT DIDN T EVEN HAVE A COFFE MACHINE or just a cattle to boil water maybe only in our room we didn t find out Actually I wonder what besides the price was the difference between normal room and this superior deluxe one Quality of furniture wasn t the best some drawers was not working properly And WiFi code works only for 3 devices which was hard to deal with cause we had 2 phones and 2 iPads , Hotel is located in nice area not that far from city centre Personel was really nice and helpful Room was very clean and nice designed 
292589,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, There is really nothing to complain about May be just that for somebody not speaking Spanish it is difficult to find an interesting TV channel to watch A TV guide with a list of channels would be a big help I didn t see any in the room Otherwise you have to click channel by channel to find out what s available , Very good location Just a few minutes walking distance from Placa Espana Very close to the bus stop to the airport and other means of transport Not a big variety of food for breakfast but fresh tasty and enough to have a good meal and not to be hungry till lunch Nice and helpful staff Place was clean quiet and I liked the design and equipment of our room The pool on the roof seemed to be a nice place to have a rest after sightseeing tours but at the time we were there it was a little too cold outside for my wife to use it although the water is heated We spent mostly late evenings and nights in the hotel but it was quite a pleasant stay Good ratio value for money

292626,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The 3 4 score on comfort it s because the room was a bit noisy being standard rooms rather small it is easy to hear noises from outside the room corridor or neighbors while double glazed windows help decently with noise from outdoors , The concept of the hotel the friendly staff The hotel overall deserves a positive review 
292627,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, not so efficient staff at check out and a little too much photos of semi nude men, nice and helpful staff at check in very nice roof terrace with swimming pool

292637,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, No hot water kettle in the room Guess it is not a common facility to have in the room in Spain , The staffs are helpful and friendly Prime location Metro just 50 metres away Safe and comfortable
292638,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, My wife wanted a hair dryer And I thought some advertising throughout the hotel was overly sexual , The staff were very helpful to my wife and I the hotel was clean and modern 
292639,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We had two single rooms But all our breakfasts were charged for four persons as well as some other small mistakes on our bills We had hard time to explain and get it right , Design confortable room 
292640,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Compare to similar non gay hotels in this area the rooms are overpriced and a bit overrated In particular the breakfast far too expensive , High quality inventory relatively new facility Good room size Bed okay Quiet location in walking distance to the BCN gay area 
292641,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Nothing really just you had to pay to use the gym and spa in the other Axel hotel and it was a little old , Very stylish comfortable hotel with friendly helpful staff it was very clean and we ll located just beside a metro stop Would book again with no hesitation 
292642,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, There is no bathtub in the room and the closet is open for everybody to see your clothes way too small for gay clients with lots of clothes and barely any drawers Uno spa and gym were in the other hotel too far away , Clean location style service super nice staff
292643,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Was given room with city view but it looked directly across into anther building , Beautiful hotel in gay area close to pubs clubs and lots of resturants and shops close by 
292644,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Great location it is a beautifully decorated brand new hotel Staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was delicious room very clean and the wifi for free available in the room I couldn t expect more it was a great experience and a very good value for the money I ll definitely book here again 
292645,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, The whole experience The helpful staff the great breakfast the other guests the fact is that it is a gay owned hotel the location away from the insanity of the Ramblas the room itself 
292646,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, This hotel has definitely worst and the most tricky staff ever I booked a superior room they gave me a double the one above was deluxe When I realised the situation they insist lying and told me the room i ve been given is a superior room until I wanted to see a double and a deluxe room to compare They chanced my room after a long discussion and offer me 100 euros refund I accepted it When I check out I realised they hidden the 100 Euros refunded amount to my extras When I asked what is it they told me it was Tax I realised they were lying again Didn t pay that amount Be careful if you stay there ,No Positive
292647,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Staff was efficient but not particularly friendly very little storage space within the room, Location is fantastic overall design of the hotel and rooms is beautiful
292648,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Due to technical problems our room was not available for the first night We were offered an alternate hotel and taxi We didnt accept this offer When we wanted to cancel our entire booking all of a sudden they had a room for us in the same category that we had booked Not a nice experience Also strange as they stated that the hotel was fully booked , Modern free wifi glutenfree options closeness to metro airport shuttle supermarkets Rooftoop sundeck and pool Staff in breakfast restaurant excellent 
292649,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Checking in was really complicated My stay here was a present from someone else and they booked and prepaid using their credit card But when I tried to check in myself the staff told me they needed to see the credit card used to make the booking or they wouldn t let me check in Of course I did not have the card So I had to contact my friend and he had to send them photos of the card Didn t matter that the booking was already paid for and it had my name on it This means in this hotel you can only book a room for yourself You cannot book for anyone else because then it will be too difficult when they try to check in Also after I checked in when they gave me the key it was for a room that already belonged to someone else Someone else was already using that room I went in and all their suitcases and things were in there and the room smelled of cigarettes I had to go back to reception and tell them and then they gave me another room that wasn t already being used I know this is a new hotel but still stuff like this shouldn t happen In this hotel the restaurant only does breakfast The advertising you can see everywhere like in your room and the lift etc They say how amazing it is But actually it s not Especially because the food is not fresh I ate some fruit there for example some watermelon and it was already sour like it was a few days old already I told the staff and they just brought it back to kitchen didn t explain or apologise or anything I felt this was unprofessional , Good location If you want to do something in the city centre or the old town it s a perfect choice Staff were very friendly 
292650,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Non functional bathroom Need partition between the shower and the toilet Rooms on the first floor is nonsense , Convenient location Friendly staff Regular cleaning of the room 
292651,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, No complaints , We really enjoyed this hotel We have traveled the world and thought this hotel was splendid Especially helpfull and friendly staff Great design 
292652,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Not really in the center of the gay district it s a 15min walk to the bars and clubs Pity that there is no gym in the hotel , Very modern clean and spacious rooms friendly receptionists nice roof terrasse well connected to public transport and airport strong wifi
292653,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Nothing, Staff was really friendly and helpful They have the great service mind They tried their best to help us to contact Lufthansa as the our flight was canceled The room was clean and modern Location was great 2 mins from Underground train and 5 mins walk to AERO Bus stop to Airport Easy to find something to eat and drink Highly recommend this hotel 
292654,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Absolutely loved it pristine clean friendly service and particularly loved this special smell of a newly opened hotel The only thing missing is the gym 
292655,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Offer of hotels by axel is directly tagetted to homosexuals which is missing from description For sure hetero friendly place but this is not the same thing , Close to metro and city centre nice breakfests 
292656,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Smell in the rooms at the ground floor was rather not fresh Also the ground floor actually is basement so if you want to open the window you would see people s feet , Nicely decorated modern and clean apartment 
292657,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, , Excellent location and connections to the city and the airport Amazing stuff Outdoor swimming pool in use even in November Extremely early check in possible 
292658,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Disappointing check in on the day of arrival with 2 Staff Members multitasking completing our details and dealing with incoming phone calls at the same time , Nice Modern New Build well located 
292659,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, We arrived at the hotel earlier than the checkin time and were advised that we can just check in later We specifically requested for a double bed and had been told that we will get one When we came back another staff called David gave us a twin room and refused to acknowledge our earlier request stating that the hotel is fully booked Good thing Mark was there and he helped us sort out our room Otherwise we would have been miserable for the 3 nights we were staying there , Mark was very friendly and helpful and gave us a lot of tips about what to eat where etc 
292660,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, the sofa was broken we couldn t use it as bed they couldn t afford another solution instead they told us that the queen size bed is actually two beds pushed to each other so we can separate them and sleep on it as single bed the magnet card was not working as first the locker was closed when we came , The apartment is nice and luxurious The stuff Lucia was good help for us 
292661,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Rooms are a bit small by north american standards but the amazing disposition and decorating more than make up for it , perfect location just on a metro station the staff is super charming Complete excellent breakfast buffet
292662,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Not as good as it looks in pictures I got a bit depressed during my stay because of the colours general lighting in the room There should be focus on the facilities as some are incomplete Throwing some small events will be nice for socialising freaks , Their complementary shower toilet products look funky The staff are cery very helpful friendly 
292663,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, There are no proper facilities breakfast seems to be too much expensive the hotel is a bit far from most of the interesting places , The place is highly designed but not very practical 
292664,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The glass open bathroom is nice for a solo traveler or couple but for friends sharing a room it is really not ideal A little bit of skin can be fun but you need to be prepared for it , The staff was very friendly amazing location and comfy beds and amenities 
292665,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Extremely soft water difficult to get the soap out of your skin , Newly opened Great feeling as you are LGBT traveller Great design of hotels and rooms Very kind people Bathrooms just for couples only glass walls and you can t have any privacy if you need 
292666,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Beautiful and clean lovely space nice illumination of the room new facility class helpful staff But because of its excellency it has a costly price After a horrible experience in another Barcelona hotel previously staying at TWO Hotel Barcelona felt as a taste of heaven I highly recommend it 
292667,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Design room but transparent window for the bathroom is not usual need some day to habit , Well placed Hotel nearby the Subway Design interrior and excellent breakfast with fresh fruit and tortilla closed to home made taste Sunroof with swiming pool very pleasant to rest and take the sun 
292668,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Great new hotel much better than original Axel mainly because hyper recent Roof terrace is very sunny Rooms are well designed and great to live in
292669,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The sky bar was practically empty all day It was too loud from some construction work on the street The staff should get additional English lessons , Close to the most of the main sights Very exquisite look 
292670,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Staff not very eager to provide good service Specially one of the guys at reception who was always very grumpy and was very inefficient , The room was a good size and the terrace was cool 
292671,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Very bad staff at front desk almost all 3 days no gym at the moment and need to pay for axel gym nearby shower and toilet not seperated so privacy is on zero breakfast is nice but bit expensive for 14 euro per person, New hotel clean close to metro at the we have been the price was fair so it was value for money during the week
292672,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, there were 2 attempts to charge us for breakfasts breakfast were included Once we got a bill during the breakfast and second time they gave us a bill for 99 euro at check out Be patient there is no kettle in the room haven t changed towells when cleaning room, breakfast very taste food first hotel where we eat salmon on breakfast fresh room sweaming pool really good location 
292673,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, They do to you the old trick You get the simple room that you order but it stinky no light or air on the first floor with no view And then they offer you to upgrade for more money to a better one They did it to 3 more guest in addition most of the front desk staff have a negative attitude , It s not that far from placa catalunya
292674,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, I like the room The bed and pillow so comfy Room is clean tidy and well maintenace Bed cover blanket is too thin Might be Ok for summer Location is close to Rocafort train station only about 3 minutes walk Plaza de Espana is Just in the corner Walk distance 15 minutes Plaza de Catalunya is near by for shopping Staff is friendly and efficient when I Arrived Breakfast is having good variations It s fine for me Recommended 
292675,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Design of the rooms was very uncomfortable transparent bath just at the entrance to the room confusing mirrors no closet or shelves poor quality of design, Great service very nice staff
292676,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, lobby with a strange athmosphere very small pool pool not heated Gym wasn t ready mistakes in final invoice a bit off site, Nice Rooms expecially nice bath nice roof terrace with bar
292677,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Staff rooms pool and location, I was worried when I seen some reviews This is a great hotel fresh clean new friendly staff I m not sure what staff other people were dealing with but anyone I met was nice in particular Richard the rooftop bar man and the front desk staff I was disappointed the other facilities were not open but overall a great staff and would come back here again for sure 
292678,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The gym and spa were not finished which should have been noted when we booked Further the cleaner made a mistake as she made our twin beds into 1 double bed No problem but we had to ask the front desk twice to change this In the end they just left an extra sheet in the bedroom so we had to correct the hotels mistake ourselves and change and make our beds Not good Also some of the staff have a bit of an attitude , Brand new hotel nice rooms and roof terrace with small pool 
292679,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The room a bit more design than practical E g clothes have to hang in the middle of the room little space for bathroom things no place to hang towel dangerously slippery shower floor Something felt wrong in the breakfast management Gay bars quite a long walk if one aims for that No gym very strange for a gay oriented hotel , Modern clean nice terasse nice area without too many tourists 
292680,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, No restaurant for dining in Rooftop bar was disappointing closed at 9pm and swimming pool area therefore was dark and uninviting after this time The coffee at breakfast was a severe let down and expensive Single rooms have no view and are compact , Location to metro station was convenient as this area is not as densely filled with restaurants as Las Ramblas so you will need to commute often to main attractions
292681,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Looked much more bigger in the pictures but when I have arrived there It was a bit more smaller Nothing much is happening in the hotel , The design was cool Friendly people 
292682,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Argumentative and unaproachable front office staff One of them should be bouncer not front office representative Bar staff group of very young and poor trained boys , Location The one and only front office member with patience and profesionality Adrian House keeping staf invisible and efficient 
292683,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Poor value for money not good enough location or enough facilities or inclusions to justify the charges Small room could hardly take my bag Advertised gym and spa doesn t yet exist Pool and rooftop bar area disappointing Poor bar staff with zero care factor Reception staff charged my card in the wrong currency and without authorisation very poor business practice I could go on I wouldn t recommend this hotel There is much better around at half the price , It was modern and clean 
292684,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, They don t even a coffee or water boiler in their room though they have 2 sets of condom and fancy interior Maybe this hotel is fit for faburalous one night sex ,No Positive
292685,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Would have been nice if the pool area was open for drinks during the evening , New Hotel Comfortable beds Nice rooms facing park Nice staff Great breakfast
292686,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, Only opened a month before our visit so some elements still at practice stage No bar facilities either in lobby bar or at poolside though 24 hour super meerkat sorry supermercat close by , Friendly staff great breakfast excellent room design great impression from outside nice rooftop pool and sun area good location 
292687,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, there was no where to get a drink after 11 pm bars were closed , Breakfast was great Bed was huge and comfortable and staff was really helpful sky bar is amazing in the sun
292688,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The hotel is a normal hotel with pictures of men in the front windows Nothing else makes it gay These pictures are too graphic and I was embarrassed to see the reactions of children walking past There is no spa only a swimming pool They play music constantly throughout day and night and it doesn t need to be played on bedroom floors Room too cold even though I turned off aircon Why only a thin bedsheet as a cover , Pleasant hotel with large rooms
292689,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, It s a 4 stars hotel I believe it should have at least tea or coffee machine , The staff where amazing can t remember all names but Arnau was very helpful and the bar tender can t remmwmbe his name but he has an ear ring Always smiling always helpful
292690,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, No music system no exhaust fans After checking out at 6am and missing my flight I tried to return for a few hours sleep at 7am but they wouldn t let me I had stayed a week and paid premium prices a little hospitality would have been nice But the spaniards know nothing of that in general, All new hotel modern rooms
292691,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, The lifts are too slow Pool bar always quiet Hotel surrounded by residential properties so not best location for large night parties like the other axel hotel , I really liked the tall receptionist with the beard 
292692,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Very stylish hotel with good location Absolutely new and clean it has everything you may need while traveling I had a feeling that these people who was designing this hotel made everything so cosy comfortable and nice as if it was their own house Staff was just amazing with very positive professional personalized and friendly approach Dear TWO by Axel next time I m in Barcelona count me in 
292693,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only, My shower didn t work right Only like warm water They fixed it immediately Bit that meant a maintenance man in and out of my room all afternoon No biggie It s not close enough to the Beach and great restaurants That s why I moved after two days I don t really care about the gay scene Which is mostly at the beach anyway , The room was chic and clean very new with a good bed and the staff was very friendly except for the breakfast waiter who seemed bugged the whole time Just his face 
292694,TWO Hotel Barcelona by Axel 4 Sup Adults Only,No Negative, Great hotel for single travelers You can always find someone to hangout with near by the pool
