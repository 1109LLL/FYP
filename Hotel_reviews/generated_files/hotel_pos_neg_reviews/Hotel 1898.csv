360029,Hotel 1898, The room did not have an iron in it The coff e in the room is instant Given the quality of the hotel I would have expected real coffee , This hotel is in a great location It s within close walking distance of nice restaurants shopping museums and public transportation The staff is professional friendly and helped us with all of our needs The lobby has a nice atmosphere with a bar and plenty of sofas to lounge in The AC worked great which was such a relief from the July heat I would stay here again in a heartbeat 
360030,Hotel 1898, Shower in the bathtub is extremely dangerous Slippery with an unbelievably low pressure rain head up at the curve end of the tub Impossible to wash body or hair safely The hand held shower nozzle which you can trip over also as it lays in the bath has decent water pressure though , The rooms were lovely the staff were very nice and Amanda on Reception was amazing Answered all my questions and booked everything for me on the spot The roof top terrace is a gem with a fantastic vibe and lovely views Didn t have time to try out the pool but it looks inviting Food not that great on the rooftop terrace but I still had a wonderful time up there on 3 occasions in 2 days I had a room overlooking Las Ramblas there aren t many It s not that noisy but there s also not much to see either because of the trees The hotel has plenty of other rooms looking over less noisier streets which may be cheaper If you want decadence there are 3 penthouses with private pools for around 1000 nite and they are amazing 
360031,Hotel 1898, We stayed at the Hotel 1898 last year and we noticed a very slight deterioration in the maintenance of facilities e g not all the water features in the indoor swimming area worked some of the light fittings in the room It would be a shame if these minor issues were not addressed as generally the hotel facilities and staff are excellent, Excellent location very good facilities quiet despite central position
360032,Hotel 1898, No soap on arrival in room Waste bin standing on sink area one day Room not made up at 1630 one dsy No soap another day 30 minutes to arrange a taxi to an event one morning so gave up and organised myself,No Positive
360033,Hotel 1898, We changed our room twice One of the drawbacks with booking is that you do not know the real suze of the room Standard rooms do not mean anything because they change in size in different countries Need to know exact size in metres and a good picture of every type of room, We enjoyed the fact that the hotel was on the busiest street but inside the hotel it was quiet elegant and the staff very accommodating 
360034,Hotel 1898, To be 5 star They need to 1 supply hair conditioner 2 improve room service so that one can order coffee before 7am or improve the coffee in each room from horrible instant coffee to Nespresso machines or something similar 3 improve water pressure from shower heads 4 install Full length mirrora so you can tell what you look life from head to toe 5 change hair driers so you don t have to have constant engagement of the on button they only work when you fully depress the button which makes it very difficult to do a full blow dry styling, I travelled with work colleagues you need to include that in your questionnaire as partner has a different connotation I love the grotto
360035,Hotel 1898, Nothing , Wonderful three days we especially enjoyed the roof top terrace for drinks and tapas with the amazing views The hotel is right on La Ramblas so within walking distance to all the shops and many museums The staff were very friendly and courteous and went out of their way to make our stay special The bed was so comfortable and the marbled bathroom well equipped for lovely long soak after walking for miles The breakfast had was good a large selection on the buffet although the small bowl for the scrambled eggs freshly cooked kept running out but saying that at least it wasn t the rubbery stuff kept warm for hours you see in most breakfast buffets Excellent hotel a bit pricey but there again you do get what you pay for 
360036,Hotel 1898, Staff was extremely unfriendly and service was poorer compared to previous years Checked me in with 1 5 hour delay Service at the pool was poor and our guests were not even allowed to stay by the pool even though our group had 4 hotel rooms A member of the hotel threatened to call security and kick a friend out of the Hotel Waiter for lunch was extremely unprofessional and nervous despite we had lunch for 15 people and paid 700 EUR I asked for late checkout and they only gave me 30 minute delay ,No Positive
360037,Hotel 1898, breakfast too expensive the location just on La Rambla is very annoying when you do go out way too touristy and busy but the hotel itself is indeed a very good choice, Stayed in the deluxe 5th floor room with private terrace that terrace was absolutely the best thing about the whole stay Spacious and comfortable A nice surprise too to receive a complimentary bottle of cava as welcome 
360038,Hotel 1898, Really nothing, Staff was excellent location was fabulous really enjoyed our stay Hotel 1898 is one of the best hotels we ve ever stayed at They are at the top end of La Ramblas You can walk down the pedestrian thoroughfare to the beach or go North to the beginning of the more modern areas in Barcelona We had a wonderful visit to the City We didn t even have a chance to enjoy the rooftop area that overlooks the entire city We lingered there for a few minutes one morning really enjoyed the views 
360039,Hotel 1898, Everything was fantastic , Location on La Rambla is fantastic easy to access the market Champagne Bar and the best restaurants Hotel beds and pillows are really comfortable and the rooms spacious 
360040,Hotel 1898, Being asked if we were residents every time we got out of the lift on the roof terrace They need a swipe card system to enter if they are having problems it s very intimidating the way they question you every time, Towels around the pool 
360041,Hotel 1898,No Negative, A luxury stay Twin room was spacious but did not allow for curtains to be opened Would recommend On a wet wintry day floating in dungeon swimming pool roof top swimming pool closed was magical Centrally located 
360042,Hotel 1898, This hotel is fantastic it s all good, Cleanliness good night sleep on a comfort bed large private terrace friendly staff that are very helpful fabulous breakfast on the roof terrace
360043,Hotel 1898, Breakfast was a total disappointment The full breakfast was very expensive so we went for the cheaper option which there was very little choice The waitress serving us was very aloof and inefficient getting our orders totally mixed up As a consequence of this experience we decided not to have breakfast at the hotel again nor try the restaurant in the evening , The location was excellent Front of house staff were extremely friendly and efficient The bedroom and bathroom were very clean Towels were changed very regularly 
360044,Hotel 1898, On the first night we were in room 605 and the noise from the roof top bar was terrible We rang down twice to the reception and it did improve for a short while All we could hear was chairs being moved and a trolley moving across the roof this started at 2230 and only stopped around 0200 And other guests seem to think it was ok to shout as they walked back to their rooms and one lady decided to make a phone and sit in the elevator hall People should be informed if their noise issue with the room And in relation to the other guests notices should place around the hotel asking them to respect other guests We spoke to the reception again in the morning and where treated very professionally by the staff They where in a position to move us to a quite part of the hotel As an apology We received a bottle of Champagne as a gift which was much appreciated but in hindsight the price of the room for the first night should have been refunded We will stay in the hotel on furture visits to Barcelona but will make sure not to stay in a room effected by the roof bar , Bed was excellent and rooms quite spacious 
360045,Hotel 1898, Terrible experience Music from the roof top was so loud all day that I felt that I was in a club I approached stuff few times and nothing was done Manager never even approached me Although I asked to notify manager Music started from befor 9am and did not stop all the way till 11 until I called downstairs We were told that hotel is full and they cant move us I received call around 11 pm when we were trying to sleep that they can mov us which had no sense to us as we were leaving next day Absolutely no care about customers for such a nice hotel that they are pretending to be We traveled for my husbands birthday and stay in this place did not make out ravel pleasant I will be posting on all social media as this was unexceptabke for the amount of money that we were charged , Location
360046,Hotel 1898, The most strange thing is that staff at reception was not helpful at all During our visit we asked them three times to solve our problems all three with zero results First request was to book one very popular reataurant for our birthday party We got a letter at around midnight that it was impossible and with suggestion to come to reception to find the variants We decided that using of tripadvisors service would be more effective Second request was to help to find the lost jacket the taxi When we asked the next day all that we got is reply that nobody brought the jacket we got NO information about lost and found service of the taxi and etc And the third request was late check out all we need were three additional hours Impossible We are fully booked was the reply So we got the total feeling that they just do not care about their guests at all That is very suprisingly and unpleasant for the hotel with such a high ratings The shower is not comfortable the water pressure is low , Very nice comfortable rooms Location is great The staff members at the main restaurant and the terrace are great Breakfasts at the main restaurant are tasty with wide selection 
360047,Hotel 1898, The roof top bar was overpriced and the some of the waiting staff were sometimes rude and ignorant which was a shame , The hotel was lovely and clean as it was very high end Room size was very good abd had everything you would expect mini bar etc The hotel left a bottle of cava as well which was a nice touch All the reception staff seemed lovely as did the staff at breakfast Breakfast by the way is awesome Sax player playing live whilst you dine on a sumptuously buffet Worth the money
360048,Hotel 1898, The only complaint we had was that the Air conditioner in the room did not keep the room cool It was very hot in the room , Everything was spectacular except for the Air Conditioner in the room
360049,Hotel 1898, Room was located next to a service room where there was constant talking and noise Rooms and common areas could use renovations, great bed ample sized bathrobe
360050,Hotel 1898, Really can t think of a single thing , Loved the spa and the roof top pool area The bedroom was very comfotable and we loved the robes slippers and all the other little luxuries 
360051,Hotel 1898, Felt for the price continental breakfast would have been included , Fantastic hotel with very comfortable beds The rooftop terrace and spa were fabulous 
360052,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Loved the rooftop terrace the extra little touches like a bottle of champagne for my partners birthday The room was fabulous the facilities were great We used the spa which was fabulous also 
360053,Hotel 1898, I made a one day mistake on my reservation and they refused to refund the extra day Apparently they assume everyone is perfect and doesn t make mistakes but their hotel is filled with mistakes There was mold between the bathtub tiles and down the wall from a leak During a entire stay there was a vacuum cleaner in the hallway outside of our door Requested an early check in arrived at 2 00 p m the room was not ready ,No Positive
360054,Hotel 1898, Except a strange smell in the room humidity nothing to complain, Great hotel perfect location right by the market Nice restaurant around for local breakfast and diner 
360055,Hotel 1898, The shower was difficult to work , The staff are very helpful and pleasant which is what you need visiting a new city Beautiful roof garden for R R after all the sight seeing Comfortable rooms Very clean Excellent location 
360056,Hotel 1898, Decor was a bit dark, Great location Very comfortable soft beds and beautiful bed linen Friendly staff Lovely clean bathrooms Great roof terrace 
360057,Hotel 1898, Coffee too strong Toddler with parents in the spa making too much noise Breakfast choice good but expensive compared to elsewhere Room lighting difficult to turn on in middle of night, Roof top bar Spa Room was spacious clean and plenty storage Room service excellent Staff very helpful and friendly English excellent
360058,Hotel 1898, Nothing Except wanted to stay longer , Staff friendly and were able to help us on many levels Rang restaurants for us gave us a bottle of champagne for my husbands birthday Bar staff great with many cocktails made expertly Towels amazing with everything you could need if you have forgotten toiletries 
360059,Hotel 1898, nothing i can think of, We ve stayed in this lovely hotel for 7 nights with our little baby girl we loved it very much and want to come back to summarize an excellent location clean and well designed rooms great facilities very friendly staff amazing experience 
360060,Hotel 1898, Room lighting keeps disconnecting no hot water with the shower sometimes had to call for maintainance each time very poor internet connection sleep disturbances due hotel located beneath the subway nothing can be done here and finally despite calling the hotel to While stuck in traffic on my back to the hotel I was still charged extra for late checkout Overall it was an unpleasant experience with poor value for the money we spent We re glad it was finally over , Clean room comfortable bed and great food
360061,Hotel 1898, Seems to be over priced Some staff members did not provide complete information regarding ticketibg for Sagrada due to which we has to face some issues, Location
360062,Hotel 1898, Better coffee and a bigger gym are they only things I could suggest But these don t detract from an excellent stay It was my third stay there so that says something , Excellent location lovely comfy beds friendly staff lobby big enough to meet and chat and nice casual atmosphere Lovely b fast with great choice especially if you are looking to linger and sample a lot 
360063,Hotel 1898, Breakfast included But that has to do with pricing The breakfast was amazing Huge buffet delicious and the best quality food Worth every penny , Lovely comfortable room fabulous bed and very well decorated classy but not fussy 
360064,Hotel 1898, I felt breakfast was an amazing spread of foods but seemed a little high priced I would have liked it to be included with the room rate , Perfect location Incredibly comfortable It felt like home Staff was so friendly and were helpful in every way They actually talk to you like family instead of a tourist We celebrated my friends birthday they sent a bottle of bubbly She felt so special I can t wait to come back and stay here again We were here for 5 days and it s not enough time to experience all that Barcelona has to offer 
360065,Hotel 1898, Showers were not always hot enough, The bed was very comfortable As a result we saw less of Barcelona than planned Great location for La Ramblas the Gothic quarter and there s a taxi rank outside for exploring further afield 
360066,Hotel 1898, Nothing could have been better , The hotel is in an excellent position right on Las Ramblas It is decorated to a high standard and everywhere was spotlessly clean The staff were very helpful and more than polite they engage in conversation with their guests at all opportunities Renan in the bar was great company and very good at his job nothing was too much for him and he was an expert on his drinks knowledge The facilities were a great addition A large roof top terrace with plenty of tables chairs and lounging sofa area Also a well stocked bar and swimming pool which is heated in winter In the basement they have a lovely spa where treatments can be booked and it also has a pool There is a restaurant on the first floor but we ate out so cannot comment on the food I would definitely book this hotel again 
360067,Hotel 1898, The place doesn t including breakfast need to pay extra 25 euro But still it s not a great loss , Well WOW Me and my wife was looking for a nice place to spend the new year We looked for a fine hotel with a good location it was far beyond The hotel was amazing and also the location At first when we got into the hotel we arrived at 13 00 check in time is at 15 00 the staff said to us that they upgraded us to the superior room but we will have to wait till 15 00 We spend this time to eat lunch at terrace of the hotel which was great Nice view very good tapas Very recommended also The room is very comfortable and have a great facilities We we re in shocked that this hotel is ranked in just 4 stars he can be 5 stars with no problem Btw The hotel have a very nice staff The hotel have an awesome spa It was a great upgrade of our vacation The location is right in the center of La Ramblaa st also near by the plaza the catalonya which made the connection from the airport very easy The Aerobus that leaves from the airport every 10m his last stop is plaza the catalonya Approximately 3 minutes walk to the hotel I will definitely come back to this hotel 
360068,Hotel 1898, We paid over 400 per night but breakfast was not included , Staff were excellent We made several requests and all were met with smiles and quick attention Location is perfect and rooftop bar has stunning views 
360069,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Everything was perfect even down to my soft slippers Champagne delivered to my room free of charge due to it being my birthday X Beautifull roof terrace fantastic views of the city slept like a baby comfy soft sheets and pillows 
360070,Hotel 1898, Advertised slippers in room all one size Seemed like a size 6 when as a man my feet are 11 Considering cost of hotel either don t offer or provide large medium small Room description suggests a certain view but this is dependant on which part of the hotel you are put The first room had an outside wall for the view which was claustrophobic so we upgraded after 2 days to a room with a balcony The room was great but there was no ground view as the surrounding walls were to high Also as it had rained they were unable to change the damp sun lounge mattresses so these remained damp until we left Between the two it made the balcony pointless I raised this point during and at the end of our stay Disappointed with the advertising of the rooms in particular , Staff very helpful Location in prime spot Pool and sauna 
360071,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Amazing trip Concierge was more then helpful made our reservations with excellent suggestions So clean and the maids did an amazing job Amazing location and perfect walking distance I would suggest this hotel to anyone 
360072,Hotel 1898, The Turkish bath could have been just a touch warmer , Rooms were extra plush and cozy We loved the view from our balcony It made for great people watching in the morning The pillows on the bed were especially cushy It felt like we were melting into the bed every night I also loved the little night time treat that they left for us 
360073,Hotel 1898, Concierge staff does not know much about around hotel everytime I ask something I was passed over to reception staff My room was on Ramblas street side it was very noisy until 2 3am in the morning 3 bars were oposite side of my room Room was a bit small compare to other hotels like Starwood hotels , Location is good but not recommend ramblas street side 
360074,Hotel 1898, Rare unusual incredible NOTHING , Everything Ambience professional courteous staff fragrance in public arears comfort of the beds temperature of the indoor pool Quiet Nice well mannered guests no rude new money individuals No kids 
360075,Hotel 1898, The internet was terrible completely unreliable and it seemed to be a problem that was known to be regular If I had had to work it would have been a major issue , Wonderfully comfortable amazing staff great spa excellent location Expensive but you get what you pay for 
360076,Hotel 1898, Hair dryer you had to hold the switch down arm ached holding it would be better in the bedroom, The staff went above there duty in looking after us and friendlyness especially Monika pool cocktails amazing
360077,Hotel 1898, Room 205 is above the restaurant and there might be some noise in the morning due to the breakfast service We got upgraded to a higher floor as a result , Overall design was very cosy Location very convenient with three very good restaurants just next door Helpful reception staff 
360078,Hotel 1898, Breakfast should of been included, Excellent location walking distance to the port and other attractions Hotel was modern and contemporary The roof top terrace has excellent views of Barcelona and was our place to go after a long day blankets were provided when it got colder along with heaters The spa was very relaxing and tranquil The gym was small but adequate for a quick workout Would recommend this hotel to friends and family
360079,Hotel 1898,No Negative, The roof bar was fantastic with great views of Barcelona The buffet breakfast was the best I have ever experienced and the staff could not have done more to assist 
360080,Hotel 1898, The matress was a bit old It lost its tone on the the edges so one always felt like one was falling off the bed The coffee was made with long life milk YUK , Beautiful building in a fabulous area of wonderful old architecture in Barcelona s gothic quarter Staff were multi lingual and very helpful 
360081,Hotel 1898, We got a room with no fresh air so we asked to change and were told that we were upgraded but the room we got 324 was extremely noisy till 2 3am very noisy from the restaurants and from 6 am in the morning from the trucks that brings supplies We couldn t sleep from the noise and when you open the window you get all the smells from the restaurants because the chimney is just in front of the room It was the worse experience we had in a 5 hotel Very disappointed , Great location beautifully decorated big rooms 
360082,Hotel 1898, small room but comfortable a lttle noisy as overlooked the street , the atmosphere very European nicely decorated staff friendly and helpful at all times 
360083,Hotel 1898, No bar soap for the shower Difficult to regulate the heating and cooling system Minor issues as we finally figured the thermostat out , Perfect location The W may be hip but 1898 has the location Go to Canete the best Tapas in Barcelona right down the street Upstairs at 1898 is great for a late night drink before bed The bed was great and the staff are very courteous and helpful 
360084,Hotel 1898, Food was great I just found the room was too hot for me to be comfortable , The serene atmosphere in the lounge and bar was perfect after a hectic day of touring and shopping The beds and linens were a dream even for my chronic back issues 
360085,Hotel 1898, We chose to have a continental breakfast and were made to feel like lepers Seated outside the main dining area and had to wait to be served by a very reluctant waiter Not good,No Positive
360086,Hotel 1898, it would have been better if the breakfast had a two tier price For people who choose not to have a hot part of the buffet I thought it was expensive Staff very slow, Position of hotel was perfect Reception staff very friendly and helpful The roof terrace would have been very romantic if weather had been kinder 
360087,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Staff were excellent The room had all the little extras I e razor in case you forgot to bring one Location brilliant for shopping cruise port 
360088,Hotel 1898, Get an outside room for the views but can be noisy didn t bother us this is Spain , Great location Friendly staff Great period features The roof terrace has great views and a great bar place to be at sunset Food in the bars including tapas and the restaurant is very good 
360089,Hotel 1898, This is a criticism of this website not the hotel Paying at the hotel in euros was expensive and the deal I got here did not come due to volititliy with the euro P, The staffs attention to detail They even spotted it was my wife s birthday on 13 10 and made a fuss of her 
360090,Hotel 1898, The service in the roof top bar could have been better Some of the staff came across a little standoffish really the only thing which let the hotel and the bar down , The roof top bar was excellent for chilling out after a hard day s sight seeing We loved the fact that priority for the bar was given to residents of the hotel The 360 degree view especially at sunset was stunning The menu in the bar was great too 
360091,Hotel 1898, We found rooms were cleaned late in the day so when returning after a morning sight seeing we couldnt make a much needed cup of tea The overhead shower wasnt really overhead as bath was small and couldnt stand directly under it , We stayed in a deluxe room so had our own sun terrace with sun beds table which was lovely Bed was huge very comfy Staff very curteous helpful Lovely roof terrace very chilled 
360092,Hotel 1898, Shower head needed to come out further over the bath Sad that glasses could not be returned easily via post due to hotel policy Maybe some plainer food, Bed and pillows very comfortable Staff all very friendly and helpful Clean quiet room Lovely views from rooftop terrace Good atmosphere
360093,Hotel 1898, whereas I love the hotel I feel the cost is very high at over 300 for one night for one person and to not include breakfast , bedrooms were very comfortable fabulous spa overall very nice good location lovely reception staff lovely coffee 
360094,Hotel 1898, Sorry to say but I think this hotel is a little over priced I travel a lot for work and pleasure and lovely as it is it s at least 50 more expensive than an equivalent hotel in say Sydney Singapore or Hong Kong, Brilliant location nice vibe lovely room with a very comfortable bed The front desk staff were excellent warm efficient and friendly as you d expect and also delightfully patient and encouraging with my simple Spanish 
360095,Hotel 1898, Cost of food and drink within hotel was extremely expensive to the point of only buying 2 drinks from hotel and then buying drinks and meals from other venues very close but excellent quality , Room and facilities were excellent Staff were very helpful 
360096,Hotel 1898, Would have liked an iron in the room , The Breakfast was amazing best breakfast I ve had in any hotel The rooftop bar was comfy beautiful views over the city 
360097,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Great location Bartender can make a killer Manhattan Rooms on smallish side but great concierge work kind people solid regal and old school jazzy look and feel to the place 
360098,Hotel 1898,No Negative, This is a beautifully appointed and luxurious hotel in a fantastic location Staff were also extremely helpful and friendly I would highly recommend staying at 1898 and can t wait to return
360099,Hotel 1898, don t know how to improve but sound of the underground metro every 5 10 minutes at night prevented restful sleep noise and vibration were terrible , staff very helpful at front desk and size of our room and location of hotel
360100,Hotel 1898, Small rooms Price paid 337 for 1 night does not reflect what u get in terms of room size and breakfast was NOT included in the price paid , Location
360101,Hotel 1898, Outdated tired bathroom fittings Cracks in hand held shower holder , Bed was comfy room was large airy and opulent Loved the floorboards and decor 
360102,Hotel 1898, Rooftop staff a little difficult to catch the eye of when we required drinks , Rooms spotless and quiet requested an inner room specifically with quality furnishings linen and towels Staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable we tried two restaurants recommended by Reception and both were exceptional quality and a fair price for the type of food and the surroundings The location of the hotel was superb halfway from nearly every site in our list of things to see in Barcelona Spa was fantastic a true oasis of peace and tranquility in the centre of a bustling city 
360103,Hotel 1898, There was no need to change sheets and pillowcases daily nor towels sometimes twice daily , Slept really well here bed and pillows very comfortable Didn t sample their expensive breakfast as so many eating places nearby Never heard any noise from any other rooms just one evening on the corridor Both pools are lovely the spa one very relaxing We stayed in room 236 some street noise but only when patio doors were open 
360104,Hotel 1898, Staff not welcoming We book king size bed but been offered 2 twin beds connected Or we have to wait another 4 hours for room to be ready Beds keep moving from each other and from the wall making sleeping very uncomfortable We order breakfast in room food was not Ok Yogurts covered byMOLD We told receptions during our check out but they told us we cant do much since we didn t report it right on spot Really Don t waste your money by dining in the hotel Plenty of small restaurants , Location is amazing Hotel has very nice spa where you can relax and hide on hot afternoons 
360105,Hotel 1898, On a long stay guests ought to be devised that rooms might not be cleaned until 5 pm which is not convenient when returning for a rest mid afternoon The gym is way too small and under equipped for such an upmarket hotel And the stone floor not appropriate for a gym Such a pity as there is lots of under used space in the spa area , The beds were fantastic The staff extremely friendly Excellent location but quiete Rooftop terrace with pool and bar just wonderful to relax and refuel 
360106,Hotel 1898, The rooftop pool was a little disappointing the drinks at the bar were very expensive and the pool chairs filled up quickly The staff gave us a hard time when we turned up at the bar w o booking a table even though we were hotel guests It was never a problem to find a table but we were made to feel like we had done something wrong , comfortable room lovely property and fantastic location
360107,Hotel 1898, my room was a bit dark as it looked in to an interior courtyard Next time I would upgrade to a room with an external window But otherwise the room etc was wonderful, Location was excellent and staff very helpful and pleasant
360108,Hotel 1898, Can t fault it and I am a hard judge Slight noise we stayed in superior room in the side of the hotel away from La Ramblas but that is the noisiest Street in Barcelona So the soundproofed rooms do work , After walking around in the city it is like finding an Oasis in the desert relaxing atmosphere friendly staff and glorious views and two swimming pools 
360109,Hotel 1898, Breakfast was expensive though the selection was very good, The hotel staff were very helpful The room was good though painted in dark colours and we were given a free upgrade to a room with a small terrace The rooftop bar has amazing views though the seats are not comfortable and the drinks are expensive
360110,Hotel 1898, Getting a taxi can be a challenge thank goodness they have helpful staff Not all rooms have a good view Electrical outlets be sure to bring your converters They did have a lending option for a converter 10 refundable deposit which worked for us , The lobby area was quite large the elevators were decent sized for people and luggage the bed was large and comfortable and many attractions are within walking distance The hotel itself is very nice Our room was ready early which was fabulous after 18 hours of flying They had already acknowledged that I requested early check in and advised they would be able to hold our bags if a room wasn t available There is a nice pool and bar on the roof top 
360111,Hotel 1898, Hotel is lovely and the room very nice however we were unlucky to have a problem with a sewerage smell in the bathroom It was very strong and unpleasant We were offered another room however we were tired from a long journey and elected to stay in the room if they remedied the situation They tried to fix the problem with cleaning fluids but it recurred and was particularly bad in the evening and this remained for our 3 day stay I was told that this is a problem in Barcelona during the summer , Excellent location on the Ramblas The rooftop restaurant is lovely for drinks and tapas in the evening 
360112,Hotel 1898, the place is quite noisy esp the subway, very good location king size bed very cleanly nice view from the top where you find the pool and good terrace bar
360113,Hotel 1898, Ac vent located directly towards heads of people in bed Unfortunately not comfortable at all staff tried to help by covering partly with paper and tape , Rooftop pool amazing after a long hot day of walking Rooftop bar also great Rooms very clean wooden floors and no carpets is a big bonus 
360114,Hotel 1898, nothing this place is as good as it gets as far as hotels go, Everything this is a fabulous hotel great location superb facilities friendly staff Amazing breakfast comfy beds large room excellent bathroom we loved it 
360115,Hotel 1898, Spa was clean but understaffed The changing area is a bit backward , Perfect location fantastic decor friendly staff and nice spa This is definitely our hotel in Barcelona 
360116,Hotel 1898, Not the best if you want a good English style cooked breakfast , Exceptional hotel room with facilities have use this hotel for 10 years for leisure and business and you really can t beat it
360117,Hotel 1898, THE COMPLEMENTARY TEA AND COFFEE IN THE LOUNGE AND BAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM 3 00 pm NOT 5 00 pm , EXCELLENT LOCATION AND EXTREEMLY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL STAFF ROOFTOP BAR AND RESTUARENT IN THE EARLY EVENING A RELAXING AND PLEASANT EXPERIENCE 
360118,Hotel 1898, No iron in the room an not available from reception clothes must be ironed by the laundry and a great expense , Great location in the centre of Barcelona 2 minutes walk from metro station Beautiful rooftop bar with nice food and cocktails and with great views of Barcelona city 
360119,Hotel 1898, Turndown could be improved with a more personal touch such as placing rose pedals for couples or a special bath amenity option Staff on the rooftop seemed understaffed or overwhelmed leading to slower and less personable service but what a great view Tip creating a personalized experience is today s biggest service challenge amenities name usage and recognized content would bring this hotel to a new level No staff used my name once except at check in out , Amazing facilities and great lounge rooftop bar Also fantastic spa and underground pool very relaxing and escape worthy Very clean and well maintained room with great in room amenities and service 
360120,Hotel 1898, Lack of facilities and treatment was not worthy of a hotel that positions itself as luxury I was there in June for my wedding with a big party of guests we took over a lot of rooms in the hotel for a few nights no steamers and no irons are provided They make you use their laundry services which is appalling to oblige guests to do so and charge them when all they want to do is iron a shirt All the guests complained On my wedding day we were getting our hair and makeup done in a few rooms and the electricity kept cutting when the hairdryers were one which delayed everything and created panic Lastly my husband wrote to them a few days before arriving and asked if they could put some flowers in the room to surprise me we were staying in the privilege room and they sent him a cost It was our wedding we should have had welcome flowers in the room to begin with without asking a nice gesture doesn t harm A proper luxury hotel would not do that especially for how expensive they are We were all expecting much more from such a high end hotel Disappointed , The hotel is elegant and the location is very good 
360121,Hotel 1898, the evening staff on the ground floor barely acknowledged our existence, it was a great room with a fabulous bathroom the spa and the rooftop pools were lovely too and there was a pillow menu 
360122,Hotel 1898, I know Spain has a manana approach to life but if you order room service breakfast for 7 00am as you are going on a tour Then have to ring at 7 20 to find out where it is and they turn up at 7 30 That is poor customer service , Room and bed were very good and comfortable good size room Hotel is beautiful in an excellent location 
360123,Hotel 1898, Rooms that face courtyard are quieter but also darker Drinks at rooftop bar are quite pricey , All hotel staff very helpful and friendly Rooms were clean Housekeeping service was great Beds very comfortable Reminded me of Westin s Heavenly beds Location was perfect 
360124,Hotel 1898, Breakfast was very expensive We went to the cafe next door , The terrace with fantastic views The terrace restaurant did great food The beds were very comfortable The hotel decor was extremely good
360125,Hotel 1898, Only criticism was that a couple of the staff on the rooftop terrace were a little bit rude and unhelpful That said the staff in the rest of the hotel were very polite and helpful , Lovely hotel very well situated for La Rambla Walking distance of restaurants bars and shops Rooftop terrace and the spa were both excellent 
360126,Hotel 1898, had problem with our shower wouldn t stop and then didn t work had to move rooms on saturday night stayed three nights and moved rooms twice No recompense for spoiling our weekend such as upgrade in room or champagne spoilt it for me and expect more from a hotel of espoused calibre, great location and love the rooftop pool
360127,Hotel 1898, The Bar Prices were a lot higher than purchasing drinks at other tapas restaurants in the area , The bed was very comfortable The use of the Spa was very useful 
360128,Hotel 1898, The staff were unhelpful and often rude they did not respond to issues with lights not working didn t explain the air conditioning and were not in line with a hotel in this price range , The roof terrace and pool are beautiful and the location is great 
360129,Hotel 1898, Turndown was a bit sporadic and the servicing of rooms was often done late so that your room would not be cleaned until 4pm which was not great , Location is excellent the superior rooms are nice roof terrace and pool and the spa are good also 
360130,Hotel 1898, Rooms being cleaned late in the day 4 5pm We went out every day came back to rooms either still to be or waiting to be cleaned , Great hotel Great location 
360131,Hotel 1898, Nothing to dislike about this hotel , The hotel is perfectly located at the top end of Las Ramblas within a few minues walk of both the Gothic Quarter and Placa Catalunya The hotel is very tastefully decorated throughout quite dark and atmospheric with lovely large sofas in the lounge areas We requested a room on the 6th floor just to avoid any potential noise from Las Ramblas We were impressed with the cleanliness and hygiene standards throughout the hotel We particularly appreciated the huge bed and it was so nice to walk into a bedroom with a clean shiny solid floor no carpets or rugs gathering dirt Our crisp white sheets and pillowcases were changed every day not an old bedspread in sight The hotel has a small heated pool on the roof and a large well run roof top bar which was a very peaceful place to relax with a nightcap or two at the end of the day Brilliant We really couldn t fault the staff who were always extremely polite and professional Would definitely recommend this hotel 
360132,Hotel 1898, It was Grand Prix weekend busy Staff on roof terrace on Sunday were very off had an attitude as if we should not be there They just had had enough by the looks of it Took 35mins for our G ts to come although there were 5 staff behind the bar , Hotel decor location most staff friendly
360133,Hotel 1898, There was absolutely nothing we didn t not like at this hotel Everything was perfect , The ambience of the hotel was beautiful Great location in the heart of Las Ramblas The room was beautifully decorated with a very large and comfortable bed Loved the roof top terrace with wonderful views great bar service and pool The sangria drink is the best in Barcelona The staff were very polite and obliging with helping us locate restaurants and various attractions to see and do while in Barcelona We couldn t fault the hotel and will definitely stay there next time in Barcelona 
360134,Hotel 1898, check out at 11am expensive for 4 star hotel stingy in providing small items such as paper tissues had to request for, excellent location cozy and clean nice staff very good breakfast but highly priced 24 
360135,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Great location in the heart of the action on Las Ramblas A few minutes walk to Barri Gotic the Gothic Quarter and to the port Staff were very friendly and helpful The room was very comfortable we had a king bed in a superior room Rooftop pool and bar was nice as well Strongly recommended for your stay in Barcelona 
360136,Hotel 1898, The hidden A C controls in the cupboard took me a while to figure out the bathroom fixtures too Getting old I guess , As requested received a room with a smoking balcony on the 1st floor Imagine higher locations are quieter WI FI worked very well Best mattress in Spain so far Pleasant rooftop bar Friendly staff 
360137,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Perfect location in the heart of the old city and walking distance to all main attraction Hotel is superb Very clean and stuff very professional and helpful 
360138,Hotel 1898, The hotel doesn t offer an iron board for in room pressing , The location is simply amazing makes the trip so convenient and easy to go anywhere 
360139,Hotel 1898, It is very noisy which you expect but the rooms at the front of the hotel are difficult to sleep in There was shouting at partying outside until 6am on Saturday The gym is extremely small The general pool and spa day is great however don t go here if you re a gym bunny The worst part of the trip was the unhelpful front desk staff I asked to check out at 12 30 but was told this wasn t possible We asked them to bring our bags down and keep them at reception but they didn t bother , Brilliant location The rooms and hotel common areas are clean and well designed 
360140,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Decor is very inviting and we loved the location While the staff was helpful we often got overly optimistic estimates of how long it might take to get somewhere Air conditioning does not operate until May very warm in room at night But overall would definitely recommend this hotel Lovely breakfast and afternoon tea time with snacks which are all included 
360141,Hotel 1898, All good, Wonderful central location on La Ramble A calm oasis in the vibrant centre of Barcelona Roof top terrace is marvelous Pool warm and inviting Worth having breakfast there Staff were brilliantly helpful
360142,Hotel 1898,No Negative, I loved the d cor colonial style with wooden floors and stylish design throughout the hotel The spa complete with steam bath and a beautiful indoor pool is a peaceful haven The rooftop terrace is also a fabulous place to hang out away from the crowds It has a great view of the city and a heated swimming pool A gorgeous hotel for a weekend away 
360143,Hotel 1898, Some members of staff s attitude and manner when dealing with you Which appeared to be because we were younger than usual clientele , Beautiful hotel and very good location 
360144,Hotel 1898, Breakfast too expensive so ate out 2 bottles of white wine bought at bar not chilled Noisy at night so had to sleep with window shut but that is not the fault of the hotel , The friendly and very helpful staff and general comfort cleanliness and location Views from the roof terrace 
360145,Hotel 1898, The wifi was really bad We had to call a few times because it worked and then didn t work Also the television stations available wasn t great There was only one station in English and it was a political show The room faced the Ramblas so on a Sunday morning there were prostitutes under our window making loud noises as the young men walked by in the early morning , The staff was very accommodating The room was extremely comfortable and clean I really enjoyed our room 
360146,Hotel 1898, Did not order breakfast as it was just too expensive I don t eat that much in the morning and there are plenty of great places nearby for more than half the price , loved the pool on the roof Friendly and very attentive staff The spa pool was also lovely but could have been warmer 
360147,Hotel 1898, noisy drainage could be heard throughout the night in our room and woke us up during the night several times not what you expect from a hotel of this quality and cost, location roof terrace lobby and bar
360148,Hotel 1898, Arriving late on a Friday and trying to order bar snacks the rather terse response from the barman that the kitchen was closed could have been a friendlier direction to room service options , Central location on La Rambla easily accessed from Placa Catalunya La Ramble can be a bit overpowering but our quiet and comfortable room was at the rear of the hotel meaning it was away from the noise and tat and had a good view over Mont Juic Roof top pool looks great though cool weather precluded its use and the spa facilities were nice to have though the sauna steam room could have been hotter 
360149,Hotel 1898, Nothing , Very clean excellent turn down service modern classical decor taxi rank by side entrance brilliant rooftop HEATED pool Very friendly and efficient staff We also stayed at the very expensive W hotel 5 as well but the 1898 was better in all respects except maybe the view 
360150,Hotel 1898, plenty to see and do people very friendly and the sun was out during the day lots of little back streets to get lost in and historic buildings to look around some things were on the pricey side like any big tourist city, right on the main street lots of bars and eating houses and only ten minutes walk to the sea front a wee bit of noise at night from young people and so very busy
360151,Hotel 1898,No Negative, 10 10 Extremely happy stay highly recommended to all travelers Roof top pool bars spa treatments and general all round enjoyable stay All staff great English which made things so easy Excellent location
360152,Hotel 1898, Roof drinks were pretty expensive which is typical for a hotel bar I suppose , Best part is the roof deck with heated pool and I mean heated It was like a bathtub in there so relaxing Great to have drinks up on the roof relaxing in the sun after a morning of walking around and exploring The rest of the hotel is great also though Rooms were very comfortable and the mini bar was well stocked Front desk person gave us some nice recommendations on places to see and eat 
360153,Hotel 1898, The water in the bath shower was not hot enough and the size of the room was a bit on the small side , The hotel was in an excellent location right on Las Ramblas My room was comfortable the pillows were very fluffy and the decor was classic and stylish 
360154,Hotel 1898, Disappointed we couldn t get an iron and ironing board We were a little disheveled when we went out to celebrate my husbands birthday First hotel I have ever been to around the world that didn t provide an iron I would have been disappointed also at having to pay for the ironing service had I actually know about it before it was too late , Location for our weekend visit was ideal We liked the bar our room the spa and treatments 
360155,Hotel 1898, , Loved the terrace leading off from our room The bed was extra comfy a real bonus and the room was extremely clean at just the right temperature Staff are always smiling and polite willing to help with literally anything The building was large and spacious with lots of room to spread out and relax around the foyer The roof top pool bar and seating relaxing area is very very nice If it is not nice weather the indoor pool and facilities are great 
360156,Hotel 1898, Room was an internal room so only looked out onto a court yard This made the room dark and a little claustrophobic We were told it would be a quiet room however would have preferred a room with a window , Perfect location easy to walk to most of the attractions Close to restaurants shops and the market 
360157,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Lovely hotel and very helpful staff who helped us make a reservation for the flamenco show Spa treatments were lovely too Fantastic location couldn t ask for more 
360158,Hotel 1898, Since the location is on La Rambla there was noise at late night even when our window is closed Also the elevatora system that one for ground floor and one for 1 that wasn t a good idea in my opinion, The location is perfect on La Rambla and near to every thing you need the decoration is great and antique I liked the tea time system between 5 to 7 pm there is a free tea time at the lobby they have wide selection of pillows you can call them and choose your prefered type if you don t like the one they provided with the room 
360159,Hotel 1898, Nothing we did not like , Staff were friendly and professional rooms were nice and very clean hotel was in excellent position overall we were all extremely satisfied 
360160,Hotel 1898, hotel is little overpriced we had at march terribly cold room with only possibility to use aircon to warm up all rooms faced to ramblas are incredibly noisy due to underground it is really disturbing nice rooftop terrace bar without service until april why , great location at ramblas close to all best attractions for city turistic oppulent nice equipment design 
360161,Hotel 1898, Not enough tea and coffee in room Fresh milk would have been better , The room was lovely Spa area beautiful Roof top pool and terrace Views stunning Staff friendly and helpful Car parking available at a cost 
360162,Hotel 1898, Nothing perfect stay , Everything was first class good breakfast although a little pricey but offered a wide range of choice hotel location spot on facilities and spa very good and nothing was too much for the staff 
360163,Hotel 1898, If I had to criticise anything it would be the bath shower Plug was missing so we had to ask for a replacement and the tap system was a bit of a faff but it was not a major issue and certainly did not spoil our stay , Excellent location Polite helpful and efficient staff Delicious breakfast in bed 
360164,Hotel 1898, The room was dark with very little natural light The bathroom door did not shut properly but as we were only staying 2 nights we didn t want to change rooms However it was fairly expensive so I did expect everything to work properly, The location was perfect right on Las Ramblas and very easy to get to from the Airport The hotel was very traditional and the rooms were very comfortable Amazing buffet breakfast with a huge choice of top quality food The staff were very helpful and informative I travelled with my sister and we had a wonderful 2 nights in Barcelona
360165,Hotel 1898, It was slightly upsetting to realize how well we could hear the people walking and chatting past our room The noise is not a nuisance in itself but it means we have little privacy as the bedroom starts right after the entrance door There is no corridor leading to the room which could provide some privacy , Very efficient and friendly staff Spacious room and outstanding terrasse Heated swimming pool outdoor on the roof top Dream like in January The hotel itself is comfortable and the deco is wonderful the breakfast is worth mentioning as one of the best we had in such a quality hotel rare choice of fruit hot and cold dishes various sorts of bread cakes biscuits good service and friendly hostess 
360166,Hotel 1898,No Negative, we loved the customer service we received at the hotel and we loved the rooms and the lobby areas The front desk was extremely helpful for anything we needed They were also extremely accommodating when the internet in our room didn t work they switched us to a new room right away Great service 
360167,Hotel 1898, The gym is small only several cardio machines and very limited weights small dumbells The spa pool is good however the steam was too cold Small roof top pool, Location good close to the Ramblas Staff willing to change room and did so quickly we wanted a balcony Roof top seating beds are excellent
360168,Hotel 1898, While we received a lot of written information upon check in map list of things to do hotel amenities I would add a small conversation about what time the Spanish eat later lunch and later dinner and where to eat or have drinks just a few places to get started , This hotel is amazing I can t find any fault Perfect location right on La Rambla for tourism We walked to Port Vell Museo del Picasso shopping restaurants The hotel itself is beautiful and felt so luxurious We had drinks at the bar but didn t eat at the restaurant But just sitting in the lobby huge to rest between attractions was luxurious Also when referring to the hotel for taxis etc don t say Hotel eighteen ninety eight Refer to it as Hotel one eight nine eight unless you know the spanish for 1898 
360169,Hotel 1898, There wasn t anything I didn t like , The staff were friendly and very helpful Our hotel room was upgraded on arrival because it was my friend s birthday really lovely We were close to all the shops and restaurants and within walking distance of the harbour all in all a really relaxed and enjoyable break 
360170,Hotel 1898, That I had to come home and go back to work , The hotel was very trendy and in a brilliant location We loved everything about our stay especially how friendly the staff were I wrote a small note on the booking form to tell them it was our honeymoon and they had a bottle of champagne ready for our arrival not to mention the free room upgrade Fantastic hotel with amazing staff and facilities I m certainly going to come back 
360171,Hotel 1898, Beware that the indoor pool can only be used by children older than 14 years We had a five year old and we only noticed that he could not use the pool when we arrived at the hotel since we had not noticed it in the hotel conditions when booking For us the indoor pool was the deciding factor for this hotel since our son loves swimming , Excellent hotel felt very welcome Lovely indoor pool and spa 
360172,Hotel 1898, pool was being refurbished and the other pool didnt allow children under 12 also a shame the roof top bar was open in winter , concierge were really helpful with left luggage breakfast is expensive if not included but amazing and includes cava 
360173,Hotel 1898, the pool on the rooftop was closed which wan t mentioned upon reservation In the morning you hear the metro in the rooms on the third floor , Perfect location Very good bed and love the pillow service Good breakfast
360174,Hotel 1898, Not an issue but something I noticed The room was just a tiny bit small in comparison to the other hotels we stayed in afterwards for the same rate I mean , The location was perfect and is perfect for any first timers to Barcelona The staff was extremely helpful and friendly 
360175,Hotel 1898, We loved everything Even the man who helped us carry out luggage refused to accept a tip , Everyone was so very helpful we asked if it was possible for us to retain our room a little longer on our last day as we are not very mobile and our flight was not until late afternoon This was not a problem and we got to keep our room until it was time to leave for the Airport 
360176,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Everything Facilities staff location food sincere concern they show you for an excellent stay The fitness room spa massage and pool were all greatly appreciated 
360177,Hotel 1898, If you are a light sleeper avoid staying in the rooms facing La Ramblas Do t get me wrong the rooms are sound proffed but the street never sleeps , Location staff ambience room size and the fact that we were upgraded upon arrival One of the most comfortable and specious lobbies I have seen 
360178,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Loved everything Staff immensely helpful and welcoming Pool was gorgeous Breakfast was amazing Room spacious and comfortable Facilities were outstanding 
360179,Hotel 1898, The service in the bar was slow even when not busy, Everything was within walking distance and the front desk staff were incredibly knowledgable even their recommendations for dinner were fantastic We loved the rooftop bar 
360180,Hotel 1898, I like jogging in the morning or afternoon In the afternoon it is a bit of a struggle to make good pace down to the beach from the hotel s location through the crowds of La Rambla , Wonderful hotel 
360181,Hotel 1898, Rooms were a little too hot at night time but Netherless lively with I nice touches, Loved the rooftop terrace and heated pool in a sunny October was wonderful Also the spa pool and facilities Fantastic location right in thecentre
360182,Hotel 1898, Lobby too dark reminded me of a casino Cleaners constantly in hall ways outside rooms drinks too expensive at rooftop, rooftop area tidying of room in evening
360183,Hotel 1898, That we couldn t stay longer , The staff were helpful with any question or request asked of them The location of the Hotel is the best in the city near every quarter and tourist location The room was beautiful the spa room relaxing and the rooftop terrace is stunning with unbelievable views over Barcelona 
360184,Hotel 1898, The free wifi kept dropping out Easy enough to reconnect , Helpfulness of staff always willing to help with any request Room service was excellent the roof terrace was so good we had dinner and drinks and just relaxed there with the beautiful skyline as our view Hotel decor was lux The underground Spa was a great way to end a day and relax before bed The computer room with free printers was spacious private luxurious I ll definitely be staying there again 
360185,Hotel 1898, The in room dining options were rather limited it would also have been great to have traditional Spanish dishes on offer The location comes with a bit of noise from the restaurants around it , The location the friendly and helpful staff the beautiful interior and comfort of the room The facilities were great The breakfast spread was wonderful 
360186,Hotel 1898, Couldn t find the air conditioning so we were too hot over night A clear indication that the air con is hidden in a cupboard would be useful , Spa room size and decor roof bar location look and feel of the hotel 
360187,Hotel 1898, The restaurant was rather expensive and didn t serve traditional Spanish dishes No Sangria or Paella on the menu , The location was superb close to all areas of interest I walked to almost all attraction places Great amenities in the room all basic essentials provided Lovely friendly and helpful staff 
360188,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Excellent location right on the Rambla and a couple of blocks from Plaza de Catalunya Street noise wasn t an issue but our room wasn t facing the Rambla so YMMV Nicely decorated room w hardwood floors and large plush towels The turn down service didn t just leave a mint on the pillow they replaced used towels and tidied up a bit Nice rooftop lounge bar w an unobstructed view of the waterfront Although spa access was included we were too busy to check it out 
360189,Hotel 1898, Room was extremely noisy until about 4am from the Ramblas every night not well insulated for noise , Clean room comfortable bed Central location for sightseeing Front desk was very helpful
360190,Hotel 1898, The showers were a little cold, The service was great they couldnt do any more for you The facilities were top class and the design and ambience was second to none
360191,Hotel 1898, Worst showers and towels I ve seen in quite a while Terrible shower rose clash with bath lip wall had to nearly stand on the bath rim Water was always tepid to cool even on highest setting Towels had no pile were like boiled rags that smelled of white vinegar Not up to bathroom standards of even a basic hotel , All facilities outside the room itself were good Pools were good bar nice though small snack portions and location is great 
360192,Hotel 1898,No Negative, the perfect spot for sightseeing restaurants and cafes The hotel was beautifully appointed and the roof terrace and pool great to relax in after a hard days sightseeing 
360193,Hotel 1898, You could hear and feel the subway running underneath the hotel which made it difficult to get a good night s sleep , Great staff Wonderful outdoor pool on top floor Large rooms Fantastic shower 
360194,Hotel 1898,No Negative, Staff are excellent service levels are great The location is perfect for local attractions and the metro Housekeeping staff provide a first class service 
360195,Hotel 1898, Our room was on the front left corner of the building and There was a rumbling noise I think it was from the metro underground from Across the street But it became white noise after awhile ,No Positive
360196,Hotel 1898, Shame the heated rooftop pool was too cold Only complaint Otherwise superb, Beautiful hotel with superb facilities and helpful staff Fabulous rooftop bar with great selection of food and drinks and excellent service Amazing views to see the fireworks and city lights
360197,Hotel 1898, The evening meal at the rooftop restaurant was disappointing Given the quality of everything else in the hotel it didn t meet our expectations , Wonderful ambience in the hotel beautiful decor and furnishings in all areas and a fantastic rooftop terrace with pool 
360198,Hotel 1898, Shower very complicated instructions on wall near sink discovered our last day couldn t use shower properly until then No iron in room security risk could have items pressed by hotel no use when in process of changing to go out, Location and roof terrace
360199,Hotel 1898,No Negative, I definitely liked this hotel and will recommend it to everyone who wants to combine a city break with relaxation and pampering Although the treatments in the spa were not the best I have had in a hotel spa in was still relaxing as well as the pool and sundeck on the roof The staff was very helpful and friendly but the cleaning of the room was not always timely and they forgot to fill the minibar but all that was fixed immediately when I mentioned about it My overall view is that Hotel 1898 is a good choice in Barcelona 
360200,Hotel 1898, undergraound metro passe underneathe hotel can be noisy duing most hours apat from very late night into early morning Bathtub extermely slippery with no means of pevention Should be taken care of by hotel, location quiet decor friendliness of staff fast service good food on rooftop restaurant 
360201,Hotel 1898, No iron in the hotel only a dry cleaning service that is only open during select hours nice but inconvenient Atmosphere was a little bland and not as captivating or unique as I had expected Very overpriced in comparison to other hotels of great stay for only a fraction of the price , Great staff primary appeal to the hotel for me Great breakfast on rooftop terrace Free spa Was given a free upgraded room 
360202,Hotel 1898, The location is only good for young people who want a busy scene If you know Barcelona you know La Rambla is packed day and night 1898 is slightly shielded on a side street but it is still very hectic , The rooftop is not to be missed The staff was amazingly helpful 
360203,Hotel 1898, Nothing, Everything Decor is fantastic rooftop area is an oasis of relaxation and the staff are first class Spa and pool area is beautifully done with sauna and steam room Probably one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in
360204,Hotel 1898, Breakfast in the terrace A tad disappointed Lovely setting shame coffee was weak and semi warm Complained and fresh coffee was bought up from first floor restaurant cold Likewise with the hot food , Excellent location Rooftop pool a little busy but it was August Reception staff particularly helpful booked us a nearby fish restaurant and helped with queries 
360205,Hotel 1898,No Negative, fantastic rooms most comfortable beds ever great linen and cushions great roof terrace for evening drinks very friendly and helpful staff great location right at the rambla 
360206,Hotel 1898, Took over 20 minutes to get served cocktails on the rooftop bar in the afternoon when there were only a handful of other customers We had to go ask at the bar for a menu just not good enough for a hotel like this , The rooftop breakfast was special and worth the extra money fantastic 
360207,Hotel 1898,No Negative, This is a fabulous hotel food staff spa rooms everything is amazing But the roof top terrace with cocktail bar is out of this world I recommend breakfast up there just fabulous 
360208,Hotel 1898, The steam room in the spa is not hot enough firstworldproblems I know but it really isn t The staff in the rooftop bar don t welcome you when you come up for a hotel like this I d expect to be greeted and seated not have to wander around wondering which bit is restaurant only the bit with the best view is solely a restaurant annoyingly and which bit is the bar The lifts are very mildly frustrating The spa was unattended and I couldn t find any water inside despite signs indicating there was water available again a small problem but anyone who uses a spa knows you want to hydrate while doing so , Fantastic new hotel very good location big and comfortable room the rooms are a lot nicer than they look on the website much brighter and airier fine hard wood floors Good staff generally the spa is small but quite peaceful and a nice stone design 
360209,Hotel 1898, Wifi could be better keep cutting in and out and poor receptions on the rooftop, Size of room service and location is great Charming and romantic hotel
360210,Hotel 1898, Try to not to get room on 6th floor as just below bar area and abit noisy at night , Superb location right on Las Ramblas and also very relaxing and tranquil with great facilities including rooftop pool and bar and spa with gym and indoor pool
