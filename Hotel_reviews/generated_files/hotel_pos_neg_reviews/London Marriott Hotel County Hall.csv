372353,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Room was not what we requested No dressing gowns slippers Automatic light in wardrobes not suitable Staff pleasant but under trained , Comfortable bed good sized bathroom 
372354,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, We received a different type of bed purchase two bed and received one King The rooms are too small I was very dissapointed because there were no view as the picure of the hotel mention I had two rooms on one of them the window was high and not able to see the big Ben and the other had obstructed view to the big Ben , The hotel is located at a very nice spot and near to most of the attractions
372355,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The breakfast is changeless To Chinese stomach it s hard to accept these foods for seven days We went out for breakfast sometimes , The location is good Jubilee Line Westminster Station facilitate visitors touring around London Room is quiet big and with BigBen room view Waiters and waitress are polite warm and willing to help 
372356,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Be very careful when you are booking the room Think about the m2 because we booked room for 3 adults and got one big bed and one bed for little little child , location was great silnece everywhere
372357,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, N A, All the staffs in the hotel are very kind and helpful especially Alexander who worked at the front desk on 05July2017 around 2 30pm He was so kind and very patiently explained everything we should know Great helper We are extremely satisfied with our stay in Marriott County Hall Will definitely come back again Great views from the room and both the light blocked curtains and the sound proof windows are excellent 
372358,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, You need to ask for slippers and robe I found none in my room View on Big Ben was partly spoiled by view directly into Eye cabins Price is high but you wont get mush for it Bar is cute but cocktails are strange Some drivers can not find right turn to the Hotel so better look after them , Best location for sure Good classical design nice place 
372359,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Not very much We would gladly stay here again On the Sunday morning there was a small hiccup at breakfast as staff struggled to keep the buffet stocked with bacon and sausage from the kitchen The supplies ran out and there was a delay of 15mins or so It was c 9 20am and not particularly busy There were no problems at all on Monday and Tuesday so this may have been a one off issue My adult daughter stayed with is in the same room The temporary bed was of a good standard and not intrusive given the size and shape of the room but there was no close turn down service and we had to unfold the bed each night Also the room was not fitted out with an extra mug bathrobe slippers towels etc The matter was promptly and efficiently dealt with within a few minutes of our call to reception but the booking was clear enough so I m not sure why this cannot be picked up before arrival I appreciate this is a city hotel not a resort hotel but for the price I expected better , The hotel is superbly located and close to many of our favourite places in London The tube is nearby and you can also catch a boat nearby to travel further afield to say Greenwich The room was newly refurbished clean and bright with excellent views over the Thames towards Westminster Staff were helpful and attentive at all times The food at breakfast was good with fresh fruit and quality ingredients 
372360,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Pillows could be better Breakfast was poor eggs and bacon too dry Also 20 for kids is overpriced as they only had cereal and one egg each, Great staff service location 
372361,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Check in didn t explain what facilities were available to us We had to ask about breakfast and check out times etc Also we should have been able to use the Executive Club but we were not told about this and only found out at breakfast the following morning because we we ate in the main restaurant and not the Executive area They also kept asking us the purpose of the booking and I had explained on booking that it was a 60th birthday treat Also we had to wait 15 minutes for some of the breakfast components and when the mushrooms arrived they were cold Not very good value at 22 per head , The building was fantastic the staff were welcoming and we loved the swimming pool 
372362,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Restaurant food quality not worth the cost Too many delays in serving the food Breakfast was not worth the cost Selection not extensive enoigh, Room and location
372363,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Had a river view room Unfortunately it was facing the river at a 45 degree angle and facing down river away from Big Ben and Parliament facing the London Eye so did not get the quintessential London view I was expecting , Great location exceptional breakfast friendly staff
372364,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, For a 5 star restaurant the breakfast was really poor The english cuisine of course but there were only 3 different kind of bread sandwiches no boiled eggs no salmon or any fish and it took some time before they refilled empty things , the hotel is located in the former old city hall its one of the most beautiful buildings in London Its close to underground station and right in front of the big ben and the London Eye 
372365,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I tried calling from the states to arrange for transportation pick up and was told I needed to put the request in writing address given was not correct I finally gave up , The entire atmosphere was so welcoming
372366,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Pretty mediocre breakfast in the main dining room Cold food items were fine but the hot food was not well prepared Dried out and bland tasting , Very quiet rooms Liked all of the wood that s used in the interior space The hotel has character 
372367,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Not the hotels fault but we had ignorant parents that allowed their children to run and yell in the hallway for a while in the morning and wild in the room late at night , Our son wanted a view of Big Ben and we got exactly what we paid for We drove our rental to the hotel and paid for parking for 3 days and used the black cabs that were always available The staff were excellent and the room was comfortable and clean 
372368,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The lounge staff were untrained They were friendly clean and polite but had no idea how to perform their job We practically had to tackle them to get them to bring our snacks and drinks They were visiting with each other when they had customers in the lounge waiting for them , The room size and furnishings and the other hotel amenities were outstanding 
372369,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I booked a table for the evening of 21st April as it was my wifes 70th birthday I requested a bottle of Champagne to be put on ice at our table this did not happen We ordered some other wine but this was very disappointing , Good food and drinks
372370,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, Excellent location Great Decoration environment Very clean room and facilities very friendly professional and ready to help staff A special note and our thanks to Thanos from Greece at the reception who greeted us and made the appropriate check in arrangements Excellent member of staff 
372371,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Nice hotel and location , Booked 2 doubled bedded room almost 5 months in advance and this was not available then even though we were let down on this as it was the only reason we booked this hotel and used Booking com To add insult the room had only a double bed in and not additional bed even though it was clearly a booking for 3 and the double bed was requested Poor from the hotel and a VERY misleading booking engine on the booking com website which clearly does not stress that your booking is only a request until after you take the booking I will be reporting my comments to Stranding Standards as an official compliant 
372372,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, Every member of staff went above and beyond to ensure that our stay at the Marriott County Hall was absolutely fantastic When I mentioned at check in that my husband and I were spending a last night together before he went away for four months work we were asked to wait in the stunning bar for ten minutes and when we went up to our room there were rose petals on the bed and complimentary champagne in an ice bucket plus a box of chocolate truffles Incredible service and such a lovely surprise The room itself was perfect the bed sumptuous and everything had been recently renovated in a luxurious modern style that still managed to echo and complement the history of the building Little touches like being able to easily link our laptop to the TV and watch movies from our own Netflix account was a huge bonus The hotel and amenities were beautiful but it was the wonderful friendly service where nothing was too much trouble that made our stay so memorable I hope we ll be back soon 
372373,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, refrigerator was not cold enough breakfast could be better , spacious room with comfortable beds great staff and service nice view of big Ben i forgot my phone charger and found it kept well next day 
372374,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, This was my treat for my sister s 70th birthday We also went to see An American in Paris She had the time of her life and as a swimmer loved the pool I fulfilled an ambition that I have had since my youth as a penniless student in London in staying in a posh hotel over looking the Thames Our stay exceeded expectations so thank you all 
372375,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Rated as 5 star reception were unclear of booking and tried to palm me off with a double when twin was pre booked Had to fight to get Twin reinstated which was done only after stating on three occasions that it was sold out Breakfast was poor Hot plate insufficient to keep food warm bacon and suasages deep fried eggs watery and generally mush of varying types passed off Coffee poor and service patchy with self imporatant pompous French type revelling in patrolling the breakfast area Gym ok but dirty Pool ok but very dirty Charging 5 star prices which I dont mind paying for but expect 5 star service , Building was lovely 
372376,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I really can t say there was anything I didn t like , The staff were so helpful nothing was to much trouble the room was amazing two double beds that were so comfy a large selection available for breakfast all presented lovely 
372377,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The room was advertised with a bath but only had a shower When booking I asked if it would be possible to have a room with a river view but apparently no one even read the request,No Positive

372381,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Nothing, I loved the position The view of the river Big Ben and the London Eye was breathtaking Tour busses were at our doorstep Staff were extremely helpful too
372382,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Breakfast table too close to service area Not enough milk for tea in room No biscuits I would prefer a bath to just a shower, Staff were brilliant Great views Nice location
372383,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Would prefer crispy bacon , Lovely room with 2 double beds Bathroom was sumptuous with Floris soaps body lotion and bath shower shampoo conditioner They were really impressive and I ve brought home the opened products When we arrived in reception I asked for a room not too far down the corridor as I have mobility problems and my request was fulfilled Thank you That meant a lot 
372384,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I had called the hotel the day before arriving asking for an early check in I did not feel well and knew travelling all night would not help They said they would do their best When I arrived the staff said unfortunately my room was not ready but it would be in a half hour Unfortunately I did not get a key until after 3 00 p m We also experienced fire alarms two out of three days which were unsettling but I guess what can you do At close to 600 a night I thought it would be a little more customer friendly but the staff was very nice ,No Positive
372385,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Would have been lovely to have had a bath in the bathroom And irritating to have to pay extra for wifi when expensive enough already , Room was so comfortable staff fantastic the meal in restaurant the best of the trip
372386,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, Location location location super staff super staff super staff The hotel is located just behind the London Eye and across the river Westminster Bridge from Big Ben great location close to a lot of the main attraction within short walking distance There is a hop on hop off stop located right outside of the hotel highly recommended to great a bearing on the city As well located at Westminster stop for the underground The staff are really exceptional all are very helpful and go the extra mile Special thanks to the young man at reception Thanos who really was very helpful and accommodating and very thorough I will definitely be coming back and will be staying again at the same hotel Highly recommend
372387,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, its worth paying for the gallery breakfast in the main restaurant looked crowded where the gallery was relaxed and spacious , fantastic view over the Thames gallery for evening drinks and breakfast was lovely with a feeling of exclusiveness all the staff were very friendly polite and professional 
372388,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The swimming pool changing rooms cleanliness and look feel weren t in keeping with the rest of the hotel but the staff were still extremely friendly and helpful, The hotel is perfectly located for a weekend in and around the West End book a room overlooking Big Ben for a great view well worth it The interior of the hotel was exceptional and spotlessly clean The staff were possibly the most helpful in any London hotel we ve stayed in
372389,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I paid 600 for 2 nights room with a view of the London Eye river however it was a side view so was very disappointment We had booked for 2 nights for my husbands 50th birthday so I was hoping for a very good room, Friendly staff central location
372390,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Everything was great will be returning for sure , The Bathroom was great clean and roomy Had a good view from the room over looking the thames and big ben The meal in Gillrays was lovely and staff was very good to as was the breakfast Slept well in the bed very comfy would deffo go back 
372391,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The room was not as described by booking com Clearly said a bath and only a shower was provided The bed was described as being over 180cm and this was not the case When challenged at the hotel I was informed that booking com only listed facilities available ,No Positive
372392,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, We wanted to book for December 2017 on checking out as we visit London every year We were told we could not do this and had to phone a central reservation This was a shame as we would of booked that day for 2017 had we been allowed to book at the hotel , Everything Mix up with our booking and we were upgraded at no extra cost Excellent customer service and hotel is gorgeous Great for families and swimming pool great 
372393,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Breakfast buffet choice is limited, Fantastic renovated rooms beautiful interior design Excellent and helpful staff Nice view of the Big Ben and the Thames 
372394,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The breakfast was good but cold The bed supplied for are daughter was very poor the mattess was uncomfortable No proper bedding was supplied just an old blanket in a duvet cover in the end are daughter ended up sleeping on the floor which I think is very unsatisfactory, The location was fantastic and the staff were very friendly 
372395,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The breakfast in the lounge is very moderate , The location was perfect just opposite big ben and under london eye Big hotel and very friendly and helpfull staff Also very clean
372396,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Stopped in room 532 Real problems with noise when bath running next door it was so loud it woke us up each morning at 6 30 for 15 mins while the bath filled Watching television in our room one evening next door turned the bath on and we had to turn the volume up 10 more to hear I did complain to reception on booking out said they would look into it , Lovely staff all had a smile and welcome for you 
372397,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The fact that there was no WIFI in my room In a Hotel this class I would expect that not only in the Bar and Restaurant area , The bed was extremely comfortable
372398,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Room wasn t serviced by 4pm when we returned to freshen up had no fresh towels Not expected from a 5 hotel On day of departure housekeeping knocked on our door at 8 10am Something wrong there , The location was amazing 
372399,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Window was too high and small couldn t really see the scenery the worst thing was people inside the cars of London Eye could see the interior of my room clearly I paid more for my room just because it was claimed as Big Ben view but unfortunately it was in the far left handed side that I could see nothing , Staff were very friendly and helpful 
372400,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Very over priced paid a lot extra for amazing view but wasn t all that great Was told I d requested a third bed but I hadn t They left it in there for 2 days and didn t remove it , Very expensive for what is it 
372401,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Room service got our order wrong so I had a pregnant wife and a 5 year old both starving It takes a long time to get food ordered so we had to wait for about 1 hour and a half , John Francois was an amazing host and it was a pleasure to come to breakfast just to see him and also made up for the mess up with the room service The rooms are quiet
372402,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Very pricey mini bar in the room, The room was amazing The staff were excellent Concierge took our luggage with a smile and the restaurant and bar was most professional 
372403,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, was a bit disappointed off the breakfast time u got ur cooked breakfast and sat down it was luke warm , overall the hotel and staff was excellent room was great the view was amazing location to places was great 
372404,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Lounge very loud music on all the time Also service slow and waiters aloof like peacocks not smiling and welcoming Room very warm aircon noisy and ineffective , Great location
372405,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, No bath in room even though I booked with an infant There are apparently 10 rooms with baths but you must somehow know to request one From a food perspective not child friendly and limited accommodation of special dietary requirements for baby and cannot heat up your own baby food due to health and safety policies apparently Will only offer bowl of warm water for you to heat yourself which isn t sufficient especially if you must heat chicken or the likes Fridge in room wasn t at adequate temperature to keep baby food cold , Comfortable bed great view fantastic location
372406,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Hairdryer did not work a bit annoying but not a problem should have ice available on every floor as a very long walk to get ice noisy fridge so much so we had to turn it off, The staff were lovely and the beds were very comfy
372407,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The first room they had me in was a two minute walk from the elevator which was ridiculous to be honest I traveled alone as a woman and didn t feel comfortable walking in a dimly lit long long corridor just to get to my room , The receptionist called Natalia did her utmost to change my room to one that is closer to the elevator She was trying so so hard to do everything to accommodate my request to be close to the elevator and she was so friendly and polite I really appreciated that The rest of the staff always greeted you with a friendly smile Really the service there is fantastic 
372408,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The breakfast was chaotic understaffed inexperienced staff didn t know what English Breakfast tea was rude head waiter when I gave feedback of how stodgy the rice porridge was he rudely shot back and said we don t normally have this this is an exception Whilst Le Creuset pots are good for cooking they re terrible for buffet service the lids are heavy it retains so much heat that the porridge and eggs became overcooked The pool and gym were sad desperately needs upgrading The toilet in the gym looked like they had forgotten to clean it for days , The refurbished bedroom the bed the bath Good location if you want to visit Westminster Big Ben Aquarium Shrek London Eye and lovely views of Westminster and River Thames if you re lucky to get a room with a view Great front desk team concierge 
372409,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, The staff were very welcoming and friendly It was my 50th birthday and we were upgraded to a river view room and a cake We dined in the restaurant on the first evening The service was very friendly and attentive and the food very good Would recommend this hotel Many thanks
372410,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Scaffolding outside our bedroom window which workmen were noisily working on in particular on one of our three mornings not good enough for a 5 hotel We got a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience I was glad we paid for room only in the hotel and not b b as I thought the breakfast for a five star hotel was poor We would probably stay in the Premier Inn County Hall if we were to visit London again as it is just around the corner and better value Pillows uncomfortable air con difficult to control room either too warm or too cold Could not locate steam room sauna, Location is excellent quiet room Decor in room excellent All staff excellent in particular all at reception desk concierge Hotel in general very clean 
372411,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, There wouldn t be anything to improve , The Big Ben room was amazing Shower and beds both incredible Also the use of the sauna and pool was delightful 
372412,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Limited river view in the river view room we d booked Extra cost for Wifi in room, The staff was genuine friendly and professional Lovely decor Loved the bathroom Swimming pool was clean and relaxing We treated us to room service Both food and service was great 
372413,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Cannot fault this hotel , The property delivered on everything I would like to sincerely thank the management individual Christer for his 5 Star customer service My girlfriend and I were blown away He truly made our experience 1st class and I would recommend this hotel to anyone 
372414,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The hotel is very overpriced for what you get Room service was also very poor took over an hour for the food to turn up and was stone cold when delivered When complaining we were initially told we d get a 60 discount with it only being by luck we noticed if food takes more than 45 mins it should be completely free ,No Positive
372415,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, We loved everything the history of the place and the fact that a lot of the original d cor is the same The staff were absolutely outstanding friendly and efficient the room had everything you could possibly need Maybe a bit pricey but for that location it s priceless 
372416,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, one elevator for the whole hotel making us walk 10 min every time we want to go to or from our room We were given the very last room at the end of the corridor mugs in the room were dirty and had dust hotel receptionist did not follow a standard protocol with guests and she provided some guests free services while waiting for room while others none although we were waiting for a longer time no character for hotel, Renovated room
372417,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Older structure was hard to get around only one bank of elevators a long way from the room , Great location beautiful building and fantastic bar and restaurant Staff was top notch 
372418,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Bar slightly overpriced with a service fee the spa isnt actually a spa it is a rubbish cold swimming pool no sauna or steam room or jacuzzi Definately not the relaxing spa break advertised The scaffolding is awful and obstructs views Men on the scaffolding early morning making noise yet seen on phone texting away rather then working , Bed was amazing service at all times including bar and breakfast was amazing
372419,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, breakfast should have more choices the options were very disappointing considering its a 5 star establishment , The location of this place is the best thing you need to have a nice trip in London everything is close by 
372420,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Breakfast IS a disaster from the lifts walking down the corridors to the bedrooms is never ending as its NO good for people with walking problems as the rooms are way too far from the lifts cause of the building, bedrooms was perfect and location was excellent
372421,London Marriott Hotel County Hall,No Negative, The room was beautiful and bed was extremely comfortable The staff were very friendly and helpful It was a great experience and I wanted to stay longer 
372422,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The Bollywood party at full volume that started at 6 30 and took security 45 minutes to stop, Amazing location but you need to make sure you don t have one of the rooms by the London Eye as it obscures the view and people in the pods can see right in to your room
372423,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I booked 2 double beds with Booking com and when arrived we had one king bed and two camping beds which were so uncomfortable I slept on the sofa so my children could sleep in my bed ,No Positive
372424,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I booked one night at the Marriott London Country Hall and when I arrived they sent me in another Marriott hotel in Hyde park and the reason was we re fully booked I asked why did you not tell me that and they answer me with sorry but we hadn t a email address or mobile phone number and this is a very stupid answer because I couldn t book without those informations And I also ordered a room with river view paying more and obviously they gave me a wall view Hotels are cute but never again after this adventure ,No Positive
372425,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Staff less helpful than expected some had very low English levels Double billed for breakfast Didn t acknowledge our special occasion despite emailing in advance , Amazing views of Big Ben Very comfortable suite Modern and well designed decor 
372426,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Nothing really Every bit of the stay was outstanding , The hotel and all of its features are first class but what really puts this property over the edge is the STAFF Every single person is enthusiastic and professional the restaurant staff in particular have genuine enthusiasm for their work and the guests of the hotel They were over the top in service hospitality and thoughtfulness That was the best part of the stay 
372427,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, lovely rooms inside but lacks a little polish in lobby decor exterior window cleaning etc pool was hard to find access and felt like a 1920s rec center , Location couldn t be better for views catching transit local park london eye walking areas Very comfy rooms good wifi amenities Service team was stellar 
372428,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, leaving, basically perfect Great food great staff wonderful room They found out it was our wedding anniversary and put a complimentary cake in our room Pool was a little chilly but it was a super hot day to be fair and it was a good temperature for actually swimming 
372429,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The restaurant was appalling Don t put cheese in what you called Yorkshire pudding No Yorkshire person would recognise it The soup was so salty it ripped my mouth , I chose to stay here because of the big area at the front door as I came in my car My car was carefully looked after I liked the fact I could see it as I went in and out Breakfast in room was just what I asked for and well presented 
372430,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I booked a room with a bath through booking com however on arrival my room had an assisted bathroom with no bath and just a shower hose no holder Second room was another assisted bathroom with a hospital esque wet room Paid a premium to have a hotel with a tub no tub Paid a premium to have a hotel with spa but no treatments available Paid a premium for a hotel with pool gym steam room Jacuzzi sauna but steam room and Jacuzzi were broken on day of visit Therefore I must regrettably leave a poor review , Excellent friendly staff familiar Marriott Hotels feel super clean well decorated and furnished 
372431,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Being woken up by alarm one day and being told to leave the hotel on the second day Both were false alarms, The staff were particularly accommodating and friendly
372432,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Used to slightly better food in hotels of this quality Pool could have been warmer, Incredibly family friendly Lovely room Wonderful staff and location
372433,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Nothing everything was fantastic, Everything was great room superb clean with a great view of the river plus it was my partners birthday and the hotel placed a desert cake in the room which was a nice touch Highly recommend this hotel for its location and helpful friendly staff
372434,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Some rooms were a distance from the lift, Front desk Jemma was fantastic as well as Omar bellman and not to forget Jean Francois in the restaurant was outstanding 
372435,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I had booked a deluxe king room however was allocated a room with two regular double beds I was also disappointed that room 307 was quite a long walk from the elevator meaning this was a little impractical I was expecting there to be elevators either side of the corridor , The traditional architecture tied in well with the contemporary feel of the decor 
372436,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Paid for twin room and provided with a 1 x king size bed only When spoke to staff was told that twin beds were not guaranteed and that a camp bed could be put up in the room Was bankholiday weekend and could not get a vacancy elsewhere Very annoyed at having to pay an average of 125 per night for a camp bed absolutely outrageous, Located very near to attractions 
372437,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, No account taken of request for a twin room Iron didn t work and no bottle opener Hot options at breakfast were cold at 7am, bed was very comfy Room large and great views
372438,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Reception looked like it was out of he dark ages However that s being picky , Fantastic room overlooking Big Ben incredibly well trained helpful staff Were very helpful with our 3 year old 
372439,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, We had to wait for check in which was fine we were early I asked for a room easy access as husband was disabled yet they gave us a room well away from lifts Worse thing was massive scaffolding outside room workman all day view completely restricted and they didn t tell us After I complained they emailed apology nothing else This is an expensive hotel 25 for breakfast 268 a night We expected at least a nice view or a discount But nothing Think they cater to the high end and don t care about ordinary paying customers Will not be recommending this for a stay Look from the outside Staff were nice room lovely NOT WORTH THE MONEY , Location great for access to Westminster Very clean and historic 
372440,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Room service forgot to service our room turned up at 5pm just as we returned to room woke up at 8am with drilling and repair work outside room, Local to everything
372441,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, The hotel is still under renovation I am sure it will be very good when it s done , Staff were excellent very helpful and breakfast were really good 
372442,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Hotel undergoing renovation very little public space just one quite noisy bar and a library lounge which opens only for afternoon tea shut by 6pm Renovations not acknowledged no apology or info in when these would end what would be improved The sauna is separate male female within the pool changing rooms Also a long walk the length of County Hall to our room , Lovely room and bathroom Excellent location Nice bar with view to Westminster There is a 25m swimming pool 
372443,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Room not ready on arrival No price differential between Children s and adult breakfast Very expensive Had to insist to be moved from our breakfast table Glass on the floor under the table and around us had not been properly cleared from night before A problem for people with children I would propose , Unbeatable location for the Southbank area Great room better views Loved the small touch of a toy car in the room as a token apology 
372444,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, At least a complimentary bottle of water as we had to go out and buy one for almost 300 a night we would expect a little more , Bed was comfy room was beautiful
372445,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Poor quality hotel could be magnificent but wasn t Staff were very mixed Some were terrific others reception person particularly were poor Felt no personal attention at all Very mediocre hotel indeed Unbelievable noise of drilling in the night as refurbishment still continued at 2am until complained Only good view of the sights of london if you pay extra Some rooms directly in front of London Eye with clunking noise whenever it was on , Location for the sights of London is great 
372446,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Only 1 chair and dressing gown in double room Quilt was upside down with the opening at the top Extras would ve been nice Hot chocolate biscuits , The bed was very comfortable Relaxing environment
372447,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, Very unclear information about parking and fees breakfast eggs over cooked from room service delays check in and out , Quick response to reallocation of room ice bucket facility facilities in room good staff friendly and responsive
372448,London Marriott Hotel County Hall, I was disappointed when I learned that the spa was not available, I liked the staff I loved how they did their best to help me as a guest in both simple and complicated matters
