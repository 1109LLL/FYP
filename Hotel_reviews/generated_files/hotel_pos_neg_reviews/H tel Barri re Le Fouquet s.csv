193053,H tel Barri re Le Fouquet s, the chef doesn t know how to make the hollandaise sauce of egg benedict Old hotel needs a real complete refreshment Service is not up to the price of the hotel Small gym room it is the level of a 3 stars hotel no more , the bed was comfortable and the room quiet
193054,H tel Barri re Le Fouquet s, The lights in the bedroom were very confusing but it is so minor and I am sure they are fixing it with the renovations , the location was extremely convenient and the hotel is really nice The bar and restaurant were so much fun even though the food is disappointing it is so legendary that you are enjoying every minutes of it I also loved that the mini bar was complimentary I was not expecting it and it was a nice surprised The staff is so nice smart and welcoming they really make the hotel I just cannot wait to see what they are doing with the renovation and stay there again I loved the place and encourage you to stay there if you can 
193055,H tel Barri re Le Fouquet s, front desk and porters were excellent Room service were rude and unprofessional in a whole different level moved to the four seasons George V next day Who were amazing , Rooms are excellent Location too
193056,H tel Barri re Le Fouquet s, However 2 very huge negative points that MUST be solved Smoking is allowed in every room That s is totally disrespectful and unaceptable even more for a Leading Hotels member At least should be separated by floors would be reasonable For non smokers acording that policy it s very possible you to check in a room that a smoker just left all his terrible smell stay for you And the bed was really overused not comfortable canoon style like the pillows as well It doesn t match with the hotel level , The service is nearly to perfection Front desk concierge and house keeping were amazing Amazing breakfast It s a Leading Hotels
