251843,TheWesley, The only minor fault we found was the safe in the room which was in the bottom of the wardrobe which meant you had to almost stand on your head to use it , We liked everything about the Wesley Hotel from the location to the very comfortable bed The bedding was obviously of a high standard The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice 
251844,TheWesley, More signs to indicate where lifts etc are I was in the restaurant trying to get to reception desk luckily there were staff to ask, Onglet steak is definitely something to try
251845,TheWesley, Noisy extractor fan from neighbouring building during one night Servicing of the room not quite up to a fair standard Two light bulbs needed changing and the air extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work which meant the room becoming very steamed up Trim around the shower door peeling off Wrong towel brought on one day Tea bags not replaced on one day The breakfast on one morning was poorly cooked The extras at breakfast you have to pay for when having paid the full tariff you might think you get the lot , Very comfortable bed and blind at the window meant a good night s sleep 
251846,TheWesley, When we arrived the first room we were given was so dirty we had to ask to be moved There was broken glass all over the chair spilled wine just lying on the desk and mould and hair all over the shower After investigating the hotel agreed the room had not been sufficiently cleaned if at all so we were moved to another room This room was acceptably cleaner but still shabby and a bit off putting Speaking of the shower it went between hot and cold every few seconds which is a surprisingly tortuous experience The bed was tiny The smallest double bed I ve ever slept in My feet were off the edge of the bed and we both felt like we could fall out at any time When we spoke to the staff about these things they were very nice and helpful but slow to deal with the issues most likely due to a busy manager behind the scenes We had to go for a wander near the hotel for an hour before they agreed to move our room We were on holiday and essentially just lost a good hour or two of exploring London We re fairly easy going with hotels as we don t spend much time in them but when you can t even get a decent sleep and shower it s a very bad state of affairs Especially when you consider this is supposed to be a four star hotel at 150 per night The photos of the rooms really flatter to deceive they re nowhere near as nice when you arrive This does happen fairly often with hotel rooms as the photographers are so good at getting great shots However in this case you ll be left more disappointed with the reality than usual This hotel will likely continue to do good business due to it s close proximity to Euston but it really needs an overhaul I d suggest looking at other similarly priced safer options such as Premier Inn , The close proximity to Euston station is very handy There s also an underground within a short walk and a few decent places to eat nearby 
251847,TheWesley, jug was full of water how old lighting not sufficient strange noise from the window area during the night plug for wash hand basin slightly stiff, I liked the size of the room some drawer space and full length mirror also bottle of water
251848,TheWesley, The bin in the room was filthy and needed a good clean The thin bin liner was sticking to the sides There was also a stain on the carpet and wall what looked like tea that had been spilled but not cleaned up Nothing major and easily remedied wouldn t stop me from coming back , Friendly helpful staff Small but well furnished very modern room Very quiet and had everything I needed Powerful shower in a light and bright bathroom Breakfast was great had salmon and eggs and they were more than happy to leave the toast off The continental breakfast looked comprehensive although I didn t have any of that Great coffee from a bean to cup machine Small detail but it makes the difference About a 2 minute walk from Euston Station and 5 minute walk to Regent s Place where my meeting was Would stay again 
251849,TheWesley, I only had a one night stopover and there was nothing I could find to complain about , Helpful and friendly staff I arrived late via Eurostar and also had my bike with me It was no problem to store my bike in the luggage room The continental breakfast was plentiful the croissants challenging the French ones I had been eating the last few days for freshness and taste The room was clean and very well appointed and I enjoyed a comfortable nights sleep 
251850,TheWesley, Carried our heavy bags up to the reception Went up one floor in the lift searched for the room like in a labyrinth then went down one floor through stairs while pulling our heavy luggage finally found our room at the end corner of the building, Close to the train station
251851,TheWesley, Not good value for money And I made a special request for my partners birthday but no one acknowledged it For the amount of money I spent on the room I was shocked breakfast wasn t included , The location and staff were polite and friendly
251852,TheWesley, We had no view out the window just a brick wall but we wasn t to bothered, Fab location 2 mins away from station few bars around Would stay again 
251853,TheWesley, Shower had a small leak it is a bit difficult to find your way around the hotel due to bad signage, very convenient hotel if you would like to be near Euston station It is clean and the staff are friendly but it was over priced for what it was
251854,TheWesley, Although our stay at the Wesley was fine the hotel lacks atmosphere and the room was small and basic with much of what you would expect from a reasonable 3 star hotel Overall we thought it over priced for the standard of accommodation and therefore not good value for money , Good location within a short walk of Euston Station and a short travelling time to Covent Garden Oxford Street etc The staff were very pleasant and helpful 
251855,TheWesley, The room finishes were average in some respects poor Cracked tiles marked porcelain poorly fitted items did not speak of good quality We moved rooms and that was handled very well indeed but some room clearly just need some work to improve the finish , The restaurant was very good The staff generally particularly reception and bar were excellent 
251856,TheWesley, 3rd floor bedroom in attic space Room OK but cramped hanging space for clothes Nice bathroom but very small Velux tyoe Windows must be fully closed or open , Close to Euston and Kings Cross Station In a quieter street Comfortable bed Brilliant choice at breakfast esp full English Air con in rooms much appreciated Nice staff Nice pub on the corner of Street and many Indian restaurants in Drummond street nearby 
251857,TheWesley, Was there for a 3 night stay would have preferred if towels and coffee and milk supplies were automatically replenished every day rather than ringing housekeeping every day , Very close to Euston train station so perfect for travelling around the city Close to Camden at night too Perfect for our trip 
251858,TheWesley, One recommendation to the staff make sure you replenish the tea coffee daily without having to be asked these things are important, Great central location Staff very accommodating to make a double room into a twin room Room requires some minor TLC Stained carpet shower seal broken so it leaked however this did not prevent us from enjoying our stay Would I stay here again absolutely Great location room and staff
251859,TheWesley, The grout tiling on the bathroom floor needs to be redone it looks like someone tried to take up the tile to repair a leak beneath the shower but then did not neatly clean up the grout and it ended up on the tiles There needs to be a soap dish in the shower as there is nowhere to put anything More outlets near the bed would be useful for charging phones and other items , The staff were friendly and helpful The wifi was consistently good and easy to access The bed was comfortable and the tv screen was big and clear 
251860,TheWesley, It was so pretentious It made such overbearing claims to be sustainable no evidence was offered The breakfast was expensive and meager I have often stayed in hotels costing 1 2 1 3 the price This one was little better , The location
251861,TheWesley, Room service i e bed making bathroom cleaning was not finished until late afternoon which was unfortunate as I had returned to the hotel hoping for an afternoon nap before going out again in the evening I have used Booking com previously so booked again through you in rather a hurry and had obviously agreed a price I would never have accepted had I double checked I have found The Wesley to be good value for money whenever I ve stayed before but certainly not this time If we stay overnight again in London I shall try a different booking service and also other hotels , Good breakfast with plenty of choice
251862,TheWesley, The AC is centrally controlled During the last day of my stay the AC was switched to HEAT although it was mid july and close to 30 degrees outside When the reception was called they failed to give an explanation and said they were going to fix the issue but never did Horrible ,No Positive
251863,TheWesley, I like Radio 4 Maybe I should have looked harder for it , Very convenient when travelling to and from Euston Station The breakfast was very good The room was well designed and comfortable 
251864,TheWesley, lifts were confusing and slightly slow shower unusual though worked no toilet seat cover razor socket did not work when I inadvertently pulled the cord nothing happened no full length mirror, the ambience especially over breakfast
251865,TheWesley, It was expensive to stay given the fact that we were only in our room to sleep Suppose however that is indicative of prices in the capital , Location for station was excellent Modern and functional hotel which suited our needs for an overnight stay Air conditioning excellent given the temperature in the city when we visited Staff helpful and efficient 
251866,TheWesley, It s not a didn t like more a note I recommend the Wesley highly but it s a little bland This is reliable comfortable air conditioned hotel It has all the professional amenities Light Friendly Elevators Wi fi What it lacks in unique personality and luxury it makes up for in confident friendliness It s not the Ritz or the Dorchester and it s very nice for that , I really like this hotel It s friendly professional and affordable It has everything you need for work or leisure Air conditioning plentiful showers great big sky filled windows Modern clean lines 
251867,TheWesley, We paid 160 pounds for one night at the Wesley an absolute rip off Definately not 4star The bed wasn t bad and the bathroom ok however the dust on the door hinges within the bathroom wasn t a good look The carpet was an absolute disgrace it was beige and was very badly stained also extremely badly fitted Kept our shoes on at all times because of this I would never stay there again or recommend to anyone I know things are expensive in London but I wouldn t stay there again if it was free it depressed me Over our trip we stayed at five other hotels through booking com All as expected no complaints at all ONLY THE WESLEY was rated wrong The facilities for a comference or the like might be ok but we were on holiday so not required All we wanted was a nice clean room , Didn t eat or drink in the Wesley so cannot comment on the food etc 
251868,TheWesley, 1 In addition to the buffet that was provided at breakfast we were also able to order eggs pancakes etc On all three incidents we waited over 25 minutes for our order to arrive On the last day one of the staff members was preoccupied with her phone and was not very approachable or courteous 2 The elevator doors take too long to open about 7 10 seconds upon arriving to the destination floor , 1 For the most part staff and personnel were very friendly pleasant and courteous 2 We complained about an issue that was completely mishandled and the manager was very understanding and handled it gracefully and professionally offering us a 15 discount and to upgrade to a better room She also informed us that our complaint will not be brushed off and will be reported to the general manager 
251869,TheWesley, The view was to an office block Room a little cramped, Comfy bed breakfast nice staff good but room a little small even though a single could have been designed a little more thoughtfully Very quiet 
251870,TheWesley, the room was rather small and oddly old fashioned for example the windows and curtains were hard to open and close , it was a perfectly fine hotel near Euston station the breakfast was good nothing special but with a nice range of choices for london the price was very reasonable excellent pub across the road not a busy road so quiet location 
251871,TheWesley, Took a while to check in as staff were overwhelmed , Well presented room clean and spacious bathroom Nice and quiet at night early morning Easy to find 
251872,TheWesley, Rooms are small No real frills It is basic but you get what you pay for , Close to underground Affordable Good onsite small bar and restaurant Staff were friendly and helpful 
251873,TheWesley, There was nothing that I could say I was not happy with , Lovely room very comfortable cleanliness excellent Staff friendly Breakfast very good selection of fresh food to suit all tastes very happy 
251874,TheWesley, They checked me into a room where someone was still staying My towels and sheets smelled mildewy , Completely nice staff Breakfast was fine Location was pretty good 
251875,TheWesley, Size of room, My room was tiny I booked a double room even though I was travelling alone and got a single bed The room was so small that the fire alarm went off when I boiled the kettle The windows didn t open so I couldn t let air in The glass was frosted so I couldn t tell you what the view was The bed was clean and comfortable although small but the bathroom could have done with some TLC
251876,TheWesley, Desperately in need of redecoration Batbroom particularly bad and dangerous My girlfriend slipped in the shower due to it having a smooth surface and no slip mat She cut her leg and is bruised Despite complaining we have had no response from tbe hotel, The location was the only redeeming feature 2 minutes walk from the tube
251877,TheWesley, Very thin walls Woken up a few times by other guests in the corridor , Very convenient location and good price for compared to other options I looked at Clean and good size room
251878,TheWesley, The room I stayed in must of been the worst of the worst The room was filthy Huge yellow stain on the carpet muck on the bathroom doors hairs in the sink toilet bin was not emptied from the last person I had a single bed which had no sheets on it and a single size duvet with a double duvet cover which was all bunched up at the bottom of the bed when I got in The plugs were in odd places in the room no plugs in the bathroom and the furniture didn t fit together e g Desk chair didn t fit into desk therefore stuck out in the middle of a small room My room also had a power supply board in the ceiling which had a cage type cover over it which illuminated a green light all night Would not stay here again Only good thing was the location but there are plenty of better hotels around , Only good thing about this property is the location 
251879,TheWesley, The shower did not seal on the doors flooding the bathroom The room smelt like feet We had a double bed where the bed joined the one bed was lower than the other, Very good location
251880,TheWesley, service at breakfast on day 2 was terrible, Nothing wrong with the hotel reception or cleaning staff Location was perfect for the conference I was attending Breakfast on day 1 was fine Breakfast on day 2 was poor I ordered a full English with the staff member who was seating customers It didn t arrive I asked another member of staff and it didn t arrive He told me it would be 2 minutes and 10 minutes later it hadn t arrived despite people who walked in 15 minutes after me being served theirs 
251881,TheWesley,No Negative, Had a lovely room at the back of the hotel not a great view but nice and quiet Had to ask for Earl Grey tea bags which were supplied immediately Staff friendly and helpful I was able to leave my bag at the hotel and collected it later having spent the day in London 
251882,TheWesley,No Negative, Very easy journey from Euston Station and friendly staff on arrival Cloakroom luggage service took hassle out of trip and was able to get on with sightseeing Room clean comfortable and quiet Lots of places to eat nearby 
251883,TheWesley, A little train noise due to location near Euston but one of those things, Great room lovely towels and bathroom Value for money Very helpful staff Will definitely return 
251884,TheWesley, Asked if we could check in earlier on booking requirements but instructions were not read Room wasn t ready when we needed to get changed for a business meeting Asked if we could use a spare room to get changed We were told only superior rooms were available which we were not allowed to use We were then told we could get changed in a conference room which had see through windows and no mirrors To then be told we were not allowed in the conference room after all and had to move to the bathroom which had no electricity facilities and poor lighting Very Unorganised as a whole The staff could of easily let us use a superior room or our original room despite it not being ready we only needed the room for a total of 45 minutes to enable us to get changed The conference room was a complete disaster of an idea considering the lack of privacy Extremely disappointing service when needing to be at a business lunch at Wembley stadium , Easy to get to from train station 
251885,TheWesley, In Executive room not quiet at all no soundproofing and constant loud rumbles of trains passing below except between midnight and 6 am which is the cost of a location so close to a major station There were no usable power sockets near the beds and we had to charge our phones across the room this was very disappointing as we use our phones for alarms and white noise no white noise was a major problem for us while attempting to sleep amidst the train racket Walls and carpet had lots of stains , Very close to Euston 2 mins walk our Executive room was spacious with comfortable beds Clean linens towels and bathroom suite Large selection of tv channels 
251886,TheWesley, Nothing , Staff were very friendly food well presented The whole ambience was welcoming The room was a good size with all the amenities we required for a few days in London I also liked the information book for guests as it the history of the concept of the hotel I have already shared this with a friend who visits London regularly 
251887,TheWesley, Given my room key I opened the door to find the room already occupied by other guests Embarrassing Reception blamed a computer error I had paid for a full English breakfast but each morning of the three day stay I had to argue with staff that I had paid for breakfast they said I hadn t On each occasion reception had to be contacted to sort the error Staff seemed poorly trained and not customer friendly in my opinion , clean bright room good restaurant though a bit over priced good location
251888,TheWesley, Rooms were tiny bed mattress was of poor standard Very uncomfortable to sleep in showers were badly temperature controlled would change from hot to cold all the time even after we requested for a room change , Location was excellent staff were very helpful and polite Rooms were tiny and bed mattress was floppy and caused backaches 
251889,TheWesley, The wifi was slow throughout the hotel at all times and unusable in the evenings Makes it challenging for business travellers , Convenient to transport links Great pub Bree Louise over the road Relatively cheap for central London 
251890,TheWesley, I was on second floor and could here the Tube train below I couldn t feel any vibration it was just the sound Once I put earplugs in it was fine, Great staff and comfortable basic room Also good location for Tube to the City in the morning
251891,TheWesley, You really should sort out the breakfast issue first we get an email from you saying the breakfast was continental not full as described then the hotel say they have an issue with booking com and there s no breakfast included We didn t bother fighting but it puts us off using you or the Wesley again, Good location shower fair bed ok 
251892,TheWesley, I m afraid it just didn t look or feel like a 4 star hotel The lift was outdated the room double and bathroom were small with outdated wardrobes and air conditioning Had I not known I would have thought this hotel was a 2 star hotel , Friendly staff clean quiet 
251893,TheWesley, Nothing to dislike Everything was good and staff very friendly and helpful , Compact with all necessary facilities Lovely toiletries Good continental breakfast An ideal place to stay when visiting London 
251894,TheWesley, Missed Breakfest as order and delivery took more than a half hour no buffet Every 4 5 minutes the tube is in the room hearable hence no good sleep possible Carpet in the room full of stains No clear window in the room , Good room equipement cozy bed near Euston Station
251895,TheWesley, Rooms were not cleaned well Carpet is spotty furniture well worn Small crammed reception area if you have to wait your turn Our windows were frosted I hate that when it is a superior room , Good breakfast Friendly staff Great location if you want to stay in the King s Cross area Easy to get to 
251896,TheWesley, I was upgraded on arrival which was nice only to be told when I d settled in the room for a few hours that the room they had upgraded me to was in fact booked the next morning and I d need to move immediately to a third room Not a disaster but an inconvenience for a business traveller rushing to meetings Was offered a free breakfast for the trouble which was awful , Have stayed several times the larger rooms are much more comfortable but overall the facilities are good Good shower comfy bed and ideal location for commuters just a two minute walk from Euston station
251897,TheWesley, Negatives I requested a firm mattress and got a soft one instead And I got waken up at 8 30am on Saturday morning because of loud music coming from a breakfast function right underneath the room where I was staying My hot breakfast came cold and toast was properly burnt Oops , Positives The room was very clean and was well supplied with decent teas coffees and all you need in the bathroom Staff at the reception were very friendly professional 
251898,TheWesley, Had double bedroom but not very spacious especially if you had more than one case or a partner but I d stay there again , Decor contemporary Great location for travel into and out of London as well as proximity of all the shops at Euston Station Didn t try breakfast went to local caf Room quiet even though on front of hotel 
251899,TheWesley, I arrived fairly late so after unpacking and settling into my room I got into bed only to find I had a wet bed I stripped the bed to find a stain and large wet patch on the mattress To be fair to the hotel they changed my room within 5 minutes Also If you pay for breakfast in advance you get a voucher to hand in to the restaurant staff I had one for a full English but be warned handing in your voucher is not a prompt for the chef to start cooking no waiting staff told me about breakfast protocol and so I sat unattended for 30 mins thinking my breakfast was being cooked when it wasn t Only after I queried the cooking of my breakfast was I told I had to actually order it from the breakfast menu Finally and a bit more minor when you leave the lift by reception on the floors above ground level there is no signage to tell you the room numbering sequence and which direction to head for I raised these issues with the hotel reception on checking out and they were very apologetic particularly about the wet bed They said they would email me to offer some kind of remedy hopefully I will hear something soon , Good location for Euston station Reception staff very helpful Reasonable size rooms Despite the confusion over my full English breakfast the food was good 
251900,TheWesley, Bar and restaurant didn t allow use of the gourmet society card unless booked 24 hours in advance although the app does not state as a condition We had lunch but went elsewhere for dinner as a result Would think Monday night would be a good time to get more diners who will buy more drinks The room had outdated information in the booklet explaining the hotel amenities Check out time was wrong as it stated 10 30am during the week when it is actually 10am Luckily we didn t take breakfast or we would likely have been still eating and we checked online when we woke up at 9am We also didn t appreciate the maid knocking on our door 15 minutes before check out or 45 minutes before if you read the information in the room to remind us to check out whilst ignoring the do not disturb sign Fair enough to give us a knock when it got to check out time Left a bit of a sour taste of our last impression of the hotel The blurb in the hotel intro also seemed completely at odds to what the hotel seems all about Not sure where the ethics come in In all I don t feel it was 4 star but happy with the price we paid for what we received , Cannot rate the receptionist on check in enough He was professional friendly and enthusiastic every time we encountered him from arrival to departure For us he was the best asset to our stay as he diffused when we felt annoyed at other things The hotel is in a great location for people travelling to Euston and we were surprised to discover just how close it was The food we had in the bar was excellent and the staff were also great there Room was very comfortable and we were asked on arrival which room we preferred We asked for the quietest and we heard no noise at all The shower was wonderful and we liked having hand sanitiser in the room in addition to the usual toiletries 
251901,TheWesley, room was very basic Shower was too small shower doors let water leak all over floor Carpets were stained To single beds not double Bed noisey , Tea coffee and water provided Black out blind was good Air conditioning was provided 
251902,TheWesley, The bed was uncomfortable The room was brightly lit all night from outside At breakfast the fire exit of the restaurant appeared blocked with chairs from the bar Not only this was the only exit but if there had been the need to exit due to an emergency but it was a complete mess In addition you had to buy a voucher for breakfast which was a bit strange, Nice staff at breakfast Good location
251903,TheWesley, Desperately needs attention in the bedrooms Carpets full of stains marks all over the walls and the bed had huge dips in so definitely time for a new mattress ,No Positive
251904,TheWesley, Bed was very uncomfortable Hotel was in a poor state of repair generally Lift was slow and faulty Breakfast was supposed to be included and was not Generally very over priced It felt like a hostel ,No Positive
251905,TheWesley, Having a room with no natural light was not great at all there were windows but they were boarded up on the outside and did not allow any light in so it was impossible to know whether it was midnight or nine o clock in the morning Very unhappy with that Did not like the bed the mattress was far too soft and the duvet did not quite cover the mattress let alone two people underneath it The toilet creaked quite dramatically when you sat on it I thought it was going to crack or come off the wall at one stage Not terribly impressed either by the receptionist who checked us in who was putting on her lipstick as she was talking to us To top it all this cost 215 and breakfast was not included Needless to say we will not be going back , The location of this hotel was excellent easy access to public transport and could walk to the Eurostar terminal in ten minutes Close to lots of nice restaurants and bars too 
251906,TheWesley, Breakfast felt pretty haphazard the waitress didn t seem interested and the layout of the buffet left something to be desired Breakfast was below average and wouldn t recommended the meal Plates were too large for toast so ended up having two massive plates Coffee was by a machine but had to ask staff about this For 13 it just wasn t worth it would avoid this and find another place nearby to get breakfast Was initially given an internal room which was very claustrophobic and had to ask for a different room , Location if very good and you really can t complain very close to euston so helpful for taking advantage of the tube Initially had a different room with no windows but the new room was clean and tidy Very nice view of the street below Staff were quite helpful 
251907,TheWesley, thestfof hotel gave us room for disability person instead of regular room after our complain they replace it it incorrect standard double bad is to narrow for two person also the hotel charge us for5 nights acc to our booking in spite of our notification that we will deley one day and stay 4 nights it is incorrrect , not too much good things just ordinary 
251908,TheWesley, Train station is near so you can hear trains from room Single room is very small Tiny sink in bathroom , Although very small but convenient room Good location 
251909,TheWesley, Nothing , The receptionists were extremely helpful printing something for me with no fuss The rooms here are stylish and spotlessly clean Wifi is very efficient So handy for Euston My room was upgraded too 
251910,TheWesley, The toilets next to the reception are not clean and very small The elevator takes forever so you might think you re stuck in there but you re not It s just very slow It s nice that there are bathrooms for disabled people but we are not and so the shower with seat low mirror and so on were not that comfortable for us , Location is super Very close to Underground Bus and railway station 1min walk 10min walk to Madame tussaud s and Oxford Street You can easily leave your bagage in the hotel before or after checkout Staff is very friendly and they have a 24hr reception Room was small but clean bathroom was very big and they have special bathrooms and easy availability for disabled people 
251911,TheWesley, Noise from Trains every 3 4 minutes On a Friday and Saturday these run through the night didn t disturb my sleep but if you are a light sleeper this may not be best for you , Hotel is 3 minutes walk from Euston station Room was very clean complementary tea coffee in room was nice Great if you are only staying a short time
251912,TheWesley, The wardrobe is too small There is no enough room between each clothes hangers , Good location Staff is really nice The room is very clean and comfortable There is a big stand makeup mirror on the desk 
251913,TheWesley,No Negative, The bed was very soft and comfy Ground floor room had audible rumble of tube trains beneath Room was freezing I couldn t raise temperature using air con so I asked Reception to switch it off centrally the system wouldn t let me do it myself I waited all night and it was never switched off 
251914,TheWesley,No Negative, Helpful friendly staff had to leave really early the next day to get an early Eurostar so they organised a take away breakfast Rooms clean comfortable modern with lots of eco touches reflecting the hotel s environmentally responsible ethos Good central location some good pubs and bars nearby close to Euston Station 
251915,TheWesley, The fact that we could hear the rainfall from the next room so I guess people who would make real noise in the room would be heard from the person taking shower But I was alone , Everything was fine nothing to really complain with 
251916,TheWesley, Ok so the website said this was marked down from 248 or similar to 99 If I was charged 248 I would have been furious The main lights in the room and bathroom didn t turn on so I just had lamps This made the bathroom quite dangerous to be honest The room was dusty and I mean no ones dusted for days dusty not just a bit had settled in a day I m not being a snob I d call this dirty The mirror on the desk had what looked like part of a sneeze on it The bottle of water on the desk had bits floating around in it The air con is centrally controlled so even though I was boiling already the heat kicked on at about 9pm and stayed on until sometime in the night I opened the window but then had to deal with noise I should have been able to turn off the heat surely I reckon the booking com site give false initial prices because this was no 248 room I would pay hostel prices at best maybe up to 50 but will never go here again Keep searching there are better hotels nearby , The best experience of the staff was the gentleman at the front desk who let me stash my luggage for a few hours whilst I went to my meeting The woman who was on reception when I arrived seemed nervous and was distracted and the girl who brought my dinner up from room service forgot items and had to come back and was awkward basically stayed silent whilst delivering the tray of food 
251917,TheWesley, ramp to pull the luggage between the main door and lobby reception, location the distance to tube station was very good staff was very friendly and helpful
251918,TheWesley, Toilet blocked easily bed creaked stains on carpet tiny tv screen with limited channels iron but had to ask for ironing board just felt like a hostel in the room and not a hotel,No Positive
251919,TheWesley, the room felt really outdated window looked at a wall and was claustrophobic like there wasn t enough air shabby rug outdated everything location was super boring nothing around except the metro price was just so high for what you get really didn t seem like a 4 star was fine for a night but pretty meh, restaurant was yummy wish i could have had room service had to go downstairs to order but the food was really nice staff was very nice was convenient to get to euston station 
251920,TheWesley, The hotel used to have a restaurant that served an amazing deluxe egg breakfast sadly they no longer have it and now offer a buffet style breakfast I would have preferred the older option but it did not impact the stay overall , I enjoyed my stay this is my second visit so I think that speaks volumes about this wonderful hotel 
251921,TheWesley, There were two old staff sitting front of the internet sign They were not feiendly refused to answer my question about location , Very confortable and large rooms Clean Easy acces to the airport Excellent breakfast delicious salmon fish 
251922,TheWesley,No Negative, We were upgraded on arrival to a superior room so ratings reflect this as I suspect we had a bigger bed than standard and it made the stay seem better value for money The room was very well furnished and tasteful Staff were really friendly and attentive Breakfast lovely we just had pastries but lots more available The breakfast room had modern decor and a nice atmosphere 
251923,TheWesley,No Negative, Super friendly stuff I came much much earlier than their check in time but they found free room and checked me in Great location close to Euston train station and to Euston Square tube station 
251924,TheWesley, Extra charge for cooked breakfast already paid for breakfast with booking but on arrival to restaurant informed would be another 5 for hot food This was not mentioned anywhere on booking com nor hotel website Highly misleading and unnecessary I don t mind paying but why charge people twice, Good location staff very professional room clean and bright 
251925,TheWesley, Hotel Without Lobby there is a small sitting area in the underground floor Small Standard Double Room compared to price Very slow Elevator Broken Elevator Buttons Broken Safe,No Positive
251926,TheWesley,No Negative, My room was tidy and clean and the daily cleaning service is a real added value in London All the receptionists were friendly and tried to make me feel comfortable Both the classic sweet breakfast and the traditional british breakfast were tasty and the service was fast it took 5 minutes to have the complete traditional breakfast Surprisingly the breakfast mushroom is the best I ever tried in London The location is functional it is near to two different underground stations 0 1 miles away from Euston Station Central Victoria Northern lines and 0 1 miles away from Euston square station Hammersmith City line 
251927,TheWesley, We were at the rear of the property 116 and noise was present during the whole stay from a large fan or ventilation system Difficult to get to sleep A quieter room would be essential for a second visit , Extremely friendly and obliging reception staff willing to book taxis and hold luggage A full English breakfast was available although we were told by email that this facility had been withdrawn 
251928,TheWesley, The room is too small One light is broken and the air conditioner doesn t work We called the staff but no one came to fix it , Location is good 
251929,TheWesley, Slightly larger shower so I could use it properly and advance notice of the local parking costs we did request this but didn t get an answer the charge at Euston for 2 days was quite a shock, The bed was far too soft and bouncy for my comfort but it was clean and a good size Shower was really good just very cramped
251930,TheWesley,No Negative, It was a real good bed and very clean room Breakfast was promised on line and in all the publicity for this hotel to be a full English one but only 1 week before our arrival there was communicated that the breakfast would be continental and that s a pity This is not correct The restaurant of this hotel however is a TOP restaurant and we recommend it to all visitors of London
251931,TheWesley,No Negative, Bed and pillows comfortable Looked out on a brick wall and noisy enclosure Booking in was poor Invoice was different by 30 to what reception wanted to charge Eventually sorted On the whole quite good 
251932,TheWesley, The room we were given had no natural light at all It felt like we were staying in a dungeon Breakfast was very overpriced There was little choice for people having to avoid gluten in their diet The hotel is poor compared to what it was like just a couple of years ago Having stayed at The Wesley a number of times in the past when it was a much better offer we ve decided to stay elsewhere on our visits to London from now on ,No Positive
251933,TheWesley, Having paid for a full English breakfast for each of my family I was then charged an additional 5 each due to an incorrect entry on your website, The location was very good Staff were also excellent
251934,TheWesley, Sound insulation sub optimal the room door has a gap at the bottom so you hear people talking in the corridor very well and the light shines through Our room was next to the elevator which produces a subway like rumbling that can be heard well in the room , Good continental breakfast nicely furnished bath and room 
251935,TheWesley, Breakfast was expensive so we didn t include it in our booking however just around the corner an excellent breakfast place for only 5 50 Not really a negative just a tip , Reasonable in all aspects lovely stay 
251936,TheWesley, Booked then got an email saying breakfast was downgraded from full to continental really for a 209 night they could have sucked up the 5 Shower thermostat broken so switched constantly cold to hot flag outside the building slapped on the window all night Street outside full of druggies and aggressive people begging for money Bar empty totally and lifeless ,No Positive
251937,TheWesley, Room cold no heating adjustment Bed too big for floor space, Excellent meal in restaurant Good staff well kept decorations Convenient to station
251938,TheWesley, i booked this hotel the full breakfast was included in my booking list early for 2weeks i when i was arrived in hotel staying for 4days from 7th March 11th March i had very bad experience when i had breakfast in this hotel not only for the food is OKAY one thing misunderstanding between booking com and Whesly hotel to be customer i was very sad the thing is when i booked this hotel the full breakfast was included in my booking list early for 2weeks the hotel staff told me it was booking com issue full breakfast was excluded just normal food in the morning i asked it for 1st day 2nd day until 3rd day the staff gave the feedback is if i want to have full breakfast i should pay 5 pound to hotel first and ask for my money back from booking com i was shocked the answer was not very professional thing when hotel took off their responisbliity i will never ever book this hotel again , the room is clean up the bed is comfortable and room is large the location of hotel is very good 
251939,TheWesley, Just slightly aged overall appearance e g Old toilet seat which moved around cupboards worn around handles Nothing worth worrying about though , Comfortable bed friendly staff and were happy to look after bags for the day Good tea coffee in room 
251940,TheWesley, My only fault was the room was a bit to warm even with the air con but better warm than cold every time , The room was very clean and a very comfy bed It was very quiet spot on 
251941,TheWesley, No view very loud at 2 3am when the bar restaurant is dumping empty bottles into the trash bins in the alley Could here the loud sounds of people chatting while smoking outside the bar at 2am, Location is excellent Close to shops underground etc 
251942,TheWesley, We were both disappointed by the breakfasts when a hotel says breakfast included I expect a cooked breakfast option I certainly don t expect to have to pay extra for one The continental breakfast was marred by the penny pinching butter portions I wonder how much return business you lose to save pennies the organisation was also poor e g You ran out of eggs which I reported but there were still no eggs 15min later We last visited the Wesley some years ago when the shower leaked badly which we reported exactly the same happened this time I noted that the bottom of the door frame had rotted because of the on going problem The staff kindly organised an alternative room We won t be returning to the Wesley I m sorry to say , Hotel location is a great attraction easy access to Euston 
251943,TheWesley, Very disappointed with the breakfast Your description stated a breakfast it didn t say a continental breakfast I had to pay a further 5 on top of the cost I paid with my accommodation breakfast There are restaurants on the same road providing a full english breakfast at a reasonable price , The rooms are small but compact light and modern Will stay at the Wesley again Staff are very helpful 
251944,TheWesley, I thought I had paid for breakfast when booking but not clear as it was only continental which admittedly was a nice spread but I have to pay and extra 5 for cooked breakfast as it described it as buffet and last time I visited the cooked was a buffet so misleading when I ordered the breakfast it was very nice farm quality produce and better than he old buffet selection, Clean friendly staff and very helpful rooms modern and well equipped
251945,TheWesley, the beds arent my type too soft shower water not mixing well hot cold fluctuant the room is too cold and the heating is centrally controlled, good location good stuffs attitude
251946,TheWesley,No Negative, I was surprised to see that the room was very spacious The bed was lovely and comfortable enabling us to have a great nights sleep The hotel is located in a prime location with easy access to underground and bars restaurants within short walking distance 
251947,TheWesley, Terrible service from the hotel staff Breakfast was served on the bar Room was not clean and lacked enough towels which I asked for more but never got them , Location
251948,TheWesley, The air conditioning didn t work during all the stay In the room there were only 15 Celsius degrees The Staff instead to propose us to change the room they have proposed us a mobile and little heater Result my partner and I got sick The Staff was not very friendly ,No Positive
251949,TheWesley, Waitress was not very welcoming Some of the food looked like it had been sitting there a while Very little choice , The decor was nice and the coffee was good 
251950,TheWesley, Room temp air con system didn t work room was constantly 18 degrees Shower wouldnt stay at one temperature went from boiling hot to freezing cold continuously Rooms were not soundproofed so noise from other rooms outside kept me awake Staff were unhelpful and wouldn t move me to a room with heating Paid in advance for breakfast only to be told we had to pay again we didn t One of the worst hotels i ve stayed in , Nothing other than the fact it was close to the station
251951,TheWesley, room did not appear to be sound proof as I could hear the room below, location and I was given the room early breakfast was fresh and tasty and staff were very friendly and helpful 
251952,TheWesley,No Negative, Lovely helpful staff very clean excellent room for the night Free wifi Food was very good in the Savannah bar Really close to Euston Station Great hotel 
251953,TheWesley, Small TV s and the fact that the large double beds were two singles pushed together leaving that awkward crack down the middle , Modern rooms comfortable mattress located close to Euston
251954,TheWesley, My partner pointed out the mouldy break to a member of staff They acted immediately which was good Breakfast choice was ok , Warm croissant excellent Nice modern feel about the hotel 
251955,TheWesley, One bed in the twin room was not comfortable and squeaked , Rooms were very clean and room service was very quick Location was good wrt access to other amenities etc
251956,TheWesley, The rooms were a bit cold as the air conditioning was centrally controlled Not a bad but I thought I should mention Also should the narrator option on the TV should be available to non blind guests , Great location Euston Station is just a few minutes walking distance Very central The rooms aren t too big but make them very cosy The beds are just fantastic 
251957,TheWesley, my room and bathroom were very cold They gave me another room and in the second room nice and warm , Great location very clean modern friendly staff 
251958,TheWesley, The bed was larger than necessary for two people It took up a bit too much space in the room, Staff extremely friendly and helpful Hotel was clean and modern Location can t be beat 
251959,TheWesley, I stayed here 3 or 4 times in the past with satisfaction but this time room keeping wasn t good The TV controller did not work The room safe did not have correct instruction and the front desk staff could not mend Coffee milk and biscuits were not properly refilled , Location is very good Close to Euston Square metro station and Euston station Large and comfy bed Well heated room Excellent value for money 
251960,TheWesley, The room was a quite small The lift was a bit claustrophobic , Modern hotel Staff very helpful and efficient Nice healthy breakfast selection Great firm mattress 
251961,TheWesley, The main issue was the noise in the lower rooms you can here the underground clearly when it starts around 4 30 , The Staff were excellent really helpful The location is great as it is easy to get anywhere in London The price was ok 
251962,TheWesley, Somebody was sick in the coridor from the next room to us unfortunately it was really awful to walk through the sick and be able to smell it in our room The puke stayed there all night and looked awful The rooms could be a little bigger and the view through the window to the office wasnt nice because i felt like somebody were able to see me , Modern rooms and clean Nice size bed 
251963,TheWesley, Breakbest is not worthy at all cant be 10quids and it s ridiculous that they charge extra 5pounds if you want full english breakfast , Big bed nide and comfy room
251964,TheWesley, could be cleaner bathroom corners behind sink paint works change carpet in the whole hotel As a interior designer I believe that with minor changes in the hotel it could have more value and luxury Due to a delay we arrived a night later then booked As the rules are you have to pay for this night without staying fair enough However it would be a great service of the hotel to offer you an upgrade or extra s The Wesley didn t offer anything nor the staff mentioned anything about this Staff is correct but not by heart It felt like you were just the next visitor not really personal although it s not a huge hotel , The room was okay good beds Location is good on a quiet road and just a few minutes from Euston Underground station 
251965,TheWesley, There was nothing we didn t like perfect for what we wanted , Nothing was too much trouble we asked for extra blankets and another quilt was brought promptly 
251966,TheWesley, Reception staff unable to help a lot with directions via buses underground , Room basic but comfy bed clean bathroom amenities Friendly staff Good location near Euston station 
251967,TheWesley, Bed was two singles together which was annoying Price was a little on the high side, Excellent location Superior room was a good size Very clean Late check out was no problem Staff arranged for pizza delivery when room service was finished Had a really great stay in The Wesley
251968,TheWesley, The bed in the superior room wasn t comfortable and water dropped from the ceiling when the shower was on The breakfast was terrible , The location
251969,TheWesley, Breakfast was poor value for money 14 99 for continental breakfast with limited choices or upgrade for 5 each to get a small amount of cooked breakfast Certainly did not receive 40 worth of food in total , Comfy bed great location friendly staff and very modern 
251970,TheWesley, Awful breakfast fake window in bathroom I was upgraded to a disabled friendly room but it was impractical bed was ok it just very basic but pictures made it look nicer Room also pretty small , Good location
251971,TheWesley, Used to be free full english in the price Now moved to continental breakfast with a 5 charge if you require FE If you get a ground floor Junior Suite you hear and feel the rumble of the underground Guess there is not much they can do about tit though , Good location near to tube and train links not near a busy road good local pubs and restaurants near by Rooms clean and well equipped 
251972,TheWesley,No Negative, The staff are very friendly and helpful There was a problem with the heating in our room They switched our room Lovely hotel all amendities available and the location is ideal
251973,TheWesley, Room tiny and freezing Heating didn t work had to get portable heaters bed was 2 singles joined together Supposed superior room would hate to see standard 2 mins late for breakfast but offered nothing , Very little but staff very friendly
251974,TheWesley, Noticed hairs on the bathroom floor toilet wasn t flushed noisy neighbourhood or bad soundproofing room was heated through a noisy air conditioner , Decent wi fi staff was amicable comfortable bed nice toiletries
251975,TheWesley, Hotel is cold and humid both in the room and in the restaurant Every night I had to ask them to start the air warming which is centrally controlled and could not be activated from my room on my own My window had only heavy plastic curtains I had a vintage bed with vintage springs under the mattress Room floors have very narrow corridors The restaurant is too highly priced for the level of kitchen they have and for the little portion you get in your dish Positive note food is fresh and this is the most important thing , Hotel close to both Euston Square Metro station 2 lines and Euston train station 1 line Staff is very friendly and helpful always available to listen and help without putting you in a hurry This is a plus 
251976,TheWesley, First I was givem the room on the top floor which is not the one as advertised in the picture smaller and outdated The girl at the reception refused to change so I had to sleep the first night there In the morning the staff was much nicier and changed the room to a modern one, Good location for overnight stay who travels from Euston
251977,TheWesley, not much my colleagues room had an elec fault so changed rooms , all very good comfy room warm savannah restaurant food was excellent very good quality literally 2 min walk from Euston very handy 30 seconds walk from euston square tube 
251978,TheWesley, Wouldn t change anything, Perfect room in a perfect location The hotel s in walking distance of Euston St Pancras and Kings Cross Station and Regents park is just down the street The reception staff were lovely as were the bar staff Food from the bar was really nice and super convenient when it was too cold to go out Would stay here again for sure 
251979,TheWesley, Can t complain about anything regarding our stay at the Wesley Clean and modern room with great facilities including a very comfortable Queen size bed and a very decent shower , Great location 15min walk to shaftsbury theatre and 15mins walk the opposite direction to Camden market 300m from train and bus station too 
251980,TheWesley, I was woken up two different night by the fire alarm in the middle of the night The staff told sus that it was because of people having steamy showers Totally unacceptable The rooms are tiny and claustrophobic The walls are thin and so it s pretty noisy , The location was convenient because it s close to Euston Square where my training took place It s also walking distance to Kings Cross station which is one of the main hubs in London
251981,TheWesley, staff Reception forgot to give me the passport back We found it the next day still in the copy machine , I got an upgrade to a bigger room because none of the type of rooms I have booked were available very clean hotel and very comfortable bed 
251982,TheWesley, Between 7 00pm and 10 00pm I rang the restaurant six times attempting to order some room service food The phone was not answered once I therefore had to order a takeaway and I would have much preferred the Room Service This has happened at least three times during my last four visits so I m assuming the restaurant is short staffed and they were prioritising the actual customers in the restaurant It s a shame as the restaurant lost 50 of business and the waiter lost a 5 tip , I ve visited this hotel many times It is excellent value for money with comfortable beds and well appointed rooms The bathroom had a great shower and it was pristine The customer service provided by Reception is always of a high standard 
251983,TheWesley, In executive room to sleep 3 3rd bed was temporary folding bed Full sized single bed would have been preferred , So easy to drive in to London park car on Euston station car park and walk with hand luggage to hotel in 5 mins
251984,TheWesley, Breakfast was quite basic A warm english breakfast costs 5pounds extra rooms very noise no sound proof at all bed out of 3 matraces very uncomfortable, was very clean free drinking water in the room and a tea making facilities clean and good bathroom iron and bathing stuff in the room 
251985,TheWesley, The noise was awful from the street below all through the night meaning I had a terrible sleep and woke constantly The double glazed windows are from the 70s and not fit for purpose at all and no bath option , So very central for business and just a stones throw from Euston station 
251986,TheWesley, I was allergic to the strong cleaning products I could barely breath and had to check out without refund Staff were nice but couldn t refund me Waste of 138 , Modern Friendly staff 
251987,TheWesley, The breakfast was terrible however you can upgrade for 5 and get a full english I recommend you do that , We had a great stay at The Wesley Staff were so helpful and super friendly and the room was very clean comfy beds amazing shower all in all a very enjoyable stay 
251988,TheWesley, Internet did not work properly Although there was no password required it kept asking me for one I needed to sit in the lobby where for some reason there was no password required for the same network Receptionist was nice but could not help She said that others had experienced the same issues , Very close to Euston station comfortable and reasonably clean Breakfast good as well Very nice staff member reception 
251989,TheWesley, The temperature in the room was centrally controled meaning that I was unable to adjust the room temperature and had a ask reception to do so , Ideal location for anyone needing to leave from Euston in the early morning Staff were very friendly and accomandating to our needs 
251990,TheWesley, Being so near to Euston you do get a gentle rumble from the trains through not in a distracting way , very convenient friendly professional and easy Like their sustainability and eco awards Room furniture was good quality and in great condition
251991,TheWesley, The bathroom was made for a thin short person I am normal build so got in and out again hence I am able to write about this but I am not short and the toilet was so close to the wall that anyone above average height would scrape their knees on it The boiler broke while I was there and so there was no hot water for a morning shower Initially I was a bit miffed about this but the staff were so lovely I couldn t stay cross for long and they did their best to keep everyone happy and clean by offering alternative rooms as the water came back on The breakfast was not good however very uninspiring and the staff in the bar weren t anywhere near as friendly as those on reception , The room a superior double was big and the bed was very comfortable There were blackout blinds on the window which is my current favourite thing in any city hotel where light can come in The staff were really friendly and helpful The location for Euston couldn t be better but my room was pretty quiet more noise from the air con unit which was off so don t know why than anything else but nothing to worry about 
251992,TheWesley, Bed was hard and uncomfortable Shower was cold complaints by other guests too Fuss over booking of breakfast costs No vegetarian sausages , Location
251993,TheWesley, The room was very cold and the heating didn t seem to do too much a great deal The refillable water bottle provided by the hotel had MOULD LIMESCALE on the inside of the lid and the staff didn t seem to bothered The room was way too light to sleep in at night due to some green lighting coming from the front of the building Wouldn t stay again , We have enjoyed the location of the hotel as it was very close to many restaurants and the tube station 
251994,TheWesley,No Negative, Very clean and nice place They were the best receptionists I have ever had And It was located very close to Euston station making it easy to travel anywhere in England 
251995,TheWesley,No Negative, The location was excellent with great facilities and extremely helpful courteous staff There wasn t a car park but if I couldn t park outside I could park at Euston station with reasonable charges which was only a 2 minute walk away As it was a Saturday overnight stay I managed to park outside It s also only a 5 10 minute walk to Camden high street Great hotel 
251996,TheWesley, Wish they had mentioned that the breakfast was continental before booking It was a disappointment The 5 surcharge for a cooked breakfast was fine but again no notification until you were in the breakfast room , The location so close to Euston Station was ideal Every member of staff was very friendly and helpful Very clean and comfortable bed 
251997,TheWesley, Booked through booking com our original room offered looked nothing like the one shown nor the hotels website I think the hotel was not worth the 100 as we had problems with the room as the heating was not working and had to call for assistance serveral times until moving rooms , Location was good as it was close to Euston station The staff were kind enough to offer complimentary breakfast and willing to change our room twice when we weren t happy as had problems with heating We were also given a 10 discount
251998,TheWesley, The bed was two mattresses as opposed to one This proved to be uncomfortable The only thing that was an issue for me , Very friendly staff Excellent location in relation to Euston Station Very clean room and facilities 
251999,TheWesley,No Negative, I liked the cleanliness of the rooms Although they are small they are perfectly fit for purpose I liked that I had an good Iron and Ironing board so many hotels overlook this 
252000,TheWesley, Rooms are small , Clean modern refit really close walk to Euston station extremely quiet very comfortable bed and a smart restaurant Very positive surprise experience 
252001,TheWesley, Some areas need maintenance access to elevator and the lift itself and the rooms were cold despite the AC , The staff was very attentive proactive and friendly absolutely great professionals The hotel is very close to London Euston and that was very helpful to us Gower Street which you will know as Baker Street is just around the corner 
252002,TheWesley, The bathroom was really cold the outer window had been left open and then the inner window wouldn t fully close Couldn t get the towel radiator to work bedside cabinet was partly blocking the bathroom door carpet grubby round the edges especially around bathroom door Kettle didn t work would boil but didn t stop boiling until it was turned off bedroom much smaller than the online photos suggest for a standard double Room had a very musty smell when we arrived red stains all down the side of the bed bottom right , Location was excellent close to Euston Staff were helpful had a room ready 2 hours before check in and were happy to move us when we realised we d been given an accessible room which we didn t need Staff were always smiling 
252003,TheWesley, The room didn t have a window It had a window but when we tried to open it here didn t seem to be anything there Also the room walls were very thin and we could hear a lot of noise , The location was perfect for euston and for the price per night it was all we needed Room was clean and modern decor 
252004,TheWesley, Room temperature is up to 20 maximum in the Jan we called Front Desk to adjust and been told to give time to warm up but it didn t work room is cold , Bed is comfortable location is okay 
252005,TheWesley, Breakfast could have been better Included in the booking com breakfast rate was continental breakfast and not english breakfast , Comfortable bed Staff were efficient and helpful 
252006,TheWesley, Bed felt a bit like a fold up camp bed a cheap and shallow mattress Specifically booked this hotel with breakfast However breakfast selection was very limited unless you wanted to pay extra for something hot such as an English breakfast didn t expect that , Clean modern rooms Friendly reception staff 
252007,TheWesley, Room is a bit small Hot shower is irregular Has sudden spur of cold water , Location is next to train station Yet quiet street Room is clean and new Has complimentry drinking water Has kettle with free coffee tea and hot chocolate Helpful reception Gave me free checkout at 12 noon On arrival help me to store luggage till 2pm check in time 
252008,TheWesley, tv could not be seen from the bed 4 plug sockets and heater not working so room was cold fault with electrical system but not fixed while I was there , 3min walk from Euston large room clean modern nice staff assuming electrical problem is fixed I would stay again
252009,TheWesley,No Negative, Reception was very helpful with my hand laguage while I was carrying my 4 month old baby Room service took only 10 15min to cook fresh meal and the meal was excellent worse of money Room was very comfortable for myself and baby The hotel is very close to Euston train station I would recommend it Thank you 
252010,TheWesley, First morning house keeping knocked at 8 30am and we were still asleep Bit early We put the do not disturb sign out the other days A little noisy , Comfy bed and great shower Excellent location 
252011,TheWesley, I travelled for a very important exam a night spend in peace Kept waking up falling towards right side 5 am in morning disgnosed the problem it wasnt me waking in stress it was bed tilted on right side i think it was worn down mattress it was too late to complain or get replaced , Everything other than bed
252012,TheWesley, The bed was uncomfortable and the room itself was quite small, Location was perfect right by the station so easy to get anywhere The front desk staff were super helpful I forgot to get the name of the lady that helped us put our bags away the night before we checked out but she was so lovely and easy to deal with so thank you
252013,TheWesley, The breakfast was not good as had no variety furthermore the staff at the breakfast were not helpful and not friendly , The proximity of the hotel to the station The staff at Reception were kind and helpful
252014,TheWesley, A minor point but tube trains could be heard in the room although they were not obtrusive , The staff were very friendly and helpful The room was clean and well equipped as was the bathroom The bed was comfortable The breakfast service was speedy with a good selection 
252015,TheWesley, a fridge in the room would have been helpful but apart from that was good value, fantastic location next to Euston station rooms are modern clean and staff are helpful
252016,TheWesley, We have chosen TheWesley because of its good position to reach Harry Potter Studios but we won t suggest this place We booked in advance but when we arrived at night the staff couldn t find our reservation and the hotel was fully booked not really a good experience Then the staff gave us the last room left that was for disabled without any information and we had some difficulties in using a bathroom without a proper shower Even if the staff apologized for the inconvenience the manager was very rude ,No Positive
252017,TheWesley, Breakfast has changed making hot items ordered charged separately rather than part of the buffet like they were before , Perfect location a quiet street right next to Euston station 
252018,TheWesley, I didn t like the fact that I got robbed while we were waiting for our taxi back to the airport right outside the hotel entrance by 2 guys on a motorbike who drove into me before stealing my phone That spoiled what was an otherwise really nice experience with the hotel Local Police told me that this is a common thing in this area so it would have been nice if the Police warned hotels tourists about this so the hotels can better protect their guests , The best thing about the hotel is the location It is absolutely perfect for a visitor to be able to walk almost everywhere to see the famous sights and for those less agile there is easy access to public transport The hotel is on a quiet street so there is little or no traffic noise A very convenient and pleasant location 
252019,TheWesley, The walls were a bit thin you could hear footsteps and creaks of both upstairs and downstairs, The room warmed up nicely and the bed was very comfortable
252020,TheWesley, None , This is a quite good hotel It s just next to the Euston Station and underground What I need to mention is that the staff here are so nice and friendly Anytime when I need some help they all solve it quite promptly This is quite a wonderful living experience 
252021,TheWesley, When I selected breakfast for an extra cost within my reservation I expected a cooked breakfast not toast and pastries which I can get anywhere If the website had stated a continental breakfast I would of not bothered as it wasn t great Feel misguided as I ve spent money on a croissants and coffee which where average , Great location tube is super close 
252022,TheWesley, Poor decor of our room The shower tray looked like something had been left to burn on it The flush button on toilet was not clean , The location to Euston Station The ability to be able to leave luggage before and after check in out Able to open the window
252023,TheWesley, The noise from the trains under the hotel the fact that you couldn t watch TV from bed was promised full English breakfast included but then got told had to pay 5 extra each loud booming music from early on Sunday morning , Bed was comfortable
252024,TheWesley, Found nothing wrong during my 5 day stay so that s a good indicator , Quiet room as I had requested the staff organised for an extra lamp to be brought into my room so I could study The location is fabulous 
252025,TheWesley, The room was so tiny The bed was pushed up against one wall and there was a nightstand on the opposite side which blocked 1 2 of the doorway into the bathroom One night the fire alarm went off when we asked what caused it we were told that someone had taken a hot shower and the steam set the alarm off That s a first for me , The Staff was wonderful 
252026,TheWesley, We checked in a little early was offered a disabled guest room rather than have a wait which we accepted nice room huge bed which made the room a little small but was very comfy As with all the rooms i have stayed in the Wesley the view has been awful, The staff were helpful did not have breakfast on this visit but previously did and it was good great location near Euston
252027,TheWesley, Restaurant bar not open as advertised out of stock on premium liquor several days in a row bed uncomfortable handicapped lift blocked by decorations , Friendly staff
252028,TheWesley, Strange and confusing internal layout with several different lift systems servicing different parts of the hotel the way to my room required going up and down approx 12 steps which was very difficult with the luggage I had, Good location near to Euston station
252029,TheWesley, Poor attitude from a staff member Complaint re this has not be acknowledged Not 4 star quality Breakfast was very average and poorly delivered, Great central location
252030,TheWesley, Very noisy room close to an extrrnal electricity cell buzzing loud all the time air conditioning with poor control cheap fixtures very small room poor value for the money spent quite a lot , Location
252031,TheWesley,No Negative, The location was perfect literally 2 minutes walk from Euston station but so quiet and away from the main road Also like the fact that they had nice little touches like biscuits mints bottled water and hot chocolate in the room so many places scrimp on these little things that actually make a big difference 
252032,TheWesley, No room windows so a little claustrophobic but I was offered another room when checking in Breakfast buffet could be a little more diverse , Very clean and modern quiet 
252033,TheWesley, It felt like sleeping in a basement with a small shower toilet facilities even though it was an upgrade to the suite I personally felt that the pictures were taken at a rather advantageous angle , nicely decorated friendly staff good restaurant good location
252034,TheWesley, Some parts of the hotel are looking a bit tired and could do with some TLC decorating general repair, Location Staff very friendly and helpful 
252035,TheWesley, The bed isn t really comfortable too soft same with the pillows , Location is excellent if you re travelling by train also walking distance from Oxford st Small rooms but chic 
252036,TheWesley, It did not feel like a four star hotel but rather like the Methodist hostel turned hotel that it is Fine but not really memorable Was good for a 24 hour stay room adequate but small , This was a great location close to TUBE and the Kings Cross station where we came in from France and out to Heathrow
252037,TheWesley, Had an opaque glass window could not see outside and there was not much natural light Had to wait for quite a long time before I could check in , Excellent location Good wifi connection Clever design which made the room seem bigger and less claustrophobic Very clean 
252038,TheWesley, I had a fixed booking but they nearly charged more fortunately I had not disposed of my booking invoice with correct price , It s close to Euston and if you book in plenty of time there are cheap deals
252039,TheWesley, Had a wet room bathroom not my cup of tea but we were given a room set up for a wheelchair user so impressive that the hotel has these facilities, Location is excellent Efficient staff Clean room
252040,TheWesley, No instructions for heating air con system and apparently no remote control unit either Some noise from rear service area when we opened window but at least we could open the window , Convenient location on fringe of West End with good choice of public transport nearby Very competitive price on a weekend night Free room upgrade to deluxe a bigger room on top floor with king size bed Efficient courteous staff 
252041,TheWesley, Mattress was probably the most uncomfortable thing I ve ever slept on AC for the room was uncontrollable very hot room even with the windows open on the top floor Was fixed within 24 hours , Distance to the train station and tube
252042,TheWesley, The price is really too expensive though I know that it won t change as long as people are willing to pay , It is a very good hotel and a 5 min walk from Euston train station but far enough away and down a back street so it is nice and quiet 
252043,TheWesley, Room was very cold Heater didn t work and the room remained cold all through the night The shower would consistently switch between hot and cold , Staff were pleasant Bathroom was clean
252044,TheWesley, SIngle glazed Window frames are warped so not too quiet but I think they are the original 1930s art deco windows so cannot be replaced , Location is very convenient for tube and overground trains Staff very friendly polite and helpful 
252045,TheWesley, Unfortunately temperature was controlled by the front desk At one point I was cold and had to ring up the reception to get the temperature adjusted but again service was immediately done and I was happy, Raquel and Fatima was brilliant at reception They were thorough and efficient They gave me all the information I needed and made me feel special and important even though there were other customers and I m 100 sure that once the next customer was served they probably felt the exact same way as I did They are credit to the hotel 
252046,TheWesley, The size of the room too small everything was cramped in The room noise from other rooms was woken up by someone snoring The fire alarms going off early morning, The soap shower gel The vicinity to where I needed to work eat play The fact I could leave my bags there on checkout
252047,TheWesley, Not being able to adjust a ridiculously warm room, Far too hot Asked the maintenance people to fix the air conditioning but just wasted 20 minutes for no benefit as he admitted he didn t know what to do Two nights not sleeping
252048,TheWesley, The breakfasts were expensive for the variety of food on offer Also you needed a voucher from the front desk to get a 2 00 discount off the full price of 11 00 We did not eat in for evening meals More cold meats and a wider selection The table arrangements meant that you were often sat very close to other people For all meals all the tables should be set out so that guests can choose where they want to sit After all we were paying 487 00 for our stay The room was supposed to be a superior room but was quite small , The hotel was very clean staff very helpful water always hot Exceptionally convenient for Euston Station from where you can tube trains to anywhere Croissants were tasty and the jams were excellent 
252049,TheWesley, Really small room and tiny double bed we re only slim people but struggled sharing the bed in 109 thin walls very noisy only two portions of milk so could only have one hot drink, Location and comfy matress
252050,TheWesley, We did not have breakfast as we thought it rather expensive at 13 per head , Very helpful staff Lovely modern clean and comfortable rooms Excellent location 2 mins from Euston station and tube so access to all parts of London Will definitely use again when visiting London 
252051,TheWesley, I got a tiny room at the top floor Just some minor details TV view was partially obstructed by a roof beam and phone was not close to the bed , Kind and helpful staff Great breakfast Nice bathroom Clean 
252052,TheWesley, Hate those wall dispensers of body wash shampoo no fridge or water in room, Location close to Euston station and tube comfortable bed very quiet and clean 
252053,TheWesley, Room freezing as window was wide open when I arrived Tried to warm the room as per instructions only to be told hours later when room was still freezing that staff were centrally controlling the room temperature which seemed strange Heard another guest also complaining his room was cold Noise and vibration from underground trains was very noticeable so moved rooms from ground floor to 2nd floor much quieter , Good location and room well equiped
252054,TheWesley, Second day the water they provided had soap in so after taking a glass i could of drank bleach for all i know Bathroom was covered in water marks The hangers were layed out the wrong way making it hard to hang clothes and take them back again No where to store shoes other than a small gap between the safe and wall The hot breakfast was a disappointment as they are kept in heating dishes with lids so all the food is soggy and overcooked Not a chance you will get a runny yoke or a crispy piece of bacon or hash brown , The breakfast selection was excellent and really close to euston station
252055,TheWesley, The room had no natural light no fresh air and the air con was not working The shower was dripping I spent a terrible night not sleeping a wink The breakfast service was terrible I felt the staff were abrupt They forced my room card open to check I was giving them the right room number They were very abrupt in saying I couldn t add it to my room rate but had to pay cash which I didn t mind at all They just had no customer service sense , The man at the front desk was friendly and helpful and quickly let me get back in my room after checking out as I had forgotten something 
252056,TheWesley, Breakfast is often inclusive in the room rate and used to include a choice of individually prepared cooked meals such as Eggs Florentine and Grilled Kippers Alas no longer Only the usual buffet style English breakfast with beans remains as a hot meal Dinner has gone up market and while the standard is high portion sizes are too small to be satisfying without the ubiquitous chips and the prices are now far too high , Large comfortable bed Helpful and caring staff
252057,TheWesley, I had booked a single twin room which was extremely tiny It looked fine at first but I wasn t impressed by the cleanliness of the carpet or the bathrooms also the sink was tiny I think I got the smallest version of a Single room not like the ones in the pictures Then the heating didn t work and I spent the night freezing I had to call them to check it out at 1 am but they couldn t resolve it I had to ask for extra blankets that were not available in the room The bed had no headboard and the window was just above it where i kept brushing my head with the curtain it was too late at night to ask for a room change but I did next morning and the front office gladly gave me an upgrade to a double room and a free breakfast Her name was Fatima She was very nice and took a decision right away The double room I got had a double bed The room was small for a double room but compared to the single it is Heaven So price wise I think it is a bit overpriced for the quality of the facilities, Great location close to different tube and train stations as well as to Tottenham court road which is packed with stores and restaurants It was very close to the college where I had my classes which was a great advantage for me Staff at reception were extra helpful and very attentive to whatever the problem was
252058,TheWesley,No Negative, The staff were friendly and helpful 165 for a superior double was more than i wanted to pay especially as it was room only That said we had nice good sized room which was quiet as requested Just a three minute walk from Euston station the location was perfect for us The bar was excellent and the barman cheery and helpful Had a great espresso martini cheesy chips and onion rings at 10 30pm which rounded off the stay a treat 
252059,TheWesley, The room was a little small , The staff were very friendly and helpful at all times and went out of their way to assist us whenever we asked for help or advice 
252060,TheWesley, Expensive Size of original room , Very comfy bed Good service breakfast I would esp Like to thal Fatima at reception who was very courteous helpful with genuine smile rapidly corrected a mistake with the room gave me a better room 
252061,TheWesley, I was disappointed because the hot buffet was pretty much empty, Great place and excellent service of the reception staff near the underground station and everything is very clean and organized 
252062,TheWesley, The room was located towards an inner yard which is ok but it had milky glass windows which is strange during the day Opening the windows revealed an ugly inner yard with a lot of garbage The room was chilly the heating did not seem to work Worst the rumbling sound of the underground trains went through the room every few minutes until late at night and from 5 in the morning , Convenient location close to Euston train and underground station Very friendly staff at reception and at breakfast Nice large room jubilee suite with sofa and table 
252063,TheWesley, The single bedroom was just too small The foyer was too small with only one sofa given the number of meetings that happen there There is no comfortable lounge bar area I would like granola blue berries as a breakfast option ,No Positive
252064,TheWesley, Very overpriced Paid for an upgraded room which was still small and I cannot actually see what the upgrade was supposed to be Upon arrival the girl on reception never smiled once Carpets were stained throughout The TV was round a corner out of view from the bed so you had to sit on a chair in front of the TV in order to see it which was very uncomfortable when we had had a long jpurney and just wanted to chill in bed watching TV this was not at all possible given the room layout The double bed was 2 singles pushed together so highly uncomfortable especially in the middle near where the beds were joined Very noisy all night due to trains and tubes going past all night had very broken sleep so was subsequently tired the next day which was a big deal given that I had an exam in London Paid 13 for breakfast very little choice When I asked for porridge I was informed there would be an additional charge which I found ridiculous given that I had paid 13 This would have been a very expensive bowl of porridge had I have paid The room was cold with no option of self controlling the room temperature and no radiator in the room Overall I paid over 200 for a hotel which was no better than a 2 star Very disappointed , Great location
252065,TheWesley, Disabled facilities room we should know about our room earlier Funny smell in the room , It was our second time when we stayed here Location is perfect and staff lovely but we had disabled facilities room which we didn t booknow so I feel a bit weird in the bathroom Reception tried to help us with room swap but they were fully booked so we had to stay in that room 
252066,TheWesley, The WiFi coverage is a joke If the hotel wants to provide free internet that doesn t work better not provide it in the first place , Convenient location for travelers through Euston clean rooms 
252067,TheWesley, in the room i had 302 the window wouldnt parcially open it completely opened so i had to keep it shut luckily they changed my room from the original one that had the noisy pipes outside bur next time i d prefer a room like 302 with windows that parcially open the bottle with the water nearly breaks your hands trying to open it, no problems nice and near eustonn station 
252068,TheWesley, the room is sealed no chance to open the window a bit claustrophobic the room is quite small but that is London , Location and person at the check in
252069,TheWesley, If there s was 1 thing I would change it would be a bit more variety for room service, From arrival to check out could not fault staff very helpful and friendly Especially at breakfast they couldn t do enough for you Facilities just perfect room very clean nicely decorated It s just been fab thanks xx
252070,TheWesley, The room was BOILING HOT I had the a c on the coolest setting and it was still too hot This negated any other good elements because the sleep was terrible , Clean comfortable etc 
252071,TheWesley, There was nothing at all to criticise, The staff were exceptionally friendly and because our room wasn t ready we were upgraded The suite was beautiful and very clean Would highly recommend the hotel 
252072,TheWesley, Very minor thing teabags in the room were poor quality not great taste and I m sure if I had asked I could have got fresh milk but made do with the UHT , Staff were so polite and friendly Helpful and humble I had a single room which was very clean and kitted out with all the basics My room was super quiet a surprise for me for London We ate in the restaurant corporate event and the food was delicious altho lacking overall in vegetables 
252073,TheWesley, The corridors in the hotel let it down a little but that s me being a little picky , Excellent location We got to the hotel about 12pm and we were able to check in which was fantastic Room was really clean and modern The shower was very nice also 
252074,TheWesley, The shower controls were confusing would have liked instructions , Great location and friendly staff Breakfast was great lots of choices and excellent coffee 
252075,TheWesley, Nothing, Location Room and facilities were all first class Previously I have had breakfast there and though it to be excellent This time we had business and ate out for brunch We will stay again
252076,TheWesley, The TV was flat screen but very small didn t work and was in a very inconvenient place The view was awful and there was a continuous exhaust sound coming from the window , The bed was very comfortable The room was a good size too 
252077,TheWesley, the weather, everything about the place was a enjoyable evening and really comfortably room nice shower lovely big bed great area every thing was just around the corner and a nice little pub not to far away 
252078,TheWesley, There was only a small gap between bed and wall about 10 in our superior room , A very comfortable hotel with great staff and remarkably quiet It was very clean with adequate tea and coffee facilities 
252079,TheWesley, No problems really Took a couple of calls to get through to room service but that s it , Good size room very comfortable with large shower room and large wardrobe I had no issues with noise from outside or other guests Paid a few quid more than a different hotel in same location but this was a lot better Excellent location if you want to be near Euston too 
252080,TheWesley, Nothing really a great stay thank you Maybe your payment system if I am being really pedantic as I have given my bank details x4 times for 1 nights stay which is a little alarming but other than that a great experience and I will use you again for sure Regards, Great facilities really friendly staff and perfect location
252081,TheWesley, Just a small comment The room was excellent but because of the kingside bed there was very little space between bed and walls Everything else was perfect , Great welcome on arrival Just two minutes from Euston railway station so no extra transfer costs an easy walk 
252082,TheWesley, It took me a while to figure out how to work the lights my fault You need to put your keycard in a holder hear the door to signal to the system you re in the room Food onsite a bit pricey , Very comfortable bed all amenities provided great location right next to Euston station and within walking distance to the British Museum Covent Garden and South Bank Exceptional value when found on sale I got it for 75 night for a single room Great value 
252083,TheWesley, The bathroom is interior and so ventilation is a small problem , A simple but clean hotel with rooms that while not large were comfortable and practical Excellent value for money Staff were excellent 
252084,TheWesley, Room was small No storage drawers , Good shower Tea coffee tray replenished with biscuits each day Comfortable beds Effective yet quiet a c Closedown Euston station 
252085,TheWesley, Whilst breakfast is served until 11 a m some of the food runs out later on and is not readily replenished , The location in the close vicinity to the Euston train station It is easy to walk everywhere and the tube and buses are on the doorstep for moving around the city 
252086,TheWesley, There was a lack of communication between reception staff and maintenance men fixing a plumbing problem Front desk weren t aware they shouldn t have been checking people into certain rooms , There was a plumbing problem with the room we were given and we were upgraded to a suite which was very nice Comfortable bed Aircon very welcome as it was hottest couple of days so fsr this summer Excellent breakfast Location very near Euston station was good Also Regents Park for the zoo 
252087,TheWesley, Didn t like hearing the tube rumbling every 2 mins underneath us for several hours while trying to sleep, Close to where we wanted to be and was very modern and comfortable
252088,TheWesley,No Negative, Couldnt fault it at all Excellent room very helpful and well mannered staff excellent food We were made welcome from the very start and that carried on through the 3 days we were there 
252089,TheWesley,No Negative, Excellent location for London sightseeing Very friendly and helpful staff Clean room with everything you need Loads of choice at breakfast Highly recommended
252090,TheWesley,No Negative, Nice renovated bedroom with confortable bathroom and big shower Great breakfast and friendly staff Totally worth the money above all comparing with other hotels in London It is located in the universitary area quiet location close to Gower st with London college and beautiful english buildings 
252091,TheWesley, One of our joined rooms had to have its carpet cleaned this was damp for a full day and room smelt for the weekend This was due to last occupants and a potential drainage problem that appeared to be associated with this room On departure we recommended the room not to be used due to carpet continuing smell We did get our breakfasts meal free for 2 days without even asking , Location to Euston station 
252092,TheWesley, everything far to much to mention, apart from the friendly and helpful young lady at reception there was nothing at all to like the room was like a cell completely charmless that looked out on to a drab concrete office block witch was only about 15f away which meant curtains had to be closed all the time
252093,TheWesley,No Negative, Pleasant helpful front desk staff Spotlessly clean Very quiet for this part of London apart from the gentle rumble of the occasional passing tube train A hotel that is run as a social enterprise You don t get better than that 
252094,TheWesley, Very small room for the price and noisy with the tubes running below hotel if on ground floor Carpet and chair in the room was very stained , Staff very friendly and helpful Great location right next to Euston station 
252095,TheWesley, It was a little noisy other guests but I always have earplugs with me, Great location clean bedroom and bathroom very comfy bed pleasant staff no stress
252096,TheWesley, No drawers or proper shelves for clothes Just hangers And WiFi kept cutting out in the room although it was good in other areas May have been the particular room we were in Anyway loads of free WiFi in London including all around adjacent Euston station , Terrific location Air conditioning was great and definitely necessary in August Room was comfy and quite large for the price and shower was fantastic Especially loved the H2K products Really good buffet breakfast with both cooked English and Continental Attentive and pleasant staff 
252097,TheWesley, Our room had no window and I didn t like that at all Be aware if this is an important thing for you because they have rooms like that Beside this it was a nice hotel and I would recommend it , The hotel has a great location from my point a view staff is friendly 
252098,TheWesley, The surounding area is a bit shabby and rundown , The reception staff were exceptionally polite and efficient The room was spotlessly clean and comfortable And the location is fantastic for a rail traveller only 500 yards from Euston Station 
252099,TheWesley, Nothing of any significance, Very clean bright and modern feel Staff very helpful and friendly Within easy walking distance of Euston Station Ideal for train arrivals Would recommend
252100,TheWesley, Don t think I can think of anything haha, Very good location very clean rooms are a good size and the beds are extremely comfy and overall very good value for money
252101,TheWesley, 1 The cleaner was still making the first room we were given When we went back to the reception they gave us an upgrade 2 The walls are paper thin you can hear the shower from next door , 1 Excellent location 2 Attentive staff 3 Comfortable bed 4 Decent breakfast
252102,TheWesley, Sound isolation is poor Towers are old and gray Room size is smaller than expectation not good for international traverler Shower room lack of maintenance and not seal the water well , Location is great Breakfast is simple but good
252103,TheWesley, Nothing , Easy to get to Pleasant and helpful staff Made to feel welcome straight away Bedroom very comfortable and it had everything I needed to make my stay comfortable and ready for my business day There were even two irons 
252104,TheWesley, Restaurant staff in evening quite dismissive All I wanted was a spoon and bowl Homeless man sleeping outside our window , Restaurant staff at breakfast super friendly Very convenient location for Euston station and north central London 
252105,TheWesley, Nothing, I liked everything about this hotel we will definitely stay there again It was clean with a comfortable bed and everything you need in a hotel room Location was fabulous with a 24 hour reception and you could leave your luggage there on the last day 
252106,TheWesley,No Negative, The staff were friendly rooms were very clean Very impressed we could leave our over night luggage at the hotel securely for the day so we could look around London with out carrying all our stuff Worth the money 
252107,TheWesley, Not easy to find in the dark on a Sunday evening No one around to ask , Easy access to Euston and so many sights Warm welcome and nice decor Surprised that ore Methodists I meet have no idea that the Weskey exists 
252108,TheWesley, Bed too small for couple with a 4 year old old insufficient staff at breakfast meant sometimes long wait to be seated and items such as orange juice not available at busy times, Friendly staff and very convenient location
252109,TheWesley, The mattress was uncomfortable squeaked a lot like a fold away bed or a sofa bed would Hardly any space to move around the bed hardly any space for a large suitcase Very thin walls I could hear the family in the room next to me I could hear the family across the street arguing at 2am And the seagulls dont get me started on them Plus the silverfish bug in the bathroom was not a nice surprise at 2am , I liked the proximity to the train station and the friendly staff The guy was really nice when I suggested the ear plugs he said well I wish you told us we would ve made a run to Boots for you he even carried my suitcase up and down the steps for me 
252110,TheWesley, Generally it was a good experience Just one little thing I would like to mention that I did make a connection with the Wesley about exchanging double bed room to a twin bed room and I received their reply said it was okay if I accepted to pay extra 20 pounds then I did reply as I accepted to pay extra 20 pounds for exchanging to a twin bed room However my reservation did not be changed I still was serviced with a big double bed room Actually I am not sure if I was required for the extra 20 pounds Maybe my requirement was not sent to the Wesley precisely , Breakfast service was good nice cooking and staffs in reception were all nice a well Big room on perfect location i think i will stay again in my next London trip 
252111,TheWesley, Staff were inattentive No one helped me with my baggage from the taxi or to my room The phone was broken and I asked repeatedly over 6 hours to get it fixed It never was Room was tiny walls too thin I could hear other guests all the time noisy pub right below my window and no view to speak of Internet connection kept going out too I checked out on day 2 and went to another hotel where I paid far less and got a much better room service , It was in a good location near the train stations to travel throughout the UK room was clean 
252112,TheWesley, Very noisy loud with people in the hall at night and doors opening and closing , Bathroom sink clogged on arrival but repairman came up quickly and fixed it somewhat Good breakfast 
252113,TheWesley, Condition of the carpeting in the room was a bit worn but not a distraction to the experience, Convenience to Euston Station and multiple Tube stations easing transit across London Breakfast restaurant and bar were very good with excellent service and staff including house keeping Maintenance staff addressed a minor plumbing issue very quickly
252114,TheWesley, Not a lot of space around the bed and the aircon was a bit wobbly but these are minor issues Having different music playing in the bar when the restaurant music could be heard was a bit noisy , The staff were extremely helpful and friendly The room was well equiped and comfortable I really enjoyed the cooked to order breakfast and the smoked salmon was a bonus 
252115,TheWesley, The hotel should do something with the photos of the rooms and their description Now this information is very misguiding standard twin bedroom is very small and cannot offer minimum comfort for two persons 4 stars hotel without mini bar even if it is not needed is very odd But there is not even a small fridge There was a strong noise through the whole night made by the outside air conditioner or ventilator I do not know if it belongs to the hotel or other facility nearby Booking com should seriously look into reasons of placing this hotel under 4 stars category it is certainly not At least in comparison with standard 4 stars hotels in Europe , Staff was kind and attentive to our complaints clogged sink trap in the bathroom initially impossible to keep the window half open etc We were not charged extra costs for the early check in three hours before the legal check in time even if it was in the policy regulations of the hotel 
252116,TheWesley, Mini fridge in room would of been handy just to store own drinks snacks Also a green light on all through the night also unsure if something to do with fire alarm but was very bright and lit up the room , Big room with a lovely bathroom a shower which didn t leak out the door No complaints at all just some minor niggles 
252117,TheWesley, Not really a 4 star hotel more a good 3 stars Reception elevator and rooms are a bit rundown The breakfast room already had a make over and this was very nice , Good breakfast Not a big buffet but you can order English breakfast pancakes Good location closed to Euston Station and St Pancreas
252118,TheWesley, We arrived late and weary after a concert and discovered the aircon didn t work and the room was a cosy 28c all night but wait you can open a window right wrong t behind the glass were boards or bricks so no window to open and like being in a sauna not a very enjoyable stay As it was 12 30am when we arrived back certainly didn t have the inclination or time to be faffing about trying to get it repaired was a little disappointed to say the least, The location staff and breakfast were very good 
252119,TheWesley, Nothing, The staff were outstanding and were so helpful both before our arrival during our stay and when we left The room was excellent It was clean and quiet 
252120,TheWesley, Misunderstanding over breakfast charges, Everything was perfect in the room Things like ironing board and iron not provided in our room but were provided within 5 minutes to our room Couldn t ask for a better location Staff were extremely friendly and helpful 
252121,TheWesley, We found hair on the bedsheets and pillow when we checked into our room This means that the sheets were not cleaned sufficiently well or the staff that made our bed was careless which is a minus on both accounts , The breakfast was extremely good They provide luggage storage for free for the entire day when we checked out which was a big plus as we were out travelling It is a stone throw away from Euston train station which was a big plus 
252122,TheWesley, The customer service was appalling The receptionist on arrival only checked us into one room and cancelled the other then demanded full payment When arriving back on the night the receptionist was rude and extremely unhelpful The girls on the reception desk the next morning were extremely apologetic and tried to help but it was too late , Rooms were small but very clean the food was very good
252123,TheWesley, A green LED light on the ceiling was on and could not been turned off lit the room up all night difficult to sleep due to this reported to reception but no explanation or resolve Cost of the room per night was not reflected in the hotel quality certainly didn t feel 4 star upon arriving 2 nights at 440 was excessive for room type , Breakfast was good
252124,TheWesley, the hotel used to be student accommodation and the building still has a hall of resident feel to it , the staff were very helpful in trying to find me a quiet and clean room first room had dirty carpets and broken tiles in the bathroom
252125,TheWesley, Disappointed with the new Savannah restaurant Very slow service We waited twenty minutes before our wine was brought to the table The food was average and portions were small We didn t have breakfast the next morning The carpets in the public areas look shabby , Very near Euston so good for travel connections Staff on the desk were pleasant Convenient Large clean king size bed was very comfortable Fine for a short stop over 
252126,TheWesley,No Negative, Breakfast very good even though could be busy The staff did their best to cope Breakfast freshly cooked plus good cold buffet Biscuits sweets water in room every day Room had everything bed very comfortable 
252127,TheWesley, No full length mirror in the room, Room compact but well equipped and modern Loved the shower It s very rare that I like the vegetarian breakfasts as much as I liked the one at this hotel 
252128,TheWesley, N A, Excellent hotel that was exactly what we wanted Right next to Euston Station so fantastic location Rooms were really nice and nice tea and coffee making facilities 
252129,TheWesley, poor hall it should be much more better for a 4 star hotel, nice hotel very close to Euston station friendly staff spacious clean and new rooms very good breakfast
252130,TheWesley, Rooms are small not a problem but full size beds are small if you are used to a queen king size , Fantastic location near Euston and walking distance to Kings Cross and St Pancras Nice quiet street for sleeping Convenience store ATMs and several restaurants bars and pubs within 2 minute walk The in hotel restaurant and bar are adequate 
252131,TheWesley, Room was small and bathroom in poor condition Sink wouldn t drain floor tiles loose and shower tray leaked on the floor , Staff were helpful and friendly Savannah restaurant is light airy and a nice place to have breakfast which is good value at 10 
252132,TheWesley, I had the room next to housekeeping so was woken early in the morning and that was a big nuissance Let the management staff know however and I think they re passing that feedback on , Mostly great and helpful reception staff rooms were really dark at night toiletries and coffee were great touches as they re all organic and the location is ideal 
252133,TheWesley, As well as the bar closing at 23 00 without warning I felt the couple of staff were a little unprofessional with the way they openly having a go about members of the public that had just left the premises albeit there had been a small two way altacation, The convieniance of the location to the train tube stations is excellent The reception and restaurant staff are very friendly The evening meal was very good but I would have liked a little more The breakfast was spot on 
252134,TheWesley, N a, My boyfriend requested flowers to be in the hotel room they really went the extra mile with rose petals on the floor and on the bed This was our second time staying here and will definitely be staying here again No stars high enough to rate this hotel and the staff
252135,TheWesley, Towels were smelly At 9 am in the morning a man wearing boilersuit entered the room when I was sleeping and leave the room when he saw me In general rooms must be cleaned after checkout if it is a one night stay But housekeeper came 3 times until my checkout time starting from 9 30 am I think neither housekeepers or workers have no guest list and they are just entering the room whenever they want , Nice reception staff Close to Euston Station Extend checkout time an hour Modern room Not big but adequite size Free and good wifi
252136,TheWesley, The breakfast experience has changed and is now not as relaxed and it used to be Also the staff at breakfast were not very helpful , Great location great rooms and the hotel reception staff are very welcoming
252137,TheWesley, On this visit room was expensive double previous visit but price follows London market variations and everywhere was expensive so OK in relative terms , Excellent location for me Very close to either Euston or Euston Square tube Very clean and nice breakfast Have stayed several times previously and always good 
252138,TheWesley, It felt more 3 star Rooms fairly basic Bed was 2 singles joined to make a double and building very noisy voices and movement carried really easily , Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful 
252139,TheWesley, Value for money is good in London but still a bit overpriced for a relatively small room without breakfast , Very central and in walking distance from many attractions Clean and modern design and helpful staff Can highly recommend 
252140,TheWesley,No Negative, Bed was so comfortable Nice quiet room surprising as it was street level Accommodating for late checkout Great location without stupid pricing Would definitely go back we live in London but booked this hotel for an holiday evening as we had a function in Russell Square it was such a lovely stay that even though I had to go back to work in London for a night shift the day of departure I felt as if I had actually been on holiday Highest compliments as such 
252141,TheWesley, Charged twice for the room as the poor mannered male receptionist insisted on that payment hadn t been taken 2 months ago So charged by card again The payment had been taken and was refunded by the happy female receptionist the next day Also asked the male for the sink trap to be emptied as water would drain away in the bathroom Next day still not done so had to do myself with loads of hair and a mini toothpaste container the cause of the blockage ,No Positive
252142,TheWesley, There was an empty shower cap box in the bathroom wasn t really a problem as I kept my hair from getting wet in the shower This was all I could fault , staff very friendly The room was spacious and very clean Brilliant location minutes from Euston station They were also filming a tv show at the top of the street which attracted quite a crowd 
252143,TheWesley, The room had a strange smell unpleasant but I was unable to leave the window open as it was either shut vertical or completely open horizontal The carpet was covered in stains The light in the recess where the kettle was wouldn t switch off and neither would the air conditioning both of which were not conducive to a good night s sleep , The lady who checked me in was very efficient and professional and there was a room ready although I was checking in at 10 30 am 
252144,TheWesley, Room small with limited storage space for two people staying more than a day or two , Very friendly staff cleanliness and service good cooked breakfast Convenience for Euston and Underground 
252145,TheWesley, The bed was a little soft and there was no sound proofing so I was able to hear every creek of the person in the next room, The staff were excellent Although the room smelt a little musty I was able to open the window 
252146,TheWesley, Limited choices for vegetarians We wanted to stay in to have our evening meal but because of the lack of options for vegetarians we had to go out Was also a little cold had to ask reception to adjust the heating then it was fine , The room was very nice and clean and we were very comfortable Lovely breakfast Loved that it was only a few mins walking distance from Euston station 
252147,TheWesley, Didnt sleep well as was very noisy Wasn t sure if the room was above or below and office as I heard talking most of the night , The location was really good This was a massive factor for us
252148,TheWesley, The shower was a little tiny and the safe had a bit of a fit but minor complaints , Contemporary Hotel quiet bedroom very large comfortable bed Excellent bar great breakfast 
252149,TheWesley, Recently repainted but very amateur decorators as paint on light switches and other places you don t expect Shower for fid not seal properly so lots of water ,No Positive
252150,TheWesley,No Negative, Our stay was amazing we had come early but our room wasn t ready so the staff had shown us to the lounge where it was really comfortable to relax at whilst we waited on our room the service was just the best wasn t a let down at all would recommend it to anyone
252151,TheWesley, Sound of the underground trains rattling under the building felt and heard in my 1st floor room It starts at 5am Breakfast service dreadfully slow and very cramped Had to abandon hopes of seeing my scrambled egg after an hour , Location and price excellent for London
252152,TheWesley, Breakfast This hotel used to have a spacious breakfast room with delicious and varied continental and cooked breakfasts Now it is in a narrow cramped room with boring packet cereals and the cooked food is extra and pricey Truly disappointing , Pleasant and helpful staff
252153,TheWesley, Some refurbishment going on Restaurant closed for a private event the evening I arrived, Excellent convenient location for a late arrival from the north of England Very nice breakfast freshly cooked
252154,TheWesley, The breakfast area was crowded and eggs had to be separately ordered at the counter I think Savannah is good but things could be better , Quite atmosphere was the only thing requested which was granted with no complains or excuses that I could make Will consider this place when telling friends who visit London from abroad 
252155,TheWesley, They need to to get the basic right for the price the room was tiny the only mirrors were bathroom or back of door not suitable to dry hair or put on make up the shower have to door open which once water is turned on comes out to the bathroom toiletries were like a local government gym bottle or shampoo and soap attached to wall poor quality The window is only single glazed i assume as I had to try and sleep through a machine hum outside window Carpet was stained in 3 areas Area for coffee making was tiny and everything had to be moved to get to the kettle, Location to my business meeting
252156,TheWesley, My room was warm even with air con going rough night s sleep The restaurant for breakfast was disorganised and slow even when not crowded food was just okay , Location is good on a relatively quiet street close to Euston main station The front desk staff were nice courteous and attentive no waiting A clean place 
252157,TheWesley,No Negative, An absolutely brilliant find Excellent convenient location comfortable bed and everything you could need for any type of stay Staff really helpful 
252158,TheWesley, Lost points for mix up during breakfast and having to repeatedly ask for a tea even though any one arriving after us were served theirs before us Not only us but another couple ended up eating their breakfast at different times , Public areas clean and well kept Large bedroom big comfortable bed clean room and bathroom Nicely equipped room Iron Ironing board Hair Dryer Safe extra pillows flat screen with a good choice of channels 
252159,TheWesley, Small rooms shower complicated in a grotty location Looked like a cheap refurbishment in common areas Irish Times only free newspaper Breakfast room bland Few external windows Window in shower room meant disturbing anyone sleeping if light put on , Comfy bed Discounted price Convenient for Euston area but in a grotty location Looked like a cheap refurbishment in common areas 
252160,TheWesley, Upgraded to a Junior suite which was very nice but it was on the ground floor at the front of the hotel so the street noise was obvious Plus there are no net curtains so on getting dressed we had to leave the main curtains closed Could also hear that underground trains ,No Positive
252161,TheWesley, Nothing, Excellent location near to Euston Station St Pancras Station the British Museum and the British Library The rooms were well equipped with Fairtrade refreshments and luxury toiletries We would definitely return 
252162,TheWesley, I booked through Booking com and accidentally booked x2 rooms for two of us for two nights They kindly cancelled the second room which of course they didn t have to So we re very grateful that a booking error didn t cost us , The food was terrific Location great and very helpful staff particularly with the problem we encountereed Very happy to find out the profits go towards eduction training and food in Africa 
252163,TheWesley, Room very small but reception staff very good breakfast was a shambles place untidy v v poor standard and staff disinterested, Location was good for our trip
252164,TheWesley, I wasn t told they were in the middle of a refurbishment it was like walking through a building site to get to the room The Restaurant and bar were closed due to this So couldn t eat or have a drink I paid more for the Superior room The room was very small no fridge The television was far to small and I was told it would be a King sized bed It was two single pushed together that sunk in the middle Very uncomfortable nights sleep All in all I was very disappointed and would have asked for my money back had I not had to leave quickly in the morning , Close to Euston Station
252165,TheWesley, The kettle didn t fit under the tap It made making a cup of tea very awkward as I had to use the bathroom glass to fill it , Loved the soft lighting for the evening in the room Great shower Very comfortable bed Extremely clean room Extremely helpful polite and friendly staff Would definitely use this hotel again A great stay 
252166,TheWesley, The room is very cold at night although the heater is working Our room was near the main corridor door which was makes really annoying slaming sound each time anybody open it and close it, Location is fab near Euston station Staff are nice and friendly Cosy and clean room
252167,TheWesley, I didn t like being told that I hadn t paid for my breakfast at the table while I was eating it in front of other guest I felt embarrassed and uncomfortable , Convenient for Euston Station Rooms clean and comfortable Breakfast excellent
252168,TheWesley, I have stayed at this hotel dozens of times and enjoyed every one of my visits except this one I was in room 131 on the first floor I could hear almost every word of the couple in the room next to me This has never happened before but I felt like I was sharing my room with them and therefore I had a very uncomfortable stay , Excellent value for money and with very pleasant staff 
252169,TheWesley, Don t think there was anything we didn t like We stayed close to a station in central London so a bit of a rumble from the tube trains and no view is to be expected , Really good location Nice comfy twin room helpful staff good breakfast Travelling with my daughter so nice to have equal sized beds and we both slept very well Nice to have a shower cap provided it s the sort of thing we usually forget Looked after our luggage on the last day until we left for our train so handy 
252170,TheWesley, Only complaint was that We had a room on the ground floor at front of building and the green bright glow of the hotel sign made for a poor night sleep for me Perhaps black out blinds would sort it , Handy location clean and modern Plus breakfast included in price was great value for money
252171,TheWesley, This hotel compares itself with some of the more premium hotels locally and comes up wanting The experience when you arrive is some sort of twenties meets seventies car rental showroom Think black and white sparkly marble There s a reason no pictures are on their website This would be forgiven if the staff were nice but I was greeted by a young lady devoid of any personality warmth or sense of humour She was professional and efficient but was only interested in taking my money I am a very seasoned traveler and this was the first time I have been actually charged for my stay up front Card details are of course taken for security but the money was hastily removed from my account before I was pointed to my room with no mention of where I should go for breakfast So I made my way to my room in a very dubious lift with no offer of assistance with my bags Not that I needed it but to be offered is something that most staff are encouraged to offer especially in a higher end hotel The conversion of the building itself is terrible They have divided this likely listed building up into tiny rooms Then they have proceeded to clad the walls with cheap wood likely to cover up the still evident terrible painting and decorating work The mattress on the bed was by far the worst I have slept on in years It provides no support and springs were evident throughout At this point I was feeling very disappointed but I thought I ll turn to the minibar and the television for solace I searched only to find no minibar so poured myself a glass of complimentary tap water dressed up in Wesley bottles to look like mineral water and sat down to put a movie on The disappointment continued The television was no more than 20 inches that might be generous and the menus were in a foreign language I do realise a previous guest could have altered this and there was no premium content on offer at all , There was not much to like about my experience in this hotel Disinterested staff small room building site for poor quality breakfast and a mattress so uncomfortable I was dreaming of a Premier Inn Having said that the room was clean and the hotel was close to where I needed to be 
252172,TheWesley, Everything it was so bad we had to move and further more they still took 198 for 1 night B B which if you saw the place or was aware of the construction site it had become would not let guests stay there, This was awful the hotel was going under construction the place was cold and grotty 
252173,TheWesley, Really uncomfortable bed i was told i had been upgraded from a single to double room turns out it was not a double just two uncomfortable singles pushed together, Location excellent
252174,TheWesley, I cancelled a wake up call as I had to work very late but was still woken up I did get 10 reduction for the inconvenience though , The reception staff were very helpful and the breakfast was excellent
252175,TheWesley, The rooms could have been a little bit bigger and I really would had liked to have a small refrigerator to put a couple of beers in , The location with two underground stations just around the corner and at Euston station from witch you can travel across whole London without changes From Euston station 150m you can also take the mainland train to for example Manchester and go see ManU win at Old Trafford as we did and back the same day Breakfast really ok when included in the price 
252176,TheWesley, Dining room was poor but their was a lot of building work going on in restaurant also corridors to certain bedrooms Put in wrong bedroom at first but they moved us to the size of room we should of had in first place , Staff were quite friendly room was clean 
252177,TheWesley, The room was a bit too small and the neighborhood isn t much traveler friendly, very clean friendly and polite staff serve proper english breakfast
252178,TheWesley, Room temperature a little too hot at night for my liking there was a wall thermostat but seemed to be centrally controlled I did mention this on departure when staff did apologise stating that ambient temperature was difficult to gage for all guests and that it was something they were looking at , Food excellent Chef s freshly made mayonnaise best I ve ever tasted Complimentary tea coffee mineral water etc all compliant with the hotel s founding ethos free trade and organic Overall staff friendly and helpful evening restaurant staff particularly attentive 
252179,TheWesley, Notification that works were under way in the hotel Acoustic insulation of the room More desk space for working on in the room , Breakfast good rooms clean and tidy 
252180,TheWesley, We ve stayed before and we ll stay again but unfortunately the building work going on meant the usual Wesley hotel charm is rather hidden at the moment , The location traveling by Eurostar it s super convenient We appreciated having a slightly later check out 
252181,TheWesley, The hotel was a little chaotic with all the renovations going on Better lighting would have been nice by the mirror in the bedroom , Bed was comfortable the room was clean the hairdryer was a good model excellent to have an ironing board in the room bathroom was lovely The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble excellent location especially for the tube and my daughter living in Archway Finally was very impressed with the association with the profits helping the missionaries 
252182,TheWesley, I was very disappointed that I asked to have the aircon on and this was not done It was like being in a microwave during the night Very hot Slanting roof and small room that needs air circulation not full blast heating , Location and proximity to Euston station and west end is handy Room comfortable enough for an overnight stay Only if the air condition was switched on it would have been a brilliant stay
252183,TheWesley, Rooms a bit on the small side but very clean and some renovation work going on around the dining room but this didn t affect breakfast , Great location very handy for Euston Station Very helpful staff at reception and breakfast 
252184,TheWesley, Breakfast was a bit expensive 13 thus I chose to go somewhere else, Excellent location and facilities lovely room when on a budget Incredibly convenient for Euston Station Clean and tidy place super friendly staff They looked after my bag and insisted on carrying it even though it was really heavy Also it s right down the road from the cafe in Sherlock so you can pop there for breakfast 
252185,TheWesley, Next to Euston underground so head the train when it passed Wanting to be close to the station so have to expect that , 30 seconds from Euston Very Clean and modern room room quiet hotel
252186,TheWesley,No Negative, Room was really large and has a double function They ask you to checkout by 08 00 so they can use it as a meeting room during the day Only stayed one night but this made the huge room really good value Their poached eggs at breakfast were excellent 
252187,TheWesley,No Negative, Excellent location right near Euston station and walking distance into Soho one way or Camden the other Throughly enjoy our stay here and will be making it a regular 
252188,TheWesley, 10 added to booking for early check in however did have an early check in tried to challenge receptionist but got no where Also walls very thin so could hear residents next door having a shower at midnight X3 showers I add , Lovely comfortable room 
252189,TheWesley, Quality of the bed on going renovation works temporary breakfast room scruffy bedroom and bathroom decoration , Good location close to main rail links
252190,TheWesley, Some staffs are not that nice It is noisy hotel far from the center I stayed close to London Eye for the 1st 3days that was nice , Some Staffs are really very kind like the small girl from the reception and the woman who helps to clean the room 
252191,TheWesley, Plumbing and heating was a little bit noisy , Very close to Euston station Friendly efficient reception staff Clean unfussy decor Impressive ethical and green policy 
252192,TheWesley, That the corridor outside our room was a building site fire alarms were disarmed there were bare wires showing from sockets light switches We were awoken early by building work going on , Very helpful staff great location 
252193,TheWesley, Could of had a fridge Nothing major but as a room improvement for future reference , Considering the room we was given 120 was right by the current renovations being taken place at the hotel The cleanliness was spot on The noise wasn t too loud the room managed to block out a lot of the noise As a young couple we felt welcomed and location is amazing The house cleaning in the room was pleasant and refreshments replenished every day Breakfast was lovely sausages were amazing Overall very happy with my stay and would stay again recommend 100 to a family or relative 
252194,TheWesley, A C was broken windows didn t open and the fan I was provided with did hardly anything to cool the room down Was up to 29 degrees at one point Ended up checking out early and going elsewhere , Staff were friendly and helpful
252195,TheWesley, Small room considering it was a deluxe twin The water merely trickled out from taps in bathroom sink , Good location just a few minutes walk from Euston Great choice of breakfast 
252196,TheWesley, Unable to control heat in room Had to leave window open all night March weather Staff made aware unable to fix Offered to change room Dining inconvenient due to renovations, Location was convenient 
252197,TheWesley, Mattress not zipped together and fell through No bar as advertised Dinning area was basic No notification on any site of work being undertaken No sign in reception Staff attempted to put us in basic double room even after confirming my upgrade Staff moved us after the bed incident to a different room but still attempted to fob us off with basic double The temporary bar had next to nothing in it All in all not the enjoyable stay I had expected , Location was great
252198,TheWesley, Breakfast restaurant is still being refurbished so probably not as nice as it will be when finished Unobtrusive renovation work There is some train noise but only very slight I wear ear plugs at night so didn t bother me , Fantastic position for dropping your bags from Euston station 2 min walk Newly refurbished hotel very comfy bed and linen good room facilities Excellent breakfast 
252199,TheWesley, Shelves in the bathroom would be useful as would hooks on the door A little cramped , The location was ideal the room comfortable and the staff polte and willing to help in any way The breakfast was delicious 
252200,TheWesley, Small lobby area We enjoy a more social space when traveling especially with small room space , Room was modern and well laid out considering its small size A place for everything 
252201,TheWesley, Room was a little on the small side and breakfast was expensive , Well placed for Euston station and the rooms had recently been refurbished to an excellent standard
252202,TheWesley, Not much of an outlook from the rooms Rooms are minimalist and a few more homely touches would be welcoming , Location near Euston Station Clean room with comfortable bed Helpful reception staff Ethical values 
252203,TheWesley, the staff were awful and unhelpful and made my stay extremely stressful i had booked for breakfast and payed the night before yet the staff claimed i hadnt even though i had proof i then had to go through loads of forms as i refused to pay twice for breakfast and the staff were extremely moody about the situation ,No Positive
252204,TheWesley, The bedroom wall was thin and I was kept awake by snoring from next door Breakfast was good but the plate was cold , The bed was comfortable and the staff excellent The room was compact but fine for one night The ethical commitment of the hotel is splendid 
252205,TheWesley, The hotel is undergoing extensive renovations so there are many areas of the hotel such as the dinning room that are being housed in temporary locations The dining room felt like a student caf it had no atmosphere was dirty and unorganised The walls also seem very thin We could clearly hear the conversation of our neighbours in the first room they put us in I complained about the room itself bed too small and interior was dingy as well as the noise so we were upgraded to a superior room from a deluxe that was much better We could however still hear our neighbour We will give the hotel another chance once the works are complete , The location was convenient for Euston Station and the room we were upgraded to was well appointed and newly decorated 
252206,TheWesley, The breakfast on the Sunday morning no butter on the tables no quosants available as I believe they were being warmed up and people were waiting and just walked away , The bed was huge and comfortable room was nice
252207,TheWesley, Sad I didn t have a bath to relax before my exam the next morning , Friendly staff I asked for a quiet room as I had an exam next day so they switched me to back of hotel Breakfast was great I always judge a breakfast by its sausages and they didn t disappoint 
252208,TheWesley, Issues with the toilet dirty water kept pumping in even when not in use Mattress not very comfortable , The breakfast was very good Very friendly and helpful staff Complimentary bottle of water Well decorated room 
252209,TheWesley, For a hotel described as luxurious I would describe it as basic at best Small cramped poorly laid out rooms and the double bed was two single beds pushed together that weren t even the same height Needed a mind the gap sign in the middle to avoid the sudden drop between us The staff were not friendly or helpful at all We were not greeted or asked how our stay was it was awful Barely any sleep as someone decided to have a disco in the building next door which combined with the constantly dripping plumbing made the night very long and uncomfortable When I contacted reception to see if a quieter room or some earplugs were available I was told it was too late to sort anything and that the staff couldn t hear the noise from reception lucky them being on the other side of the building After a terrible night being woken by the building work at 7am on a Sunday the shower then leaked all over the bathroom floor and into the bedroom turning our room into some kind of lagoon Four stars I think not , The location was good for onward travel from Euston 
252210,TheWesley,No Negative, The room was ready when we got there and we arrived earlier than expected There was no noise and the room was very clean and well maintained The bathroom was super clean and the bed was comfortable The staff were very friendly and courteous The air conditioning was great and so nice and warm It was ideally located and we will be back again JR1 was a winner 
252211,TheWesley, We could have been told of the alterations taking place the dangerous floor in the conference room and not to book direct with the hotel as they charge as much as they can get , the location matched our requirements
252212,TheWesley, Hope to finish renovation for restaurant soon , Easy access to Euston St Pancras and Kings Cross include Tube and Buses Reasonable price in London Good breakfast Almost all recommendable 
252213,TheWesley, Single room back side small with blinded window no outside light possible no lounge for quiet internetting front desk people too cool restaurant has unpleasant ambiance hotel in full renovation , room well furnished location close to Euston Station excellent breakfast free wifi
252214,TheWesley, the shower is tiny its door doesn t properly close and the jet of water is fixed on the wall and hits directly the door therefore it was impossible not to flood the bathroom the moquette on the floor is unhygienic but apparently no chance not to find it in an english hotel, spacious room big bed 
252215,TheWesley, Could hear other guests in reception and in corridors There were building works going on and they were noisey May have been different had we known before Lighting in the room isn t very good and very poor natural light,No Positive
252216,TheWesley, We just had a little problem with the water in the sink which only a little came out and was cold no hot water, Our room was bright and clean and the staff were always helpfull and polite and the breakfast was one of the nicest I have had anywhere
252217,TheWesley, Minor point toilet roll holder hanging off the wall hook missing from back bathroom door These take the edge of the room , Very friendly staff good breakfast comfortable beds
252218,TheWesley, The walls were very thin and could hear the people next to us who were very very noisy and whenever they were on their beds our head board shook as well the telephone was not working I reported this to reception and also requested a bottle of water Nobody turned up, Bed was very comfortable and we could control the heating which was very quiet The shower was lovely
252219,TheWesley, There were noises coming from outside due to some construction works , Friendly staff good breakfast very good location Room was big and comfortable great shower Wifi was excellent also 
252220,TheWesley, The most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in So hard and not relaxing my back has ached all week since staying here , Good location great shower and lovely staff 
252221,TheWesley, Complicated and difficult to read room heating ventilation controls Limited television configuration controls , Location Tea making equipment Buscuits Shower 
252222,TheWesley, A king size bed in the suite rather than a double bed Rooms could have been larger Shame expensive rooms are on the ground floor , Staff were friendly and would do anything t o help make the stay more enjoyable
252223,TheWesley, The room was quite small and noisy When people walked past you could hear them the view was of scaffolding and buildings and we were given a disabled bathroom even though this was never required, The breakfast was nice the room and bathroom was very clean and tidy Bed was big and comfortable 
252224,TheWesley, TV was not working Guy came up twice to try to fix it still no joy , Clean and smart Would stay again Excellent location and good value for money 
252225,TheWesley, Nothing really , The management approach is based on an ethic of providing for their customers so that their customers return I loved the place Will be using again 
252226,TheWesley, The breakfast is now 15 That s way over the top when you re paying almost 170 for a room When I was there the dining area was being refurbished so I balked at paying 15 for breakfast in a near building site , I like the idea of the hotel being a social enterprise Also the location 
252227,TheWesley, Bit of a maze of a walk to room seemingly due to two buildings being joined together Might be difficult if moving large luggage bags , Great place for one night stay with group of friends in London for sports tour Very close to Euston Station in quiet side road Clean rooms with the usual amenities and free wifi Great breakfast in terms of room rate Value for money 
252228,TheWesley, Stained carpet battered walls view from the hotel Windows was industrial alley hot cold shower temperature kept changing, Comfy bed great modern design helpful staff hot English breakfast held our bags for us after check out while we went sight seeing
252229,TheWesley, With a 4 rating I was expecting much more I ve stayed in quite a few hotels in the area around the same price This is definitely the worst by far Hotel is very shabby room was very shabby with leaking shower cupboards with stiff doors slow draining washbasin poor soundproofing from other rooms and the people at the pub across the road dining room ugly with chipped formica tables , Proximity to Euston Station although there are much better hotels for the same price close to the Station Breakfast nice but not worth the extra to include on booking com Cheaper to buy at the hotel Reception staff and breakfast room staff were friendly 
252230,TheWesley, I had previously stayed and been given a room on a high level at the back of the development This was very quiet This time we had a room at the front on the first floor This was much noisier and I would try and avoid these rooms when booking , Great location Less than a minutes walk from Euston station Very clean room and comfortable bed The staff are helpful and polite If you are looking for decent reliable accomodation at a reasonable price then this is a good choice 
252231,TheWesley, If you don t like the rumbling of the tube go on a high floor but it didn t bother us , Staff were outstanding especially Senye and Racquel who looked after us fantastically when we had to move rooms due to air con not working properly Location is a 2 minute walk from Euston Great breakfast in the morning Couldn t fault our stay Already re booked to stay again 
252232,TheWesley, Terrible coffee for breakfast Carpets in corridors and lift needed a good clean Not really a four star hotel OK three star , Good last minute deal Comfortable room Very convenient for Euston station 
252233,TheWesley, The glass partitioning between the bathroom and the room means that a night visit to the bathroom lights up the whole room and disturbs other sleeping person No problem for a single occupier though , The location in the close vicinity to Euston train station suits us very well We could walk almost anywhere in the City center 
252234,TheWesley, Outside walls a bit thin so could hear opening and shutting fire doors in the hall Did not notice noise in rooms around me though , Room spacious large king size bed for solo traveller excellent H2K Harrogate toiletries in bathroom well laid out convenient for late night arrival by Euston Station looked after luggage securely on check out friendly staff 
252235,TheWesley, Very noisy not just tube train running underground but loud music being played until about 3 or 4 in the morning Did not sleep well at all , Nice furnishings facilities in room
252236,TheWesley,No Negative, They was really accomodating and we had a marvellous stay It is right next to Euston station couldn t be any better placed Only a short taxi ride to Covent Garden or anywhere for that matter 
252237,TheWesley, I would have liked some more choice of bread at breakfast The bread was a bit dry Perhaps also cucumbers and yoghurt Hot food looked great though , The location is perfect near 2 underground stations Pizza for dinner was delicious Staff friendly 
252238,TheWesley, Restaurant area does not have much atmosphere and is a bit clinical , Staff friendly and helpful Given an upgrade for 10 Superior room comfortable clean and modern 
252239,TheWesley, V disappointed in lack of the cocktail bar and restaurant proper Were not aware of this on booking so big letdown Think heating needs sorting 1st room cold in shower area as no rad and towel rail was not heated , Positive and helpful attitude of staff to resolve problems Good breakfast tho not surroundings Good quality d cor furnishings in room 
252240,TheWesley, Shower cubicle was small and screen leaked all over the floor so had to lay down towels to soak up water Eggs Benedict was considered a Premium Breakfast item so wanted to charge 9 50 on top of what I had already paid for breakfast Aside from a muffin and spoon of sauce the egg and ham was already laid out for standard breakfast so did feel this extra charge was unnecessary , Staff were friendly and attentive Location was good but road where hotel was could do with a tidy up as lots of litter so not the most attractive street in London
252241,TheWesley, bit of a rabbit warren inside and builders working in the day outside created a bit of noise No view only of a wall and scaffolding , Room was clean The bed was really comfy and the hotel was in an excellent location Staff were very friendly 
252242,TheWesley, The bin in bathroom wasn t cleared full of female intimate care stuff So cleanliness needs improving , Excellent location very friendly reception staff well equipped room 
252243,TheWesley,No Negative, We have stayed here on many occasions over the years and have in our experience never had anything negative to report The hotel suits OUR requirements in all respects especially for the short breaks that we tend to take The hotel has undergone quite a physical up dating transformation over the recent past which has in our opinion been well managed with consideration for guests under what I m sure have been difficult circumstances We have ALWAYS found the management and staff pleasant efficient and very helpful indeed 
252244,TheWesley, Some of the lifts weren t working and it s a bit of a maze so not the easiest to get to rooms Quite noisy walls must have been thin Glass wall on bathroom not ideal as lights up entire room if one person uses bathroom in night , Location was great if you re looking to be near Euston very easy walk Rooms were nice clean and comfy 
252245,TheWesley, The shower alternated hot water with short intervals of cold water but i think it was a problem of just my room, Almost everything was nice Would definitely come back 
252246,TheWesley, Construction works in the hotel this was not announced on the hotel s website noise coming from the train station breakfast was till 9am due to construction works check out was at 10am on the second night the room flooded with water due to water pipe problems from construction works wetting our luggage and all the items we had on the floor we were upgraded to a larger room but with an opaque window thus you cannot see outside , Location is only 2 minutes away from Euston station connecting trains northern and Victoria lines
252247,TheWesley, cleaners forgot to close our door after clean causing concern as door was left open all day , Location for getting around London Excellent Room was very clean Bathroom was good with powerfull shower
252248,TheWesley,No Negative, Must husband and I stayed at The Wesley hotel for New Years and we were really pleased The rooms were cosy but modern and clean the bathroom was immaculate with a decent shower and the beds were comfortable The location right outside Euston station was perfect for us as we re happy to use the Underground and it s right on the Northern line which is very convenient The staff were helpful and have been very helpful in arranging the delivery of some clothing items I left behind thanks Eva All in all The Wesley is great value for money especially London prices on NYE Recommend 
252249,TheWesley, The room looks considerably smaller than the photos in reality That was disappointing as I choose it for that particular reason as I needed a little space to reorganize after a long trip I like the photos to be an honest representation and was disappointed in this instance ,No Positive
252250,TheWesley, I think the single room is very tiny and I am a small woman I cannot imagine a man booking this room the bed is something the size you might see on a ship , Location was wonderful and the room was clean Staff were helpful 
252251,TheWesley, Shower miniscule and almost impossible to use without flooding the floor , Location is very convenient a short walk from Euston station Friendly staff Options to prepare tea on the room 
252252,TheWesley, Advised that there was no triple rooms available yet when I arrived one of our rooms had three single beds Felt disappointed that they were able to charge me for another room The other room had a double bed and a single bed The room hadn t been serviced properly as previous guests underwear was still in the wardrobe , Great location Two minutes walk from Euston
252253,TheWesley, Noise was ridiculous especially for a Monday night Maybe had 2 hours of sleep with guests slamming doors all night , Location was excellent Breakfast was great with lots of choice but felt rushed by staff Reception staff were friendly and welcoming 
252254,TheWesley, The room we were allocated had a funny smell and stains on the carpet Plus it was more or less two single beds pushed together The person on reception upgraded us to the jubilee suite which was a much bigger room and closer to reception , We had a problem with our room but the staff provided a solution in the form of an upgrade 
252255,TheWesley, The 4 star rating was misleading to be honest It was clean enough but not what you would expect from a 4 star hotel Some of the furniture had seen better days adjoining rooms were noisy and the room itself far too warm The idea of a frosted glass bathroom seemed a good idea until you needed to use it in the middle of the night the light shines up the whole room which is bad news for your sleeping partner , The location was great staff were friendly
252256,TheWesley, Shower cabin leaked onto bathroom floor and out to carpet in room cabin door did not close properly and as a result had no seal Floor was slippery and then carpet also damp , Nice bed and excellent breakfast Closeness to Euston station 
252257,TheWesley, Water in sink only dribbled out When I reported that and that the plug mechanism didn t work they said the knew but had not warned me before taking the room or offered discount Overall shabby looking room and bathroom Horrible reconstituted orange juice and generally not great breakfast Definitely not 4star , Friendly staff clean central
252258,TheWesley, Being told I was upgraded but still having a small room with no view Reception staff a bit unhelpful on checking in re use of credit card Quite expensive for what it was , Convenient location Good breakfast Well equipped room Quiet 
252259,TheWesley, Check in was difficult with a wait and it made me late for my evening out, Fabulous location rooms and hotel as a whole was kept very clean Quiet as down a side street Close to Euston station Amazing breakfast Would stay here again 
252260,TheWesley, Oodles of dust on bathroom door so could not hang clothes and also soap dispensers Room is so small you can hear everything in the next room TV conversations and EVERYTHING,No Positive
252261,TheWesley, TV remote did not work but was quickly replaced, good sized room had everything expected spacious desk comfy bed radio TV all facilities in bathroom tea tray included biscuits
252262,TheWesley, Room was very small had no view whatsoever and the mattress was very hard indeed , Good location near Euston Quiet room and a giant bathroom Breakfast was also really good 
252263,TheWesley, Room too warm air conditioning quiet but not very effective, Amazingly quiet location within 5 minutes of mainline Euston train and both underground stations We slept soundly Room was a bit too warm but that s London for you
252264,TheWesley, I would like some cheaper breakfast options at the restaurant The hostess was a bit misleading indicating that I was to get the Traditional English Breakfast when i only wanted something light She did not seem to want to share any other options Also I asked for a wakeup call which I never got , I liked the convenience to theTube theTrain shopping and the sites The hotel was a bit stark but the room was adequate clean and had all the essentials for one person Great for a short stay 
252265,TheWesley, The staff on the desk were not always as friendly as other hotels we have stayed at, The breakfast included in the price the hotel rooms were comfy although a little small
252266,TheWesley, New carpet had just been fitted as we arrived by the looks of it and there was mess everywhere weren t warned about this The kettle in the rooms smelt of burning plastic when boiled thought it was probably best not to have a cup of tea , Location of the hotel was good Staff were friendly 
252267,TheWesley,No Negative, Initially we had problems Noisy radiator and broken lamp that was not fixed despite several calls We had chosen the room for its desk as my wife needed to do some work before our concert However once the manager found out we were upgraded and treated to complimentary drinks and food Which were excellent 
252268,TheWesley, Lighting in restaurant too blue green so not flattering to appearance of food or faces Better to use warmer colours , Great ethos lovely welcome comfortable room fantastic food early supper at 5 30 soup and salads and great bread Great that it s a social enterprise 
252269,TheWesley,No Negative, Great location very close to Euston station but still quiet My room double for single use was very clean and comfortable not hugely spacious but not tiny either and well suited to a city stay Staff were friendly and efficient 
252270,TheWesley, Our first room, The staff were so friendly When I asked to move rooms because our bed was to big they did so without hesitation They were effiecient and offered us 3 others to look at At breakfast the kitchen staff all said good morning how are you The food was excellent quality and I am very fussy where I eat Immaculate 
252271,TheWesley, My single room was tiny yet only slightly cheaper than a roomier double room The dining breakfast room and bar was cold windowless lacked comfortable sitting possibilities and tablecloths and was in all the total opposite of cosy and comfortable I wouldn t dine or go for an evening drink there for the love of God , The Wesley is very conveniently located within walking distance from St Pancras King s Cross Station and around the corner of Euston Station The room has all the facilities one could wish for and a very comfortable shower Breakfast choices are excellent 
252272,TheWesley, Heating not working in our room Which was disappointing , Fantastic area Very quite and very handy to get to euston station for all our tube travels Breakfast and staff really good 
252273,TheWesley,No Negative, We like the location welcome and value for money We also like to support the Methodist church so prefer to stay here rather than a purely commercially functioning hotel 
252274,TheWesley,No Negative, Quiet room Breakfast chef very attentive and breakfast cooked to perfection Free wifi worked well Some maintenance issues I reported ie shower door seal leaking badly caused bathroom floor to get very wet light bulb blown in bathroom air con not cooling and despite someone coming to look at it it was not working so room very hot at night Reception manager thanked me for feedback and refunded dinner as GOGW which was unexpected Would give it another go there 
252275,TheWesley, There was zero soundproofing so we didn t get any sleep all night You can hear people walking and chatting in the corridors so loudly it felt like they were in the room At one point somebody tried to enter the room too , The room was clean and very comfortable The bed was extremely comply with nice linens
252276,TheWesley, I felt the stairwells could have been a little cleaner Also the cheap laminated plastic signs would make a guest query whether it is actually a 4 hotel, The location was great and the rooms had everything I needed 
252277,TheWesley, Double room booked however it consisted of two single beds pushed together , Very friendly helpful staff Clean modern hotel in a great location 
252278,TheWesley, Window cannot open for get some fresh air and the sink in the toilet are block The AC only allow us to choose fan or heater try to turn to AC but doesn t work And also the ventilation in the toilet doesn t work as well , Very good location 
252279,TheWesley, Requested early check in but were told it wasn t guaranteed when we arrived at 10 30 am so we came back at 12 00 pm to find rooms still not ready Offered upgrade as it was our second time had a child screaming all night and sound of tube meant not much sleep was had Maintenance workers left dirt in the corridor we were staying in Heating didn t work without assistance from staff If paying privately wouldn t have been impressed , Breakfast was fantastic and very welcome after a relatively rough night 
252280,TheWesley, Room heating control didn t work door on toilet broken noisy doors banging Hair dryer broke Generally I think it was a little pricy for what we got , Location was perfect for what we needed near Euston The bed was very relaxing 
252281,TheWesley, Still like all hotels nearby Euston and UCL the number of stars 4 is overrated Rooms and beds are too small Very limited minibar and minimalistic bathroom, Compared to other hotels nearby This has some decent service and amenities Location is excellent
252282,TheWesley, I had the steak for my evening meal and it was a little tough did expect a bit better quality considering the cost but still would not put us off staying again, The welcome from the staff on reception also in the restaurant and bar Breakfast was very good we had one evening meal and again the staff were very good 
252283,TheWesley, Nothing not to like , Peaceful setting but convenient for Euston Station Friendly and helpful staff Spacious room with firm but comfortable bed Functional and accessible shower 
252284,TheWesley, Our room was on the 3rd floor We had an air conditioning unit on the roof above our heads which was extremely noisy it was like noise torture and meant we had a disturbed night and a headache the next morning , The Wesley is in a good location The staff were friendly and helpful particularly the bar staff 
252285,TheWesley, I paid for a delux double room I got a double but was absolutely tight and small No room for luggage Don t be fooled by pictures , Location of the hotel close to Euston station 
252286,TheWesley, You should really give people a notification if they pay with a company credit card Now I had to pay on arrival while i thought the payment was done , Rooms were tight and tidy
252287,TheWesley, Only a minor thing no lamp in the bed side light spoke to reception and that another minor problem one was sort but no lamp put in the lamp on leaving, The staff were very friendly especially reception bar and the Chef Also had the best breakfast we ve had in any hotel in London 
252288,TheWesley, In room 309 the shower doors had gaps so the water leaked , Really liked friendly staff especially in the restaurant at breakfast Food at breakfast was also great 
252289,TheWesley, The rooms are tiny and very warm in fact too warm to sleep without the very noisy air con turned on Breakfast is good and the chef is spot on but the waiting staff and a little disorganised , It is clean and friendly 
252290,TheWesley, Very expensive Oh my god the bed Perhaps it s just personal preference but I actually only managed about two hours sleep I like a bit of firmness There was none whatsoever Far too soft The pillow too After three minutes my head had sank so low it felt like only the pillow case was left for support Really uncomfortable and restless night , Great location Nice little hotel 
252291,TheWesley, Cream carpet was a bit stained but everything else was clean so it was nothing that really ruined the stay , Staff were lovely Bed was comfy Facilities were good and it was an excellent price for the location Getting off the train at Euston with only a 2 min walk was a godsend at 10 30pm 
252292,TheWesley, There was no menu in the room for in room service Room was only just large enough , The excellent and happy staff Hotel appeared fresh and clean throughout the building Easy access to Euston station 
252293,TheWesley, Air con not working properly so had to leave windows open which meant it was noisy , Great location Few minutes walk from Euston station Clean rooms with comfy bed Friendly staff Good breakfast
252294,TheWesley, Old drafty ugly windows means no daylight Something first disappeared white pajamas likely taken with sheets Unseasoned staff reception head experienced in persuasion with dismissive overtones Charges per day of week not flat rate as stated by Book Noise from tube local pub Sightseeing still by tube, Modern room interior Close to British Library Close to tube 
252295,TheWesley, This was the worst value for money I could ever possibly comprehend 200 pounds per night and the roof rattled all night and drains in the walls gurgled these problems where known to management who still booked out the room without addressing the problem,No Positive
252296,TheWesley, Just need more powerful hairdryers and some leisure facilities , Wonderful friendly staff who treated you personally Very modern clean rooms The food is wonderful and even the chef is very friendly and talks to customers 
252297,TheWesley, First we were given a room key for a room already occupied next room was a disabled room with very noisy and annoying radiator Finally got a suitable room but for the money paid expected more and will certainly be staying elsewhere when visiting London again , Ideal location for Oxford Street and transport links 
252298,TheWesley, Noise of the Underground Train from our Room was noticeable Asked in original booking for a higher floor location this was not available on arrival on offered a rear quieter room and got placed at the front of the hotel The room was not even listed on the floor directions it seemed not large enough for a double room No draws to put items in limited hangers to put clothes on cobwebs in the bathroom and towels were not all clean, Location was very good Bed was comfy Good shower room Staff nice
252299,TheWesley, Hairdryer cut out a lot and water alternated between hot and cold, Small room but with large showroom disabled set up comfortable bed tea coffee etc al very good
252300,TheWesley, room was very small and not that clean even the towel did not smell like clean the bed was really small for two people room needs refurbishment in my view this hotel does not deserve a 4 star rating,No Positive
252301,TheWesley, The small hallways at upper floors but they upgraded us so this was solved , We didn t like our room size and they upgraded us to a much bigger room for free I forgot an envelope with money upon checkout they kept calling until we picked it up Very nice helpful and honest staff 
252302,TheWesley, Room size small , The room size was very small apart from that comfortable all facilities in room Didn t take breakfast as was too expensive 
252303,TheWesley, Had to move the tv so I could watch tv in bed the chair provided was extremely uncomfortable Breakfast wasn t the best some cheap ingredients used I think there was some kind of motor outside the room which was very nosy at times , Very clean good location
252304,TheWesley, The room was too warm for October and I had to turn the heating down Surprisingly I was given an accessible room which meant that the bathroom mirrors was installed for a person sitting in a wheelchair They must install another mirror module above the accessible mirror module so that a 6 ft tall person would not have to crouch or kneel to shave leading to a sore back, I liked the cleanliness and the fact that they gave me an upped floor as requested
252305,TheWesley, Heating was broken in the room and was very cold Despite calling twice it was not fixed and then I just gave up , Very lovely staff Nice Restaurant Good Location
252306,TheWesley, the butter provided tasted more like margarine , Room very clean staff friendly helpful hotel interior modern and well decorated meals breakfast evening excellent 
252307,TheWesley, The room and bathroom were very small and claustrophobic and not large enough for two people Very noisy with water coming through the radiator all night Buzzing noise from outside all night as well , Great location as close to Euston Station Staff friendly The breakfast was very good 
252308,TheWesley, Both staff on that day of 30th Sept were so miserable no manners what so ever and the cleaner plugged her Hoover lead in behind me and the took it down the stairs One of the guests saw this and told her to unplug it immediately as I was walking with AIDS and if I had turned around I would have fell and hurt myself The staff didn t even apologise I will never stay here again and I stay a lot in Euston I would It recommend it either The standard double room was lacking in specs One side pushed against a wall do you had to climb into the other side which is impossible if you are elderly or disabled My mother and I were quite disgusted overall especially with the staff , Everything was clean Food was nice 
252309,TheWesley, Awaken few times during the night with loud noises in the hallway and people talking out loud in front of my door I was so sleepy to get up and ask them to be quiet , Very nice and clean room great location
252310,TheWesley, Iron in room poor and heatng didn t work, How close it is from Euston station and London central Staff were very good breakfast had lots to choose from and excellent quality We were upgraded to a superior room however thought it was a standard double we had Room small and clean 
252311,TheWesley, Firstly I was put in a superior deluxe room on the ground floor and I could feel the vibrations of the tube underneath so was moved to 1st floor disabled room which ok but equipped for a person in a wheelchair The carpets and skirting boards were stained and dirty The towel rail fell off and then the inside of the wardrobe collapsed The hotel is shabby and cheap and no way near worthy of a 4 star , I liked the location of the hotel and its proximity to Euston Very nice staff 
252312,TheWesley, Street is not well lit and feels a bit dodgy especially after dark as a solo traveler Building is not well marked Confusing that the station is on Euston Road and the hotel is on Euston Street which are two different directions , Eco friendly hotel Good breakfast variety Very convenient to Euston station Within reasonable walk of British Museum 
252313,TheWesley, No laundry bag and when requested one I was told there were none When I insisted housekeeping brought me a garbage bag And the second time I tried to submit laundry at 7 am there was no form as well as no bag and I was told I would have to wait till Housekeeping arrived at 8 am So I took the old form from my previous laundry and changed the date and used the plastic cover for my previous laundry to make a laundry bag And this is a hotel charging 275 pounds a night , Convenience to my office in Kings Cross and to Euston station
252314,TheWesley, The WiFi was temperamental to say the least in the room but in the restaurant it worked okay, ALL the staff were very helpful and pleasant The breakfast was super and a wide choice of food The location so close to Euston was ideal Quiet setting 
252315,TheWesley, Being on ground floor suite not much natural light but really not too much of an issue probably the worst thing I can say , Allowed us an early check in which was much appreciated after arriving from Sydney AU Great breakfast
252316,TheWesley, The standard double bed is too small for two adults sharing a duvet for a comfortable sleep The fire alarm went off in error in early morning which was very very disrupting There was an unpleasant noise from drilling during our breakfast that made it impossible to have a conversation or enjoy the breakfast time , The location so close to Euston train station and in a walking distance to the places we planned to go to 
252317,TheWesley, We had a number of problems including room facing a working office so no privacy non working lamp n iron checkout is set early at 10am even thou we requested late checkout for 11 12pm and we found a lump of bone in the sausage at breakfast plus all drinks water was warm under no refridgeration facility, Beds comfy room clean 
252318,TheWesley,No Negative, Friendly and helpful staff Able to leave luggage Close to station Organic food Able to open windows onto street without hearing traffic noise or trains 
252319,TheWesley, A couple of minor complaints Walls are thin and you can hear what s going on around you especially the shower next door was quite noisy and the doors slamming Not a major issue at night No fridge in room , The Wesley is centrally located closed to the Euston St Pancras and Kings Cross train stations but on a side street that is relatively quiet It bills itself as a budget friendly hotel and it is but it is top of class in that category The rooms are clean and new and bright Amenities are good The onsite restaurant offers decent selection and quality It also is a socially responsible hotel 
252320,TheWesley, Neighbourhood is a bit off putting but it may improve No easy chair but how many hotel bedrooms have one these days , Good shower and bathroom Helpful staff A quiet location in a busy and noisy area 
252321,TheWesley, My boyfriend did find it quite difficult to tune out the underground train noise as it was quite frequent We could hear this from the ground floor facing the front of the hotel , The staff were really friendly the room was spacious and incredibly clean The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was lovely 
252322,TheWesley, The Wifi would not connect in the room or even in the restaurant near to reception Reception staff rebooted the router but it made no difference There was no toilet roll or even toilet roll holder in the bathroom and I had to request this from reception The doors of adjacent rooms were extremely noisy throughout the night and it did keep me awake quite a lot , The food in the restaurant was excellent Bed was very comfortable and the room was generally very clean Shower and bathroom as a whole was nice and clean 
252323,TheWesley, I believe its an old office building that has been converted into a hotel so its not perfect but they did an ok job Dragging a big bag up the initial set of steps is awkward , Nice staff 
252324,TheWesley, Breakfast room far too loud with chatty youth and all their electoric communications playthings View from our room and from the local geography I infer most rooms was either looking into active office windows or at brick walls, location an excellent compromise of several considerations staff had veryclear and helpful answers to all our questions
252325,TheWesley, The area surrounding the hotel is shabby and rundown , Polite staff spotlessly clean rooms The renovations to the dinning room and reception area has made the hotel quite chic 
252326,TheWesley, We didn t like that the air conditioning unit was directly outside our room and was very noisy causing a restless night, The rooms were very comfortable staff were very helpful
252327,TheWesley, there was only one guy at the reception showing good approach others were weak room was smelling humidity, It was clean the only person trying to help us was good 
252328,TheWesley, If being picky just that the TV was not in front of the bed and we was not warned about the high volume of noise from the railway station Other than that perfect , Excellent service
252329,TheWesley, The bed was very uncomfortable But it was only one night , I was leaving the next day from the Euston Station The Wesley was 1 5 blocks away perfect
252330,TheWesley, The hotel room wasn t very big but for us this wasn t really an issue , Hotel staff were friendly and helpful the breakfast was a buffet style and normally this style breakfast can be bland and greesy but this was very nice all three morning we ate there The location in relation to Euston train station was fantastic no train noise in hotel but literally a 3 minute walk straight down the street
252331,TheWesley,No Negative, Liked the easy accessibility of the hotel from Euston train station Staff were very helpful welcoming and approachable both at the Reception and at breakfast excellent service delivery 
252332,TheWesley, The receptionists were not as helpful as i would have expected at a hotel of this kind As i stood at the desk the female receptionist asked the male receptionist whose passport this was pointing next the the computer the male receptionist just laughed and said oh it was a ladies i keep forgetting to give them back and they don t ask so I found this manner and uncaring attitude worrying I think that customer service definitely needs addressing The taxi service used by the hotel definitely over charges A journey to the mall cost me 20 to get there but return after midnight only cost 10 Information about late checkout was not noted on my reservation and in the space of the 24hrs that i spent at the hotel i had to correct the receptionist 5 times that i would be checking out at 12 30 rather than 11 30 It was not recorded on my reservation that i had paid upon arrival and as i was leaving i was asked for the receipt for my payment which luckily i had kept but was at the bottom of my suitcase this wasted time which i didn t have to waste and i find quite unorganized and incompetent When i returned home i had been charged twice for the room despite only giving my card to the receptionist once at the time of check in it did however state that it had been re credited to me but it was still charged twice , The room and layout was great Big window let in lots of light and there were plenty of power outlets to charge my phone camera and use my hair straighteners all at the same time The location is great and walking into the central sights is easy and quick 
252333,TheWesley, There was no external noise granted but the noise from inside was awful I could actually hear the man in the room next door s toilet habits CLEARLY It was like having somebody in the cupboard Slept very badly as a result , Location was perfect the bed was very comfortable 
252334,TheWesley, Original room was not what I booked and furniture poor standard and all worn Moved us to junior suite and bathroom had damp issues wifi not useable , Location and reception area nice
252335,TheWesley, 1 The A C was not working for three days and once it starts working it wasnt working properly 2 The shower tile was very small, 1 The location 2 The staff
252336,TheWesley, The area surrounding the hotel is quite run down and a bit scruffy , The location is fantastic so near Euston Railway Station The staff are unfailingly polite and efficient and the rooms are spotlessly clean The dining room and reception area has been renovated and are now quite chic without being pretentious 
252337,TheWesley,No Negative, The room was spotless and very comfortable staff at reception and restaurant delightful efficient and friendly I also admire the ethical purposes behind the hotel Food was very good 
252338,TheWesley, I gave a credit card when I checked in but was not allowed to charge dinner to my room This was very inconvenienmt and embarrassing , Convenience 
252339,TheWesley,No Negative, I liked everything The Wesley is a great place to stay My room was very well equipped and comfortable and the staff are very professional and friendly I will certainly be booking again 
252340,TheWesley, I stayed in a delux room but it was not like the delux rooms on their site So I was a bit surprised at how small the room was I was only staying two nights with my daughter so I didn t bother saying it to staff , Location was fab and the staff were lovely and very obliging
252341,TheWesley, Banging of doors during the night but I think it could be something that they can sort , As this was the first time we stayed at thewesley we enjoyed the stay and the staff was great 
252342,TheWesley, We had a superior room for three nights One of the lampshades beside the bed was totally broken when we arrived We told the reception about it the first day and also a couple of more times the following day It was never replaced during our stay , Very good breakfast 
252343,TheWesley, The bed was very uncomfortable with it being two mattresses stuck together Kept falling between them and the mattresses slopped in the middle , The room staff and food were brilliant 
252344,TheWesley, The staff were either apathetic and sarcastic in their attitude or did not have the language skills to deal with our concerns They did not inform us of how to use the facilities ie air con which i suspect was not on at the time and the cleanliness was questionable the pubic hair on the mirror was not ours , the location
252345,TheWesley, Unfortunately my payment via work wasn t processed and despite the receptionist stating he would contact my office the following morning this did not happen breakfast too expensive, great to have a room at the front have stayed before in a back facing room which was unbelievably noisy due to large office fans outside
252346,TheWesley, Strong smell of cigarette smoke when we first went into the room but staff dealt with it Shower was impossible to use without flooding the floor design flaw , Friendly helpful staff Location was excellent so close to Euston Station 
252347,TheWesley, matress colapsed needs replacing stain on the carpet from previous ocupants food stain on the wall looked like blackcurrent, good breakfast very close to tube stations friendly staff
252348,TheWesley, The black mould in the shower and the room was a bit tired needs redecorating The pub opposite was quite noisy The water in shower went hot and cold , Staff were friendly Breakfast was good with plenty of choice We could walk to everywhere we wanted to go to from there Near tubes 
252349,TheWesley, Thought it was expensive and not good value for money , Excellent location 
252350,TheWesley,No Negative, It was a treat for my 18 year old daughters birthday and they gave a complementary cake and card to her room Very nice touch
