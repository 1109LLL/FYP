427257,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Everything was great albeit a little pricey , The hotel s location was excellent and the look of the hotel was great loved the atmosphere of the hotel and surroundings Would definitely stay here again if I was to visit Amsterdam again 
427258,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel does not have air conditioning and we must open the window but the outside of the hotel is very noisy until 04 00am Finally we can not sleep very well and when open the window is also not safe for the children, I d like the location only
427259,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Very hot and noisy rooms When I asked for a double bed not twin I was told as I booked through Booking com I don t get a choice Rude and unknowledgable staff in the restaurant and bar , Nothing was to standard for the price 
427260,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was an attic room which was way too small and did not have air conditioning although a fan was provided There was one window that you couldn t get at to open while to open the other you had to stoop very low There was a burn mark caused by a hot iron in the carpet and though bathroom was also tiny it was adequate The room was not the room I thought I had reserved and when I mentioned this to the Receptionist I checked in with she said they were fully booked and could not give me an alternative room The hotel in general was very tired looking and in need of a good makeover When asked on checking out if I enjoyed my stay Iinformed the receptionist on duty of my overall disappointment and they offered me a taxi transfer to the airport which was appreciated Overall though a very disappointing hotel in an excellent location , Location
427261,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I had requested one soft mattress and one firm when booking I mentioned this on check in but the receptionist was so disorganised it took 15 minutes to check in although I had booked weeks before I don t think she understood Then she said it would be possible and they would see to it Then I had a call to say it was not possible So I got in touch with housekeeping and requested extra duvets over the mattress which made the bed a little softer but it was uncomfortable for me all three nights My wife was OK with her firm bed Bizarrely the restaurant is not available from about 7 00pm onwards as a TV current affairs programme is broadcast from there daily Actually it didn t matter to us as the notable art deco interior of the room has been ruined by the recent addition of banks of bright neon lights quite scandalous The bathroom was very antiquated it s a long time since I have seen an overbath shower with a plastic curtain If the enormous 1940 s radiator with exposed pipework had been removed there would almost be room for a proper walk in shower There were no toilet rolls only a tissue dispenser There was no air con and the fan provided did not work The lift probably dates from the 1940 s as well I will take only 4 people at a pinch and the door has to be opened manually Frankly for an hotel with this rating it is well below expected international standards Although the remaining art deco features are well worth seeing and the location is good there is very little else that is positive which can be said , The location is good 
427262,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I needed to print my boarding pass for my journey but the facilities were a bit primitive Staff were helpful and friendly though Had originally booked a single room but found it too cramped and being on the top floor it was very hot Fortunately they were able to give me a upgraded room by paying a bit extra , The breakfast was excellent and the location was perfect
427263,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It was quite noisey at night but was expected Rooms also got very hot at night which made it uncomfortable to sleep , Location Staff very friendly and helpful Very Clean Great breakfast and bar 
427264,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel bar was out of bounds during our stay owing to a TV program being made there We chose the hotel because as a big group we thought it would be a convenient place to start and finish so everyone could meet The closure of the bar caused problems as other bars nearby were crowded and noisy places to wait while everyone got together Had we known this we would have chosen another hotel , Desk staff were friendly and helpful The hotel was well placed in a square for bars and nightlife 
427265,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel was quite tired and a bit dated in parts They filmed a tv chat show in the restaurant in the evenings and so the area was quite worn out The disabled access was through a side service entrance which was not ideal , The location was good
427266,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The couch needs loose covers Cleaned it myself after day 2 with baby wipes The loo flush was blocked took several flushes each time used , In the centre of Rembrandt s square Music playing happy laughter Our view was special Room serviced each day A welcome courtesy drink in the foyer free to guests perfect to cool down after a day seeing sights 
427267,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room 602 which I was allocated as a superior room was quite dark and claustrophobic due to it s peculiar shape and limited window area I changed rooms after 2 nights The new room was much better , The mattress was the most comfortable I ve ever experienced in a hotel 
427268,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The general hubbub of the Square is bearable and the ear plugs help But on one of our nights the beating of drums in the square at 2am hard to turn a deaf ear to would have had Rembrandt turning over in his grave , 29th May 1st June A character hotel on Rembrandt Square where you can feel the throbbing vibrant heartbeat of Amsterdam City It is very centrally located from where you can either meander round the canals or wander off to some of the major sites Royal Palace Dam Square Anne Frank s House Old Church Rembrandt s House Rijksmuseum We had a lovely room on the 6th Floor with great views over the Square and City Thank you to the staff at RH Schiller for making it a very memorable holiday for us 
427269,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We didn t realise that Rembrandtplein was a party place at night It was really hard to sleep the first night due to revellers outside , Loved the hotel and staff 
427270,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Due to the age of the hotel the lifts did not operate very well One of the 2 lifts broke down during our stay , the staff were welcoming the breakfast served at the restaurant were excellent so were the waiting staff the location is very convenient for trams and within walking distance to the central train station and other facilities I like the design of the hotel especially with the artwork and deco All in all an enjoyable stay at the hotel 
427271,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The bathtub was uncomfortable I much rather have a shower The toilet paper dispenser seemed a cheap device to save on toilet paper , It was a good size room with a view to lovely private gardens Good light to read on 
427272,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Forgot to put towels in room had to wait 20 minutes dripping wet for them Don t really understand customer service Assistant Director Miri Schuurman didn t seem very concerned about the situation Should have offered to do more to assure our satisfaction I found him to be quite arogant , LocAtion was central to city Nice large room but very outdated and worn looking Furniture was quite inexpensive and cheap 
427273,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I didn t lik the bed I were given single bed and they joint in from middle That s was not comfortable for me to sleep, Outstanding location and tram station is opposite to hotel soo your travel is very easy and hotel is surrounded by bars so it was amazing it s a center of city Rooms were big very much comfortable I would love to stay there again Services are too good Staff were very much helpful and friendly
427274,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room got a little warm and whilst this was okay for us because we were at the back and were able to open the window I imagine those who felt uncomfortable with having their windows open at night would perhaps struggle with the heat of the rooms , The hotel was in an amazing location Initially was put in a standard room with a twin bed when I had actually booked a superior room with a double bed When I went to enquire at reception about this the staff went to great lengths that I received the room I paid for There was friendly and welcoming service throughout the entire trip and the hotel itself had beautiful old fashioned features mixed with modern and clean interior in the rooms Furthermore I read reviews regarding it being too noisy at this location however I had no personal experience of this Couldn t hear anything from the room we stayed in on the back of the hotel and they also provide ear plugs in the rooms Couldn t have asked for much more 
427275,NH Amsterdam Schiller, This hotel is very far from being a 4 star hotel at first glance when you enter it looks lovely but once you leave the reception area and head towards the lifts to go to your room it becomes grotty dirty and well past it s sell by date Our stay in Amsterdam was a present from myself to my husband for our 35th wedding anniversary and I can definitely say one that we will never forget Amsterdam is wonderful and unforgettable this hotel is awful and definitely will not be forgotten but for all the wrong reasons The lift walls and floor the corridor walls and floor where all dirty and stained and the room floors and walls were the same there was a layer of dust on everything in the room which remained for all of our stay and was never cleaned The enamel sink in the bathroom was very badly cracked and chipped and there was a thick layer of lime scale around the taps and shower head The bed linen was never changed during our stay despite an accidental spill of coke on the bed which left considerable stains on the sheet and pillow case This is definitely NOT a 4 star hotel and would struggle to be a bad 3 star NOW to top all of this off Monday to Friday the only area in the hotel for food and drink in the evening time becomes a TV STUDIO and guests are unable to obtain the normal services that you would expect to be available for hotel guests UNBELIEVABLE if we had wanted to stay in a bed and breakfast or a hostel we would have paid a bed and breakfast price or a hostel price not what we paid Yes we got a slightly better price by going through Booking com but we still paid the asking price for as we thought a good standard of hotel Next time can I believe what Booking com tells me , My husband and I thought the breakfast was excellent but after having seen mice yes mice running around quite openly in the area where the buffet breakfast is laid out in the morning for 3 4 hours over the tables that we ate and drank at over and around dishes and glasses that we ate and drank from this area is also were food is served during the day and the bar area I m afraid we were shocked and alarmed at the lack of food hygiene standards if this is what we could see openly what was behind the scenes we felt it was safer not to eat or drink in the hotel Mice in one area of the hotel also tells you that they are probably elsewhere as well and if there are mice running around in the open what other vermin problems could they also have so I m afraid I was very unhappy in our bedroom and afraid to turn off the lights and go to sleep I understand that mice and rats can be a problem in Amsterdam but I m afraid hotels especially a so called 4 star one needs to ensure health and hygiene standards within their property for their guests and they have a responsibility and a legal obligation to do so NH are a large worldwide group so pest control should not be a problem to them if the attitude of their staff is anything to go by they just do not care 
427276,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The square in which it is located is very busy and can get loud This didn t bother us much as the hotel do provide earplugs to block it out My only main concern is that they decided to do some maintenance work while we were staying and no amount of ear plugs can block out the sound of drills in the morning , Staff were really friendly and the location is brilliant Everything is on the doorstep and all main attractions are walking distance There are trams and busses running right outside the hotel so it is so easy to get around 
427277,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Wifi waa horrible even though i purchased the premium wifi 40 euro for 4 nights but it seems they limit the bandwidth How can they claim fast speed internet for media browsing vidoes etc This was reeeeeally annoying Oh and i was very happy they gave me the same room I always stay in but some of the furniture especially the sofa bed needs renovation , One of my favorite hotels in amsterdam Location is amazing Best square to stay on in amsterdam
427278,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room there were holes in the floor under the carpet Horrible shampoo Hair drier smelled badly Poor quality of iron ironing board, Good location good stuff
427279,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The square can get crowded and noisy especially on weekends but the hotel staff was very accommodating in moving us to rooms that were not facing the square and away from the front of the hotel They have a show in the bar area each night so don t expect to have a drink before going out to dinner No big deal but just a word to the wise , The location was excellent for getting to any part of the city There s a tram stop right across the square from the hotel We ate at several of the restaurants close to the hotel and enjoy the variety service and prices 
427280,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room was very tired The bathroom was poor and needed renovating Old shower curtain sink cracked and very disappointing No bar in the evening as they run a TV show from the hotel , The breakfast was OK
427281,NH Amsterdam Schiller, See above Also hot water rather violent but better than not having any at all , Staff were very helpful when we asked to change rooms which we did because of the noise from the after party going on downstairs Hotel site neglected to mention that there is a live talk show hosted every week night from about 10pm which means metal detectors and security guards in the lobby and consequent noise Fun if you want that sort of thing but unexpected However our new room on the fifth floor was delightful quiet view over the rooms of Amsterdam and comfortable beds Great central location for walking about the city and catching trams plus street entertainment and Watchmen sculpture also clouds of marijuana smoke from people chilling out in the Rembrandtsplein which might put some people off 
427282,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Compared to North American standards rooms are smaller Buffet breakfast was expensive for what was on offer , Great location Tram stop is almost at the door Walking distance to main shopping areas Variety of restaurants at your door 
427283,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room was too small and has noisy because it s facing streets , I ve been regretting that the price I booked is very expensive than the price my colleague booked via company agent and the room is bigger than mine 
427284,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The original room we were allocated due to not having a view but this was soon changed , All the food was well prepared presented well and all the meals we had tasted lovely Staff were very welcoming and nothing was too much bother for them as we requested several things and they were so willing We requested a room change and this was done as soon as was possible for them at no extra cost Barbara was the member of staff we saw the most and she was absolutely wonderful in making us feel comfortable 
427285,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Rooms and bathroom need some TLC Windows are not sound proof If you are okay with smelling cigarettes into your bedroom from outside and noise from the streets and fellow occupants then go for it , Great location Friendly and helpful staff 
427286,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Location was incredible We upgraded to a suite but beware if you have trouble sleeping with noise the noise from outside is loud every night Best location and close to literally everything you would want bars restaurants cinema 
427287,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Requested a double room but when we arrived we were told that the double rooms available would not be suitable because of their proximity to a green room being used for 24 hr filming purposes We were offered a really grotty twin room instead which my girlfriend burst in to tears upon seeing so I had no choice but to pay for an upgrade Complained to booking com but never heard back Feel extorted and will not use either nh shiller or booking com again in the future , Location was good in busy central area They leave earplugs beside the bed 
427288,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, The hotel made us feel very welcome for my birthday and even upgraded us very welcoming staff and friendly bar staff even gave us some of the local snacks to try 
427289,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Rooms were plain Live music extremely loud every night Bath leaking Single beds pushed together to make a double Horrible view when told we were upgraded Construction from early in the morning ,No Positive
427290,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The noise from downstairs was unbearable we were moved around because of a mistake by the hotel staff Then when we finally had a room we got no sleep because of the show being directly below us we complained and they stated that they may be able to move us even though they stated that the hotel was fully booked when we arrived The room we stayed in should not be a guest staying room ,No Positive
427291,NH Amsterdam Schiller, That the bar was closed off during the evenings because there was a live TV Talk Show being recorded there , Excellent staff ideal central hotel Can be noisy in front rooms so best request rooms at the back The fact that the hotel supply earplugs tells a story Breakfasts excellent great choice Room could have been a bit larger but it depends how much time you want to spend in it Would certainly go back there again 
427292,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Although breakfast was self service it doesn t mean tables clean and clear themselves Breakfast staff lacking Not able to use the bar due to rtl show and not given al alternative until the last evening when we were told we could go to the Schiller Caf next door Hotel guests were let down in preference of the going on around the filming The noise on the square at night was incredible and people should have been warned about this I thought the windows had double glazing obviously not , Friendly staff at reception Clean rooms although small 
427293,NH Amsterdam Schiller, They had twice a live show at the bar for a TV station They keep the noise to minimum but after the show the dressing room was near the quest rooms , Great location Could walk almost everywhere and there was a train station across the hotel 
427294,NH Amsterdam Schiller, NH Schiller is the host of RTL Night Show from Mondays to Fridays Rooms adjacent to the dressing rooms green rooms and party rooms should NOT be given to visitors customers tourists due to EXTREME noise by people and staff , Great location and value for this location 
427295,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Requested a double bed was given two singles then heard a member of staff checking in others that there were no single beds available in the building Frustrating , Early check in 
427296,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was a little chilly, Great location comfortable bed historical building and front rooms have a wonderful view of square windows have its own special charm
427297,NH Amsterdam Schiller, NH hotel 4 offering most basic wifi email only effectively You can upgrade for c 9 per day minimum Most basic NH hotel i have stayed at Would rate 3 50 euro demand on check on to cover mini bar usage Unacceptable Apparently is an RTL live venue check out the screens and lighting in the bar breakfast area Problem is that it forgot it IS an hotel , Flexible breakfast timings
427298,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, I booked this to celebrate my girlfriend s birthday were delighted that staff put a card balloons and some chocolate art in the room lovely start to our break in Amsterdam 
427299,NH Amsterdam Schiller, That breakfast wasn t included For the money we paid I think breakfast should have been included , The beds were very comfortable Lovely view from the 6th floor Staff were very friendly and helpful 
427300,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The only problem we had was the lift door the door opens outwards so you cant see anything outside Unfortunately I hit someone when opening the door to come out as they were walking past , the hotel is set in a great location with plenty of places to eat and drink round the square plus you also have the hotel bar and restaurant and the staff could not have been more helpful Plenty of sights and shops close bye Don t think anything was more than a leisurely 30 min walk from hotel but plenty to see and do on your walk 
427301,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room lay out was a bit tight but that was just our room the room next door was fine The only other thing was the hotels neighbours were of the herbal essence kind But wasnt an issue as our room was on the back of the hotel no view but if your looking out your window at Amsterdam your wasting the experience of being there I would probably advise a room on the rear due the building opposite having a advertising screen the size of a modest 4 bedroom detached house I can imagine that would cause an ever changing irritating glow through the curtains unless they are super thick Ours was reasonbly thick but dont think they would hide that sign Would not put me off the hotel as the benefit from the view from the front would out way it , Location was perfect Everything was within walking distance even the train station to the airport still quite a walk wouldnt recommend on a rainy day 10 15min If I was to go back I wouldn t stay anywhere else Staff were very helpfull Nice friendly welcoming environment Turns out its the homebase of a television talkshow call RTL late night did not cause any sleeping issues 
427302,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Old building with old furniture noisy wooden floor old bath room no heating in the room temperature was around 4 Dec heater located in the bath room Old elevator, Location and staff
427303,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I arrived late so the only rooms available were above Rembrandtplein The windows did not have double glazing against the noise At 05 00 the wind started blowing and I was woken up by the noise of the flagpole outside my window banking around in its socket I was able to transfer to another room in the back at 05 00 In this room the bathroom floor flooded each time I took a shower because the shower curtain is not long enough Also each time I showered the water went from too cold to too hot and back again every 5 10 seconds When checking out I told the reception about all this and was given a 15 discount Even after the discount the price was a bit under 150 euros per night I don t think I got value for money and did not expect this of a NH hotel ,No Positive
427304,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Staff on the bar are very rude I gave a girl bar staff 20e for two cokes and she refused to give me 14e change Said I gave her only 5euro note I pointed out that the drinks were 6euro she changed her story and said I gave her a five euro note and one euro coin Terrible for business the bar staff were very rude, Nice view in room
427305,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Some noise from the square outside during night This I knew would happen however maybe in the future can the hotel change windows to more soundproof ones Breakfast could be a bit more exciting and with less sweets , Nice personal and clean hotel 
427306,NH Amsterdam Schiller, so noisy until 5am in the morning in a weekday room so tiny queen bed and not a king size pictures of the room not what we got offered, I liked the breakfast the location on the Rembrandtplein square
427307,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, We had a large bedroom with spacious comfy bed A surprise was having an ironing board and iron Also there was kettle and coffee making machine with assortments of coffee s etc A minibar which you obviously have to pay extra for The bathroom was large with a bath with a shower the towels were soft and white changed on a daily basis if required Ample toiletries are supplied and replenished daily The staff at the hotel are all very polite and helpful a good place to start if you have any queries The hotel is well positioned for bars and restaurants with pubic transport right on your doorstep 
427308,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room and bathroom were grotty the condition of the hotel overall was old the wifi we paid for and didn t work and no one thinks to let you know on arrival, Not much
427309,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We couldn t use the bar in the evening due to television program To access this facility it was proposed to us a payment of 25 euro per Person We made a complaint at reception that was totally ignored , Location and access to the city were very good
427310,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I think the main front doors should be automatic as i walked into them a few times , Beds very very comfortable Reception staff all polite and helpful 
427311,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room we had was fine but as it was over looking the main square and the taxi rank right in front of the hotel the noise didn t stop until about three in the morning new windows to block the noise is a must,No Positive
427312,NH Amsterdam Schiller, This Hotel hosts the talk show RTL Which can make it difficult sometimes accessing certain areas of the Hotel when they are there , The overall stay was excellent all amenities were great food too 
427313,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Leaving , Fantastic breakfast and all the staff were very friendly the elevator stopped working the morning we were leaving so we received two drinks complementary which was a nice touch
427314,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Staff are absolutely fantastic Especially the guy with the blonde hair on reception forgot his name sorry the last 3 visits to the Schiller he couldn t do enough for us top guy From the Halliwells 
427315,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Unfortunately the bars and clubs below our window didn t close until 5am so the noise was loud throughout the night Ear plugs are provided , The staff were lovely the room was a great size and immaculate The bed was huge 
427316,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was way too small and didn t look like a 4 stars hotel Dirt on the wall floor and seats I want with my partner and we had two single duvet I ve asked for a double one but it wasn t possible I ve paid 166 but I found that it was overpriced, Staff was polite and location really good
427317,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room was very small and dated We had to negotiate a very steep staircase down to the room The rooms shown on the website were much larger modern and brighter In the evening the brasserie was taken over by live TV radio show this wasn t mentioned ,No Positive
427318,NH Amsterdam Schiller, That we had to pay 50 city tax for cleaning of bins etc in a country that isn t ours Bit cheeky tbh, The bed was amazing and the room was really nice and had the view of the square
427319,NH Amsterdam Schiller, On our first stay our room was quite roomy and had had tea coffee facilities On our second stay we had a pokey room down steep stairs and no facilities It was okay for one night , Great location Close to eateries and other tourist attractions Staff very friendly and helpful 
427320,NH Amsterdam Schiller, You should check your invoice a few times Because when we turned back we realised that they took the accommodation payment twice And thats a problem if you are going for work , Location was perfect and also breakfast was good 
427321,NH Amsterdam Schiller, 2 single beds instead of 1 double or kingsize Also I wanted smoked salmon at breakfast mushroom tomato sticks but when they run out I asked for some but waited 15 min for them to be replaced by that point I d eat food I didn t even want, Bed was comfy but only problem was it was 2 singles instead of 1 double for price paid would expect king size bed for me my wife
427322,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The bar was poor service we ordered drinks and 30 minutes later we still did not get our drinks so moved on to another place, The location is amazing Staff are very helpful and friendly The room are good sizes and large beds The view out the square is great and buzzing with people and life
427323,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Some staff are not engaging with customers borderline rude Wasn t impressed with not being able to access bar on our first night because of some radio show Room we were given was no bigger than a matchbox and as we found out later that night was 10ft from radio show after party lots of shouting and banging doors at 2 in the morning The room was also freezing cold because heavy curtains block radiator which you have to keep closed as room is overlooked by other windows in some alleyway We rang down for another bed cover as the one on the bed was paper thin We were moved to another appropriate room for our second night which better reflected the cost Advoid room 118 at all cost if you have to stay in this room your bill should be discounted Also they do not communicate that they charge 50 euro mini bar deposit on your card when you check in that still hasn t been returned as we did not use minibar , Breakfast was good something for everyone location was very good easy to access everything 
427324,NH Amsterdam Schiller, still cant use the hotel bar in the evening as they broadcast a live chat show but guests are invited to pay to go and eat there but a late night drink at your own hotel is always welcome, Easy check in good central location lots of bars and restaurants nearby easy to walk to most attractions
427325,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We were not aware that every week day the bar restaurant would be closed by 7 pm and not reopened due to taping of tv show Even superior rooms were very small , Location staff were very good 
427326,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Very very expensive Room small and very basic For the price the room should have wowed me 2 single beds pushed together Hairdryer very poor and wired into bath room so couldn t dry hair while someone else in bathroom even then trying to dry hair in damp steamed up room Room at back of hotel Shower curtain didn t go right round shower tray so water always ran onto the floor To get breakfast additional cost on top of the very high price ,No Positive
427327,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The attention to details in terms of cleanliness On the surface it looks clean however I suggest that the housekeeping supervisor go for spot checks The toilet brush is very old rusty and dirty glasses are not replaced and the bed sheets are not turned over I stayed on the first floor so my room was noisy due to the TV show live broadcast from the ground floor except weekends Please take my comment as a constructive feedback I really loved your hotel and I would probably book it again due to the location friendliness of the staff and the customer service , The location is amazing very central and a walking distance to the tramway The bed is very comfortable and the staff very helpful smiley and professional I do recommend this hotel 
427328,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The superior room was a little smaller than expected The group I travelled with had a standard double room and I failed to see the difference between standard and superior so I was a little disappointed having paid extra , Hotel location is excellent in the heart of the square with a vast selection of bars shops restaurant and coffee shops at your reach Room was confortable and very clean 
427329,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Very loud at night due to the coffee shops below our windows Need to invest in double glazing Shouldnt have to rely on free ear plugs really , Good sized room and comfy bed Nice touch by the staff who provided a card balloons and chocolate treats on arrival for my wife s 50th birthday Much appreciated
427330,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Staff were friendly and polite Rooms were decent size the pillows are soft and fluffy which I like all round wonderful stay Location is perfect everything on your doorstep Try vapianos about a 3 minute walk italian food to die for 
427331,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, The Receptionist was so helpful and such a friendly man helped us to book excursion when he was on his way home top man Beautiful view from our window hotel location is great stayed here 5 times now
427332,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Bed was a little too hard , The location was perfect My husband and I were traveling with someone who was Dutch so he helped us around Amsterdam but we would have been able to find our way thanks to the location The tram stop was right in front The hotel was was very clean and the staff was friendly as well 
427333,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The only thing I could complain about is the pillows not the comfiest But wouldn t put me off staying there, In the best location we ve stayed in Amsterdam my 4th time here and my boyfriend s 8th Noisy at night but provided ear plugs which worked great Big TV in room and very clean Staff were friendly and always someone at the desk 
427334,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Bit of a cock up with the room booked a double for my wife and I was given a lovely room overlooking the square bit 2 single beds Took a while to sort and they seemed slightly disgruntled that I had a problem with it Once sorted rest of the stay was very pleasant , Breakfast was pleasant and staff were friendly and accommodating after initial inconvenience 
427335,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Bathroom could do with improving and modernising, Good location request upper floor on the back of the hotel No noise heard at night Very friendly staff always say hello and happy to help
427336,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel hosted a party one of the four nights we stayed and the noise was ridiculous until 4 a m A second night the music was also a bit loud bass thumping so the walls vibrated The complimentary earplugs on our night stands should have been a clue of what was to come , The staff were excellent Friendly and very helpful 
427337,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Bed was a little hard for my personal preference and it was two singles pushed together But not a big deal, Great location with excellent transport links if you wanted them Could walk to all the main attractions in under 20 30 minutes Staff upgraded our room and were helpful answering all of our questions 
427338,NH Amsterdam Schiller, nothing bothered me about this hotel , my boyfriend proposed to me in the bar of the hotel staff went out of their way to make it special for us They surprised us with rose petals when we went back to the room and even got us some complimentary drinks with our room service Everything was perfect from start to finish 
427339,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We had a room overlooking the square but the noise of drunken people and police car sirens forced us to change to a room at the rear of the hotel Bar prices are scandalous a beer and a soft drink 19 , Location was excellent
427340,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Breakfast was not included and they want to charge for 1 person 20 dollars plus to that I ve asked for a double bed and got 2 twin beds I ve ask them 3 times to fix that and they didn t i was very disappointed of that they had electricity break for 4 hours and I ve ask to have a late check out because of that and they did me a lot of trouble until i convince them that i m right , best location on Rembrandt squire better then the Dum squire the hotel and the room looks very good wonderful view from the room its actually fun to be at the room with this view 
427341,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Nothing genuinely couldn t fault it at all , The hotel is brilliant perfect location the staff are friendly the hotel is clean the rooms are modern and the breakfast is brilliant No complaints at all 
427342,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Our room was not cleaned once in three days of having been there , The location could not be better especially if you enjoy the club scene but perfectly situated near the Dam Square and trams right across the road 
427343,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Toilet was very cold Under the bed dirt slippers from the previous guest Dust on the bedside tables Bar was closed for hotel gusts , Only location 
427344,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Radiator didn t work but was fixed as soon as I mentioned it to reception Likewise hairdryer didnt work but I soon got given another one , Service was very attentive friendly staff
427345,NH Amsterdam Schiller, free wifi was barely functional basic surfing of the websites was difficult , the location is incredible right in the center of lost of entertaining places food at many hours of the day easy travel to most places also walk its such a beautiful city to walk
427346,NH Amsterdam Schiller, dosent have air condition in the hotel the stuff made jokes about me between them when I girst arrived the bathtub was full of hair I only hope the sheets were clean , only the location 
427347,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The rooms are small and any rooms to the front of the hotel are extremely noisy I specifically requested a room away from lifts and stairs and in a quite part of the hotel when I made the initial booking I was allocated a room directly beside a lift and stairs when we arrived When I went to reception and requested a room away from lifts and stairs I was given a room at the front of the hotel which turned out to be very noisy at night It was that bad cleaning staff left ear plugs beside each bed everyday , The location was fine 
427348,NH Amsterdam Schiller, There is a televised live show that takes place Monday to Friday with bands etc in the restaurant I didn t see this advertised when booking and would have liked to I was up on the 4th floor and could hear the loud band it usually finishes up around midnight Also if your room is facing the square prepare for a loud enough night the hotel is surrounded by lots of bars , Overall the room was very clean and comfortable Plenty of space for a single room Magazines were provided in the room and if you needed phone chargers etc all you need to do is call to ask for one Hotel in great location right opposite the tram stop 
427349,NH Amsterdam Schiller, There is a TV show filmed in the hotel bar 5 nights a week so access becomes restricted It s ok if you want to pay the 30 Euros to be part of the crowd If you just want to sit and relax with your wife and a few drinks it s pretty bad, Very large bed in the Junior Suite
427350,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Incredibly noisy Hotels in central locations should pay more attention to sound insulation which was non existent single glazing wooden frame windows , Comfortable bed
427351,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel was originally 3 buildings Because of this the floor on which our room was was not at the same level so after we got off the elevator we had to walk down 5 steps and then 13 very very steep steps illegal in the U S and vice versa This was not fun with luggage although the front desk man helped us , Great location in center of city but not in the rowdiest area and presence of tram line 4 and 9 made getting around easy even though walking is easy as well Buffet breakfast spread was exceptional but not included in price Windows faced on quiet courtyard Wifi worked very well 
427352,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Location was excellent staff were amazing very helpful and friendly the whole experience was brilliant we will definitely be going back to this hotel This trip was for my brothers 21st and the staff surprised us with birthday card balloons and chocolates all set up in our room when we checked in attention to detail was outstanding 
427353,NH Amsterdam Schiller, They do not have enough staff in the hotel They do not have a concierge facility which was annoying as I was paying more thab 250 usd per night without any facility No air conditioning in the room also The standard room is too small so i had to upgrade to a junior suite and pay extra which was ok , I liked the location of the hotel 
427354,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, The breakfast was delightful the staff was very nice and helpful The hotel located in a great location near the most attractions of the city We were two and the room was dense 
427355,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Over priced rooms are plain with very uncomfortable beds provided with ear plugs as you can here everybody in the rooms around you Staff are miserable Only thing going for this hotel is its location , Location
427356,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I can only recommend location The hotel is pretty old and smells Rooms are not even similar to the pics on booking com rooms are pretty small and really dirty The money you will pay is NOT worth it all Stuffs are really rude and not friendly I visited amsterdam four times and the last hotel experience was the worst Let me explain like this me and my girlfriend were staying in nh schiller and my two friends of mine staying across the street of my hotel which is Nh caransa Both of the hotels are located same location and same owner So during our staying second day some thief got into the room and stole Louis Vuitton bag passport 2500euro hermes belt and more stolen stuff cost at least 10 thousand euros And we went downstairs to complain to front desk They did not even call police because of their reputation They told us to go police station we have nothing to do and only house keeping got into room and supervisor And they already know we are leaving tomorrow they did not search anybody or watch cameras even they want to watch the cameras they don t have any cameras on the floors They told us we didn t lock the door thats how they defense themselves It doesn t make sence for me to spend 800euros for 3 night in 4 star hotel and some one came to stole my stuff in the Hotel room So why am i staying in 4 star hotel and pay more I rather to go stay in some hostel for 10 euros Do not go this hotel in both of the locations they are organized thief they don t have a camera for purpose on the floors So this is my experience of this hotel save your money go stay in different hotel , Only location is okay 
427357,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The Hotel ruined the weekend for us they got our booking completely wrong on arrival all of our party were two sharing in twin rooms and we had a set rate per room which we all budgeted for When we arrived many were put in single occupancy rooms which not only carries a different charge but means people were separated and caused all sorts of confusion Most importantly the charging for each room was completely out and one of our party was charged twice which currently is still not resolved with the hotel not looking to resolve I will be making a formal complaint , We really liked the location was well suited for our trip and was close but not too close to all sights and the square was very lively 
427358,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I didn t event sleep in the hotel where I booked a room I was sent to the one opposite in the street that had no charm at all I got a free upgrade it would have been a scandal otherwise but the room I got didn t even have a double bed just two single beds My boyfriend and I didn t really enjoy to sleep separately on holiday And the terrace wasn t clean because there were cigarette butts on the floor And the hand cream sample in the bathroom had already been used by someone before we arrived We won t return for sure , Central Location View from the room
427359,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It was certain discomfort due to shooting of a TV show that what local security lad told me , Stayed for 2 nights For me it was a good last moment chance I booked the room in airport just after arrival With a discount it was good money for the proposed value Breakfast was really good despite of the limited choice the quality of the food is above the average Location is OK and fits my destination just perfectly 
427360,NH Amsterdam Schiller, No air conditioning and it was HOT somewhat sloppy room cleaning slow response to reasonable requests e g for a shower mat a firm pillow etc , Excellent breakfast historical building central location large bedroom 
427361,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I did not like that there was no air conditioning in the rooms and the windows had no screens While it was noisy it did not prevent me from sleeping ear plugs were provided along with a fan All things considered a good two nights, The location of the hotel for getting to all the major points of interest is great The tram stop is just accross Rembrandt Square This is a lively area with lots of hotels and restaurants A great area to sit and people watch after a busy day of sightseeing 
427362,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Much more than I am used to paying but I was so pleased with the end result that I felt it was worth it , Very busy location overlooking Rembrandt s statue and the characters from the Night Watch which was a bonus as I felt safe returning on my own after dark Very noisy when windows were open but ear plugs were provided Fantastic breakfast good range of gluten free stuff as well and very friendly and helpful staff Could leave luggage on my last day it was kept securely with a receipt Good WiFi Lovely old hotel with history and character 
427363,NH Amsterdam Schiller, As other reviews have mentioned it is insanely noisy at night and we did find it hard to sleep although the earplugs provided by the hotel helped It s worth bearing in mind that this is the price you pay for such a central location but perhaps some double glazing would come in handy , The hotel is in an incredible location and made it so easy to get out and explore the city The hotel itself is nicely decorated and the staff were all lovely Good varied breakfast too 
427364,NH Amsterdam Schiller, A 4 star hotel should really have A C especially if you re located next to a bar and a night club so you dont have to open the windows to get som fresh air , Loved the location best in Amsterdam if you like some vibrancy And the staff was really nice too 
427365,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Was really disappointed with the room it was tiny just enough room for a double bed because of the pictures on here I feel a bit deceived due to it costing 490 for 3 nights It also smelt damp from the bathroom and it was soo hot I was sweating getting ready we asked to be moved but the hotel was fully booked so they sent us a fan instead as there s no air con Wouldn t book again , Breakfast and location were good but that s all you pay for 
427366,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The weather was glorious so air conditioning in the rooms would have been helpful A walk in shower would have been useful for the elderly members of our party, The staff were all very helpful and the service was excellent Delicious breakfast good choice
427367,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I wasn t aware I had to pay an extra 50euros when arriving on top of the cost of the hotel Gutted as had to come out of spending money leaving me on a budget If I had known I would have brought extra cash I was there and checked in just thought this was unfair Also wasn t the right room I booked Fuming, Staff was very friendly room was clean good location
427368,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was poorly lit and the hair drying stopped working after a minute The safe didn t work and the description said large double bed and it was actually two single beds pushed together and two single covers , The view of the city was lovely and the location was great Comfy bed 
427369,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It s very noisy if you don t wear the earplugs you won t sleep at all the thin glasses windows are also not modern and this means you can not control the temperature of your room and noise of course I had a superior room but the bathroom was tiny and with not a good lighting not to mention the sofa dirty , Very good position in the centre of Rembrandtplein square close to tram and many museums shops and restaurants
427370,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We were couple and informed them head of time we wanted a double bed however we were met with two singles and had to request a new room Second room was tiny , Excellent breakfast highly recommend 
427371,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I did not like that there was an additional authorization hold on my Credit Card This amounted to almost double billing of a couple of thousand dollars It also tied up my credit card for several days , Location
427372,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Hotel took a huge deposit when I checked in and didn t really explain properly I assumed that they would take the price of the stay from that and give me back the difference instead they took a 500 desposit by card and released it to me after I paid for my stay in full Not too much of a big deal but it could have been explained better , The bed was extremely comfortable slept very well Location was fantastic Breakfast buffet was great too 
427373,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Bathrooms are filthy Found a mouse in the room at 12am and was therefore moved to a smaller room couldn t have asked for better compensation Rooms opposing the square are way too noisy until 4am , Location balcony and price 
427374,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Our room was facing the plaza and it was extremely noisy The days that we were visiting were very hot and there was no air condition in the room , Good location
427375,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room is ridiculous small and therefore way too expensive Its like sleeping in a closet Furthermore the hotel is quite dated understatement especially the elevators stairs colours floors heater etc Although the hotel needs a metamorphose the bed is comfortable and the hotel is clean When checking in they ask for a deposit of 50 Euro even if you have paid the expensive room already Lack of service I think , The location and view are both more than perfect The hotel is quite dated but bed is good and room is clean 
427376,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We had to change room as our first room was very small made us feel claustrophobic as it didn t have any view at all It was an expensive room too so we expected better , Hotel is in a great location especially if you want to be in the centre of the fun lively nightlife scene It s also very close to the main sightseeing attractions museums 
427377,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Booking in process was unusually complex and obscure for some reason had to pay 50 euros extra in advance in case we used the minibar During my stay I had a brief question to ask at reception but unfortunately had to wait behind a couple booking in and that is a marathon process why The beds were comfortable but the duvet was a bit too hot , Breakfast was A1 Lovely room we were upgraded don t ask why because I don t know but we had a very spacious and comfortable room with a gorgeous bathroom Good atmosphere and friendly staff 
427378,NH Amsterdam Schiller, 1 There was a large piece of plaster fallen off the wall on the floor This was not repaired 2 I was there on Sat night facing the plaza Too loud and the shade in the room did not effectively cover the pulsating big screen advertisement continually flashing 24 7 If I stay and the Schiller again I would not stay in a room facing the plaza ,No Positive
427379,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It wouldve been better to have an air condition , The room is very comfortable The staff are very friendly and helpful the breakfast is great I had so much fun staying at this hotel 
427380,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Staff were not very helpful The hotel was shabby and dated The rooms at the front are very noisy and the room we was in was directly below someones room which was very noisy , The location was good 
427381,NH Amsterdam Schiller, No air conditioning in rooms but windows open for breeze Noisy front rooms from park but great people watching , Plenty of hot water in the shower and bath Location of course 
427382,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I am only commenting in this box as constructive criticism Air conditioning would have been welcomed as the temperatures reached 31 degrees exceptional weather not really normal in Holland That is the only thing I could mention and it wasn t really a problem as a fan was provided in the room in the wardrobe should you require it , Room was immaculate Very well equipped Breakfast had all you could wish for A great selection and fresh It hadn t been hanging around for ages Hotel in great position and although right on the square was very quiet Staff were very welcoming and helpful and hotel had a warm friendly feel 
427383,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We clearly asked for twin beds in both rooms This was not provided which caused immense embarrassment stress for us They offered a derisory discount of 10 of one room price and free dog Given that people had to sleep in the floor to avoid embarrassment this was insulting The hotel is very noisy , Two staff members were kind despite the managers attitude
427384,NH Amsterdam Schiller, No air conditioning so room was sweltering And although room service advertised til 11pm they were shut at 10 30pm Id stay here for leisure but not again for a work trip ,No Positive
427385,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Really there was no issues with anything We had an awesome time in Amsterdam and were only so happy we had a roof over our head at the end of a busy days sightseeing , The hotel was close to public transport We were lucky our room was at the back of the building so noise wasnt a problem as mentioned in other peoples reviews 
427386,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I didn t like that othe first room we were in was a dump The wall paper peeling the wall had big cracks in it mould on the ceilings and filthy carpet, I liked that when I complained about a room we were given another room and the staff were pleasant 
427387,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Hotel is tired Room furniture is worn Shower was tricky Really needs an overhaul , Staff were SO helpful and accommodating Bedding was comfy with crisp white sheets Overlook the tired rooms and stay here Location is perfect 
427388,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Earplugs on the bedside table are a warning Hotel is in a very noisy location with people shouting in the street in the early hours There is no air con so you have a choice between breathing while lying awake or trying to sleep while being stifled DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL FOR A BUSINESS TRIP , Difficult to pick out anything to say in this category except that the location is central
427389,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Was given a room on the 2nd floor Didn t have air conditioning Was provided a small electrical fan and balcony doors were able to be opened So still quite bearable as weather during my stay was still quite cooling Only thing was that I woke up a few times on certain nights as it was getting too warm, Really nice location Right in the heart of Amsterdam 
427390,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I put a sign on the door in request the bedroom was made up when leaving in the morning all was done was a change of towels and the sign taken off the door Why wasn t the bedroom even attempted to have been made up especially when it s claimed as 4 and the price tag Also I asked about where I would be able to print something off for that evening the woman kindly said to email them and they ll sort it out I emailed the letter I needed printing and hadn t heard anything for a few hours so went downstairs and another girl acted completely clueless even when I explained everything to her she found said email and couldn t figure out how to print the document needed off why she didn t ask for a manager is beyond me so I left in a state of panic that evening luckily it all fell into place without the letter , The bed was one of the comfiest beds I ve slept on Nice sized room and incredible view from the 6th floor Excellent location on the remberantplien square Easy transport links and socialness Lovely shower too 
427391,NH Amsterdam Schiller, water dangerously hot no slippers in rooms windows with old wooden frames wich is why rooms were very noisy from the street side , location breakfast was great overall was great and may stay there again 
427392,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Could have included breakfast at the price , The room was spacious clean and with modern architecture The staff was courteous and helped out in whatever way they could The location was absolutely amazing
427393,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room was very small and because of the location was very hard to sleep because of the noise, The location was excellent and the staff went above and beyond to help 
427394,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I can not say it was something I really did not like it is just that I expected better value for money e g The price of the room should include daily coffee refill for the expresso maschine some windows need to be changed etc, The location is perfect for a party weekend close to clubs bars restaurants The breakfast was simply great 
427395,NH Amsterdam Schiller, They do not have air conditioning and allergies were real bad This staff and other people said it was the worst this year Also they do not have help with the bags but I made them do it First they put me in a room on the 1st floor in the front where the busy street noise was not acceptable no air and window had to be open Put me in a smaller room again in the front on the 4th floor They said they didn t have anything else , Location was good and so was breakfast You can walk just about everywhere and public transit was just across the center square Restaurants galore in the area People were nice too Room sufficient Amsterdam is an expensive city Outside of summer a room on the other side would have been fine to stay 
427396,NH Amsterdam Schiller, First room was extremely small not even room for one to hang a dress or coat Rooms facing street were also very noisy , Location was good and room was clean 
427397,NH Amsterdam Schiller, the weird elevator where you had to push pull the door Two single beds stuck together even though asked for separete beds, clean comfy rooms great service top location
427398,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Very expensive for a single room Television didn t work Noise from street level can be excessive , Excellent location Near transit and lots of attractions Very friendly and helpful staff 
427399,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Long waiting check in the staff might be new needed help from the others Long and confused check out again we have three people however the states were all under the one person s name The most unhappy experience happened on the shuttle bus arrangement I gave up one museum tour and hurried with the lunch and it turned out to be the shuttle will be delayed for 30 mins which I don t think it was true I can see from the staff s face the same one we met on check in some steps were missed and there won t be any shuttle for me Anyway I took the taxi finally , Perfect location good restaurants around
427400,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel was too expensive for what it offers in general Staff need to be more informative about city attractions and events, Location is great it is in the Rembrandt Plein square 10 min walking to the Dam 5 min to central station by tram The hotel is very clean The staff is friendly
427401,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Housekeeping did not remove dirty cups and glasses and did not wipe out the bathroom tub The room did not have air conditioning , Location was great Staff was friendly and helpful 
427402,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, We stayed here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon We were welcomed with balloons and a heart made out of flower petals on the bed and strawberries and sweets too The staff was very friendly and helpful the room was wonderful and the location was great 
427403,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Eventhough I asked for a nice view I did not get one I would rather to overlook the Rembrandt square I asked the receptionist to change my room but She did not , The location of the hotel was very central 
427404,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room 118 was next to the party room so it was a bit noisy but it finished at a reasonable time , Lovely bed and beautiful toiletries The staff were fantastic and so was the coffee 
427405,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I think air conditioning would be essential for the summer Didn t bother me however on my visit in April The foyer was undergoing having a new floor fitted during my stay These things have to be done and disruption was kept to a minimum , Comfortable and clean room Superb location just a few seconds walk from a tram stop Quiet 
427406,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Location was right in front of Rembrant Square The tram stops right in front of it A lot of attractions were walking distance The staff was extremely helpful The room was just as advertised in pictures 
427407,NH Amsterdam Schiller, the rtl late show made the hotel feel in accessable for hotel guests perhaps if it was held in a private room and not the hotel foyer it would be better but would definately not stay there again because of it ,No Positive
427408,NH Amsterdam Schiller, the room was a bit cold with no way to make it warmer the water pressure in the shower was minimal it is right in the center but also a bit noisy, Room was nice and the staff very pleasant
427409,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Lack of front door service and not being able to use the bar or restaurant in the evening due to the tv show recording wasn t made aware beforehand , The location is central with good tram links 
427410,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The fact they are hosting TV show and it is very noise until 1 30 am which is not acceptable when you are traveling for business If I knew that this was the case I would have never booked this hotel ,No Positive
427411,NH Amsterdam Schiller, There was maintenance going on in the lobby when we arrived so had to come through the side door Our room was down some really steep stairs and even though I had booked a double we had two single beds pushed together and two single duvets The breakfast could have been a bit broader especially for the price we were paying The most annoying thing that you are not made aware of when booking which would of made us not book this hotel is we were not made aware and it s not advertised that the bar would be close on week nights due to filming a local TVs show We wouldn t have booked it if we had known The hotel rooms could do with updating I think the hotel is over priced , The location of the property was great In walking distance to everywhere 
427412,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Would of loved the treats in the room to of been free but still can t complain , The hotel was stunning The staff were amazing friendly welcoming and helpful The room was a supierior room with a beautiful view It had everything you could want and more They hotel held stunning history and was like walking back in time Our room was really spacious the bed was the most comfortable bed I ve ever slept in It was noisey at night but that was to be expected it didn t bother us though and we still slept every night beautifully The housekeepers kept our room clean and stocked up daily It really made our stay that much more enjoyable and there s everything you need all around the hotel We will be staying again 
427413,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We were not told that a TV show was being hosted at the hotel whilst we were there It was very loud until midnight There was a lot of rigging up where breakfast is served and looked untidy The lobby was being renovated which woke us up in the morning and was very loud whilst we were having breakfast We were not told about this prior to our stay , Very comfortable bed Friendly staff
427414,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Not impressed in view of the rates charged Room was tired and shabby bathroom sink was cracked tiles and grouting very grubby bathroom needs gutting No double glazing or air con pretty poor for a hotel that charges these rates That being said many NH hotels in Amsterdam are being refurbished so this MUST be next on the list Tea tray equipped with milk powder surely plastic milk cartons can be provided 19 Euros for breakfast really Hotel seems to struggle with it s identity is it a TV studio or a hotel , Excellent location if you like loud nightclubs which kick out noise until 4am ear plugs are left on bedside tables as a courtesy for guests which got us thinking when we noticed them 
427415,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Noise from outside especially at night Expensive breakfast No radiator in the bathroom , Excellent location surrounded by cafes and restaurants Short walk to old town and museums Nice decor in room Friendly staff Good range of TV channels 
427416,NH Amsterdam Schiller, noise at night there is a tv program RTL on 4 that takes place in the hotel where people queue up to be in the audience Lots of music people walking up and down the corridors at night , comfy beds friendly and helpful staff location central
427417,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The rooms although clean enough and had all the amenities needed were a little dated However this will not stop us returning This is our first choice of hotel in Amsterdam , The location is perfect Near to the main shoping street leading to Dam Square The staff are the most helpful and polite I have dealt with Top tip room service breakfast is very generous Highly recommended
427418,NH Amsterdam Schiller, A little pricey and because of exchange rates when we arrived it went up slightly from the original price when booked and reserved Thought I would be paying instantly online but it didn t take the money so had to pay when we arrived , Perfect location Lovely kind and helpful staff who were willing to give us directions with maps Would recommend highly 
427419,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I really needed to relax in silence and my room was just above a hotel bar where there was loud live music until 11PM This was really disappointing , The staff was very helpful The room was in perfect condition 
427420,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Very noisy at night with many bars and night clubs on all sides Hotel clearly knows of noise as ear plugs placed in all rooms Very little use Also TV programme was recorded each week day night from 10pm to midnight in hotel bar so closed to residents from 7pm Very small single room which was dusty throughout stay Amount charged was greater than booking com quoted rate for the 2 nights , Convenient for trams to station Selection of local restaurants 
427421,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Because this hotel is located in Rambrandt square Rambrandtplein lt had a liitle noisy at night , Room was very clean and large Hotel staff were so friendly This hotel has easy access to other sites There is a tram station in front of hotel 
427422,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Single room relatively small however it had all it takes Wifi was not strong enough in my room , Location is very central Single room was relatively small but had all it takes Good beds Quiet as room towards the back 
427423,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Booking com stated in our booking we would have a soacious room with views of the plein This was not the case The stay was good in the hotel though ,No Positive
427424,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It was early February and the room was a touch on the cold side I didn t mark it down or speak to reception because it wasn t as issue for me but might be worth noting for winter travellers My friends did not have the same issues but they had slightly smaller rooms , Everything was within walking distance and there are a few great pubs around the square alone Plenty of places to eat All of the staff that I spoke to were very helpful most notably a younger female member of staff who helped my friend and I find the perfect restaurant in our search for local food And as far as the hotel goes it s immaculate I slept very well 
427425,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I stayed for one night in a single room and while it was serviceable and clean it was a little run down Nothing terrible but you can tell the hotel has been used and hasn t been renovated in a while My windows also were not double paned so the night s festivities on Rembrandtplein did get a little loud I can sleep through noise so it didn t bother me but it s worth noting But honestly for the price and for the location I would absolutely recommend it If you re looking for luxury pay way more for another hotel , For the type of hotel it is it s perfect If you arrive and are disappointed the only thing I could imagine is that you were expecting a luxury hotel to rival the Waldorf The location is great the staff is kind the breakfast was decent and it s an excellent price for what and where it is This is probably one of the best hotels for younger people who are trying to experience the crazy Amsterdam scene and for those of us who would like to be in the middle of the city without spending a fortune but I would not recommend it for business travelers 
427426,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, Staff were very pleasant welcoming and helpful the location was perfect 10 minute walk from dam square but along the way there was lots of shops cafes restaurants coffee shops and bars but if you didn t want to walk there is a tram stop right across the street to take you in The local people were also very friendly Fantastic hotel would definitely stay there again 
427427,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We had a lovely room in the front with a beautiful view over Amsterdam but unfortunately the city has allowed Times Square style advertising panels to be installed with huge flashing lights just across the square from the hotel which lights up the top rooms in the front of the hotel so bright that is resembles daylight and was impossible to sleep The hotel is aware of this as they tried to fight it and so they immediately moved us to a room in the back which was much better The staff was very understanding and accommodating , The location was perfect Just across the square from the tram that comes directly from Centraal Station A good variety of restaurants and cafes nearby 
427428,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Asked for a high room with a view put on the second floor at the back looking at a roof Asked to be moved and told it was full After a bit of complaining we was moved to the front of the hotel with a great view of the square Was warned about the noise but went ahead anyway as my wife loves the hustle and bustle and lovely views It was however very very noisy there was earplugs next to the bed nice touch which we made use of The second night was a lot quieter due to the rain and the wind but we was then kept awake by the clanging of the massive flagpole that was right outside our window The wind was going for it and the pole was clanging in its clamps sending shock waves into the room We also had booked a superior room but only a standard was left so we was refunded the difference I d say the worst point of this hotel was the bar They have a live TV show broadcast from here every weeknight so the bar is taken over After the show you can get a drink only until 12 30am This is pitiful for such a big hotel but It gets worse on the Saturday night it closes at 11pm I have never been to such a big so called chain hotel and not been able to get a drink as a resident , The room was small but lovely and nice and warm as it was freezing outside Very comfortable bed Great location Staff very helpful 
427429,NH Amsterdam Schiller, we received 2 single rooms even thought we have booked 1 double after 1 night we have had to change a room for a double one no clear info from reception re cost of taxi to airport the receptionist told us to pay certain amount of money as the hotel has agreement with taxi company but the taxi driver charged us much more saying I dont have a discount ticket but it was hotel booking me a taxi , location
427430,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Not a place for light sleepers Rooms looking on to the square are very noisy Filming of a TV show means the bar is unavailable to residents for about 4 hours in the evening,No Positive
427431,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We stayed in a room at the front of the hotel It got quite noisy at night due to a club being next door to the hotel The bar in the hotel could not be used in the evening night due to a tv show being recorded there Hotel needs to be updated bathroom very shabby would definitely not class the hotel as a 4 star , Location is brilliant close to all the main attractions Bed was very comfortable 
427432,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was very cold and poorly decorated not what I d expect from a four star hotel , The location is very central 20min walk at the most to tourist attractions 
427433,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Only complaint about the hotel is the noise levels are insane Amsterdam literally never sleeps and 4am is as noisy as 6pm the hotel provides ear plugs if your front facing , The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring amsterdam overlooking rembrant square with plenty of places around for food drinks culture and coffee shops if thats your interest 
427434,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Didn t get an adequate room for the first nights stay but it was rectified , Great location good enough facilities excellent staff very friendly and helpful 
427435,NH Amsterdam Schiller, , When we first arrived we wanted to get out there and look around straight away The check in was spot on We had our room key and everything sorted in minutes The location is absolutely perfect extremely central to all the best bars cafes restraunts wide variety also a few clubs around We travelled as 2 young couples so we wanted to make sure we had the best hotel for the money we paid The hotel itself was very clean VERY HIGH STANDARDS All the staff are extremely helpful and willing to do anything for you beautiful touch they advised us of the best restraunts and bars to have a great night out Took the advise and the night was great It was only a short weekend away for the forst time in amsterdam but we managed to get so much done all the sights to see etc The trams are centrally located which is just outside the hotel Never too hard to get a plan together and then go and do it Overall i would rate this hotel 10 10 only thing what wasn t perfect was the price But definitely is worth every penny Would recommend to anyone of all ages and groups NH schiller would definitely accept YOU 
427436,NH Amsterdam Schiller, 1 Collected 50 pound as a deposit but only return 39 9 pound without a clear explanation 2 Went into our room without permission for room service while we did not put the sign for the request and went into our room 10 minutes before our check out time 3 Bath tub with a broken hole , The quiet bar 
427437,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The check out process I wish the hotel would include the local city tax in the price of the room just when you think that you have everything packed away ready for your trip home you have to dig your way though your bag to find your money to pay the tax Its also not giving a true room price if they add this on at the end , The location is brilliant trams bars restaurants The room was quiet and the bed comfortable 
427438,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The lobby looked super old and the carpet needs changing plus the price is overrated, The room was clean and warm and staff was friendly plus the location is super right next to the Christmas market and close to everything with a lot of good cafes restaurants and clubs 
427439,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel is old in so many ways The mattress is the worst in the world We both have back aches and we could barely sleep Then the pillows were so old that they didn t have the shape nor the feel of a pillow they were chunky We were sleeping in 2 different rooms so it wasn t only one room problem The toilets don t have a working ventilation so imagine how the room smels Too expensive for what you get Will never come back again , The assistant manager was extremely nice and took care of us and our issues with the room was given at the beginning 
427440,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The only downside was the room It was absolutely freezing in the bathroom and we only got the room cleaned once the whole time we were there so nothing was really cleaned or changed when they did come in they made the bed but didn t actually clean or tidy anything including cups we had for cups of tea Also they were coming to clean at 3 4 o clock when we d been out all day , Absolute ideal location right in the square with everything in walking distance Rooms good size hotel lobby lovely and staff were friendly 
427441,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I was expecting more luxurious rooms and bathrooms for 200 a night The hairdryer was broken and the bathroom was a little small , Fantastic location right in the heart of Amsterdam 
427442,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We ve booked 4 rooms in the NH Schiller in May 2015 via booking com but 1 day before our stay Dec 10th the hotel called us to say they didn t had any room in this hotel and they had to replace us to the Caransa After some dicussions as we weren t very happy about that fact ve ve got a discount upgrade standard to superior room and a free small lunch with cava for 8 people Anyway some people remained really disappointed due to the unprofessional handling of our reservation by NH We believe that it wasn t a mistake but that they could sell our rooms in the Schiller for a much higher price to other people if that s the NH policy I don t know if our group will stay at NH the next time Dependent on the floor and room you stay the rooms can be very noisy due to the loud music from the neighbours and renovation was badly done , See negative point we ve booked 4 rooms in the NH Schiller but due to a mistake by NH we ve ended up in staying in the NH Caransa in the same street Good location big superior rooms very good breakfast 
427443,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Nothing bad to say , Service was fantastic it was my partners birthday and they made the room special and arranged for a bottle of wine on arrival Room was excellent we had a balcony overlooking the square which was great The location was also fab for us it was walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go I would go again in a heartbeat 
427444,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The only downside was the lighting in the room Plenty of lamps but no main light in the ceiling so proved hard to get ready Also feel their should be a mirror near the plugs on the desk in the room , The hotel was in a great location The beds were like sleeping on a cloud so comfy The staff were also really nice and very helpful 
427445,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Noisy lots of noise from the square so rooms at the front were rather noisy, Staff on reception were really helpful and recommended two excellent restaurants for us 
427446,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Although the rooms are ok the windows are old no double glass and the noise from the street is so big that next to the bed the hotel provides ear pieces like those people use on planes Crazy , The location is good The staff is nice 
427447,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Housekeeping left a bit to be desired It s all in the details you know , Location was convenient although noisy on a front room Not sure about having a live tv show shot in the restaurant with live loud music 
427448,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We ve booked Superior Double room and were appalled by the room which was given to us it had a tiny window and looked nothing like on the pics After a complaint we were given a room with dust on table and shelves and a frame of what has to be a window filled with something and covered by a curtain We complained again and were given a much better one together with free breakfast The last room was what it supposed to be but it took a lot of effort and complaining to get it , The location is great however it gets loud at night
427449,NH Amsterdam Schiller, It s incredibly noisy at night One window in my room was broken obviously long ago and nobody cared They should renovate this hotel because it s much too expensive for the current condition The daily talkshow which takes place at the bar is obviously more important than the comfort of the guests , The location is good but that s all Personal is freindly but this cannot compensate the negative points 
427450,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Late night loud pedestrians outside to be expected for the area though , Great location friendly staff and clean rooms Would definitely stay here again 
427451,NH Amsterdam Schiller, I booked a junior suite and got what looked like a very avarage room nothing like the picture requested a double bed when booked received 2 beds pushed together The amenities that are listed such as bathrobes and iron were no where to be found and the bathroom looked like a public restroom, The location
427452,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Booked twin got double on first night of three got moved for second night onwards me and best mate had to man love it up thanks a bunch Wasn t aware that hotel bar brasserie is location for nightly edition of RTL s late night TV show For a 4 Star hotel Breakfast pretty damn poor and at 15 Euro s a time get out of town Had mine elsewhere , Great location Founder s Art on display in reception 
427453,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Hotel hosts a TV Radio show M F 2200 depending who is guests of the show there may be a lot of screaming fans outside Thank you 5 seconds of Summer you have some LOUD fans Other than that issue it is a great hotel , Location location location 
427454,NH Amsterdam Schiller, We had a substantial leak from the ceiling in our bathroom the maintenance staff were very prompt in attending the reception staff one person did not offer a new room she said we will do whatever you wish so we had to ask for a replacement room which in the event was slightly smaller When I asked the receptionist if she would like to stay in a room with a bathroom in that condition she said it is not for me to decide This is a 4 star hotel When we explained this to the manager he apologised I presume that due to the change of rooms two charges for services we did not use were erroneously added to our bill the manager again sorted this out and apologised Other reception staff were very friendly and helpful , Location
427455,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Hallways tired and really out of date Small plastic kettle in bedroom with one tea bag, Nice clean room On top of some good cafe s and restaurants Safety deposit box in room is free
427456,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Cleanliness was a bit poor as the bins didn t get emptied daily and there were a few things that could be updated , The view was great and the location was great Everything that a tourist would want to is within a 20 minute walk 
427457,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Is a little bit far from the center the toilet is a bit small no air conditioning , The staff are very helpful the area is very nice and surrounded by a lot of restaurants and coffee shops They thankfully arrange some flowers and chocolate for free for our anniversary 
427458,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Beds not very comfortable We had to have our room key reactivate twice a bit of a pain as our room was on the 5th floor No reason for it not to work as we kept it away from phone etc The shower bathtub can be somewhat difficult to get in and out of if you have any issues A bit pricey but you are paying for a great location We only had breakfast one morning it was OK but expensive Lots of cafes close by that have a great breakfast menu for less money , Location is excellent Tram stop across the street Everyone speaks English well 
427459,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The bathroom was below par Needs modernising and bringing into the 21st century Double glazing would have helped to block out some of the noise from the square which continued most of the night Although the room had been serviced our tea and coffee facilities were not cleaned or replenished and we had to contact reception I had requested a twin bedded room as I was visiting with a friend The beds were together with no room to separate them I requested a superior room and expected better facilities for the money I would have given this hotel a 3 star rating not a 4 star , The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size The view over the square was very good The staff were polite and helpful The breakfast was good but there appeared to be a shortage of staff and the waitress was under stress 
427460,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Originally given room that didn t meet expectations this was swiftly changed with a smile when asked, Location suited us as easy walk tram to many attractions
427461,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Shower over bath Bath very slippery and no grab handle for shower to assist getting out Sides of the Bath very high Not sure hiw many people soak in a bath nowadays and there was no bubblebath , Location was very good Room size very good and comfortable beds 
427462,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Would ve liked a balcony room but everything else perfect , Excellent location friendly staff great wifi connection in room Quiet room despite very central location Lovely choice at breakfast hot and cold buffet
427463,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Shower was broken , Location of hotel Character of the hotel with Schiller s art work exhibited in the communal areas Staff very attentive and polite Breakfast was excellent 
427464,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Constant mess in the hall way in front of my room 314 I needed to ask every day to remove dirty dishes dirty sheets and other stuff from the floor Additionally doors from the elevator and hall way were so close that it was very uncomfortable to open it as well as to manuevre with lagguage , Location and friendly approach of people
427465,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Rooms are NOT 4 star standard Bad NO VENTILATION aircin neither in the room or bathroom Smells bad WIFI is so SLOW that it s almost non existent They SHOULD NOT write FREE WIFI with an Internet THAT SLOW , Breakfast was good but you pay extra for that on Schillers 
427466,NH Amsterdam Schiller,No Negative, super friendly efficient staff check in took 3 mins check out took 3 mins champagne and chocolates with heart balloons in room for arrival as it was a special occasion Fantastic Hotel would highly recommend to all visiting Amsterdam
427467,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Photos on Booking com is NOTHING like the real rooms In the photos you have big rooms with 2 3 windows two chairs and modern rooms In reality the room is half the size one small window wallpaper peeling off very hot and no air conditioning I hated the week I stayed there, Location but that s it
427468,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The hotel was undergoing renovation Had I known this in advance I would not have chosen to stay at this hotel It would seem only fair to notify people beforehand Also as a four star rated hotel the facilities and overall appearance of the room does not come up to par with this rating , Free wifi and good location of the hotel
427469,NH Amsterdam Schiller, The room was very small We requested a room at the back after reading reviews of considerable noise in the early hours of the morning when the club next door closed However it was pretty noisy and not pleasant view and smelly from the kitchens deliveries etc I would expect a 4star hotel to replenish the tea and coffee supplies in the room each day and to provide for more than 1 cup per person , Very good location on Rembrandt Square which is surrounded by bars and restaurants Tram stop opposite hotel and easy walk to most places of interest
427470,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Rembrandtplein is an offense to Mr Rembrandt After 5 PM you will be smoking pot just for breathing around that little plaza Hotel wanted to charge me extra 25 x dog little x night Unbelieveable , In front of Rembrandtplein Close to Bloemenmarkt and tram stops 
427471,NH Amsterdam Schiller, There was scaffolding at the front of the building obstructing our view but once the work has finished there won t be any problems , Great location very friendly staff and overall a great place to stay in Amsterdam 
427472,NH Amsterdam Schiller, Room was hot No air conditioning they provided a small fan No sheets I took the cover off the duvey to use as a sheet and the duvey had blood stains on it We were on floor 1 1 level up and took the lift then had to lug our luggage down 15 steps of stairs Average breakfast is expensive at 15 per person Hotel has a rather run down appearance Internet is a joke with 5 mbps download speed and 2 mbps upload speed With speeds this slow they should not even advertise that they offer Internet Even the front desk staff said they cannot use the Internet at times because it is so slow , Location on Rembrandt Square Stiff bed
