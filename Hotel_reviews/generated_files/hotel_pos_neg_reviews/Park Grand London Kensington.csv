149098,Park Grand London Kensington, A bit pricey but i think this had to do more with the events in Lodon i e Pride London U2 concert summer We also booked a bit later than we should have , This was our first trip to London We could not have been happier with the location The breakfast buffet was great and was an easy convenient way to start each day Though the room was rather small similar to NYC and par for the course in London the bed was comfortable room was clean and bathroom was nice The hotel is walking distance 1 2 minutes to Earl s court stop We walked all over but one of our favorite places was Holland park which was a 10 minute walk from the hotel The staff was really helpful and even held are bags for us after checkout until we left for the airport We would definitely stay in this hotel location again

149100,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Excellent location 5 minutes walk from Earl s Court Underground station Very friendly and helpful staff rooms are not that big but still very comfortable 
149101,Park Grand London Kensington, The room given had a adjoining door so I could hear everything next door including very loud music and a lot of moaning and screaming fro 1 30am to 6 00pm of an intimate nature The occupants are entitled to that but my room wasn t fit for purpose I did complain about the former problem and eventually the music stopped the second problem I thought it futile On checking out very early and recounting this problem to the reception staff I was offered a coffee Couldn t wait to leave to get some sleep at home ,No Positive
149102,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Very high standard room Liked the little touches free bottle water and fruit I would certainly stay here again Ideal for Earls Court or The Olympia 
149103,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing, Vanessa the receptionist was extremely helpful and noticed it had been my birthday the day before Vanessa up graded our room added breakfast to our stay and had a chilled bottle of bubbly with a lovely hand written note sent to our room to enjoy I have travelled the world and this welcome has been the best one to date The management should be over the moon to have her on the front desk 
149104,Park Grand London Kensington, I asked for a upper room but was given a basement room which had difficulties heating and had to keep calling front desk which they ve sorted out in the end , The room was clean and lovely for the price It also included a microwave which was bonus 
149105,Park Grand London Kensington, The room window was not able to be opened and getting a satisfactory temperature in the room was not easy using the aircon system , Enjoyed the sunny breakfast room The staff cheerfully undertook any requests we had eg clearing the fridge so we could put fruit in it The hotel was brilliantly situated for transport making it easy to go to all the destinations we were interested in 
149106,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff did an excellent job We came on bicycles and the staff took good care of the bikes The girls at the reception were very friendly and helpful 
149107,Park Grand London Kensington, Check in was completely chaotic The staff started helping someone else midway through and left us waiting There were no room key cards left so we had to wait for more The staff did not seem professional at all The room was in the basement along a warren and took ages to find from reception There was no phone signal and the wifi didn t work at all There were bright lights on the door settings which couldn t be turned down The room was clean but the carpets and decor are cheap and worn out I would never stay here again , The room was a good size
149108,Park Grand London Kensington, The room itself looked a bit tired and need painted recarpeted , Great location lovely breakfast We were moved from the Park Grand to the Hyde park hotel but we were explained the reason and the hotel organised the change very well Bathroom had a nice new feel 
149109,Park Grand London Kensington, The sound proofing could be improved as at night or early morning I could hear the neighbors in the corridor As well as I have received a room at the basement where there was no elevator and the way to the room felt bit like a labyrinth For European standards the rooms was rather small but I guess for London it was the regular size , The staff was very helpful the room was clean Easy to reach especially when travelling from Heathrow and generally a nice area to be at They had all types of electricity outlets and even an USB one makes life always easier 
149110,Park Grand London Kensington, Carpet outdated Our room was located at level 0 hence to reach it was via up to level 1 walk through a few corridors and then downstairs However we liked how the staff didn t mind us using the emergency exit for our convenience , Customer service was excellent The room provided all essential needs
149111,Park Grand London Kensington, It was fine , Easy walk to Earl s Court Station Room was comfortable Mix up with our bags however was given a bottle of wine for our troubles

149113,Park Grand London Kensington, A little expensive but so is everywhere in London, Great location only a few hundred metres from Earl s Court station Nice 4 star hotel very clean large room with nice bathrooms and great staff who went out of their way to be helpful Buffet breakfast with selection of cereals breads pastries hot food was terrific In all a great base for a London business or leisure trip
149114,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was tiny and the bed both very narrow and incredibly uncomfortable A simple IKEA matress would have been better than this And please do get rid of those dirty carpets on the floor I find them quite disgusting Naming this a superior double is just ridiculous ,No Positive
149115,Park Grand London Kensington, Didn t like My room being cancelled unbeknownst to me at 18 00hrs and suspected the subsequent room allocated was of a lesser quality than the one reserved It was certainly below ground and felt a bit dungeon like Tatty corridors and a hike to the rooms allocated , Liked Rooms were a pleaseant surprise including The iron and ironing board in the room Tea and coffee making facilities Mini bar with snacks iPod smartphone dock Generally Nicely presented and prepared buffet breakfast Helpfulness of staff
149116,Park Grand London Kensington, The red light used to indicate Do not disturb is extremely bright and in some rooms shines at the bed via the mirror A paper alternative would be much better I had to cover the light , Very nice decor bed extremely comfortable good space friendly staff perfect location 
149117,Park Grand London Kensington, Overpowering smell of disenfection scent in the bathroom When we arrived we were moved to another hotel without prior warning wasting 2 hours of our weekend forcing us to change dinner plans ,No Positive
149118,Park Grand London Kensington, The hotel needs a concierge and the front desk staff could use some retraining I needed to receive some advice on getting a train from Euston Station to MGM s Harry Potter Studio The first front desk clerk told me he would print directions and send them to my room After 1 5 hours without directions I went to the front desk and was working with a woman and she asked me to step aside so she could help another customer I thought that was rude and disrespectful I asked to speak with a manager and was told the manager does not work on weekends I asked to have the manager speak with me when he came in and I never heard from one Bottom line I ended up calling Euston Station and getting the answers I needed We had a great family vacation in London but I would expect a basic level concierge service for the fee we were paying to stay I would certainly return to London but I would not stay here again , The location near the Earl s Court Tube station is fantastic
149119,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff at this Hotel were excellent couldn t do enough for us We will definitely stay there again Extras like fruit and water in the room certainly not a basic Hotel Would give it 10 stars as could not fault anything Pam Gaynon

149122,Park Grand London Kensington, Room is small Bathroom is tiny Elevator is slow , We stayed 6 nights in the hotel in total 2 stays First night the room was not good but later the hotel staff put us in a good room in our second stay The hotel in general is nice and clean Staff very friendly especially Kanisha from the reception Location is perfect Close to tube and buses too 
149123,Park Grand London Kensington, the bathroom is a shower room with the shower quite narrow , The King size bed was very comfortable The area is quiet and so no noisy interruptions during the night 
149124,Park Grand London Kensington, Mattress on one side had small bumps general cleanness is just about ok but a few small things here and there were noticed like someone s lollipop on the staircase for a day the gym is really tiny and claustrophobic machines are old and has no TV it could do with a renovation Breakfast does the job but with so many alternatives round the corner you can give it a miss alright My colleague s room bathroom was messy two days in a row without warning or explanation but they gave her a bottle of wine to compensate , Location is very good rooms at the back are really quiet Value for money is about ok staff try their best 
149125,Park Grand London Kensington, Room size was a little small considering I had booked a deluxe room and no bath was provided although I may have been able to ask for a room with one, Super comfy bed and great shower
149126,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The coseyness of the room and the complimentary cheesecake and wine was simply a great gesture Thank you to Venessa and the team at GPLK for making our stay a memorable one
149127,Park Grand London Kensington, We would have prefered a larger room next time we will but the rooms were kept very well Would suggest a shelf over the basin , Helpful staff specially Camilia on the front desk Great location for shopping transport restaurants walking cycling Would stay again Our first visit to the Hotel 
149128,Park Grand London Kensington, Parking reception directed me to the Marriott to park who have very limited spaces so ha to drive around for some time to find metre parking would have been good to have know that parking was limited before we arrived and could have used different mode of transport , Staff where excellent and went the extra mile
149129,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Very close to the underground very helpful and nice staff nice room in a great little area of London within walking distance to restaurants and some shopping
149130,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing I did not like , I really appreciated the way that they adhered to my requests of where my room should be At breakfast I also strayed from the normal buffet and they served me without a question This is why the Park Grand is on top of my list of hotels to stay in when I visit London 
149131,Park Grand London Kensington, Booking com pricing because had to cancel multiple times because initially booked it a month ago for 228 and the price went down all the way to 168 frustrating because no warnings or updates that prices went down had to cancel booking numerous times to get the best possible deal Previously was 108 and next month booking is at 116 , Everything hotel was just consistently brilliant my second time with the hotel and already booked another for next month 
149132,Park Grand London Kensington, N A, The staff especially Camilla and the doormen were amazing I liked the fact that a mobile phone was provided I received an amazing and warm welcome although I arrived early I was made to feel at ease and welcomed
149133,Park Grand London Kensington, All good , AMAZING surprise We booked through a website and when we got there we were very pleased with everything Great location Nice staff We loved the hotel Highly Recommend 
149134,Park Grand London Kensington, Only thing would be to let you check in before 2pm especially if you have been travelling for a while, What can i say but absolutely fantastic hotel staff food beds little persoal touches like a phone that the hotel supply you with to use for calls info on how to get around London to heated tiles in the bathroom to little chocolates left on your pillows each night just the best hotel ever
149135,Park Grand London Kensington, Grubby dirty tired dusty 40 minutes to check in and staff who didn t know what they were doing So dissatisfied will be writing to head office for full refund they could only offer partial refund at the hotel ,No Positive
149136,Park Grand London Kensington, Horrible hotel very small dirty bad service it is one star hotel run by Indian people Horrible bed old discusting mattress no robes nothing in the room Waste of money , Me and my wife like nothing in this hotel And we saw other people complaining
149137,Park Grand London Kensington, I stayed here for a recent short business trip to London for 3 nights prior to a vacation in Europe On the second night I was itching but couldn t pin down the cause Well night 3 I woke up to a bed bug in the bed I took a picture of the bug and decided to see if there were more which I found on the mattress along the headboard something I had read about where they like to hide I complained to the front desk and showed them the pictures They dealt with it by being apologetic and offering me a free breakfast management said they d need to get a report from the pest control before any further action was taken I believe in giving people a fair chance to rectify the situation which unfortunately wasn t the case in this instance Instead of following up promptly I had to email them and ask whether the report was filed I also had the huge inconvenience of having to launder all my clothes and spray out my suitcase on vacation for fear that the bugs got in there Not only did they confirm that yes in fact they did find LIVE bed bugs but basically that they can t identify the cause and basically insinuated that it could ve been my fault I was absolutely appalled by the treatment and lack of customer service No fault to the front desk staff but how management dealt with this was appalling ,No Positive
149138,Park Grand London Kensington, I booked and paid extra for the club room as it gave access to the club lounge Every other club lounge I have been in offered food and free drinks including alcohol and this was what I expected Unfortunately this club lounge turned out to be a very small room with a coffee machine with no coffee in a facility to make a cup of tea and a few other things I was very disappointed and felt I had been misled I would not have paid extra for this room had I been aware of what little was offered for the extra money On the website of other hotels in this group the club lounge looks worth the extra money but people should be made aware that this is certainly not the case with this particular hotel , The staff were very friendly The room was very clean and the bed was large and comfy I had no complaints with the room 
149139,Park Grand London Kensington, On arrival we were informed that the cost was over 40 higher than that on my confirmation from Booking com It had to be discussed with the Manager before it was agreed we could pay the lower cost The rooms weren t ready and on returning we were told that we had been given a complimentary upgrade These proved to be rooms in the sub sub basement with a window with a strip light behind it and curtains so you felt as if you were in a proper room not 2 floors underground On querying what room we had actually booked Superior we were told that we have been moved to their largest rooms and we couldn t have our original booking as they hotel was full Having said that once the curtains were closed the room was fine The tea and milk was not replaced the following day A second rail for drying 4 wet towels would have been appreciated We had to wait in the foyer for 20 mins for breakfast on the Sunday with several other guests the breakfast room was virtually empty on Monday Breakfast offered a poor variety of choices if you didn t want a full English breakfast but the traditional was good for those who wanted one , The beds were extremely comfortable Good sized room shame it was 2 floors below ground Complimentary fruit and water and my daughter got chocolates 
149140,Park Grand London Kensington, One receptionist served unwell to me However it s obviously that she is bias since she served very well to another customers This means that the receptionist classify the customers and serve unequally , The room is very comfortable and value for money The location is great since it is near Earl s court underground station 
149141,Park Grand London Kensington, Basically the design and layout of this hotel are not well done my room was on ground floor w a small window facing street and right by an emergency exit door directly to street I needed to go through multiple steps stairs to access the room from the reception area Room decor was not really fresh and updated needs to be updated Bathroom layout is not practical there was not much space to put your stuff It would have been nice if USB or power outlets are at bed sides , The staff was very very helpful and great people Shower area was very clean Very close from a tube station 
149142,Park Grand London Kensington, The bath was hard to get into and out of as it was too high and had to ask for non slip mat and fell and slipped the first night and bruised my leg above knee No windows in the room The decor was dated and door of the cupboard for the fridge was hanging off the hinge No daylight in the room was not great , Comfortable bed Great location 
149143,Park Grand London Kensington, The deluxe room we booked was extremely small with no space to even keep our luggage around the bed We had not even booked the standard room but the next category deluxe at a higher price than the Standard Room We were told that the standard room deluxe room are of the same size So i wonder why they were priced differently However since we were not too pleased with the size of our room the staff upgraded us to the next category room which was much more spacious However the upgraded room did not have a window or balcony and was below ground level However the room had complimetary fresh fruits and complimentary water although this was provided on the first day only We did not get the complimentary water on the second day however since we were in a rush we did not bother asking for it , The staff are extremely polite and very helpful Breakfast spread is very good Hotel is located just a few steps away from Earl s Court station which was the best thing Plenty of restaurants around the hotel 
149144,Park Grand London Kensington, Got a room in a lower category as booked After getting back to staff I received discount It was disappointing as I expected a comfy spacious room which was no more available Room not as expected and very small Avoid ground floor or basement , Good location close to subway 
149145,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The hotel was ideally situated staff were extremely helpful and courteous room was lovely and cleanliness was excellent Nothing was too much trouble This is the 2nd time we have stayed in this hotel and will definitely come back 
149146,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Staff was very friendly and accommodating We told the hotel we were celabrating in our reservation and they went out of their way to make our weekend wonderful 
149147,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff were delightful Lovely refreshing water in the reception hall Comfy beds everything worked and was well designed only issue was lack of drawer space 
149148,Park Grand London Kensington, Small beds for two especially if you are used to bigger size beds noise of the neighboring room when they open close the door to their rooms the neighbors door noise could wake you up however I should add that apart from that the room was very quiet , Nice and helpful staff good location and access clean nice bathroom 
149149,Park Grand London Kensington, A Kensington hotel should be a place of serenity and relaxation At Park Grand London Kensington guests can relax in the elegant and chic surroundings and feel at home while away from home The beautifully appointed guest rooms are designed with the utmost attention and embellished with plentiful amenities We were informed that we had been given free upgrade by the receptionist on arrival only to find that we had been put in rooms below ground level my room had a man hole cover in it and rather unpleasant odour there was no natural day light with no window and the booking did not included breakfast My colleague immediately asked for a new room with a window and was moved to a room in a far reaching part of the hotel with a window but not much of an improvement use again not likely unless I can be assured of a natural above ground accommodation Our perception was that the receptionist knew the rooms were not very nice but tried to counter that by stating we had been given these free upgrades prior to seeing the rooms 180 for a dingy dungeon not very happy ,No Positive
149150,Park Grand London Kensington, They need to let you know that the stuff in the fridge is not free Spend your money in the small shops that are in the area cheaper and it gets you into the neighborhood Elevator is very small 3 persons without luggage fit Do not let them call a Private Taxi for you overpriced and they do not take cards I found out the hard way the first hours I was there Learn the Underground , Location location location 300 feet or so from Earl s Court Station direct link to the airport and the Tower Bridge area using the District Line Direct link to King s Cross Station and Pancras Station via the Piccadilly Line Learn the Underground and avoid the taxis Walking distance to V A Museum well worth the walk Many very good places to eat bakery is close by as well as small shops to buy just about anything you forgot The room has one US outlet and two UK outlets for your chargers and such If you forgot them there is a small shop a few feet away to supply them at a slightly higher cost of course Try the MasalaZone great food but try the rest of the small restaurants in the area I try not to eat in the hotel restaurant when there is such a wide variety of other places to chose from The bathroom is very nice just not enough shelf space for stuff can t imagine if there is more than one person The staff was attentive and polite the door persons were always there for assistance if you needed it 
149151,Park Grand London Kensington, Was, The initial room was in the basement and I didn t like that so I spoke to the rather helpful receptionist who gave me a better room the only problem was that the bathroom was for disabled guests so the toilet was higher than usual 
149152,Park Grand London Kensington, The air con didn t work When we changed rooms it still didn t work Not worth the effort at 1am to keep looking for a room with functioning AC Staff seemed concerned we hadn t enjoyed our evening but if you can tell me from reception that my current rooms air con isn t working I m sure you can check the room that you re moving to me is working , Clean comfy modern really close to the tube and great amenities in the area 
149153,Park Grand London Kensington, I didn t like the room or facilities it was not as clean as I expected a four star to be I was also not overly impressed with the breakfast , The area was perfect with lots of local amenities The outside of the hotel was lovely and streets were clear from any litter The lobby was nice 
149154,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was extremely basic and very small its was next to the kitchen so got the impression i was tucked away in the basement I wouldn t stay there again , Nothing
149155,Park Grand London Kensington, Slightly larger rooms, The staff were amazing treating my friend and I to a complimentary glass of prosecco for her birthday and leaving a bottle of red wine and box of chocolates in our room 
149156,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing that I can think of , I was very impressed by the welcome extended by the Reception Staff Aijas and Dave as we entered the Hotel They greeted us warmly immediately offered us water when we told them that it took us ages to get to the Hotel due to heavy traffic as a result of the incident on London Bridge Both of them took special care of us speeded up the formalities and Aijas then escorted us to our room He showed us around the room and told us to call him if we needed anything I must say this was service par excellence Much better than at any of the hotels with big names Very personal service I would highly commend both the staff for their professionalism courtesy and friendliness 
149157,Park Grand London Kensington, The breakfast area is probably too small as everyone seem to want to eat at the same time This also resulted in the need to wait a bit at the buffet We usually do breakfast early this time we didn t so perhaps that s just normal when everyone seems to go at 9am , The room was very clean modern and roomy we were on the ground floor which made it very quiet and private with no passing traffic except the emergency exit Initially I found the location a bit off putting being in a basement area but then I realized the advantage and really liked it The staff were all very friendly and helpful a real bonus compared to my last London hotel We also had dinner in the lounge and the food and service were excellent 
149158,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Recently stayed here and I couldn t recommend it highly enough I had a couple of personal issues during our stay and the staff went above and beyond to help me out The hotel is lovely very clean and in a great spot Thank you very much to all the staff
149159,Park Grand London Kensington, Well the main problem was noticed the next day On waking up it was strangely very dark I thought it must still be the middle of the night and tried to sleep longer and when I woke up again it was still dark Something didn t feel right so I checked my phone and it was 11 00am I arrived in the evening and didn t open the curtains and when I did there wasn t a window behind there So be warned that the basement level could all be like this It s not nice and very confusing to have a windowless room I m sure the higher rooms don t have this problem , This hotel had excellent staff the front desk clerk was friendly and check in very efficient There was a porter to take my bag to the room and show we all the features which was very nice The room was clean and well equipped furnishings were solid and the everything had a good quality feel The location ok the hotel is also pretty good with a 2 minute walk from Earls Court tube stop Also enough places to eat near by if needed Wifi worked well 2 bottles of free water and some fruit too 
149160,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast area gets crowded and although we got our table as we went down a bit early we saw a lot of others having to wait in a queue for a table, The staff were great The guy who showed us to our room was very helpful gave us information about nearby parking restaurants etc and generally very friendly The breakfast was decent most breakfasts aren t hot even though they re kept on hot plates but the food here was The best thing about this place is the location Some decent bars nearby train station right around the corner if you want to head in to central and plenty of fast food choices if you need a quick bite KFC Nandos Byron Burger King McD s more 
149161,Park Grand London Kensington, We were not notified of ongoing hotel maintenance and booking com never gave them my email address or any other contact info When we arrived we were told that there were no rooms available and we were transferred to a partner hotel approximately 15 minutes from Kensington The hotel did pay for the taxi to the other hotel at Lancaster Gate That hotel was very pleasant but the rooms were tiny It was acceptable for a single person but much too small and uncomfortable for a couple , The staff tried very hard to be accommodating but the hotel and booking com put them in a difficult situation 
149162,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Great lively location minutes from the train station Helpful friendly staff Everything you needed in the room including complimentary bottles of water nice touch 
149163,Park Grand London Kensington, For the room rate they could offer breakfast included and not as an extra and also the bed was a little to hard for our liking , The location cleanliness and staff was all excellent 
149164,Park Grand London Kensington, Might be a bit picky but the view was a just a brick wall from the building next to the hotel , Everything The bed was comfortable the room number as exquisite perfect for couples Very clean could not fault the hotel Check in and out was very quick hassle free each time was done in 2 mins or less Location was great very close to the underground and lots of pubs and restaurants nearby 
149165,Park Grand London Kensington, Wasn t too sure of the area to begin with but easy access to Knightsbridge and quick route to Earl s Court Tube , The beds were super comfortable and the shower really effective 
149166,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was a bit small for three adults they said on the booking we would have a sofa bed but we got a small camp bed , Location bed was fab supplies in the room 
149167,Park Grand London Kensington, Daughter travelled down to join us and was then taken to your Paddington hotel where her room was in a basement with a noisy generator outside her room which woke them numerous times during each night We also had to use the tube to meet up with her, Friendly staff very helpful
149168,Park Grand London Kensington, The shower could do with more water pressure, Very friendly hotel whilst the bedroom wasn t over big it was perfect for our purpose Staff were exceptionally efficient and polite we had a good breakfast and the bedroom was tastefully designed and more to the point everything worked Great value for money in a good location Hyde Park being less than a five minute walk 
149169,Park Grand London Kensington, I could really clearly hear someone walking around in heels above me which was a little distracting but overall not a huge problem The bar restaurant was lacking in atmosphere and seemed a little understaffed Friendly service and good food helped though , The staff were really lovely The concierges were very kind and helpful and all staff were friendly My room despite being in the basement and lacking a window was really nice The bed was very comfortable and a decent enough shower Complimentary water and fresh fruit were really welcome A phone for non uk visitors was a really nice touch Plenty of sockets and tech support in room too Good free wifi that didn t require me selling my soul Thanks I was given a late checkout as requested which was really helpful as I had a charity run that morning They were more than happy for me to leave luggage through the day Location was excellent for access to the Underground Earls Court and walking to Kensington and surrounding attractions 
149170,Park Grand London Kensington, We had a room 2 fllors down in the basement with no natural light No information was provided on the hotel facilities eg fitness room whn breakfats was available Poor value for money,No Positive

149173,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast expensive at 12gbp per head night before or 15gbp on the day Better value walking a couple hundred metres down the road, Clean tidy and modern Rooms well equipped staff very attentive and helpful
149174,Park Grand London Kensington, When we arrived they claimed that they left us a massage that they re allocated us in another hotel due to capacity We did not get any massage and did not comfirm We were very upset After arguing they agreed and gave us a room I am not sure if it was the level we paid for It was very small and no spare space By the way the same happened to our freinds two months ago In addition the matrix was very soft Very bad sleep We do not reccomend , The location is quite and close to the tube 
149175,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing as far as we saw or found, It was central for our purpose a 2 min walk to Earl s Court Underground which was 2 stops for Chelsea flower show the main reason for our visit also easy to hop on and off to all the main attractions an Oyster card is a must for the underground and buses if your staying overnight big savings we didn t need or use one of the best ideas I ve seen in a hotel the use of a mobile phone at no extra cost you can use for calls take photos if you have left your camera at home and is loaded with maps of London etc great idea facilities in the room water wine and fruit very good all the staff were polite and courteous nothing to much bother booking in and out very quick overall an excellent enjoyable stay 
149176,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing to report , The staff and breakfast were both excellent Hotel in a very good location and on a quiet road Nice area and was perfect for our visit to The theatre and Chelsea Flower Show 
149177,Park Grand London Kensington, Size of rooms varies enormously My double room was tiny could only just squeeze around the bed The other two rooms I booked one was adequate one was huge , Lovely little unexpected touches water fruit chocolates in room Earlier check in than most hotels later check out than most hotels Always staff available to help with baby equipment up steps no ramp Fab location in quiet road but near Earls Court tube station 
149178,Park Grand London Kensington, The bar was shut at 10 30 but the staff enabled us to get a drink to take to the room Why did a London hotel bar shut so early , Property well placed to get around on the tube 
149179,Park Grand London Kensington, Noise from the street Very simple breakfast selection , Confortable for 2 person Clean rooms bathroom There s a microwave in the room It s very close to metro too 
149180,Park Grand London Kensington, Considering this was a superior double room there was no window and we felt that the room was badly planned The lighting was poor, The shower was excellent and the room was serviced very well 
149181,Park Grand London Kensington, Some rooms have skylights rather than windows it can feel a little claustrophobic , Very helpful staff efficient service at breakfast with a good choice of food Rooms clean and comfy 
149182,Park Grand London Kensington, I paid 162 per night for a nominally superior double room It was so small that it was barely possible to walk round both sides of what was no bigger than a double bed The layout was appalling Inadequate space to hang even one person s clothes Virtually no drawers whatsoever The bathroom did not have a single shelf on which to place toiletries Nowhere was there even one glass for water I have never ever been so ripped off My inquiry whether this really was a superior double was to be referred to the manager No one ever got back to me By all means pass this on to the hotel management I am 76 and have never anywhere in a lifetime of travelling encountered such a ripoff Who on earth gave this place 4 stars , The location was good There was nothing more to like about this supposed 4 star hotel 
149183,Park Grand London Kensington, Our room had no window just a closed off skylight that was really noisy with birds about 4 am in the morning Not good We booked a deluxe but had to sleep in the same bed Apart from that it was a lovely place , I loved the shops and there were lots of places to eat Great place
149184,Park Grand London Kensington, I had problems connecting to the hotel s wifi which staff tried to help with I was able to get connected when I accessed the wifi from the restaurant which then kept me connected in the hotel The corridor near the room smelt of cigarette smoke , I enjoyed my stay at the Park Grand London Kensington having booked the room last minute all the staff were friendly and helpful my room was upgraded upon arrival the room and bathroom were clean there was fruit in the room upon arrival and chocolates on the bed 
149185,Park Grand London Kensington, Last two occasions being requested to move hotels due to ongoing maintenance issue Seems to still be an issue Hotel did find me a room but has meant not returning until this issue is resolved Hotel tried to say it was a sudden issue but having had the same issue three weeks running it appears not the case ,No Positive
149186,Park Grand London Kensington, The decor in the rooms needs sone uplating I always stay at this hotel when in London it needs some freshening up in order to maintain the standard of a four star hotel , The room was comfortable and spacious with good conveniences and a well stocked mini bar I liked the biscuits with the tea coffee facilities and the water and fruit in the room on arrival 
149187,Park Grand London Kensington, Slightly grim room in terms of tiny window straight out on to the pavement Breakfast a little more limited than one might have expected given the price of this stay , Comfortable bed Good shower Easy access to wifi Friendly professional staff
149188,Park Grand London Kensington, The restaurant could have been open for evening meals as the lounge was very small and crowded , We were assigned a different hotel on the morning of the trip because there were maintenance problems at Kensington We were sent to Park Grand Paddington While this was a good hotel it was It in as convenient location for what we were doing The staff were fine but omitted to take our payment so we were locked out of our room when we returned after our day out We didn t think anything of not paying on arrival as many hotels including Holiday Inns do not take payment until you check out On our second morning our toilet cistern was continually filling but not retaining the water We reported this It had to use toilets a cross the road in the main building 
149189,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing, The front desk staff were extremely helpful and friendly It was my husband s birthday and they left a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine in the room together with a card this was much appreciated The beds were really comfortable and both the room and the bathroom were very clean The hotel was less than a five minute walk to the Earls Court underground station which was convenient and in spite of being in such a central location it was very quiet Overall we would recommend this hotel 
149190,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was in the basement and it was difficult to find Room was extremely small even though we d been told at check in that we had been upgraded Check in staff could have been much friendlier Menu at the restaurant does not make allowances for people with food intolerances so we had breakfast elsewhere Overall it was ok but I am not sure I d stay there again ,No Positive
149191,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The front of house staff were really accommodating they left us some chocolates and balloons in the room for my partners birthday and generally couldn t do enough for us Fantastic stay 
149192,Park Grand London Kensington, We only stayed one night and were not disappointed with anything, Friendly staff who ensured we actuall got everythig we asked for comfortable well sized room Perfect stay 
149193,Park Grand London Kensington, No parking available at this hotel however another hotel just a five minute walk away did offer paid parking , Lovely staff easy to find really close to the tube station at only a 2 minute walk 
149194,Park Grand London Kensington, I cannot fault this hotel, Hotel staff were brilliant made our stay extra special Location was great close to Earls Court tube station and 15 minute walk from museums Kensington Palace and Hyde Park 
149195,Park Grand London Kensington, The hotel and room was extremely small as compared to pictures and the price I paid The lift could only fit 2 3 people at once and there s only ONE lift so if you have a lot of luggage or if the hotel is busy you might be waiting a long time The room was also small since we booked the room for 3 and the extra bed was not really a bed and no blanket we had to ask for it The bathroom had very little amenities The hotel front didn t have a ramp or anything so those with babies or those with wheelchair might have a hard time since we had to carry the stroller up and down the stairs everytime we entered and exit the hotel although the staff was always kind enough to help us , The location was great really close to the train station and there were lots of restaurants nearby Staff was nice and friendly
149196,Park Grand London Kensington, I can not think of anything , Staff was incredibly quick and helpful The free breakfast was included and exceptional Free wifi nice room a bit small but very comfortable I would recommend this hotel 
149197,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff was all fantastic really friendly and helpful I was visiting London with my sister and daughter to celebrate my sister s 60th birthday The staff were aware of this and put a balloon and gorgeous chocolates in the room The room itself was large spotlessly clean and had everything we needed The beds were soooo comfortable I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to London
149198,Park Grand London Kensington, Would ideally have liked a little more shelf space in bathroom for my toiletries better quality toilet paper and facecloths , The service was charming and discreet nothing was too much trouble Felt very and secure as a solo lady traveller Location perfect Attention to detail excellent 
149199,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff Very clean room with great in room facilities Great location for getting around central London Suitable for business travellers and tourists Thanks for s great stay 
149200,Park Grand London Kensington, The room the decor the price the bar There was a green fire exit light on in the room all night that was so bright I couldnt sleep if there was a fire I would have been too tired to get out of bed and therefore died , Nothing
149201,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was terrible An underground room in the basement with a cold draught Half a window overlooking rubbish and trash I increased temperature and it didn t work Had to walk to reception to ask for help as phone was not working and nobody turned up to help with heating or phone There was hardly wifi and reception and I had to stand up aginst the window for signals I couldn t speak to colleagues to find out where they were It wasn t a good experience I asked for a refund and was told to speak to booking com I left 3hours later to a neighbouring hotel , nothing
149202,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Great access 2 3 minute walk to Earl s Court station which has great access to most parts in London Grocery shops and bars by the station are open late 
149203,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Wonderfully comfy bed nice cool air conditioned room great shower Nice to have fruit and water in the room Staff were all very friendly and helpful in an unobtrusive way 
149204,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, I booked at Park Grand Hotel Kensington and I came pretty late but they had that day a maintenance issue and my room was not available They booked for me at another location Paddington and the staff Aijaz as night manager and Ravi at the desk was incredibly helpful to organize everything free transfer to and from the other hotel free breakfasts for the next two days So the way they managed that problem was a very positive service experience 
149205,Park Grand London Kensington, We could have used more pillows We asked once did not receive and moved on They provided a cot for my adult son in the room which was not as comfy as our king sized bed but he slept none the less , Room was spotless Bathroom was brand new and sparkling Towels were fab Great location near the underground Restaurants and coffee shops are within walking distance Cute neighborhood 
149206,Park Grand London Kensington, The breakfast is poor I wouldn t recommend paying for this when we arrived at the hotel I got charged twice and still haven t received a refund our room was having problems so we got transferred to their sister hotel in Paddington which was an extra expense getting to the room is the smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in definitely not worth the 516 I was charged rather that 312, The hotel is modern
149207,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff was very helpful and friendly upon arrival The room and bed were both comfortable and the hotel was within walking distance to the Underground Lots of places to eat around the area as well If you need a place to wash clothes there are a few options nearby 
149208,Park Grand London Kensington, Very nice hotel very clean but we had a room downstairs and to get there you had to go up to the first floor along the corridor and then down again it was near the service area where it smelt of smoking and it was noisy in the early morning Felt a bit like the cheap relatives down in the basement maybe as we got discount through booking com, Clean tidy professional staff 
149209,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, At check in we were told the hotel was overbooked and they have arranged an equivalent room in their Paddington branch Got a complimentary taxi ride to the new location and breakfast staff handked the situation perfectly
149210,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Staff were lovely and really accommodating Really comfortable Ideal location to the tube We waited just 10mins later to check in and they knocked on the door with a bottle of complimentary wine 
149211,Park Grand London Kensington, The size of the bed is tiny almost like a big single the leaking toilet the fact that we booked at Kensington branch and they had us drive to the Paddington branch even though it was 10pm in the evening and we was ready to just go to sleep , The location
149212,Park Grand London Kensington, The room we stayed in was a little small but the service was incredable no complaints, The hotel staff were amazing Polite helpful a pleasure to stay in this fabulous Hotel The breakfast was the best ever perfect It was a late birthday celebration and the hotel had a bottle of champagne and fruit left in the room so kind Hotel is fab fab fab
149213,Park Grand London Kensington, Check in at 2 00pm was very slow between airline staff in bulk and overbooked guests being transferred elsewhere had to wait almost 30 mins Then on entering the room found the safe didn t work One hour after trying to check in one safe removed I asked for another room and was upgraded One small lift to service 5 floors is inadequate Would not classify this as a 4 star hotel, The convenience of where I had to be 
149214,Park Grand London Kensington, Some of the breakfast personnels attitude were not so friendly The lift to rooms was very slow , Reception personnels skills and attitude excellent Also doormens The view from breakfast hall to the street it was nice to look local people passing by while eating 
149215,Park Grand London Kensington, Walk way to the hotel from Earl s Court station is quiet and dark There should be more security guard and policemen patrolling around this area , Breakfast is excellent Staff is very helpful and assist guests to solve the problems Rooms are comfortable 
149216,Park Grand London Kensington, The room in Paddington Way too small Unsuitable wardrobe space shower not ideal as water went everywhere and flooded the whole floor, The staff were very courteous and professionally at all times throughout our stay We were moved to Paddington on our first night due to maintenance at Kensington Unfortunately the room was too small there and staff were able to transfer our belongings back for us to stay at Kensington as we were not happy to stay in a small room when we had originally booked a superior room at Kensington We were upgraded to a club room at Kensington which was lovely Thank you x
149217,Park Grand London Kensington, If what was booked as described as a superior double was actually this room I fear for those that might occupy the standard room This was a fairly sub standard room by any objective measure Quite small on two levels generally standard Premier inn Travelodge decor equipment etc but in the basement so generally noisy and quite airless Foyer area is very cramped particularly when coach parties arrive as seems to be the norm for this hotel Restaurant dining room also very cramped Not a place to linger unless you are of course waiting to see reception when the coachees arrive , Location is the main only selling point I guess Staff appeared to be doping their best under challenged circumstances 
149218,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Comfy bed After complaining to reception about taking my money from my account before my stay they put it back in my account straight away and more than made up for it by putting extras in our room to apologise 
149219,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, I loved my stay at Park Grand Great attention to guests needs and with an unbeatable location My bath was broken so I couldn t use it on my last night and I got a complementary breakfast for the inconvenience Nice clean and quiet 
149220,Park Grand London Kensington, I booked a superior room but it was so small that we had to climb over the bed to get to the window Getting dressed had to be done by the door as it was impossible anywhere else Spending any time in the room was claustrophobic I would not return and cannot recommend , Location was the only plus
149221,Park Grand London Kensington, Having to wait forty five minutes for help in opening the safe in our room having promised help in five minutes It was not our fault the battery needed replacement This meant nearly an hour late in starting our planned day including train journey ,No Positive
149222,Park Grand London Kensington, We were offered an upgrade from our standard room which we accepted However the room which was beautifully furnished with a lovely shower room was in the basement and had no window which might put some people off , We loved the location of the hotel and the staff could not have been more helpful We were going to the Albert Hall and the location was reasonable walking distance about a mile for us 
149223,Park Grand London Kensington, Toilet an floor were smelly Staff had miscommunication as they kept asking the same question over a small period of time A bit rushed to check out, Nice kitchen facilities alright room size bed was so comfy
149224,Park Grand London Kensington, If the hotel has a fitness center At least a small one, Clean good location near the earl s court station Room size is not bad compared to London room sizes
149225,Park Grand London Kensington, Rooms are all great but prefer a room on the higher floors rather than lower ground room but they are all of good quality, This is a great hotel I had a superb room and the rose wine is lovely staff also very helpful
149226,Park Grand London Kensington, No water is provided for everyday they said it s just complimentary for the first day only The bathroom stuff such as shower gel shampoo shower cap vanity pack all of these you have to ask for otherwise they won t refill for you , nice room clean good location
149227,Park Grand London Kensington, 5 hours before the opening of the check in time the hotel declined my cards whitout any reason it was the first time I had to face that kind of problem despite I ve always joined hotels with booking com for long time After checking with my bank I could verify there was nothing wrong with my cards and bank accounts so I had to call custumer service of booking com in order to be reassured on my booking in such a situation I learned the hotel must let the booked room available if you check in by 6 pm Once arrived at the hotel I had to wait 30 minutes to have the room It was a bunker room without any window room 8 so I asked to have a different room room 2 that was near the hotel s kitchen with an old window overlooking on stairs leading down to some tin bins The room was nothing special and quite small I joined better rooms in different 4 stars hotels in the U K Considering the high volume of 4 stars hotels available in Lodnon my advice is that there are better hotels definitely ,No Positive
149228,Park Grand London Kensington, The bed needed to be a bit bigger and was a bit too springy This led to little sleep No parking provided , The pillows and duvet were comfortable and I was really pleased to be swapped to a room with a bath 
149229,Park Grand London Kensington, The parking situation I was told I could park in a bay that I actually couldn t and received a Westminster parking ticket which wasn t compensated Fuming, Bed was lovely shower great 
149230,Park Grand London Kensington, The gym was a little bit too small However there is a gym called Soho Gym 100m from the hotel which has EVERYTHING The rest is just perfect , Amazing place We loved our room Club Double The staff was very friendly nice and helpful The location couldn t had been better In the centre of London but away from the noises of a big city We will definitely come back 
149231,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Very comfy bedding very modern rooms finished to a high standard Nice and close to Earls Court tube station Would definatly stay again and would recommend if your planning a trip to London 
149232,Park Grand London Kensington, Location Seemed underground Bit of a maze to get to Room small but believe rooms generally are in London This didn t cause any problems and would certainly stay again, Bed extremely comfortable Lovely fluffy pillows Beautiful clean bathroom Kettle and T C Fridge in room which is always a bonus
149233,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing , Amazing hotel The staff went above and beyond to cater for our needs It was also my birthday during the stay the staff helped to make it as special as possible Great location Clean and beautiful rooms Would definitely stay here again 
149234,Park Grand London Kensington, Although the room was a double room it was a little bit small Two people would have found it a but small , The Staff were very welcoming and efficient The hotel had a lovely atmosphere it was very clean and very close to Earls Court Station A particular thank you to Kanisha
149235,Park Grand London Kensington, For American standards the room was small Desk was almost too cramped to actually sit at Food from restaurant was average not bad but nothing to write home about Sink was quite high , Room has all the amenities including heated bathroom floor cable TV refrigerator and microwave Bed was wonderful Bathroom was nice and spacious Tea and coffee in room with water bottles Stocked refrigerator with everything from juice to hard liquor 
149236,Park Grand London Kensington, Bad experience when our credit card was used by the hotel Another of their properties suddenly appeared on it and 600 was debited Hotel denied all knowledge We had to ring bank in Aust to have the matter resolved No apologies from the Park Grand , Position position 
149237,Park Grand London Kensington, nothing to complain about it was a great stay, the staff were great i hadnt mentioned it was my birthday but i had a knock at my door with a complimenty bottle of wine and box of chocolates it was really unexpected but a great surprise we would with out a doubt stay again 
149238,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing it s was lovely even gave us chocolates and wine as it s was a mother day gift from last year as I had been in hosp 2016, Lots of choice
149239,Park Grand London Kensington, Reception s information about the booking was different to Booking Com hard copy I have stayed at this place more than 20 times There doesn t appear to any historical guest data because they always ask to manually hardcopy fill all my details, Bedding very good quality Central location for every thing you need in London Very well sound proofed rooms 
149240,Park Grand London Kensington, Carpet a little worn out but to be expected in a busy London hotel Sound insulation is definitely inferior compared to likes of Premier Inn you can hear your neighbours and vice versa The room was in the basement or lower ground floor with blackout curtains and some sort of window shade so you could not see outside The lack of natural light meant that if you haven t set your alarm you might wake up as I did at 9am thinking it is still only 4am If you are expected to check out by a certain time this may be problematic Also in the morning without the option of having a window to open you feel as though can hardly breathe and need to escape well before your check out is due We did not pay for the breakfast as for 15 a head this did not represent good value for money in line with the room rate and there were better alternatives elsewhere , Easy check in Friendly and attentive staff including a phone call we received from the receptionist to the room 5 minutes after check in to ensure we were satisfied with it though perhaps a more personal touch by door knocking wouldn t go amiss but that is just my preference and I expect others prefer to be left alone Compact room size but clever use of space The complimentary fruit and water bottles are a nice touch as well as tea and coffee facilities The overhead shower was a welcome surprise and the bathroom and bedroom decor was first rate or at least what one would expect of a four star hotel The price we paid via booking was also very good value for money 
149241,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The Staff were absolutely lovely Everyone was warm friendly and really helpful They made the whole experience feel very personal even sending us a card to congratulate us on our recent marriage which was such a lovely touch The location is great Earls Court Tube Station is just at the bottom of the road and on the District Line so really easy to get to Central London too There are loads of restaurants bars and shops within walking distance of the hotel so plenty of choice We had a lovely time here and will definitely stay here again 
149242,Park Grand London Kensington, I found the bed a little lumpy but not enough to keep me awake , The staff were so polite attentive and friendly Hotel was very clean and the breakfast was excellent 
149243,Park Grand London Kensington, I don t see how they could of improved on anything , All of the stay from start to finish was excellent All of the staff were lovely especially the lady on the reception desk As we were celebrating a birthday she sent up an extra bottle of wine for us The bed was so comfortable And the breakfast delicious A lovely stay
149244,Park Grand London Kensington, Window seemed poorly fitted as room was cold until heating kicked in and early morning and late night traffic seemed noisome to us , Boutique hotel that obviously tries to add something to your stay Impressed by the offer of a free smart phone and free international calls although didn t use the facility 
149245,Park Grand London Kensington, only thing I didnt like was the little green light in the ceiling that made the room too light and hence made it difficult for me getting off to sleep, Location near the Earls Road station shops and cafes Very nice room with strong shower and comfy bed As well as the electric jug and the mini fridge there was a microwave which I found very useful Also nice biscuits provided to have with the tea coffee and chocolate square to settle with all were replenished each day Also like the idea of the smart phone that was available in the room for guests to use even though I didnt use it
149246,Park Grand London Kensington, The green exit light over the room door shone so brightly when the lights were off that it kept my husband and myself awake most of the night The bed was very small too ,No Positive
149247,Park Grand London Kensington, I was disappointed with the gym It was absolutely tiny no space or mats to do floor exercises plus machines out of order , The rooms and bathroom were modern and comfortable and quiet It s location within spitting distance of the underground made travelling easy 
149248,Park Grand London Kensington, A small thing please put the correct WiFi details in the guest book in the room Then I don t have to bother reception who are pretty busy , The choice of eggs in a morning scrambled or hard boiled Soft boiled were offered if I wanted them The Do Not Disturb light system was new to me and very welcome The heating control actually worked in this hotel Without needing the assistance of the staff 
149249,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Very friendly helpful staff Clean comfortable A great oasis just away form the busy Earls Court Road and very close to the underground station 
149250,Park Grand London Kensington, Check in wasn t a good experience as we were told there was a problem with our room and asked if we would be prepared to go to a sister hotel in Paddington It transpired that a few rooms were out of service and they were asking all the guests the same The room was very small considering we had booked a superior I did query this with reception who were going to call me back we waited for half an hour with no phone call so decided just to make do with the allocated room and not waste any more time, Bed very comfy Hotel room nice and quiet Breakfast room very clean and sylish
149251,Park Grand London Kensington, The staff was very rude and we booked the room through booking com when we reached there they didn t provide us with a room which was unacceptable,No Positive
149252,Park Grand London Kensington, Room size exteremly small as big as the bed size Lobby is small too , Very clean super great location easy access to any wheat in London bathroom is so great and big
149253,Park Grand London Kensington, In a not too distant future the hotel might need a minor renovation, Perfect location close to the tube Excellent breakfast Good layout of the room Peace and quiet
149254,Park Grand London Kensington, Check in was a bit of a drag as hotel had a problem on the night I checked in but was offered a night at their sister hotel across the road Went back to the main hotel for my 2nd night and was offered a free upgrade , I ve always loved this hotel been staying here for 4 yrs now Great decor friendly staff 
149255,Park Grand London Kensington, Rude Bellhops watched us struggle to carry bags upstairs and didn t open lobby door Carried our own luggage up 3 flights of stairs No elevator to basement ground floor ,No Positive
149256,Park Grand London Kensington, I would say the following could be improved Elevator MOST OF THE TIME USED STAIRS Glass on the bathroom door Breakfast some meat items should be without pork , The location Stuff and the fact it is a new renovated hotel 
149257,Park Grand London Kensington, When leaving staff member asked me to pay for the complimentry snacks which were actually free as another staff member told us when checking in This was a bit embarrassing because she was quite loud and kept saying you have to pay Will be good if they find out the correct information before asking their customer to pay , Hotel was clean restaurants and transport was within walking distance 
149258,Park Grand London Kensington, I did like the shower room but I d prefer a bath instead for more relaxation but the shower room was great and would be great in summer too , Bed was very comfortable great facilities in the room Beautiful hotel located in a lovely place 
149259,Park Grand London Kensington, My room was virtually underground and I missed not having a window, Staff were great and very friendly Rooms are spacious and very clean My bathroom was brilliant Very close to Earls Court tube Easy access to airport Great Pubs and restaurants nearby Easy walk to Kensington Palace and the beautiful gardens and park 
149260,Park Grand London Kensington, The breakfast could have been better the waiting staff were not particularly helpful and the restaurant manager was running around the seating area telling everyone that the buffet would be closed in 5 minutes so if you won t more food get some I felt rushed in eating my breakfast , The beds were extremely comfortable and the room although very small was extremely clean 
149261,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast could have had more choice, Staff very friendly gave us a free upgrade and bed was so comfortable Breakfast was sufficient would definitely return
149262,Park Grand London Kensington, We were asked about a special request with our booking however was not acknowledged during our stay so don t understand the point of asking , Friendly staff Location not too bad 
149263,Park Grand London Kensington, the room was in the basement and was under the breakfast room Heard all the chairs scraping across the floor early in the morning Door to the room was paper thin Could hear all the guests walking up and down and everything people said in the corridor Could not get back to sleep , the shower
149264,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was cold as old windows allowed a lot of cold air in to the room Needed the heating up to 28 to be comfortable Paper starting to peel from the walls and the phone wasn t working , The room was modern and comfortable
149265,Park Grand London Kensington, Spot on nothing wrong here , Very welcoming staff on arrival Complimentary newspapers in the reception lobby Excellent bed double mattress protector and warm cosy feel to the room Asked for a top floor room and they delivered all facilities in the room were excellent mini bar available hairdryer and iron ironing board already in room The stay cheered us up really well after a not so nice other hotel we checked in and out off just prior Asked for some more complimentary coffee and milk which was brought up to the room in no time Great value for money 
149266,Park Grand London Kensington, Booking invalid They asked to live to their hotel in Paddington instead of Kensington that we refused They finally found a room but it did not meet our booking criteria They changed our room for the 2nd night but it was very small the so called double bed was actually a 1 person large bed that other hotels offered me in other locations too expensive for what they offer Restaurant average food and service, Location Free minibar and coffee tray Free internet connection
149267,Park Grand London Kensington, Small room in fact the surface of a triple room is the one of a double room At the first floor from the rooms which have the view on the internal terrace you hear all night long the sounds of the pigeons which can be quite annoying ,No Positive
149268,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was very cold Whatever you do please stay away from Room 004 It stunks in this room and the heater does not work properly After several hours of no heating the bathroom floor started getting warm The staffs did not come up to check the faulty heater and it seems that they were trying to fix it from the reception It appeared that they knew about this problem They said that they were fully booked and no other rooms were available but I belived it was a lie as it stated that more rooms were available for booking online , it is near the train station and some of the staffs were nice 
149269,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was a bit stuffy but opening a window solved this problem , Great location close to the Earl s Court tube station many tourist attractions off the Piccadilly and District lines into the city center The accommodation was clean staff was outstanding several good diverse restaurants and shopping close to the hotel 
149270,Park Grand London Kensington, Bedside tables had muck underneath the glass Bathroom very small with no bath Had to walk sideways between toilet and shower cubicle to get in Couldn t even lay the shower mat down fully I paid for breakfast which was not good Bacon very overcooked and dry lying in grease boiled mushrooms and solid and rubbery scrambled eggs , Very close to Earls Court tube station Staff friendly and helpful Bed and pillows comfy 
149271,Park Grand London Kensington, Rooms a little small with the wardrobe in a difficult position right against the bed Our room looked out at a brick wall but then we didn t choose it for the view , Excellent location quiet Buffet breakfast very good with excellent scrambled egg Shower and room facilities good
149272,Park Grand London Kensington, The air conditioning wasn t working but we are to tired to change rooms when you realised But I did complain and report to the reception The room also was quite small , Staffs very receptive and nice and very good location We also enjoyed the breakfast 
149273,Park Grand London Kensington, Waiting for half an hour at 6 30 pm in the reception on the night to check in as the reception did not know if the room was ready but the booking says check in from 2pm The young girl on the counter was only a trainee and no senior management to assist The room we booked was a twin and they gave me a double room We have stayed before but the service we got was very poor and will not be rushing to go back Disappointing stay,No Positive
149274,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was a little on the small side as was the bathroom , We were relocated to this property due to reservations They really looked after us and made the transfer as easy as possible 
149275,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The staff made a huge effort decorating our room as we were celebrating a very special anniversary That made the day even more amazing for us so thank you so much 
149276,Park Grand London Kensington, Found that the smoke detector in the room had been covered by two plastic bags immediately sorted by the maintenance staff but surely this should have been spotted by house keeping , My fifth visit and as always the staff were welcoming and helpful I will stay there again without a doubt 
149277,Park Grand London Kensington, Out the window could do with looking a bit prettier but not bothered enough to mark you down on it Maybe a little advise for future Incase of pickier guests , Loved the hotel So welcoming and refreshing Fruit infused water and hot chocolate on arrival and shown to our rooms by door staff with great instructions info about the hotel Really enjoyed our stay
149278,Park Grand London Kensington, Rooms too small and very very warm even with the AC on View was of a brick wall how romantic, Location staff room facilities all very good
149279,Park Grand London Kensington, The bed was a bit soft , We have just got back from our stay here in the Park Grand Kensington Everything was amazing The staff were so accommodating and friendly nothing was ever too much trouble We were upgraded due to it being my husband s birthday they put complimentary chocolates and a bottle of wine in the room for him too What a lovely touch Check in was quick and easy and our room was ready before the check in time which was good although they were happy to hold our bags for us as they also did on check out day Breakfast was very good a wide choice of hot and cold food available and it didn t feel crowded The decor of the whole hotel was very good and had a luxury feel about it It even smelt nice The location of the hotel was brilliant literally a 2 min walk to Earls Court tube 5 min walk to the museums and a 10 min walk to Kensington High Street for all you shoppers we walked a lot as you see more that way The bathroom was very clean and toiletries were nice although could do with a bubble bath The hair dryer was a good quality We had lots of seating areas comfy chair sofa and other chair in our room which is always handy as you don t always want to sit on your bed We were out the front of the hotel as we requested as we like to see what s going on but was still quiet I would definitely book to come back to this hotel the next time we come to London as it was value for money but felt like a luxury hotel worth the 4 it has been given 
149280,Park Grand London Kensington, Booked a three bed room for me my wife and 21 year old son Got a two bed room with an additional camping bed suitable for a 10 year old child Complained after first night and got a new room suitable for three persons prior to third night However this room was freezing cold as heater was not started Went to sleep in a cold room but woke up pleasantly warm 4 th night was as it should have been from the start Still I was charged for a true three person bed room To summarize I paid more than I received and had booked, Nice rooms Comfortable beds for two 
149281,Park Grand London Kensington, I didn t feel that I m welcomed I came 12pm which was 2 hours before the check in time and they didn t offer early check in however I had to respect that in case there weren t rooms left But when I came they kept me waiting for my luggage with no reason Also they gave me a room on the first floor just infront of they street and you could imagine that how difficult to get sleep Even I asked for a room on the upper floor I felt that I ve been treated like that because I m looking Arab it is really kind of racism and inconvenience, The room is really nice also clean of the room WiFi was good there are many TV channels I watched Europe League Paris SG vs Barcelona on my room Also they offering tea coffee fruits and biscuits
149282,Park Grand London Kensington, Tooth brushes in vanity packs, Loverly room with great welcome Very friendly front of house team Good hotel could have done with more soap and tooth brushes in vanity pack Thanks for the chocolate and valintine balloons

149284,Park Grand London Kensington, We got incredibly tiny room in the basement for two people almost impossible to sleep comfortably For this value I expected much more The room surroundings were noisy each time someone flushes the toilet it s like he were in your room Above it all they extra charged and still have my deposit locked I left a week ago Very bad experience , Location
149285,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was a bit small It was a basement room so awkward to get to and very poor phone signal The bathroom had a drain smell so I needed to keep the door shut and that cured the smell problem but meant that the bathroom was very cold, Staff were very friendly and helpful Good warm room High standard of decoration Very clean
149286,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The cleanliness of the room was to the highest standard The room while small was extremely comfortable what i liked best was the room noise wise seemed to be very insulated you would hear nothing from the corridors at all This is I find unusual in hotels very often you are exposed to noise from both inside and outside the hotel This was not the case here at all which made for a great nights sleep Excellent reception staff great location near the underground 2 mins walk 
149287,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Great location with Earls Court Tube Station a short walk away Very comfortable and clean hotel Helpful staff good breakfast and value for money 
149288,Park Grand London Kensington, The waiting staff in the morning no smiles had to ask for a pot of tea even though the 3 waitresses had walked past us on numerous occasions The bar in the evening we had to wait so long to be served we just left and went out instead, Found the hotel was very comfortable and close to the underground Good breakfast reception staff very polite and friendly
149289,Park Grand London Kensington, I was charged twice for my night stay called up reception to ask what had happened when I informed them that I was being charged by the bank for being overdrawn they didn t really care or apologies for the mix up Due to the money for my room being taken twice I didn t have spending money for my stay in London Everything else was lovely but not having money for my stay and having to still chases it up 4 days later really put a downer in my stay at park grand ,No Positive
149290,Park Grand London Kensington, Booking dot com making the booking for august if it wasn t for the staff we would have had no where to stsy, Friendly staff after booking dot com cocked it up and booked us in august
149291,Park Grand London Kensington, breakfast was disappointing for a 4 star No freshly made to order stuff like porridge ommlettes kippers etc No better than a premier inn breakfast , rooms were lovely
149292,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, When the staff found out we were here for our wedding they went beyond the call of duty to make our stay a special one We were moved to a bigger room and after our wedding ceremony were were treated to a special bottle of bubbly flowers on the bed and much more 
149293,Park Grand London Kensington, The bed linen had not been changed as we discovered having returned after being out to celebrate our wedding anniversary The bed sheets were marked and there were many obvious pubic hairs throughout the bed The pillow cases smelled of previous users There was nobody available at reception to raise the matter at the time 11 30pm so we ended up sleeping on top of the duvet The following morning we made a complaint to the manager and were subsequently offered a refund of 25 which is unsatisfactory We have photographs of the incident but have not currently published these , Leaving it 
149294,Park Grand London Kensington, The staff were amateurish At 11 pm another guest burst into my room the front desk had double booked my room Very embarrassing and unforgivable Will never stay here again , Good location reasonably clean 
149295,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast room staff were somewhat more disorganised on this visit and perhaps the internet connection could need some attention , excellent friendly helpful staff one particular member of reception who has always been exreemly helpful Francesca deserves a special mention but all other memebers of the work force are second to none 
149296,Park Grand London Kensington, The lifts had rubbish on the floor and some of the doors could have done with a lick of paint , Really comfy bed lots of freebies good location really clean 
149297,Park Grand London Kensington, They first offered a basement floor room but once we asked to change it they did , Though a bit far from city center it has great tube access even with wheelchair access at tube syation earls court Good tube lines as well 
149298,Park Grand London Kensington, the only negative point is due to the behaviour of one single staff member at the reception he gave us an adequate room and when we asked to change it he told us we should have wait the day after in the morning we asked and there wasnt any problem unfortunately in the afternoon we asked the same guy a pair of slippers and a bathrobe he said they had none we asked later on to another person and in 5 minutes everything was brought to our room the rest of the staff was very nice and really helpful , Very nice and clean hotel in a nice area full of restaurants and close to the undergrond the breakfast was also really good with a great selection I reccomend this hotel for a leausure and business stay
149299,Park Grand London Kensington, They transferred me to another hotel for 1 night because of some problems within the hotel While they offered me free breakfast for compensation this ruined my general impression for the service it is a 4 star hotel and should be better organized , The hotel is very good clean and nice location
149300,Park Grand London Kensington, Layout of room could of been better for a superior room was difficuilt to get to other side of bed close to french window in our room, Excellent hotel for weekend trip away close to earls Court tube station and local shops bars cafes central London 20 mins by tube

149304,Park Grand London Kensington, Unfortunately in our room 122 we were subjected to a continuous noise coming from what sounded like an extractor fan in another room which was on the whole night and was very loud Fortunately we had a few drinks before returning to our room for the night so managed to get off to sleep without the noice being too much of an issue but once waking up early the next morning the noise was a constant irritant i would not pay and stay here again if i knew i would have to tolerate that noise , The room was clean modern and comfortable and the staff were friendly and helpful 
149305,Park Grand London Kensington, Only thing we would mention is the squeaky door outside our room room 8 in the corridor Woke us up very early with people going to breakfast leaving and became very irritating from then on , We had a surprise knock at the door from a member of staff handing out chocolate which was sweet Also the complimentary mobile with the room was handy as it had lots of ideas for places to eat vist 
149306,Park Grand London Kensington, Duvet was a little on the thin side with no extra blankets in the room Absence of a bath robe Not double glazed so quite cold and could be noisy , Immaculatey clean WiFi good once connected 2 min walk to the tube as well as lots of restaurants bars and convenience stores

149322,Park Grand London Kensington, We had to wait a long time for our room and the service wasn t consistent , The friendly and competent staff as well as the location of the hotel near shops and restaurants

149324,Park Grand London Kensington, Staff we encountered were efficient but not overly friendly or enthusiastic We had a club room booked but didnt get any information on where this was or how to access it There was also no bath in room or any view so we are not too sure what the benefit of paying extra for a club room was , nice clean rooms well furnished breakfast was ok location was excellent
149325,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was ridiculously small would never go back if given a room like that again Not good value for money at all , Close to earl s court underground

149327,Park Grand London Kensington, I lost my Priority Card my Priority Airport Lounge card it was inside the card insert so the air conditioning worked in the room while I was away I informed reception but nothing was really done about it They didn t seem interested in looking for it as I was checking out I was initially given a basement room which was not acceptable so I complained They must have a lot of complains when they allocate this room There was another person checking in at the same time who also refused the room They tried to convince me that it is a bigger room but the pipes were exposed and very claustrophobic These rooms are not acceptable , Staff were friendly
149328,Park Grand London Kensington, Although at booking stage I had clearly required a room upper floor I was initially assigned a downstairs one with no window They then changed my room to a suitable one same happened to a lady travelling with me The fitness room would require some maintenance the equipment is a bit rusty , Good location nice rooms at upper stairs while the ones downstairs are very claustrophobic no window

149332,Park Grand London Kensington, You could sometimes hear the muffled rumble of the tube we were in a basement room , Clean and comfortable room and hotel in general Friendly and helpful staff Nice breakfast buffet 
149333,Park Grand London Kensington, Check in took 25 minutes this is not a 4 star hotel carpets were ripped and stained in the corridors and there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the corridor outside our room We were told we had been upgraded for free and yet the view from our bedroom window was a wall and a gutter , Comfy bed
149334,Park Grand London Kensington, Very hot even with open window near a boiler maybe room 207 AC did not work Hole in the ceiling above the shower a bit unnerving 2x single beds connected instead of full bed , Staff facilities 
149335,Park Grand London Kensington, We were told by staff we would be on the 5th floor for the view of the city I looked out my window and saw nothing but the building in front , Staff where lovely and the bed was so comfortable The rooms where perfect too Lovely romantic night

149339,Park Grand London Kensington, Was a bit noisy due to road works just out the front of hotel, Good location near Earls Court station The hotel was clean and provided tea and coffee making facilities plus biscuits and chocolates on your pillow
149340,Park Grand London Kensington, The service was awful All our requests were declined I didnt get such bad service at any place One morning we didnt get towels for shower They didnt cleaned at all Glasses were not cleaned We leaved before breakfast and asked for water at breakfast box but they refused to give us They could not supply almost anything at breakfast box Zero effort to help us, We ordered the biggiest business club room to enjoy our stay The key didnt open the club lounge When we entered to business room the were the same crousans for all 4 days we were there The same The club room includes phone for internet and local calls It doesnt work and they didnt fix it although we asked each day It is very disapointing hotel 
149341,Park Grand London Kensington, can t fault it , Great staff they were a delight and friendly from the double door concierge entry well balance check in and excellent breakfast selection loved the fresh fruit in the room and selections of wines ect 
149342,Park Grand London Kensington, I have been double charged and am waiting for a refund Full payment had already been deducted from my card the day before I arrived which I did not realise until getting back home and checking my account statement and was made to pay on arrival despite the hotel having already charged the card that was used for booking a day before arrival Anyone thinking about staying at this hotel should be aware of this as I have travelled all over the world and have never come across this before hotel agent told me this was normal This is total Rubbish Very strange system Therefore I will not stay at this hotel again Have been told that I will be given a refund in a few days , Good location and comfortable bed Friendly agent at checkin 
149343,Park Grand London Kensington, Rooms small for the money and designation as superior did not reflect size not sure how it could have been any smaller and therefore less than superior , Clean and compact Excellent location mid way between earls court and Gloucester Road 
149344,Park Grand London Kensington, Staff were not trained very well no manners 2 apples and a pear in the room but they was bad cleaner missed rubbish maintenance crew had better customer skills, Nice room although small very modern comfy bed
149345,Park Grand London Kensington, Most of the staff were lovely but one member of reception staff was extremely rude unwelcoming and looked miserable , Rooms were lovely nice location short walk from nearest tube station 
149346,Park Grand London Kensington, Book for 2 adults and a 15 year old teen but a bed was given more like a baby cot and was broken while lying on it however we changed to different room next day this shouldn t happen at the first place , Nice location easy to access anywhere
149347,Park Grand London Kensington, The bathroom was a little small however this is often the case in London hotels Note that families with an older child have to book a triple room as twin and double rooms have no space for an extra bed just a cot This needs to be made clearer on the website , Nice comfortable room plenty of space for two adults and older child in a triple room Everything required for a comfortable stay was included and drinks were a reasonable price D cor in rooms and public areas was nice and modern Wifi in room was excellent Can t comment on food as we didn t eat there however it s within very easy reach of a good selection of restaurants 
149348,Park Grand London Kensington, Try to avoid the rooms on the basement floor as the fire exit door is open all the time and the hall stinks of cigarettes Besides it was not safe as anybody could enter My card was charged additional amount without my authorization so watch out ,No Positive
149349,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was particularly small Had to climb down a lot of stairs with a case Staff were not particularly helpful when I complained about the size of the room despite staying before they didn t want to help or change my room Service at check in was slow and overall I found the receptionist quite rude , Close to the tube
149350,Park Grand London Kensington, The shower did not drain properly The maid went in our room when we popped out And then barged back in without a word whilst we were in there no apology At breakfast we were given a table that was not laid up Front desk called our room at a silly time I didn t have a chance to complain as checked us out without a word No questions to ask how our stay was whatsoever I feel a refund is needed and will look to complain, Room was comfortable and easy location
149351,Park Grand London Kensington, Noisy street cleaners early in the morning The shower was slow to drain ankle deep in water terrified it would over flow staff at breakfast watching you eat as soon as you laid the cutlery down they were trying to take plates away meant to be twin room but it was a double bed separated very close to my companion not good, Comfy bed clean hotel staff friendly good location to underground
149352,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing , Brilliant room amazing helpful staff we loved our stay We accidentally left our phone in the room staff were great at making sure we got it back safely Was very helpful that we had a mini fridge in our room and loved our room service breakfast in bed in the morning 
149353,Park Grand London Kensington, Bed was not a double very small, Brilliant location and very clean Very helpful staff alway on hand to help with pram and bags Very close to tube station 
149354,Park Grand London Kensington, Our room was on the 3rd floor number 320 It must have been near the extractor outlet as it was noisy during the kitchen operating hours I was awoken on saturday mor ing by the fumes from breakfast service The smell was terrible The back ground noise from the extractor boiler passing through the room was annoying The cleanliness was good but i think the hotel and rooms need a deep clean The view was not good either We checked in early the check in process seemed rather chaotic when it was busy , Excellent location and proximity to tube Amenities were to a 4 star standard 
149355,Park Grand London Kensington, Small room initially more like a cupboard I was moved to a larger room but it was a convoluted route up one floor along corridors and through several doors back down to the ground floor again and past the kitchen to get to it , Staff were pleasant and helpful
149356,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was very small and we had a room looking out onto a work yard so didn t have a pretty view of Kensington , Room was clean but small room service was brilliant Staff were friendly and helpful location was great as the tube was only up the road I would stay again but ask for a bigger room with a nicer view as the work yard wasn t the nicest to look at Food was good too 
149357,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Stayed for 10 nights from the 26th of november really reccomend this hotel for top quality cleanliness and service in a quiet area yet close to everything you need The highlight of my stay was walking in the hotel door being greeted by a great man Mr Cornellio always happy hard working and offering assistance to me even on my rough days seeing him really cheered me up The hotel is a 2 minute walk from earls court station and various fast food places making it perfect as a base for exploring london If you enjoy walking i found my 15 minute walk to harrods pleasant and was even able to stop by the natural history museum on my way I would reccomend the full english breakfast for those trying to get a good meal in for the day ahead it was reasonably priced 
149358,Park Grand London Kensington, Nothing I could fault at alll, Everything really faultless the facilities where great the bed was very comfortable location was good near the tube station very clean friendly staff well managed and for central London good value
149359,Park Grand London Kensington, Don t take visa electron Took 150 deposit from my account which takes 3 working days to refund into my account after we leave hotel AND because had to pay cash because wouldn t take visa electron had to pay extra 50 deposit, So close to the tube station
149360,Park Grand London Kensington, Maybe could have done with a larger selection at breakfast but it was still good , Loved our stay here The bed was huge and comfortable Everything was provided and towels were replaced after one days use Staff were very kind and helpful 
149361,Park Grand London Kensington, Our bedsheets were not changed once during our entire stay Our mini bar was not restocked Food was cold in the restaurant Upon checkout they charged my card for our dinner in the restaurant despite us paying by cash on the night When we explained we were told IF we did pay they would fix it We got our refund in the end but as we were on our honeymoon we didn t feel like we needed the added stress , Bed was very comfy
149362,Park Grand London Kensington, The bed was too soft for me but that is a personal preference Could do with some shelves in the bathroom for toiletries , The staff were lovely Breakfast menu was plentiful The whole hotel was very nicely decorated and our room was spotlessly clean 
149363,Park Grand London Kensington, I mentioned not to arrange the underground room However still an underground room , The hotel is close to the station and easy to be found Staffs are friendly and the breakfast is good 
149364,Park Grand London Kensington, Cotton blankets instead of duvets for those of us who get too hot Boiled eggs soft and hard for breakfast , Helpful and attentive staff Vanessa at the front desk was great Breakfast good with plenty of options
149365,Park Grand London Kensington, The superior double room I got was in the basement without a view to the outside world I re checked both the site and my booking but there is no mention of the superior room being a renovated dungeon The hotel should be more forthcoming about this so potential customers know and have a choice , excellent location
149366,Park Grand London Kensington, Location of bedroom very poor up in lift downstairs and down more stairs Felt very much that add on to hotel Constant smell of cigarettes in corridor as staff smoked near fire door, Great location Room good standard Cosy and clean 
149367,Park Grand London Kensington, Bed too soft Probably good quality but not suitable for anyone with any back problem Mattress could not be reversed for firmness which was possible in hotels in France Spain and in UK, Staff location cleanliness 
149368,Park Grand London Kensington, Avoid lower ground floor rooms , Very friendly and helpful staff on arrival accommodated room change for 1 of our 3 rooms and early entry to another so we could change clothes and drop bags for no extra charge couldn t ask for more Rooms have usual fridge kettle etc but also a microwave which didn t matter to us but it could be of help to others Everywhere very clean and beds comfortable Gym small and no pool but for city centre hotel of this size to expect more would be unreasonable Location for us was great easy run to Earl s Court from Heathrow on Piccadilly Line then a 5 minute max walk to the hotel and with great connections to other tube stations from there Overall good value as well Would go back without hesitation 
149369,Park Grand London Kensington, We arrived after a long journey to find our room wasn t ready They were apologetic but we had a 10 minute wait , Location was excellent for our trip Room was spotless Staff helpful and friendly 
149370,Park Grand London Kensington, As in most hotels there was only one chair in a double room we would have liked two After our first night we went out during the morning returning around 3 30pm to find the room hadn t been cleaned I was told they would send someone but I stated after 5pm as we were resting before a night out They came twice before 5pm , The staff were quick to compensate when our room was allocated to another couple a couple of hours after we had arrived 
149371,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast ma tre d needs further customer service training Breakfast room which doubles as the bar is extremely stark and functional with harsh lighting Poor service at breakfast with lack of crockery and cutlery The bar was closed on our return from the West End Some rooms VERY small for 2 adults , Very good location and most of the staff are exceptionally polite and helpful Very clean and rooms are comfortable and well equipped 
149372,Park Grand London Kensington, We had a lovely little balcony but the window door was locked so we couldn t use it, Quiet location but so handy to Earl s Court tube station shops and restaurants
149373,Park Grand London Kensington, Room was very small there honestly wasn t room to swing a cat rug on floor covering access door nearly caused an injury hidden service charge on room service was sneaky Have stayed at better hotels in a more central location for less money, Bed comfortable and room clean
149374,Park Grand London Kensington, WINDOWS IN ROOMS ALLOWED A LOT OF COLD AIR INTO ROOM ALSO A LOT OF NOISE AS WINDOWS WERE ONLY SINGLE GLAZED LAST NIGHT WE ATE IN HOTEL FOOD WAS NOT GREAT FOR 4 START HOTEL,No Positive
149375,Park Grand London Kensington, The window in our room 510 was leaking some cold air from the street It was pretty uncomfortable No sleepers , Greatest thing about this hotel is that they give you an Internet phone that you can take with you around London and use for free I used my Facebook Skype Maps email etc A perfect thing for a foreigner Also very friendly stuff clean rooms Very good location 45 min by underground from Heathrow 3 min from the station to hotel 4 min walk to supermarket 
149376,Park Grand London Kensington, We didn t quite understand the heating there was a cold draught from the vent near the ceiling I asked for glutenfree breakfast basically only simple toast was available i e No tasty pastries etc No glutenfree cereal was mentioned to me Also the hot food could have been hotter , Quiet hotel and quiet location Spacious room Separate bathroom Welcoming staff Spotlessly clean Very comfy bed 
149377,Park Grand London Kensington, badkamer kan opfrisbeurt gebruiken nogal zwakke straal om te douchen, topligging in rustige mooie buurt zeer comfortabel bed lekkere restaurants in de buurt metro op 1 minuut wandelafstand
149378,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The room was compact but very well equip with everything you needed hair drier iron tea coffee facility fridge etc the bathroom was excellent good powerful shower

149480,Park Grand London Kensington, can t think of anything other than it would have been better to have been able to stay longer than the two days, the friendliness of the staff especially the way they went the extra mile to make my daughter s stay forher 17th birthday special lovely touches

149483,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, the breakfast was good We had to request a room change as the original room was downstairs and too many stairs were involved The new room was light and airy and could be accessed via a lift The staff changed the room willingly Transport was convenient 
149484,Park Grand London Kensington, No natural lighting It was an absolute maze to get to our room Wouldnt provide extra blanket Had to pay GBP9 for water when i got sick in the middle of the night Room too small you can hardly move, The bed was comfortable
149485,Park Grand London Kensington, They have a very strict check in time so you shouldn t expect to check in early That didn t end up being a problem for us though and the staff was able to switch us to a room that was ready We only had to wait for about 15 minutes after 2pm to get in our room , The location was perfect a very short walk to Earl s Court Station and within walking distance of some great restaurants The staff was very accommodating and even helped switch our room so we could check in faster We booked this hotel at a great deal and it was perfect for our vacation The room was small but we were expecting that for Europe I would definitely stay here again 
149486,Park Grand London Kensington, Not enough bench space for belongings food or even for toiletries For two people we found ourselves putting everything in and out of our bags as there was nothing to put it on except insid draws and for 3 nights it was hard to get comfortable Breakfast was more expensive than walking 100m down the road to a large selection of breakfasts and cafes at much better rates reception too busy due to the late checkouts forcing people to sit in the lobby until their rooms were ready Very busy lobby , Great location close to Subway station and a medium amount of food and beverage activities Comfortable room temperature staff were working hard to please everyone and deserve medals for performing such a good job uncluding housekeeping 
149487,Park Grand London Kensington, Stairs at entrance Provided a non accessible room Not having a room available at check in which was at 7pm at night , Very poor service for disabled guest

149489,Park Grand London Kensington, I booked my hotel the day before and once I arrived the room was not available due to no hot water in the hotel So I had to relocate to another hotel for one night And my room was smaller that what I paid for Luckily they offered free breakfast But still disappointed about the inconvenience , The bathrooms were clean Suitable for a short stay
149490,Park Grand London Kensington, The lift is extremely small for a hotel of this size More than 2 people in the lift at once felt cramped , The hotel was in a quiet area but located very close to Earls Court station on the Picadilly Line so was a perfect way to quickly travel around London 
149491,Park Grand London Kensington, i would have upgraded to club room for bigger size because we had a lot of luggage, property clean and service amazing amenities wonderful and location is excellent close to tube and to areas we wanted to go walking
149492,Park Grand London Kensington, We were transferred to their sister hotel in Paddington due to bathroom renovations and given their best room which was so small that we could not walk around the double bed as one side was pushed up against a wall We were given complimentary breakfast and free transfer to Paddington hotel , The hotel was quiet and close to restaurants and two metro stations and Hyde Park
149493,Park Grand London Kensington, Room a bit cramped Breakfast coffee tea service is a bit hit or miss Lift is essential to cover 5 floors but operation is interminably slow Television operation rather clunky , Bed comfortable with a firm mattress Room had everything we needed Late night entry security Aircon kept the room comfortable on a hot day 
149494,Park Grand London Kensington, We were upgraded to the club room which is a good sized comfortable room but it didn t have a functional window which meant there was no natural light getting in and of course no view ,No Positive
149495,Park Grand London Kensington, Minor complaint the air conditioning was hard to regulate and London was having a heatwave , Excellent Hotel location great close to Earls Court Station and staff were very helpful Upgraded our room as the first room was very small and after travelling for 2 months we had a lot of luggage Very clean and staff checked everyday we were happy with everything Would definitely stay here again 
149496,Park Grand London Kensington, Perhaps the lack of space for travellers from afar with TWO LARGE suitcases but that is a common gripe of travellers and was more than compensated by super comfortable beds giving us a restful night s sleep , Staff were particularly helpful from the front desk to the restaurant and to the room cleaner The breakfast variety was excellent and our greeting most mornings with a comment on Indian and Australian cricket was a good start to the morning 
149497,Park Grand London Kensington, The only issue was the shower as water did not drain away properly but that was it , Staff were very friendly and I thought it was a lovely touch when they delivered chocolates to your room Room was very clean and comfortable the tv had lots of channels good hairdryer which definitely makes a difference being a woman and the ironing board iron came in handy It s the little things like this that make such a difference 
149498,Park Grand London Kensington, Our basement dungeon room was apparently an upgrade so I shudder to think where we might have been without it The sewer We found it very claustrophobic and there was an odd smell from the lack of clean air Staff very insistent on paying upfront to the point that they visited my room at 11pm to rectify an error they made in billing me after we arrived at 11pm although I suggested it wait until morning as I was really tired Lastly the shower door came off thankfully it didn t fall on my boyfriend who was using it but obviously very dangerous I called reception and they were ready to send someone to repair it which was great but I got the impression that wasn t the first time it happened , Location was great 2 minutes from the tube in a nice area Housekeeping were generous with the supply of tea biscuits toiletries 
149499,Park Grand London Kensington, The fact workman were allowed entry into my occupied room to carry out window maintenence replacement and didn t clean up for brick dust from drilling all over the bedside table and pillow , Good bed comfortable

149504,Park Grand London Kensington, If anything just the size of the room but well worth the money , Comfy bed lovely shower room and super handy for the tube only a few minutes walk away would definitely stay again
149505,Park Grand London Kensington, Told the boiler was broken and would have to go to a sister hotel Had read about this before and refused to go Miraculously our room was then available Superior room is not even standard Tiny and looks onto dirty alley Upgraded to a better room after many complaints We felt the staff lied to us as we heard the same thing the next day to another guest about the boiler , Beds very comfy
149506,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, The Staff was excellent Valerie was very helpful in assisting us on our daily adventures The room was roomy and clean I would definitely stay here again 
149507,Park Grand London Kensington, A great hotel but unfortunately I felt I d been slightly tricked On arrival I was told we had been upgraded to a clubroom but found that this clubroom was under ground so had no window On the plus side we couldn t hear the traffic at all Apart from this the hotel and the staff in particular is really excellent ,No Positive

149511,Park Grand London Kensington, Poor service at the front desk We were put in the basement with no window on our arrival for a 5 night stay Asked to change rooms the next day however there was a big mix up and some disorganization at the front desk and they couldn t actually determine what room they moved us to All was sorted out in the end My question is there seems to be a problem with room selection by the front desk when booking with a 3rd party i e they give you the worst room ,No Positive
149512,Park Grand London Kensington, Bed sheets poor quality No view and barely any natural light for a so called club suite wouldn t pay the money for the apparent upgrade, Location
149513,Park Grand London Kensington, Bed could have been bigger but being 6 5f it s rare to have a bed bigger enough when travelling , Great place to stay this ended up being a last minute trip to London staff were very professional and nice The room was well fitted out and the hotel had a good gym

149519,Park Grand London Kensington, The breakfast was definitely not 4 standard Most of the staff were very helpful at breakfast but one man who greeted us on entry was not welcoming the other on the second day was great We tried to contact the hotel on two different email addresses prior to our visit to link our two bookings made on different occasions together We had no reply but managed to sort it out on arrival We kept the same room on both nights a deluxe double but had paid for a superior double on the second night The room was fine but it would have been nice to have been offered a discount or free breakfast for the second night , Great location within walking distance of Hyde Park where we were attending an event Reception staff very polite and helpful The hotel is in a quiet street and we got a good nights sleep on both days 
149520,Park Grand London Kensington, The view from the room was less than inspiring but if you don t expect to spend hours in your room staring longingly out the window this won t matter We knew the location when booking so spending a fair bit of time on the Tube to go anywhere did not come as a surprise , The staff went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable You get a lot for your money 
149521,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was way too small located in the basement so you are basically trapped in a box without a window probably below the kitchen Since my room was not at all soundproof every day I woke up around 6 00 am with people kitchen workers staff slamming the anti fire doors every 15 seconds and dragging some tables desks chairs upstairs Every single day I didn t sleep well in any of my 4 nights there When they finally would go a bit more quiet than I could listen to guests coming and going Also the double bed barely fit me and my wife , Front desk staff was friendly and breakfast was good

149530,Park Grand London Kensington, We booked with an offer via Booking at a very low price so the first accommodation we have been given was not a room but just a bed in a cellar it was at level 1 no chance to get there by lift but just moving in the background of the hotel till the kitchen of the restaurant We asked immediately to change the room and we received a good one at first floor , Good location in a nice neighbourhood very close to the Tube station
149531,Park Grand London Kensington, We were really located at short notice Really poor communication of this change This cut into our stay time We were also promised a call back from the manager To no avail I shall be warning friends and family to avoid, Our stay was not a good one due to poor communication from the hotel on change of location 
149532,Park Grand London Kensington, Thought the breakfast was a little expensive seing as there were so many other places to purchase breakfast in the immediate vacinity at very good prices ,No Positive

149540,Park Grand London Kensington, I had sent a message asking for an early check in shortly after I made the booking I didn t hear from the hotel but assumed that it would be OK When it came to it I wasn t able to check in early which was a bit annoying as we would have liked to freshen up before a long afternoon and evening at a Hyde park concert Next time I would contact the hotel directly with any requests Although our room was very nice and well designed it was in the basement with a view of a brick wall , Very nice rooms good size and comfortable with lots of attention to detail Friendly staff Quiet location but close to tube stations Would return if I was looking to stay in this area but for visiting Central London I would probably look for something closer

149542,Park Grand London Kensington, We were allocated 2 rooms in the basement without windows I am surprised that this kind of rooms even exist After discussing the unstuitability of this with the very rude receptionist they gave us rooms one floor higher but in the very end of the corridor claimimg it was an upgrade this was after we explained that my husband has a heart condition so he can not stay in a room without windows Rooms are tiny and of very poor standard ,No Positive
149543,Park Grand London Kensington, At first they put us into a room with no bath having requested one and the room was quite small for a mature couple but that was quickly resovled and we were relocated to Room121, The general attitude of the staff and the pleasant atmosphere of the hotel in general and also the allocation of our roo 121 and also the food was fresh and warm and the dining area bright and cheery

149549,Park Grand London Kensington, The Staff hardly anyone knows or understands English even though we were in London Bathroom extremely small and both shower recess floor and bathroom floor were quite slippery Cleanliness quite good although a wilted flower still in vase on bedside table a week later It was very difficult to get staff to understand English even the basics please remove insert in duvet Too much air freshener used outside the room to the point of making us almost gag Quite nauseating , Firstly I have reviewed the Park Grand Paddington Court Hotel as we were moved there due to boiler problems at the Park Grand Kensington Mostly the area although Kensington would have been a superior location Staff were mostly always courteous Efficient check in

149570,Park Grand London Kensington, I booked a plan that included breakfast When arrived the lady who checked me and my mother in insisted under the supervision and instructions of another member of staff that we booked a plan without meals included even after showing the email from Booking com stating that breakfast was included To avoid any hassles I decided to pay for the additional breakfast cost at that point with the original price I expected to pay when I made the booking in the currency of my credit card not in GBP When I checked out the lady who supervised the junior staff when I checked in told me that they made the mistake of charging me extra for the breakfast and would refund the extra cost She processed the refund in GBP without asking which currency I would like to receive a refund because of their mistake The worst thing was that the supervisor that made the mistake when I checked in and the same person who was responsible for checking me out did not explain the situation nor offered any apologies I was only given an explanation after I sternly asked for one when she asked for my credit card to process the refund I could accept the almost misleadingly spacious image of the room when I made the booking considering the part of country I was visiting I could not accept the irresponsible and unprofessional handling of their mistakes I might not have shown my disagreement at the spot because I had my mother to take care of I would definitely advise against any one staying at such an establishment I would rather book a much cheaper accommodation and willingly accept such unprofessional service ,No Positive

149573,Park Grand London Kensington, We were changed to another less nice hotel the first night For Maintenance problems but I think they over booked Other hotel was much poorer quality and tiny room with out a proper separate shower a curtain between the toilet and the shower area They would have left me there if I hadn t insisted on going back to my original booking Plus I paid the same rate for the other hotel Not happy about that They did pay for a limo to transport us which was appreciated , Staff were really friendly and helpful Near a tube station Good English breakfast Nice sized room and comfy bed in the original booked room 
149574,Park Grand London Kensington, Didn t stay in this particular Hotel as initially planned due to a breakdown of hot water supply do your maintenance on a regular basis then this would be less likely to happen were transferred to their sister Hotel in paddington where they first wanted to put into a basement room next to the breakfast hall not that there was almost no light it was loud and smelled like old chip fat After complaining we were relocated to the top floor into the tiniest room on the floor as could be seen on the fire emergency map It is to be mentioned that we have booked a deluxe double bed room which we obviously did not get On top of that the air conditioner was broken twice during our stay Again you should do your maintenance on a regular basis Apart from the page the staff was quite unfriendly inexperienced and not of particular use Train your personnel properly seriously All in all quite a big disappointment Does not really fulfill the image that is created online Our last stay there , There is a smartphone available in your room with unlimited mobile data allowing you to plan your journey on the road Also you can make free calls with that This is an extremely useful gadget

149581,Park Grand London Kensington, Arrived 12 minutes before check in and had to wait for the 12 minutes before being allowed the key Got room to discover the net curtain pole wedged in the window promptly fell down the bathroom was dirty the toilet didn t flush properly and despite booking a room with internet the neolithic age scam is that the internet only works in the lobby If as a guest you are so unreasonable to want internet for the room then that is a scamming 12 50p per day and even then it s slow Staff were about as user friendly as a brick to a drowning man On the third day taking the lift down it stopped on floor two for a cleaner who happily threw perhaps a dozen bin bags into the lift around me jumped in pushed the floor for the basement and grumbled at me who had merely said hello and smiled for stopping at the ground floor to get out This is a hotel catering for one off rather than repeat business If you want somewhere purely as a base to explore then ignore the useless staff and enjoy the central location If you are on business for 2 or 3 days then forget it You will be grumpy stressed and no doubt here writing a neg review too , Location is good fluffy pillow or at least it was fluffy until the faulty rain gutter made it wet 
149582,Park Grand London Kensington, Having to come home , Great location Great transport links Very friendly staff who couldn t do enough for you Very comfortable clean rooms The hotel is very quiet being set back from the main road compared to others I have used in this area

149586,Park Grand London Kensington, I booked this for my wife who was traveling on her own first time in London I went for a better quality hotel thinking that the service and hotel would be very accommodating ohh I was so wrong I set the booking as a late check in and as my wife got there at 11pm due to traveling long distance When my wife at the hotel very tired and wanting to sleep and rest the hotel reception would not allow her to check in as she did not have my credit card when I booked through booking com I said that I would not be traveling and I was booking it on her behalf I asked to speak with the reception team as my wife is a foreign to try to explain the situation reception declined and was trying to chuck my wife out of the hotel and treat her like a tramp of the street I rang the booking desk and a man said there was noting I could do unless I paid again so with my wife now crying I had to transfer money to her account so she could get a room so now I have paid twice something I was not happy about reception said to my wife I could call the manager tomorrow that s very helpful After 30 minutes of waiting on hold to speak to booking Com apparently the only person who could sort this mess was them I spoke to a nice man that rang the hotel and then they said the had refunded me and could take 48 hrs still no money and they had upgraded her if the room was a upgrade I would of loved to see the first room a ground basement floor room not only this but when I booked I asked that I did not want ground floor as I wanted upper floor for better safety for a single women on her own I have worked in hotels for over twenty years and single woman are always put on upper floors This is one of the worst experience I have ever had to deal with my wife some distance away and me at home looking after my young children worrying if my wife will be on the streets of London all night ,No Positive

149588,Park Grand London Kensington, Like I said above I was a little apprehensive about the fact that I had to give my debit card to the receptionist for copying I felt she could have just checked it in reference to my passport and then return it unto me but hey I was probably wrong In the end I loved my short experience and so I am returning tomorrow to close a deal Park Grand Kensington is the place for me from now on Ditto , I liked everything except that I was a little apprehensive of they copying my debit card initially

149593,Park Grand London Kensington, The door key would stop working if we had been outside of the hotel during the day which was frustrating being on the third floor and having to go back down to reception every time it wouldn t work Also a handy tip make sure valuables are locked away as we had something go missing from one of our rooms luckily it was hotel property but it was something of value which would ve been costly at our expensive if we hadn t realised it had gone missing The safe is free so I would advise to use it with anything of value I even put expensive straighteners in there which I m hindsight I am thankful I did It might have been a one off but just a warning to future guests as it was very disappointing to have something taken from our room as the hotel was lovely apart from that and it affected our time staying at the hotel as we were worrying where the item had gone , The bed was very comfy and facilities inside the room were clean and worked well Good TV and the hotel provided us with an iron in the room after requesting one which was appreciated

149635,Park Grand London Kensington, Noisy room even though we requested a quiet one No good eateries around the area We booked at the Park Grand Kensington as we had several events and chores to do around the area that could be done either by walking or a couple of tube stops max When we got there only they informed us they were doing some maintenance work and they will locate us to a sister hotel which was in Paddington nightmare All our trips took at least 30 45min extra and had to use lots of taxis which is enormously expensive We said we didn t want another area and all what they said was sorry we tried to inform our customers This is not true as I did the booking on March 3 and I think they had enough time to inform us of this If they told us that before hand we could ve either cancelled as we had free cancellation until 1 day prior to arrival or used the Heathrow express to reach Paddington rather than paying a ridiculously high taxi fare from the airport to Kensington then jump on the free taxi they provided to the other hotel as a reward They also provided us with breakfast but it wasn t of any interest This was done extremely unprofessionally and I would advise you to confirm with the hotel before booking there , Breakfast was ok and staff were friendly

149643,Park Grand London Kensington, The toilet in our room was so close to the sink we couldn t stand in front of it to wash The bathroom was badly designed as lots of wasted space because it was a wet room It seemed as if it was a disabled bathroom as it had rails by the toilet This was quite odd as we hadn t booked a disabled room There were no facilities such as a bar area to relax in There was a small area to sit in at the front of the hotel but was full up with very few people , Spotlessly clean room

149650,Park Grand London Kensington, Value for money I felt was dreadful A few days prior to our stay I upgraded the room for an additional hundred pounds Absolutely conned When we arrived I couldn t believe the size of the room It was tiny Hardly space around the bed to use the wardrobe or dressing table Bathroom was very small too I genuinely believed an admin error had been made and we had not been put in the upgraded room When I put my views to the hotel staff they were extremely disinterested and just said that the room was the correct room and there was nothing more they could do Let down and ripped off was how I felt , Good location Good housekeeping Service and very clean 
149651,Park Grand London Kensington, Ensuite sink to near the toilet so you couldn t stand in front of the sink The front staff had our room locked on our return and seemed unaware we were booked for two nights Some seats in the dinning room needed a good clean Theses are minor things and overall our stay was very good , The room was a lovely size and so was the ensuite Breakfast was good The welcome from the door staff was excellent 
149652,Park Grand London Kensington, The lack of a sitting room or similar where we could sit with our family and chat It took us a while to realise that we could use the restaurant for this as it doubled up as a bar and meeting area , It was a good location for the tube into the centre The rooms were comfortable clean and well equipped The staff were very attentive and made us feel very welcome We paid extra for breakfast as our US family had it in their package and we were glad we did It was very good

149670,Park Grand London Kensington, Staff at Reception is discriminatory I booked my room 30 days in advance and they allotted a room two levels below the reception I had to demand for a change in the room and they changed it Why Is it because I am not white skinned Every hotel in the vicinity is giving English breakfast complimentary But you asked me to pay UKP 15 00 At the time of check in I was told that I can have the breakfast comp and the following day they said I have to pay , Location and the total look of the hotel It is awesome

149738,Park Grand London Kensington, The only thing was that our children had paid for us to stay as a birthday treat and reception wanted the card that had booked the room and because we didn t have it they had to refund the original card and then use one of our cards to pay for the room Our children were not happy as we obviously then saw how much it was and now have to transfer that amount back to us However the staff were so lovely about it we ourselves could not be cross about it , Room had everything including fruit sweets biscuits tea and coffee we felt spoilt rotten Staff were so lovely just couldn t fault it 
149739,Park Grand London Kensington, Initially the hotel staff at the front desk seemed very professional and accommodating I went to London to see a friend of mine and she has an infant I had called the reception desk to book her a taxi to take her home and made sure to mention that she will need a standard cab because she needed to fit her baby carriage The staff called for the wrong type of cab and seemed agitated and annoyed that we needed another type of cab for my friend s baby my friend and I were taken aback and that reaction left a bad taste in our mouths , The amenities in the room were great They provided toiletries and free coffee and tea although the coffee was of the instant variety but it still worked The bed was large and comfy in fact the front desk person had given me an upgrade to a larger bed and for that I am truly thankful One feature that was pretty cool was the status buttons in the room that let the staff know whether you re sleeping or if the room needed cleaning The wifi was fast and free the location was right down the block from the Earls Court Metro Station that can take you where you need to go rather quickly All in all it was a very nice stay in a very centralized part of London I would stay again

149753,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, We loved our superlative treatment by the staff at the Park Grand The location was excellent as well on a quiet street with a very short walk to the Tube We never opened a front door during our stay since their gentlement were so quick to open the door for us The wifi in the rooms was excellent which was important to us and we were pleasantly surprised to find several outlets to charge our various devices that were both European and North American The rooms were very clean and were just like they are pictured The location was excellent since we were near Earl s Court Station which had a Tardis as well as Starbucks a couple of pubs and good indian food all close by Ruxi recommended an excellent rooftop patio for a drink as well that we loved We hope to come back soon since this combination of great staff location and price suited us perfectly

149783,Park Grand London Kensington, Room service poor and meals in the evening not good also waiting for up to 20 mins for a drink for it then to be some weird concoction was annoying all staff are European I never spoke to one English person not that that s an issue but sometimes getting your point across can be difficult Finally an item went missing from the room and that is currently being investigated disappointed and for someone who travels globally to go back to London and have this happen is a huge let down I also would like to comment on overhearing the front desk advising a guest that a Preauthorisation taken on a card takes 1 month to return where as a refund takes 3 5 days Not quite the truth that is it , Location breakfast
149784,Park Grand London Kensington, Unfortunately when we arrived to check in we were told that we were being moved to a sister hotel the Paddingtond Grand on the far side of Hyde Park It was said that it was because of problems with plumbing in our original room This was well outside the Kensington area where we needed to be Contrary to what reception staff told us I have no evidence that any attempt was made to inform us beforehand There was no practical possibility of making alternative arrangements A taxi service was available but this inevitably took time We found this to be exceptionally poor service which distrupted our weekend It was clear that we could have been informed beforehand that the hotel was not available but were presented with a fait accompli which put our requirements far down the list of their priorities ,No Positive
149785,Park Grand London Kensington, I did not have any windows and was not told that there would not be any I like the light and the room was very cold when I first went in and it took a long time to warm up , I didn t stay for breakfast as I had to leave really early The bed was comfortable and it even had a microwave I liked the underfloor heating in the bathroom 
149786,Park Grand London Kensington, The room and bed were small with barely inches either side for getting around yet the bathroom and shower were excellent, The location being just a few yards from the tube and bus stop was ideal and the breakfast was of very good quality The staff on reception were always courteous and had a smile and a welcoming demeanor 
149787,Park Grand London Kensington, If you arrive with a lot of luggage or plan a long stay perhaps the room would be a little small For us it was perfect, The welcome and attention of all the staff was genuine pleasant and very prompt Everything was of a very good standard from the rooms and shower to the breakfast choice and good hot coffee The restaurant staff are excellent 
149788,Park Grand London Kensington, Couldn t find the bedside light switches and had to call for help If you need to know they are tucked away directly under the light fitting , Very nice hotel conveniently located for the underground Rooms very modern and spotlessly clean Staff friendly and helpful 
149789,Park Grand London Kensington, The temperature in the room was quite chilly due to the fact that the door window to the street could not be completely locked So it was needed to put the air conditioning to the very high level but still you could feel the low temperature air crawling at the floor level , Good location Really friendly staff willing to help and advise It was good to have there a small fitness room The room was quite spacious as well Set of complimentary fruit and cookies alongside with tea was very helpful Wifi signal was as strong as needed

149796,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Staff were wonderful lovely personal touches such as balloons and chocolates on the bed when they found out it was my birthday having asked if it was a special occasion on registering and adding breakfast to our tariff Hotel was very convenient to tube station and walking distance to the museums 
149797,Park Grand London Kensington, More kitchen facilities like cutlery although when you rang reception to be fair it was brought right up , Bed was amazing they upgraded us on arrival after we commented we were down London for our birthdays and even topped it off with balloons and chocolate on the bed
149798,Park Grand London Kensington, On arrival we only had 30 minutes to get ready We were told by reception that our room had been upgraded so we though great However when we entered the room we found a wet room which was meant for a disabled person the sink was tiny and right on top of the toilet which was very difficult to get around When I complained the next morning the young lady on reception just said oh and that was it The gentleman next to her asked what was the problem and when I explained to him also the fact we didn t complain the night before because we didn t have time it was just left I know you have no control over your guests also but the room next to us had their TV on quite loud until the early hours which didn t help matters So all in all what was supposed to be a nice relaxing time turned out to be a very disappointing experience and I certainly will not be recommending your hotel or returning back any time soon , Location and the breakfast was good 
149799,Park Grand London Kensington, Draft coming from the window A little bit noisy as we could hear the water systems from the next room Hair dryer was also faulty , Location microwave in the toom cupcakes in the room on arrival were nice

149815,Park Grand London Kensington, We were given a room with a disabled access bathroom which was very badly designed despite being a good size there was no room between the basin and the toilet The basin was tiny and very low and if you stepped back you could easily fall over the toilet As we had paid for a superior room this was disappointing as it felt we were staying in a hospital , Staff very friendly and hotel well appointed within a few minutes of the tube station Earls Court not exactly an upmarket area 
149816,Park Grand London Kensington, I initially booked at earl s court and finally sent us to their Paddington hotel because they have maintenance in some rooms No warning calls or email they pretend they could not reach me neither my colleague surprisingly They were nice enough to pay for the taxi to drive us to Paddington but it seems to be usual practice to overbooke one hotel in order to fill in the other Last but not least in Paddington you have to cross the road to go to the breakfast room and it s noisy renovation works all night nearby ,No Positive

149832,Park Grand London Kensington, The room size could have been somewhat larger given the price I was however quite disappointed in terms of cleanness especially in the bathroom where dust could not be missed on the black table surrounding the sink Furthermore the shower door mounted on rails was really a challenge for us as the door was broken off the rails Finally part of the bathroom floor was also damaged , We stayed in the Park Grand London Kensington for two nights The Hotel is well situated near Earl s Court and the staff very friendly accommodated our room requirements 
149833,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Terrific location 2 blocks from Earl s Court and Picadilly and District lines 40 minutes to Heathrow 1 km to museums Good wifi throughout not just in common areas as described on booking com Small but very well appointed room and bath

149837,Park Grand London Kensington, The sink is WAY too big and not enough shelf space to put products so if you knock them over they land in the toilet if the lid is up slightly frustrating, Very comfortable beds and black out blinds
149838,Park Grand London Kensington, Being harassed three times in the space of 45 minutes when coming back in the afternoon by three individual staff members First time it was the house maid supervisor asking if we were happy with the how clean the room was answers yes it was fine 10 minutes later staff member asked would we like anything from the minibar we answered no About twenty minutes laters a man in a uniform knocked and walked into our room with out any permission All very odd and he apologised and walked out Went to the main reception and reported it and said it was very harrasing and odd behaviour Apology given and said they would look into it Nothing was ever done nor did we get compensation for our distress Got charged 4 00 for eating a tiny bag of crisps which was allegedly from the mini bar This bag of Crisps wasn t even near the mini bar Will not return as staff were too complacent and did not deal with my complaint and we were left very unsatisfied, The rooms were beautiful huge beds

149842,Park Grand London Kensington, Breakfast queuein the morning was incredible we had to go back to our room and wait to get called The choice for brekkie was poor by the time you got down there as it had been hovered up by the other guests It could have been managed much better by giving us notice of busy times If you have special dietary requirements then give them notice as they ran out of gluten free bread, Location was good room and facilities were good 
149843,Park Grand London Kensington, A letter was placed under our door while we were out warning us that there were strange smells in the vicinity of our room and if we were caught disobeying the no smoking policy we would be fined We found new chocolates on our pillows so someone had been in the room while we were away and they should have been able to know that it was not us causing the issue I was offended and annoyed by the incident although I guess it is challenging for the hotel to handle such cases without offending someone , Nice room in a convenient location with friendly reception staff 
149844,Park Grand London Kensington, Requested a room with a view but although room was very nice it was a basement room So no windows which was a bit disappointing , Very comfortable clean hotel

149926,Park Grand London Kensington, The so called Club Room that we paid for was only characterized by 3 knocks on my door 10 minutes after arriving by an obnoxious room attendant who first came in with a set of upgraded shampoo then came to drop off some bathrobes and lastly came to drop off 2 cans of soda and a small bottle of wine Club Room , I did not like anything about the hotel

149929,Park Grand London Kensington, They are absolutely refusing to release the extra deposit that they had taken from my credit card already two days prior to our arrival at the hotel The staff has been very counter productive on this matter and I ve been forced to call several times The room was nice but rather tiny and the doors were paper thin you could hear people having sex in their rooms while you were walking down the corridor The tiny shower gel bottles were never replenished the two of us got one complimentary bottle of water on the first night after that none on one day I discovered someone s eye make up imprinted on my newly provided fresh and clean towel and yes we would ve had a room underground had I not read the previous reviews on booking com and refused to punch in my PIN code before ensuring that we weren t getting a basement room And in general this part of Kensington especially when taking a stroll towards the Earl s Court Tube station just wasn t as pleasant as the other parts we ve stayed in , There were some nice restaurants in the neighbourhood and the Tube station once you manage to pass the somewhat crowded narrow street is only a very short distance away from the hotel The doormen where very polite especially the one who gave us a tour of our room The room despite the problems with the towels and soaps was otherwise clean and nice albeit small 
149930,Park Grand London Kensington, My flight was cxl due to fog and called the hotel that I was rebooked for the next day flight Asked their consideration to waive the first night no show because there was no way that I could come on Sunday as all flights to LHR were cxl and I tried to fly the next day so all stay are not all cxl actually only first night Talked to manager and no compassions shown just said sorry we could not reimburse the first night Maybe it is London where they do not need loyal customer but I have lost faith and vowed to never return to this hotel compare to hotels in Asia where they show more emphatic to any force majeure and flexibility this hotel just don t care , Cleanliness and quiteness 
149931,Park Grand London Kensington, I stay in a lot of London hotels and have done for a few years using the booking sites to find good value However as soon as I walked in to reception I realised I had stayed at this one before because of the damp musty smell When I checked in I said please tell me I m not in a downstairs room but I was and they said they didn t have anything else This means you get more of the damp musty smell and NO windows The concierge kindly escorted me to the room and switched the air conditioning fan on to full , The room was spacious I think I paid a bit more for that 
149932,Park Grand London Kensington, Mattresses need upgrading better quality pillows Bathroom spacious but not enough counter space shelves Soundproofing could be better, Steps from Earls Court road tube station Plenty of pubs varied ethnic restaurants in area In room coffee fridge microwave

149944,Park Grand London Kensington, First of all I searched alot of hotels through booking and I chose this Hotel based on customer reviews 8 3 From the first moment I arrived to this hotel I could tell this is not a 4 stars hotel by any mean and I could not understand why people rated it for 8 3 Bad attitude from staff in check in and room cleaning is horrible First night when I came back to my room late at night there was a big dirt stain on my bed cover and guess what they only flipped the bedcover to the other side This is not only bad service but also cheating customers after complain so many times they start to do it better but not good enough to 4 star hotel standard the towels in the bathroom totally overused and I had skin allergy I had the worse vacation in my life in this place They ruine my anniversary and birthday celebration mood and most importantly if you want to leave the hotel they wont refund you money because its non refundable booking So where is your rights is customer if you dont like the place There is non You are just stuck with it if you are looking for nice hotel dont ever think of this hotel , The location near earls court tube station which is very central

149947,Park Grand London Kensington, Service mediocre and unsatisfactory Crew seemed uninformed and didn t know how to address guest comments and questions , Very nice hotel with great location 
149948,Park Grand London Kensington, The room was microscopic and so cold we were freezing They fooled us telling us we had an upgrade not true at all just to put us in the tiniest room ever close to the kitchen The hotel is so expensive we couldn t believe how we were treated , The location is perfect really close to the metro 
149949,Park Grand London Kensington,No Negative, Fabulous location plenty of nice reasonably priced little places to eat around The girls at the reception Judit and Roxi were super friendly Our room was clean modern complimentary fruit bowl and a water bottle were a nice bonus Definitely one of my favourite stays in London
149950,Park Grand London Kensington, Disappointed in the room for a four star We had evidently been upgraded to a delux room I am glad we did not have standard The bathroom was tiny and there was no outside window just a skylight and very little room between the bed and the wall , The staff were excellent Very helpful and accomodating Although it was annoying that they decided to vacuum outside our bedroom at 5 40 am 
149951,Park Grand London Kensington, This is a bait and switch and a totally dishonest behavior Booking should stop working with these two hotels I booked a superior double room When I arrived late at night after quite a wait the receptionist tells there is an electric problem with my room I believe this to be a lie Despite having my email and mobile number no communication was made to me to inform me They did not even have an alternative to provide and so I had to wait for quite a while until they could find a room at another hotel of the same owner group I would guess By the time I finally get to the other hotel the Shaftesbury Premier London Paddington Hotel I get a tiny room in a pretty bad shape although the bathroom was recently renovated This room gives on the reception and on a window on the parking street so rather noisy And this room at the same price as the first one originally booked ,No Positive

149955,Park Grand London Kensington, On the ground floor but rooms accessed via the first floor go figure a long corridor a flight of steps and numerous fire doors like being in a submarine , Nice room and very comfortable bed 
149956,Park Grand London Kensington, We were upgraded to a bigger room but below ground when I had specifically requested an upper floor room via booking com that had asked for a preference when I booked The room did turn out to be good so we didn t change rooms the next day which is what the staff had arranged , Helpful and polite staff new and clean bathroom good breakfast buffet 
149957,Park Grand London Kensington, Our room was a little tight on space but apparently other rooms were larger Since there are also rooms in the basement ask for those above ground level , Location very near Earl s Court Station for Tube and rail Variety of food services nearby Newly updated high tech room with large bathroom No hesitation in rating hotel as excellent

149961,Park Grand London Kensington, Breackfasts were disastrous On Saturday morning we had to wait over 30 minutes to get to breakfast room and still we couldn t get one table for me and my daughters All the food that was meant to be warm was already cold and there was hardly anything left Getting coffee and tea took ages and whole hall was pretty messy And we weren t there even late about 9am next day we went earlier because of our flight but when we came back out there were a lot more people waiting to get in to breakfast, The location of the hotel was perfect Just by the underground and some really good restaurants 
149962,Park Grand London Kensington, they upgraded me to a club room however the bathroom was with a disabled access which is very inconvenient tiny sink just next to the toilet which had no cover The bed was too soft and had a bump in the middle small corridors old fashioned the window was difficult to close had to call them 2x to assist me, location was great wifi didn t require login convenient
149963,Park Grand London Kensington, I was asked for photo identity at check in Nothing in the booking details suggested this was needed When I said I had none I was told that it was the law but it would be okay this time I pointed out that this is nonsense and eventually the receptionist said it was just the hotels policy This is not acceptable and a poor start to the stay To be fair everything was fine after that , Greg room recently refurbished 
149964,Park Grand London Kensington, breakfast was a joke not enough tables for number of guests had to stand outside to wait for a table as even reception was full of guests waiting upto that point our experience was excellent need to get sorted, beautifull room very boutique also very close to the underground station

149966,Park Grand London Kensington, The hotel is like a maze The rooms are pathetically small and the staff at front desk were not very helpful Can see they are understaffed , The location to the tube station is convenient 
149967,Park Grand London Kensington, The staff at reception appear to have to address complaints and other issues whilst checking guests in and out This meant on two occasions over hearing and being kept waiting by tricky situations that would have been better dealt with away from reception The room was clean though smelt a bit of cooked food which was possibly through a previous guest s use of the microwave , We usually stay at the Nadler round the corner but on this occasion the Park Grand offered a far more competitive rate 
149968,Park Grand London Kensington, The cleaning was not very good The room was tiny and there was too much noise from the street, the location was very good Very close to a metro station and close to many restaurants

149973,Park Grand London Kensington, Very overpriced Absolutely not worth the Can t understand how it received award in 2014 Small outdated rooms Front desk tried to put us in a basement room far from the front door , Only the location 
149974,Park Grand London Kensington, Beware of their special prices It s true they are low for a 4 star hotel But you get a room on ground floor or even in the basement can t open the window at all and thus stuffy air everybody passing on the street can look inside your room etc ,No Positive
