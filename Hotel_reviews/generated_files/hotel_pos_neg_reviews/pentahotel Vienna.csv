376787,pentahotel Vienna, Slightly high prices at the bar and odd smell initially in room and slight amount of mold in the bath also we couldn t find the movies on the tv, The staff and room were fantastic The hotel is right around the corner from the public transport trendy bars Nacshmarkt and only a half hour walk to the city centre 
376788,pentahotel Vienna, The light in the hallway was a bit too dim and the room perfume in the public place elevator was very strong almost gave me a headache, Nice functional room with air conditioning and good toiletries
376789,pentahotel Vienna, The reception was at the bar I was constantly confused about where I need to ask for a drink snack or room facilities One of the staff preauthorized our card without any prior notice this was very rude and unprofessional , The lobby is excellent and includes all sorts of activities i e pool table ps4 reading chess etc Very modern very cozy very young 
376790,pentahotel Vienna, Porn TV only My Television was stuck on pornographic channels Wifi is terrible Decoration is kitch and breakfast is too expensive Location is not the best either ,No Positive
376791,pentahotel Vienna,No Negative, Location was accessible by public transportation Even though the hotel advertises free WiFi it is too slow to be of any use If you want working internet you have to pay for it 
376792,pentahotel Vienna, They didn t have any parking spaces available when I arrived there and it s not possible to reserve one in advance Extremely annoying given that one of the main reasons I chose this hotel was the possibility of parking , Very friendly staff great location 
376793,pentahotel Vienna, WiFi was bad the free option is almost unusable paid for the premium and it wasnt always available no kettle fridge in the room, bar lobby area was nice
376794,pentahotel Vienna, Room was a bit small I booked king bed but was initially checked in for a twin bed room After my compliant it s immediately resolved The dirty towels even the ones I left on the floor were not replaced after the 1st day This should never happen in a 4 star hotel The wifi was a disaster for me it worked only in the first couple of hours later I had to call their wifi provider to fix the technical issue Then the last day it failed again that time not even the service provider could fix it I just simply couldn t access internet with iPhone , The staff were really friendly the bed was comfortable really liked the shower It was only 5 mins walk to subway so quite convenient
376795,pentahotel Vienna, No kettle and no mini bar fridge thus was not able to make a hot drink , Location was good with friendly staff Cosy stay and food was pretty good too 
376796,pentahotel Vienna, Location could be better But overall again no downfalls all was good , The hotel at start when I booked thought was like a mini party hotel but after arriving to the hotel that fought was totally changed as I was very impressed with the set up of the hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful I was even given a welcome drink on the house after I checked my group in Value for money was also good 
376797,pentahotel Vienna, None, The staff were very friendly and helpful The lobby area was unique and beautiful It certainly stood out from the typical Marriott Hilton hotels I stay at for business travel The food and drinks at the bar were great as well 
376798,pentahotel Vienna, Few shortcomings First parking Probably hotel has little own parking which is not enough for all guests so receptionist offered to use public parking about 5 10 min By foot from hotel with nearly the same price 20 EUR day and hotel parking price 19 EUR day This is uncomfortable but understandable in this location The worst thing is that in front of the hotel there no space even for short parking to unload baggage so you have the choice either to block for some time traffic or park somewhere further and then carry luggage to hotel what is very uncomfortable Furthermore that information about parking location you get only in reception and if you are not local and don t know neither Vienna nor parking rules in Vienna by sure you get some stressful moments Second shortcoming WiFi receptionist told that recently they changed the system and problems appeared In order to access WiFi each time you want to use it it s necessary to login to hotel internet page enter your name and room number It s irritating but working with laptop but if you want to access WiFi from telephone or pad practically impossible beside login it s necessary to clean beforehand telephone cache memory and change some other configurations I tried it once and it was enough Next already mentioned lack of refrigerator mini bar safe and cupboard in the room Small thing but anyway opaque window between bathroom and the room Another shortcoming sounds like a joke At the entrance to hotel there are 2 doors first is opening automatically and attention second not Beside the fact that while entering hotel with luggage it s very uncomfortable this is very unsafe expecting that second doors will open automatically as well you can easily appassionato kiss them if not more , While entering hotel you have a feeling that it s a club and instinctively rush for other hotel door But you are in place instead of reception bar and full in confusion you are not sure if its a barman or receptionist is in front of you It turned out that it s 2 in 1 they serve and as receptionist and as a barman and always very friendly Interior nice modern design but definitely not hotel style Hotel feeling starts when leaving elevator but again into long dark corridor decorated with mirrors and small silver lizards like in Alice Wonderland Room spacey modern design nice with a huge bed and tv on the wall What I missed in the room refrigerator safe and cupboard only open shelves instead Bathroom nice clean and comfortable Designer made opaque window between room and bathroom looks modern and nice but If partner is using wc at night light from it shines directly to the bed Well despite it s shortcomings freakish style and design which sometimes miss functionality it s a nice worth trying hotel 
376799,pentahotel Vienna, After booking i have contacted reception if i could reserve a parking place in the hotel I got an answer that this is not possible Although during check in the receptionist told me that you can make a reservation The external parking is 10min walk from the hotel ,No Positive
376800,pentahotel Vienna, They blocked additional money on my card for three weeks during check in Three weeks I was not able to use my money Also they wrote on this site and made pictures that their hotel has incredible city view It s lie You will see nothing except other buildings in 20 meters Cotton case to cover a blanket full of holes There is a mold on the rubber seal in the bathroom Upholstery of chair has spots ,No Positive
376801,pentahotel Vienna, Expencive brakfast you need to log in into wifi every couple hours using login site also slow wifi , Good located modern designed and new hotel good young stuff good sauna and gym very cozy and very clean rooms It was pleasure to stay here 
376802,pentahotel Vienna, Wifi is poor almost all the staff seem always upset Our queen bed was made with 2 different mattresses not so comfy And the toilette necessaire is always refilled at minimum Overall overpriced , The hotel is very groovy and stylish We appreciated the lounge area with the bar and restaurant and also the fitness area with sauna even if is quite small it is cosy 
376803,pentahotel Vienna, The workers talked about how Americans are stupid to another customer while my husband and I was sitting right there I guess he should have realized I understand what he was saying , The room
376804,pentahotel Vienna, No kettle in the room Standard room what the heck there was a kettle in a standard room in a hotel in Paris Too little food choice there should be all day breakfast on the menu for those who are not morning persons like me And food should be standardised i had two totally different style of Shrimp Mac Cheese lol one is obviously full of cheddar cheese and is very flavoured the other two times were the same probably from the same chef its more like mac Cheesse but just being picky here why would you use penne and say its shrimp mac cheese Just wondering Finally I love the sauna honestly but where are all the towels for a cold shower For those who are not as thoughtful as me wouldnt have thought of it and might end up getting sick all in all other things are well thought about I m happy to stay here , Everything Haha Everyone is very helpful I prolonged my stay through booking com because of some relationship issues they didn t need me to change rooms Housekeepers are very efficient I was having lunch down there at the lobby when i finished the room is cleaned completely Thumbs up for that Whats more the decor is all perfect very cyber at the same time elegant which I like about The gym room is very good too for those who likes privacy like me i hide there and work out every time and so far no one jumped in and looked at me in a weird way Love the sauna too Overall the 4 stars are well deserved 
376805,pentahotel Vienna, Reception is at the bar there is no information were to check in and the waiting time to check in and check out are incredibly long, Rooms were clean and quite The hotel design is something else but in a really good way Breakfast was amazing A lot of young guests
376806,pentahotel Vienna,No Negative, Receptionists were extremely friendly and professional The best coffee I had in whole Austria ever as bartender asked what kind I like and made it exactly like this Nice location close to everything Pleasant to walk to from metro even in night hours comfortable king sized beds 
376807,pentahotel Vienna, The staff some of the waiters and receptionist were not too professional we had to wait more than an hour for our dinner although we were the only guests then we had to remind them more times to bring our drinks or whatever we ordered they just kept forgetting everything , The best thing about this hotel was the breakfast huge variety very fresh and good quality Dinner was delicious as well Location is not direct central but still not too far from the highlights of the city Rooms are spacious and clean Cosmetic products of the hotel are very unique and fine Sundays is a late check out possible we could stay even until 17 o clock without an additional fee 
376808,pentahotel Vienna, Considering the price the room lacked some basic extras Tea Coffee making facilities would be good and also a fridge minibar Also if not included in the room the price of breakfast is just ridiculous , The bed was very comfortable the downstairs area bar restaurant pool table is very convenient The staff were all very helpful and pleasant Close to the underground station so very easy to get around 
376809,pentahotel Vienna, No tea or coffee facilities in the room Only one bottle of water supplied the entire time we stayed there , Trendy hotel nicely furnished cool bar area dominos and chess by the bar was a nice touch Breakfast selection was amazing

376814,pentahotel Vienna, There are some minor things but everything all together is really good May be it makes sense to change the number of hotel s start from 4 to 3 because service is just normal but everything they have is nice Especially staff never saw so friendly and open people , Location staff design room size price breakfast free adult channels 
376815,pentahotel Vienna, the room was noisy we have chosen the hotel because that the room should be sound proof but noise come by the doors and we were beside the lift and there was a lot of noise , Location was good

376828,pentahotel Vienna, This hotel has some issues with the personnell It is obvious that some of them hate their job and possibly the guests This is the worst pentaHotel I have ever been to Two of the new girls in the reception was the only light in this otherwise dark experience of rude personnell , Humorous signs on the toilets
