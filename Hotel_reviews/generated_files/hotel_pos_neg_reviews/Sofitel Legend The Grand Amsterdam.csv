393615,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Too expensive for what the hotel has to offer poor quality service and facilities that were disappointing The plugs in my room didn t work for example and the water does not get very hot only mild staff was not very effective at solving these problems Location is also bad because it is only truly close to the red light district everything else worth seeing is at least 15 mins walk away and the public transfer trams don t go that close to the hotel,No Positive
393616,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The hot food service at breakfast was a bit slow , The hotel was beautiful the outdoor courtyard was lovely to spend some time in the bathrooms were amazing and the showers had lots of hot water and plenty of pressure Luca the host at breakfast was a delight and the concierge was of great assistance on a couple of occasions The location is just perfect for the older and more central part of Amsterdam and the hotel was a comforting oasis to come back and rest 
393617,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, N A, The historic hotel but most of all the staff vibrant smiling and very helpful The Bridges Restaurant was the highlight for us with the effervescent Simone standing out She made it all look easy with her quick and tasteful humour and attention to detail Our stay was made perfect by her vitality Kudos and more kudos to her 
393618,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, A little b mol service at breakfast a little bit disorganized and slow , Very friendly and highly professional staff Super Accomodation We had e free upgrade to a Junior Suite Fantastic room Overall a great experience for two wonderful days in Amsterdam 
393619,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Everything was wonderful , Best location by far Staff was was amazing There were little treats left in your room like macaroons under a bell jar adorned with a peacock feather I would return just to stay at the hotel even if it were not in the center of all of the attractions We were greeted each morning by Hester at breakfast with a cheerful hello We slept in and missed breakfast one morning She said no worries and magically brought us bowls of fruit yogurt and had the chef whip up our favorites She seemed to anticipate what you like before you even know what you want Amazing service 
393620,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The breakfast wasn t anything special There was lots of choice but I wanted a full English breakfast which wasn t on the menu Other than that the food for breakfast was very nice , The hotel was clean staff very friendly and polite The bed was sooooooo comfy and rain shower was very relaxing The hotel is in a very central location meaning we didn t have to walk very far to be in all the main parts of Amsterdam 
393621,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, My only criticism is the pull out bed as it was not very comfortable This was due to x3 people sharing a room The actual bed was heavenly and felt I missed out on a good nights sleep , I was truly impressed with the hotel and it is pure luxury If I was go to go back to Amsterdam would rebook with no hesitation I loved as soon as you walked in the free treats and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful They went above and beyond as Saturday evening wanted to hire a bike for 2 hours and did not charge us The room was fabulous and LOVED the shower 
393622,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Room s Housekeeping Rooms not cleaned very well , Excellent and professional Customer service All staff are friendly and easy to communicate with

393624,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, N A, I liked it all everyone was friendly and helpful I was really amazed when upon determining my passion for Lego building that the bakery was asked to make some special Lego brick looking candies and delivered to the room gratis Now that is a special touch

393627,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The gym is tiny with very few alternatives for strength training few weights an a broken machine Our room on the first floor got a lot of noise from the street even when people were not very loud bad nonexistent soundproofing If you are not interested in the gym and get a room higher up you will have a fabulous stay , Overall a fantastic hotel The breakfast is very expensive but absolutely fantastic

393635,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The size of room for the price was a little small compared to other city breaks we have been on We found that the coffee tea facilities in the room were not always fully restocked and the few pods of milk never seemed enough we had to call down for extras , The hotel is in a great location if you want your base to be in the centre of the old town ideal if you plan to explore by foot Rooms were clean and in a good state of repair To say you are in the centre of town a stones throw from the red light district it was also fairly quiet for sleeping It was my wife s birthday the day we arrived and a cake was brought to the room which was a nice touch It was good to have use of the pool spa

393641,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, I hate the fabric on the chairs in the dining room while this is a plush fabric whoever chose this didn t think that people would need to sit on it and move around in a suit or jacket you can not move or slide into your seat ridiculous also the lighting in the bedroom and bathroom was inadequate ,No Positive

393649,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff in Bridges restaurant were so attentative and welcoming it was a pleasure to go down for breakfast The food was delicious and they accommodated fantastically for our baby 
393650,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The Service was just OK but in a superficial manner I had to go twice down to the reception after check in after a long trip as the wrong keys were given The concerned receptionist offered a complimentary drink wine which never came through ,No Positive
393651,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Spa is small and no heated Jacuzzi Hotel rooms and corridors are little old and not as luxurious as you would expect from the Grand Hence it s overpriced , Location is great The hotel park is nice Friendly staff

393656,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The Seafood restaurant Bridges for dinner is Okay but very pricey , The Sofitel is both luxurious and conveniently located in the Old Town area The breakfast staff Dorothy Simone Nanette Brianca and the rest of the staff were exceptional especially with our two kids Superb staff always smiling and helpful Even they got gifts to our little kids Breakfast is great and has a lot to choose from The butler service is amazing especially Mauricio and Domingo They arranged for our personalized tours and they are very helpful whenever we need them The hotel staff is wonderful especially Michel the evening Manager The housekeeping did a great job without noticing them 
393657,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, We loved everything about the Hotel and it s staff , The food and drink were excellent the bed was so comfortable that we are buying the same system at home The staff all went the extra mile and gave useful advice to save our money and enhance the enjoyment of our stay

393660,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The very worst bit Tiny room cramped and stuffy matched only by an even tinier bathroom No room for a bath just room for a very small shower The toiletries appeared to be rationed And this was a Superior room It was a special week end to treat my partner on his birthday I was disappointed No one there to greet us and I had to drag my own suitcase up the steps The courtyard was a building site We looked out onto it from the room and also at breakfast A bit rich to charge us full price It ought to have been a fabulous week end in a wonderful building It missed genuine luxury on so many levels , The food in The Bridges The general atmosphere design The location And the kind touch a birthday cake that greeted us in our room Although it came with a message wishing ME a Happy Birthday when I had emailed in advance to let them know it was HIS 
393661,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The only thing I didn t like was that we were put in a room on the first floor which is right on street level and late at night when people walk past shouting I found it a bit unsettling , The hotel staff were very helpful and the breakfast was very nice in the bridges resturant
393662,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The hotel bar facility was very small and narrow and not particularly cosy , We were upgraded from our junior suite to a fantastic suite Also the location was very central and just perfect 
393663,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The suite we had although very clean could have been more contemporary looking , The staff were attentive and very helpful Breakfast was amazing the choice one had was countless

393668,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Doorman was a bit grumpy if I was forced to criticise , Beautiful hotel and great location Very nice staff could not fault Our butler Domingo deserves a mention along with Fabion and Dennis made great martinis 
393669,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, We were living in room 335 and we had a leaking shower so bath floor was wet After our 1st night we were woked up by some kind of loud noises sounds like constraction works or something Issue was solved after our call to reception , Bed linen was just from my dreams It was so hard to leave it every morning Excellent and very helpful stuff 
393670,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Nothing worth mentioning, A very comfortable hotel Not cheap but the staff were top class and friendly the food very good and the overall effect was that I really enjoyed my short stay

393676,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, No dressing table , Great reception staff Lovely room apart from the fact that if one needs a dressing table to do makeup or dry ones hair there isn t one 
393677,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Both early mornings we were rudely woken up by very heavy hammering which sounded like builders knocking out bathroom floor tiles in the room above us which really disturbed our rest but the biggest disappointment was that the hotel staff denied that any building work was ongoing in the hotel whilst outside a builder and plumber van were parked We paid 600 for each night for a suite overlooking the canal the heavy noise spoilt our stay, Great location
393678,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The manager promised to change the room for us after the room was flooded and soaking wet with rainstorm They offered us a bottle of coke and beer with some bowls of nuts instead I had to stay in that room for 3 nights and the worse thing appeared on the third night The air conditioning broke down The housekeeping came up to my room and promise to fix it but unsucessfully At 11pm we had to call the hotel security to check and fix it We didn t want to make our stay turning ugly so we simply let it be Anyway that was the last night of our stay at this hotel and probably we will never return , The hotel was kind enough to offer us an early check in The location is fab 
393679,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Unfortunately the main entrance was closed having repairs done and there was a crane removing an airconditioning unit when we arrived so our driver could not get near the entrance we had to lug our suitcases across the canal The restaurant was closed and service in the outdoor restaurant was very slow So all in all not the best experience of the hotel , Good location Rooms well appointed but rather small 
393680,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, The only slight negative was waiting on a line to check in and check out , I traveled with my 18 year old daughter We absolutely loved this hotel I will definitely be back and stay in this hotel with my husband The location was superb the staff was exceptional and the breakfast was amazing 
393681,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, Front office personnel not friendly and did not give us a proper welcome when they found out that we did our booking through booking com and they were not cooperative,No Positive
393682,Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam, I rated the facilities lower because the spa etc was under renovation That was disappointing because the availability of those facilities was one of our reasons for choosing the hotel , Everything is good about the hotel but particularly the staff from front desk to the lovely ladies cleaning the bedrooms stood out All of them could not have been more friendly or helpful The staff make the extra difference to this hotel
