292972,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The hotel wasn t close to the metro so we had to walk really far to get to it On the way back we ended up taking a taxi instead , Great price for what I got Rooms were extremely clean 
292973,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Far from the city , Restaurant was cozy Staffs were very friendly and helpful Very close to the airport Has airport shuttle Not far from Metro station Bus stop is just next to it Perfect for those who are using the airport and staying for a short period

292976,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, It was definitely design by a man Lightning was poor especially for women who want to apply makeup even just a little eyebrows pencil , It had free airport shuttle 
292977,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I didn t like the fact that when I jumped in the shower there was no body gel shampoo As I emailed and called that I was doing an early checked in I had to call reception twice for it to arrive The window was shut but I killed 3 mosquitoes during my stay , I really really liked the bathroom the design was marbellous The bed was quiet comfortable I found a walking distance market where to eat good and relatively cheap 
292978,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Breakfast did not have enough hot food Location appears to be industrial area , Nice Property in close proximity to the Airport The Hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to and from the Airport which is a great convenience for travelllers on short stay business travel Staff was helpful Rooms were spacious and well equipped On site Parking was great too 
292979,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The room was next to a main road the traffic noise was ridiculous trying to sleep No instructions on how to use air con To use the safe you had to get a key at reception that should of been given as an option checking in not just a note on the safe itself, Layout of the room Beds very comfy
292980,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No atmosphere we were bored Needed to give two year old dinner at 6pm was told couldnt get anything hot until 8pm Which resulted in us walking around looking somewhere for him to get suitable meal in an industrial area with very few facilities , The rooms were excellent Staff very helpful and friendly Easy transfer to airport 
292981,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, Enjoyed my stay here I typically stay here when I arrive in Barcelona before driving off for Andorra Close to airport and easy access to highway without dealing with traffic headaches Staff speak english and parking is super easy not a small underground garage 
292982,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Locario Ia really bad 11km to airport area is terrible full of trucks they charged for the parking ans didnt advert me that I had to pay, Staff is really nice
292983,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There was a flashing light in the bathroom that would not turned off The light went through the glass door of batgroom and was reflected on a large mirror As a result I did not sleep til morning,No Positive
292984,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The shower was broken No cold water only mild or hot Had no time to ask for fixing or change a room as we were very tired The hotel is 20 min at night 30 min at day by bus from city center Av Para lel up to 45 min if traffic jams are on the main road to Barcelona The area is industrial so nowhere to go It is only suitable if you need a short stay near Barcelona airport or port It is a business purposed I do not suggest it for leisure stay Taxi price still high because minimum charge to airport still 20 EUR , We needed a hotel nearby airport for only 2 days The hotel is old but somehow refurbished The price suited us but it was lower comparing to others only because this hotel is far away from city Prices in restaurant were high enough but breakfast selection was very good Staff is friendly Everything was clean 
292985,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Food options were limited for snacks as well dinner Not a lot of other option close by , Location for my purposes was good close to the airport with free shuttle service Also close to a a metro station to go into the city 
292986,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The staff in the restaurant were very inattentive At breakfast every table was dirty and no staff in sight Had to sit at a dirty table with one unused place setting and they still had the gall to charge me for breakfast , The room was clean and comfortable 
292987,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Approaching the hotel from south of Barcelona we found it exceeding difficult to find The address was not very helpful to someone who doesn t know the area What exactly is Mercabarna A street an area an establishment we had no on line access since we were traveling with American cell phones so no way to search ,No Positive
292988,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No one told me at reception that I needed to plug in my room key to activate the electricity and A C in the room One of the male staffers had a bit of a negative attitude and made me nervous about my bags possibly being lost on my flight home Everything arrived home okay , After three weeks of travelling and staying in Air BnBs with friends and in budget hotels it was really nice to check in at this Best Western Europeans do hotels right This is not like a Best Western in the US and in a good way I rented a bike and rode around the nearby nature reserve There was also a great caffe bar near the river where I stopped and had an Aquarius and delicious torta tomato bread and articoke croquettas made with locally grown El Prat articokes After my bike ride I went for a swim in the saltwater pool Good day The free shuttle took me to the airport 
292989,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The location is very bad industrial area The rooms are small and do not look like what is advertised on the internet The beds were like hospital beds and although I sent my requirements to the hotel well in advance the room was not very nice and I had to request a change of room which could only be done the next day The only person that assisted was David at reception but certainly not a very nice hotel for the rates that they requested Towels had holes in it and were thread bare bathroom was not neat and clean advise all to avoid this hotel at all costs ,No Positive
292990,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, If this hotel wasn t where it was and have the weekend transportation issues as during the week it is hopping with huge trucks going about their business it would be an excellent hotel The hotel is in the industrial commons next to a frozen food packing company and some other factory packing plant businesses The surroundings were just very industrial not exactly picturesque There were nice mountain biking paths by the river if you had the gear for that sort of thing it may have been nice The area of the city is deserted on the weekend Going to the newly built metro and being the only person there was a little unsettling especially since the metro came less frequently to boot Then a regional train was needed to get into the city center It was 3 ticks on my multipass metro ticket each way and it was about an hour s journey I took the bus into the city the next day It only comes every half an hour on weekends so look up the time beforehand It takes only about a half an hour to get to the port then a 5 minute walk to the para lel metro stop Not bad but on the way back to the hotel the driver was giving another group of drivers who had just gotten off work a ride to their cars which I assume were parked at the end stop of the line The driver didn t stop at the stop for the hotel and drove over the river to the next stop I had to walk back over the river to th hotel navigating an industrial round about and figuring out which side of the bridge was open to pedestrian traffic Since there was no shade on the route I was a melting puddle of perspiration upon returning to the hotel If they warned about these transportation issues beforehand and maybe gave a business card to give to the bus driver for the return journey I think that I would not have been so peeved I told the lady at the counter what had happened and she said it had happened to her before too because the drivers get to talking and don t pay attention , The staff was great The hotel had great amenities like a market to buy snacks a bar with bar food and a proper restaurant There was also a pool and sauna but I didn t use those facilities Breakfast buffet was delicious Bus stop right outside hotel metro 10 minute walk There is a free shuttle to the airport and they let me keep my luggage there during the day of my checkout 
292991,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There are only warehouses around and nothing more but then it is an airport hotel and only expect guests in transit , Very warm and friendly staff Helpful and efficient Kudos to the young lady at the reception on the night of 13 14 06 2017 who single handedly managed to restore the power supply to no less than 15 rooms on the 3rd floor after a major fault in the hotel s electrical system and handled all the guests so pleasantly that none complained for nearly an hour that they had to go without light or air conditioning Their airport shuttle is punctual The bar and cafe remain open till 1 30 am to accommodate the last people in The bus stand is 2 minutes from the gate of the hotel and the metro about 10 minutes walk 
292992,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The location and staff were horrible The hotel was hard to find and in an industrial area no restaurants shops etc The staff basically the reservations person Esther was rude and downright insulting I ended up paying 264 for a 107 room because I made an error in my reservation which I attempted unsuccessfully to correct 30 minutes later Definitely not recommended , The location was somewhat close to the airport 
292993,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Can t think of anything that I didn t like, I was due to take a flight to Olbia from Nice and it was cancelled and I was re routed via Barcelona and needed a hotel close to the airport as the flight landed late and the following flight was early the next morning so just needed a bed This hotel fitted the bill perfectly free airport shuttle clean room comfy bed kettle in the room for that early cup of tea and good wifi 
292994,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The staff and service was horrible I arrived with a group of people There was no one at the front desk to check us into the hotel for 45 minutes By the time an employee arrived at the front desk the lobby was full of people waiting It was horrible ,No Positive

292997,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The hotel should give a location map for the place where the shuttle picks up Just mentioning Parking G does not help Most people are unaware of its exact location ,No Positive
292998,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, We stayed here due to it s location to the airport as we had an early flight to catch Everything was fine staff were very polite and helpful Rooms were great very clean with great facilities Would definitely recommend 
292999,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, It took 1 2h to find where the parking G where the shuttle was supposed to wait when I arrived at 1 am There is no signage at the airport to direct you to that parking lot Because no one answered my request on Booking com to give me more details then no one was there when we arrived and we had to wait another 15 min before the staff organised for a shuttle to pick us up This booking was,No Positive
293000,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The only issue that I might have is that the hotel is situated quite a distance away from the main city centre of Barcelona However the public transport to and from the hotel is easily accessible The bus stop is literally just 30 metres or so from the hotel and a short walk of about 650m takes you to the metro subway station which connects to the main subway network The hotel staff at the main desk are ever willing to assist guests should you have any questions on the timings of the buses , The staff are very helpful and courteous The airport shuttle bus was clean punctual and very convenient No need to fuss about taxis etc Wi fi was fast and reliable Food served at the hotel cafe on the ground floor was reasonably priced and tasty There is a small convenience store just behind the main counter which makes it convenient to get your basic necessities and bites Overall I would say that my stay at the hotel was very pleasant and fuss free 
293001,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No electricity in my room when check in Room too hot and AC was not working first then it worked but on request at the entrance desk no possibility to set it up from the room , Good location close to the airport

293003,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There was nothing to dislike on this , The staff were so helpful and friendly although it was not close to town there was bus and train options to get there which did not take long Be careful with your wallets on the train i was robbed while trying to manage our luggage 
293004,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, we didn t like the food very much but we are used to eating differently , the hotel was fine we were surprised by the location being so far from the city but there was bus service very close so we were able to go into the city

293008,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, It would of been nice to have more tv channels available in English And it would of been great if the shuttle could of picked us up at the cruise port , I liked that the front desk or concierge person spoke English He was very helpful I also appreciated the free shuttle to the airport
293009,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Probably a slightly bigger room , The staff accomodated our special requests very well On the day we booked out we left our lugguage there and upon return to the hotel after sight seeing the whole day allowed us to shower and change in a spare room in preparation of our flight back to our country We really appreciated this because our return flight had a connection which meant we spent 15 hours flying and would not have had a chance te refresh during the return flight 
293010,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The fact that Booking com s rate was 20 less on the day of arrival than what I had prepaid non refundable 2 weeks prior , Good quality airport hotel Great knowledgeable staff good breakfast fine casual dinner that we were able to get at American times before 8pm nice grounds Really appreciated the good quality of the linens and towel after 2 months of rental property linens 
293011,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Pool and sauna need updating , Nice clean hotel Fantastic staff very friendly and helpful Excellent food Added bonus of a FREE bus shuttle to and from the hotel Good location about 20 mins from city center but we didn t mind rambling the bus journey 
293012,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The location is a bit far away from the metro station you need to walk for 10 min They said they have shuttle in the airport to pickup us but we could not find the shuttle They said you should have called us from the airport but as you know not all phones work in Spain when you go there from another country , However they provided us the shuttle from hotel to airport The pool was very small but not a big deal The staffs were very polite and helpful 
293013,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, We arrived at 9 in the night and had to wait half an hour until our room was ready which then was stinking from cleaning stuff and not very clean , The shuttle worked smoothly 
293014,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, Although in the middle of an Industrial area it was the nearest to the airport and had its own shuttle bus With an early flight out it was better than fighting the traffic to get out of Barcelona
293015,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The shuttle to the Airport left us at arrivals because some passenger asked to and the driver never thought that the rest of the passengers needed to get off at departures Short story needed to walk like 2 kms to get to Departures , Everyone was very nice and friendly really liked the hotel Will surely be back 
293016,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Shuttle service was poor Shuttle didn t pick up on time There were almost 20 people and just came with 13 seats mini bus Security locker was small I couldn t store my MacB Air in the locker, Nice staff Breakfast simple but delicious Clean
293017,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, We just stayed for one night there is nothing to complaint or dislike If you need markets cafeterias or shops around is a problem , The staff were very nice the hotel in general is great and new There is a bus station right in front of the hotel and is very near to the airport Ideally you take this hotel if you need to be in the airport in early or fast They have a shuttle from and to the airport which is very good and helpful Usually taxi charge you 20 euros when you go to hotels that are nearby the ariport they say it is a fixed price They also have a depo to put your luggage in case you need to check out but want to spend some time out before going to the airport 
293018,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Lighting in bathroom was extremely poor There was a foam soap dispenser by the sink and in the shower but the bathroom had no shampoo conditioner or solid soap The room was very small but otherwise comfortable , The staff was very friendly and accommodating The first room I was in had no working air conditioning The staff said that the first two floors were still on heat only but they cheerfully moved me to a different room that had working AC 
293019,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I didn t enjoy my stay what so ever here We landed at the airport and they gave me a number to ring this number wasn t recognised We couldn t find a shuttle bus to the hotel no one knew which shuttle bus we needed to look out for and nothing was stated on the website Also this States it is a hotel airport when clearly it isn t as its 15 20 mins away we had breakfast included which didn t state Continental breakfast the breakfast was awful and cold and the waitress wasn t very happy we ordered the shuttle bus and it only goes every 45 minutes we was the only ones on the shuttle bus who wanted the shuttle bus service The driver wouldnt leave till the actual time of departure baring in mind that our flight was in 2 hours so left us sitting around and he didn t even greet us Check out was very slow and and the driver took us to T1 before T2 which is where we needed to get our flight The swimming pool was freezing and very small It doesn t state the size of the pool on the hotel description ,No Positive
293020,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, Very comfortable bed nice room temperature Dinner available until 11pm very good for us arrived at 10pm Very nice breakfast with lots of variety Shuttle convenient back to airport next morning 
293021,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, The staff could not have been more helpful excellent service all around Only slight moan is the amount of time we had to wait for the shuttle bus 45 min and 3 separate taxis refuse to take us as they clearly wanted a longer trip 
293022,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Restaurant and buffet were not the best to put it nicely Definitely eat the food at the bar We chose this hotel because of it s NON SMOKING rooms When I booked I even added a special note making sure these were NON SMOKING rooms We booked 4 rooms with this special request When we got there 3 of our rooms were great and 1 smelt horribly of smoke We addressed this with the front desk They sent someone up to smell and she told us it did not smell of smoke and it was a matter of opinion We asked several times to switch rooms or for a discounted rate as we would not be using the room and instead sleeping on the floor of one of our other rooms we had booked but they were extremely rude and not accommodating at all She continued to say it s a matter of opinion In fact she mentioned SHE smokes and so she would know how it smells LOL what a joke After several workers came to smell and a pretty heated argument they FINALLY switched us to another room My question is why didn t they switch at the first complaint We are all still baffled at that The customer is always right but to them their opinion and sense of smell was greater than ours Night crew was very condescending and rude , Beds and room were very comfortable SOME of the staff was amazing the cute girl from Italy and some of the other daytime crew were fantastic and very accommodating When we dropped off our bags early they were very thorough in checking our tickets to even grab a sweater out of the bag they watched me put in the room So your luggage is definitely safe in there The food at the bar was delicious 
293023,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, At this price level the hotel is good and nothing to complain about, Great staff attentive and welcoming Hotel is close enough to the airport but the free shuttle does take around half an hour so allow transfer time 
293024,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Far away from city bus stop is 10 meters from hotel but frequency is very less suggest you to walk 500 meters to reach marcabarna metro stop , Very near to airport airport shuttle available from morning 5 to night 12
293025,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I chose this hotel for their pool and sauna These were not in good shape so I didn t use them after all It was a little disappointing, I didn t speak any Spanish or Catalan and they did their best to help me find transportation to a small town 2 hours away which consisted of a taxi and two buses It was my first time traveling outside of the USA so I wouldn t have been able to get to my destination the next day without their help 
293026,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The flooring of the room we stayed in seriously needs replacement There were some parts that are torn and gave a rather unsightly appearance The safe box can also use an update to allow the guest to set his her own code I had to get a key from the reception desk One of the two cups provided had a very noticeable hairline crack I took it down to the front desk and exchanged for another one , The staff was very helpful from the front desk to the restaurant to the shuttle bus driver 
293027,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I thought that the menu should be changed up a little however I know that can be quite hard Other than that everything was great , Everything I was provided with was excellent 
293028,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the shower the shower cabin is broken the water goes all over the floor in the bathroom even causing floor damage in the parket right out the bathroom door , Staff was extremely helpful the breakfast was excellent 
293029,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The buffet breakfast was limited in their offering I d like to see more variety of pastries and juices , Complimentary shuttle pick up and drop off was very good and always on schedule The front desk staff are friendly and really helpful and the room was clean and comfortable 
293030,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There isn t much not to like This time we tried out the new suites Large room very modern Very comfortable bed but as the rooms are new there were a few things we didn t like The open plan toilet was one of them and the lack of a blind at the window above the bath another Steet lighting makes the room too light at night Apart from that the room was very good , Bar snacks and wine on arrival bar is cosy Staff are very friendly and helpful Good shuttle to and from airport Good breakfast with plenty of choice 
293031,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There s renovation work going on electric wires exposed unfinnished paint on walls holes and hosts are still given rooms on those floors Which is just scandalous and not at all worthy of a 4 star hotel If the establishement wants to renovate a floor it needs to be closed to public Absolutly unacceptable There s also MOLD on the wall Again scandalous Windows are really tatty and squeak The quality and quantity of towels in the bathroom are unsatisfying I think face towels and feet towels should at least be separated The general style and d co of the rooms is frankly worthy of a 3 stars hotel at most the d cor needs to be updated The floor is irregular and has places where there s sunken parts and irregular parquet The covers on the bed were good but the covers in the cupboard I was just shocked when i saw that Very old an very ugly I understand there could budget problems but I would have prefered not having covers at all that having to see that , The bathrooms are impeccable immaculately clean and great sober style The staff is really agreeable and courteous And the free airoport shuttle is very practical for travelers who come by plane thumbs up for that impeccable service Also nice lobby although a bit small decorated with good taste I wish the rooms were that well decorated also 
293032,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, There are few options to get back from the city centre in an efficient way , The room is very clean and spacious There was a good connection to the city center by bus Airport shuttle was also very good 
293033,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Soundproofing of the room is terrible We hear people speaking walking and snoring like they were inside your room Then it s difficult to take a rest here , People working in this hotel are very great The location is perfect close to the airport and easy to travel between city center and hotel 30 minutes to the center Free shuttle for the airport 
293034,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, A bit of time to get there if needing to use public transport from barcelona Little market in hotel is quite expensive nothing is priced , Comfy bed Good staff prompt free transport to airport 
293035,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Need instructions on how to make shower work , Bed very comfortable but I couldn t figure out how to do the shower Next time I would pay a bit more and have breakfast 
293036,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, very nice and helpful reception the room is nice and clean the shuttle bus to the airport is great the location is a little bit far away from the city center but there is bus station for Bus 21 right in front of the door so it is fine 
293037,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, very nice and helpful reception the room is nice and clean the shuttle bus to the airport is great the location is a little bit far away from the city center but there is bus station for Bus 21 right in front of the door so it is fine 
293038,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Charged 44euros for 2 dogs to share our room Could have booked them their own for that , Staff were very friendly and helpful Lovely bar and restaurant 
293039,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, But a bit out of the way to the central part of Barcelona an hour by metro to The Gothic Quarter There were very loud people next to us that came back in the middle of the night The walls are very thin , Comfortable and clean Close to the airport Very nice staff Always had water and apples for us at reception 
293040,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the spa area is not very nice it could use some decoration and the water was not too clean or rather had a lot of bleach which made it unattractive for me to have a swim the sauna is extremely tiny the breakfast bufe is not bad but the croissants were not really nice could be fresh and crunchy , the stuff was really nice and helpful the airport shuttle worked well and was on time the room was clean and spacious the food in the cafe was quite OK 
293041,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The pool was an absolute deception It looks nothing like the pictures and even more so like a pool that you ll find in your local leisure centre but smaller We didn t end up using it despite bringing along our bikinis and planning to do so This wasn t a massive dissapointment though , Room was clean and very modern as was the hotel in general Staff were nice except one lady though I ve spoken to the manager about her already The location is a little far out however there is a bus stop literally 15 seconds outside of the hotel which takes you right to the city centre in less than 20 minutes There is also a metro station only 5 minutes walk from the hotel too For this reason I think the location balances up seeing as the hotel price is very decent Hotel staff helped print out my boarding pass and have a shuttle bus which collects and drops you from to the airport Super bonus 
293042,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The water is not hot when taking a shower and we went to the counter twice to reply this problem The staff said because of the new year he could not fix the problem and all the rooms in hotel were full He couldn t change the room for us at the first time when we told him It s too cold to take a shower so the second time he gave us an empty room to take shower It s really awful that he lied that there was no solution at the beginning, Welcome drink the service of shuttle bus to the airport and the breakfast were nice
293043,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Still quite a way from airport 35 Euro to get to airport which was 1 2 price of a hotel room for night , Nice Hotel with shuttle but not before 5am so forget about making your 6am flights
293044,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The restaurant staff were not a happy bunch One young lady was smiling and very quick The others needed lessons in customer service a complete contrast to the reception staff Very disappointing as the meal was good but the attitude of the staff made you want to leave the restaurant , The reception staff were excellent and efficient and the room was clean and pleasant with a comfy bed which is a bonus Shuttle service went on time and that was a real plus for staying at this hotel The evening meal was good and hot 
293045,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Not accessible easily by metro Location on the website is misleading I made the mistake of thinking it was an easy stop to get off at the market since they mentioned it was next to the market The metro stops far away and its quick a walk to get out of the market Directions from downtown would be appreciated Metro Bus connection etc , The room and amenities were excellent The staff in the morning were excellent and very helpful 
293046,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The hotel is near the airport but in an industrial area Nothing of interest in the vicinity so one just goes there to sleep Breakfast buffet was pretty good but service terrible One lone staffer couldn t keep up with attending to the dining area although not that many of us there at that time He spent more time in the kitchen than in the dining room so maybe they were short staffed there also , All amenities needed by a traveler Staff generally very helpful I needed to go to the airport way earlier than their shuttle service operated but they happily organized a taxi for me and offered to make me a boxed breakfast to go There is a bus stop right outside the hotel making it very easy to get into the city and back 
293047,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The gym was out of order being repaired and the pool was much smaller than I expected it was also cold , The veal burger was delicious and well priced The staff were very friendly and helpful and the shower was amazing 
293048,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I actually consider it as a 3 star hotel I think they need to refurbish modernize a bit since it s 4 star , It s a 15 mins drive from the airport Free airport shuttle Late night snacks available at their mini shop in the lobby 
293049,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The breakfast buffet not kept hot enough But staff would cook fresh on request , Bus stop outside to get into Barcelona centre Comfortable bed Spotless Food good and reasonable Friendly and helpful staff Airport shuttle 
293050,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Communication of front desk person when we called regarding free shuttle pick up time , Room was nice and late snack at bar as well as breakfast were fine 
293051,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Charge for parking lot not expected , Convenient to airport Room safe for free use Good selection of food at breakfast and bar snacks too Staff very friendly 
293052,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Dinner at the restaurant started very late in the evening 2030 or so The area around the restaurant was industrial and didn t offer much for dining or food either something to consider if you are flying early in the morning and want a early dinner , The hotel has a airport shuttle that starts running at 5am which was great for us because we had a early flight The hotel is very close to the airport probably a 10 minute drive We walked about 1 5 kilometers to the nearest subway to go downtown to Barcelona i can t remember the name but it was a industrial area that use to be the Olympic village in 92 For food we ate the bar they had an excellent menu and much cheaper than the restaurant 
293053,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Indoor pool was tiny approx 3 x 5 meters We asked for extra sashes of coffee for the room which we got but we were told the room allocation is one per guest per day if we wanted more we would be charged for them So we got the coffee but didn t dare ask for the milk cream to go with it Tip bring your own , Staff at reception were very friendly and helpful Hotel and rooms were clean 10 15 mins away from the airport Airport shuttle available but wait for it near the bottom of the road C area 
293054,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The night staff that checked us in didn t make us feel welcome no welcome drink was offered to us on arrival We thought one of the staff members nose piercing was highly unprofessional I talked to the staff in Spanish and the would answer me in English , The beds are really comfortable it s a nice and easy going hotel We had a lovely Spanish gentlemen checking us out of the hotel in the morning very pleasant and polite The free shuttle bus was brilliant on time quick and comfortable 
293055,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Had some issues getting fresh milk Little shop was too expensive Rather than try to make every euro possible it would be great to see a service model meeting the needs of the client came first , Interesting location at a good price Once you got to know the subway it was great 
293056,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Awful location only option to get there and feel safe at night is by taxi Rooms are loud can hear all big industrial vehicles going past bed rolled around the room like a toy pram Not cheap , Nice varied facilities Unfortunately you have to pay for things like use of baggage scale Staff were great about leaving boxes in advance Free shuttle is primary reason for staying 
293057,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Where to start First room I was assigned had a horrid sewage smell that hit me as soon as I opened the door Changed rooms to one on the 4th floor advertised as having AC but apparently it is turned off starting November Even tho it is still hot outside Room was very warm so asked to move to lower hopefully cooler floor Got one on the 2nd floor which seemed great Until 6 am when the noxious smell of cigarette smoke started blowing into my room from who know s where This is supposed to be a 100 non smoking hotel but as seems to be typical in Europe that little detail seems to be willfully ignored It was awful Needless to say my one night there could have been better The front desk personnel were very helpful and accommodating and none of the issues were their fault , The bed was actually comfortable better than expected Breakfast was a good value for the money Close to the airport was the reason I selected this hotel 
293058,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No wash clothes in bathrooms are Americans the only ones who use them Facility is obviously old and being updated No grab bars in tub shower dangerous No tub gripper mat dangerous We d chosen it for its cruise passenger package which included a breakfast Never got breakfast because coffee wasn t available before 5 30 AM when we had to catch the shuttle to the airport No accommodation offered by staff to take away coffee and croissant No price break Temperature of room was 25 C when we arrived We asked for someone to come adjust it Took over 1 2 hour for someone to arrive No written instructions provided on site to guide guest in adjusting room temperature ,No Positive
293059,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Directions to the pick up stop for the shuttle need to be more detailed Breakfast not included and very expensive It was a longer ride to the hotel than I expected Door G pick up spot for shuttle not clearly marked If you are dropping off a car be sure to get very clear directions to the pick up spot Its not at the baggage claim area , clean Clear that you needed to book the reservation for the shuttle to the airport It only holds 13 people and can be very tight 
293060,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, What we did not like about our stay was the strobe like effect of a faulty light in the bathroom When we turned the light OFF it strobed every few seconds like a flashlight on automatic so we decided to sleep with the bathroom light ON instead not ideal because we like to sleep in the dark We told reception staff next morning to save future guests suffering the same problem The staff were unconcerned No apology no offer of part refund or anything They did not even ask WHICH of the four bathroom lights was the problem or ask for more details of its manifestation They just said they would report it to Maintenance ,No Positive
293061,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The bathroom is not user friendly It is very attractive to look at but the tub shower is difficult to use and actually dangerous All surfaces are hard There are no hand holds to help you get in or out of the tub One slip you have a potential serious injury I would not stay there again because of this , Shuttle service to from Airport Dining room cafeteria good Desk staff excellent
293062,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the breakfast is way overpriced for what is offered They are taking advantage that there are no close places to eat and many travelers do not have a car , front desk staff
293063,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Nothing to complain about we would have liked the restaurant to have opened before 8pm , Every member of staff were excellent friendly and helpful The hotel was perfect for a stop over for one night between airport and port prior to a cruise 
293064,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the location is impossible very unpleasant in a desolated industrial area and quite far Even taxi drivers using GPS had hard time finding how to get there It is certainly not 5 minuted from the airport and if you try to get there with your own car you may get lost the hotel shuttle went 15 minutes in a very complicated way The rooms were OK but nothing to write home about Very bad sound proof we practically heard what other people say in the next room and the corridor let alone people coughing or children s crying The light is unpleasant bathroom is somehow sophisticated but not so nicely maintained water came simultaneously from the rainfall and telephone taps Food is OK but breakfast area is small and in the morning a bit crowded so that if you are in a hurry to leave you can t wait for refills And so are the tiny two lifts that can carry very little luggage people at once so that you end up waiting long to get the lift In total is is not worthy the more than 150 E including breakfast per night , nothing in particular the staff were nice shuttle was OK 
293065,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, hotel is in the middle of an industrial park so you are stuck there for meals unless you go to barcelona staff is very slow often waited 10 mins to be acknowledged at the restaurant or cafeteria sign on AC tells you not to touch it ridiculous as room was consistently very warm and leaving windows open was way too noisy , see previous reviews this last one was written after third stay here during same trip good food staff accommodating allowing us to store bike boxes for free for two weeks easy access to barcelona by bus and could have used the metro instead if wanted to walk to the stop 20 mins away 
293066,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, hotel is in the middle of nowhere so if you don t want to eat there you have to have a car or go to barcelona understaffed or motivated staff took a long time to do anything , free shuttle to airport easy access to barcelona bus food available most of the day and night

293084,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Cant think of anything to improve this hotel maybe more English speaking tv stations, The room was large and comfortable the bathroom facilities were spot on we did not use the pool but it looked just right the restaurant was very good great breakfast
293085,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The area It was on an industrial site However ideally placed between the airport and the port for the cruises Was about 15 minutes in taxi from centre of Barcelona and night life , Clean and comfortable
293086,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Reception staff told us the pool was open til 11pm we came back especially but it was closed at 9pm wrong times for everything given consistently so not sure of the receptionists ability or knowledge We got a decent deal but the general price is way overpriced for what you receive , Close to airport good shuttle bus comfy bed nice shower

293091,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The pool could have been a bit bigger and its location a bit more convenient, Good location for proximity to airport Shuttle bus efficient and on time 
293092,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The food in the bar attached to the restaurant was terrible and not really representative of previous reviews The food was almost inedible we refused to pay it was that bad Also its further away from the airport than is indicated more like 20 25 minutes on the shuttle painful early in the morning , Clean quiet bedroom

293097,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, A bit disappointed that they had no facilities for children Something like a football table would have been great for kids Also the fact that there were no tea or coffee in the room If they don t have free coffee and tea in the rooms then I thought customers should have warm drinks on their first night and maybe last nights free Here we had no warm drinks free I had to pay for warm drinks the night we arrived Otherwise I think its a lovely hotel , Very clean At first I did not like it because i am used to seeing hotels with much wider reception However the staff are helpful and for me its the overall cleanliness of the hotel Very impressive My kids really liked the hotel 
293098,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, It s a good Hotel in my eyes for Business when you Need to be Close by For the rest there might better Options Everything is ok but just nothing Special 
293099,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The staff were so incredibly busy always Very helpful and nice but they would be handling 3 4 customers at the same time making it impossible for them to focus on one enquiry That was a pity as it meant in the end everyone had to wait , Very comfortable hotel for business traveling good breakfast great bed bathroom 
293100,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Taxi couldn t find it it s in the middle of an industrial area about a mile from any restaurant or shop The hotel restaurant was awful possibly the worst I ve been to in Spain The purpose of heating Creme Brulee is to caramelise the sugar not incinerate the entire dish Huge queues at reservation just chaotic , Wifi is good
293101,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Would have liked the restaurant to open a little earlier as we were tired from travelling and wanted to have something to eat before going to bed The children with us were falling asleep before they had some food , The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel was as it was described and we liked the airport shuttle

293104,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, That the restaurant didn t open for dinner until 830pm, bus stop right outside the hotel was very convenient and the staff was friendly and helpful I also loved breakfast buffet at 5am 
293105,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the pool was so small that we ended up not bothering to go at all , Loved the family ajoining rooms that we had modern decor comfy beds clean etc 
293106,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The third folding bed in the triple room was damaged and worn This bed received the full force of the air conditioning while the rest of the room remained warm The analog thermostat for the A C was difficult to control The breakfast coffee was weak and tasteless The bathroom sink was dirty mostly because of its fancy design , Complementary transport to and from airport including free taxi when the hotel bus was free There s a small shop in the lobby for basic necessities and souvenirs
293107,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Waited a long time to check in and also to check out Our room was not what the picture showed They did not wipe the desk down it was sticky , The dining room was nice 
293108,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Very difficult to find shuttle bus no signs at all no information available Staff not very interested or welcoming Food expensive only sandwiches available until 8 30pm I realise eating times are according to Spanish custom but this is an airport hotel for international travellers Overall I thought the hotel was far too expensive for what was on offer , Shuttle bus was useful once it could be found Room clean soundproof 
293109,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, One of the lifts wasn t working very well would have been good if there were tea coffee making facilities in the rooms , Helpful staff well organised 
293110,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, We walked to the Hotel and there were virtually no sign of the premises until we walked in the door Street signs would be a good idea When we were dropped at the airport we were actually asked to get out of the bus quite some distance from the entrance Quite confusing as all communication was in Spanish even though at least half the bus was filled with English speakers I also felt it was fairly expensive for what we got compared to all the other accommodation we had used in Spain , We booked this place to take advantage of the shuttle to the airport It was clean and comfortable for the very short time we spent there 
293111,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, We were going to have lunch there but no one as at the cafe counter The pool was bit cold The sauna didn t seem to work , The mini market where you could buy snacks was great They got us into a room early as we came from a cruise Front desk folks were fantastic There is a bus stop that takes you downtown across the street 
293112,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Restaurant food was fair Had difficulty getting transport from airport Waited over an hour finally took taxi 20 Hotel did reimburse us for the expense , Standard room close to airport free airport transport 
293113,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, We were particularly pleased with the dinner we enjoyed in the restaurant on site The staff were all friendly and helpful and the location allowed us to take the shuttle for our 10 10 a m flight

293117,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, This hotel is perfect for early morning flight but it is a bit in the middle of nowhere if you are looking to stay over for recreational reason the free shuttle bus will bring you at the airport in 15 20 minutes first bus is at 5am 30min frequency The restaurant is good and has fair prices 
293118,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, As mentioned in previous reviews there is nothing around the hotel except industrial trans shipment facilities Eat at the hotel or at the airport before you take the shuttle Do not attempt the metro it s expensive and drops you in the middle of no where It turns out it s probably only a 600 800m walk to the hotel if you know the way but two calls to the hotel didn t help us figure it out and we walked about twice that far over cobblestones pulling bags in sweltering heat , The convenience to the airport and the shuttle were the best features The room was good the staff quite responsive and their willingness to store luggage between stays extremely helpful 
293119,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Buffet Breakfast is optional surcharge weak wifi Problems with Lights Lights goes off mostly No international prepared foods from the restaurant , Buffet Breakfast are good balanced diets Though not included in the booking is an optional surcharge Staffs Rooms and Airport Shuttle services is free 
293120,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Instructions for airport pickup I had to call to find out I needed to walk to Parking G This should be in the instructions and also you could give arrival time Also while convenient to Metro you are located a ways from city center and you need to walk along an industrial area It is very well lit , Fantastic breakfast buffet Airport pickup convenient 7 minute walk to the metro Staff was very helpful with instructions and restaurant suggestions Ana made us a reservation the first night at a wonderful restaurant near Barcelonetta Peggy was very helpful with places to see Our room for 3 was very comfortable 
293121,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The location of the hotel within an industrial park limited options for dining and or any leisure activities , Location was convenient for easy access to airport so it worked well for our travel needs Staff was very friendly and helpful Arrangements for free shuttle to airport was provided with no issues Hotel restaurant was good 
293122,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, For going to the airport using your own car is problematic because of road restrains and poor traffic signs , One of the best restaurants in the airport hotel category near the airport Choice in the evening is good and the wine prices reasonable 
293123,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Location not great if you want the city centre it s not the most scenic part of town but is very convenient for the airport , Staff were excellent couldn t do enough to help us we booked in last minute after our flight home was cancelled and we needed an extra night s accommodation in Barcelona 
293124,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The bar bill and breakfast totted up to the same price as the room which made this an expensive choice We had 1 wine and 1 spirit , Good location for the airport with regular shuttles to and fro There is nothing to do around the hotel which is located in an industrial area but we did find a walk along the estuary eventually There is no residential area 
293125,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The buffet breakfast was awful There was a fly in the dessert tray The hotel is set in dismill surroundings Very generic room, The only positive is that is is close to airport and they provide free shuttle service to the airport
293126,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, restaurant is quite expensive, Close to Barcelona s airport close to bus and metro stration small market inside the hotel restaurant friendly staff awesome breakfast
293127,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I asked for a room away from the lift ie a quiet room but my room was over what I assume was the air con units so was noisey, The bed was very comfortable the shuttle bus was on time
293128,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Plunger to stop water running out of sink kaput Uncomfortable mattress on hubbies side Only stayed two nights wasnt worth hassle to move rooms , Good breakfast and snacks in the cafeteria 
293129,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The pool was disappointing being enclosed in a small dark room , I chose this hotel because of the free airport shuttle since we were coming in one day and leaving the next Not only did that work well but we learned we could take the public bus from in front of the hotel to very close to Las Ramblas so our few hours in Barcelona were not spent sitting around the hotel 
293130,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I called to the hotel as agreed when I landed at El Prat The time 23 32 I had to wait for the shuttle until 00 48 Room 410 The shower is awfull ,No Positive

293133,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Some misunderstanding about breakfast inclusion Ad should state continental breakfast rather than breakfast for clarity Americans are more used to full breakfasts if not otherwise described , Helpful staff Stayed for 2 nights following a cruise convenient to airport some distance from the city A compromise

293143,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The hotel is located in an industrial area so there s no place to walk However the restaurant cafe has good options and public transportation is convenient , The airport shuttle was really convenient Perfect place to stay the evening before our flight out Cheap options for beer and wine at the bar A cab ride from Playa Espania to the hotel was only 21E 
293144,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Over priced but I booked there because it was the only one I could find near airport that advertised a free shuttle It is in an industrial complex and so there were many businesssmen staying there and I felt like vulture meat , Loved the bed the room darkening curtains and the flatter pillows The staff were wonderful very well trained in customer service
293145,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and helpful Nothing was too much effort thank you Arrived late and one night only but would use again for late or early flights

293147,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The cot provided for our son was not a very comfortable bed , The staff were super helpful check in and check out were fast and easy and it was very clean

293151,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, My stay at this hotel was fine However I would have expected a more luxurious property for the amount of money I was charged I felt overcharged , I enjoyed the courtesy airport shuttle

293154,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The location of this hotel was an absolute nightmare First of all the room was incredibly hot with no ability to adjust the thermostat as it is set by the hotel staff We had to open all of the windows in order to be able to get any cool air into the room This hotel is set in an industrial area with nothing around but warehouses and our room faced the main road and intersection where trucks were stopping and going literally throughout the entire night One after another we would hear the loud noises of truck brakes squealing at a red light idling and then the rumbling of them starting up again when the light turned green We re all pretty heavy sleepers and can handle noise but this kept us up for hours until we all put headphones on to dull out the sounds , The shuttle and proximity to the airport was the main reason for our stay There is a free shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to terminals 1 and 2 
293155,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Lost in the middle of and industrial zone not a problem if you only need one airport night , Free shuttle bus to the airport Walking distance to L9 metro line less than 10mn
293156,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The rooms were like jail and the beds very uncomfortable Location is near a very busy highway therefore very noisy The hallways look as if they are under renovations and look very grimy , The hotel smells like an new born baby Very fresh and powdery Free airport shuttle is very convenient 
293157,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel Everything was great for me , Very nice rooms clean big bathroom Comfortable Bed Absolutely value for money Good shuttle service to the airport Very nice and professional Staff 
293158,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the airport shuttle times for my arrival were not convenient , The restaurant serves great food till late the rooms are stylish comfortable staff friendly helpful 
293159,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The included continental breakfast could have been better Juice coffee croissant was good but waiter watched that we did not take anything else and we could only have one not two as the croissants were small I did not know that we were only allowed 1 coffee and on one of the mornings when I went to get a second coffee was told by the waiter that I could not have a second coffee, That there was a bus outside the hotel to go to downtown Barcelona Liked the swimming pool Ate one of our dinners there It was very good but pricey Were some good and very reasonably priced restaurants just a short walk away 
293160,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, the location might be good for attending exhibition to Fira otherwise public transport connection is not enough there is one one bus and frequency is every 30 min and to the nearest Metro station takes about 7 10 minutes to walk Breakfast should have a bit different I stayed there for 7 nights and every morning had the same breakfast some dry salami look dry and pretty old, staff are very nice and helpful that make you feel comfortable and welcome airport pick up is the advantage and follow the G which is for hotel parking very easy to find
293161,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, A robe hook in the bathroom would be helpful , This is a very convenient place to stay near the airport in Barcelona with a free airport shuttle They also accept pets which is important for us travelling with our little dog The beds are comfortable the rooms are stylish 
293162,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Paying more for parking through the hotel than the ticket machine quotes It was a small sum but it is silly to charge more , The bathroom was fantastic and the bedroom very comfortable 
293163,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Room service food was horrible Zucchini soup was sour and chicken and potatoes was greasy cafe standard Couldn t open the windows in room 222 because of outside smell , Staff were lovely and helpful
293164,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Rooms cold beds uncomfortable Dining room menu very poor for an international hotel Very limited menu and only Spanish food available which tastes terrible and is over priced for the poor quantity Dangerous step from shower to bathroom floor in room and very poor badly worn towels Was quoted euro35 for a 5 minute journey back to airport Hotel has a courtesy bus which runs every 30 45 minutes We spent 45 minutes standing in the rain waiting for bus despite 4 phone calls to hotel This is a hotel to use ONLY if all others are full , The checkout procedure Staff were very keen to take money from you 
293165,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, As an asthmatic I found the smell of air freshener in the reception area overpowering So much so that I had to use my inhaler within a few minutes of entering the hotel , The staff were very helpful and accommodating especially in the restaurant 
293166,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Nothing, A perfect stop over we arrived the night before ready for a morning flight and it was ieal for this Had a very nice dinner which was reasonably priced The free shuttle service was a real bonus and was the main reason for staying but overall excellent value you for money and would highly recommend it
293167,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto,No Negative, All round excellent value Nice hotel Good bar and bar food Staff were brilliant all spoke good English Very good facilities available for the price paid Room nice clean and simple with a smart bathroom Highly recommend 
293168,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The price for breakfast or anything from the restaurant or convenience shop was extortionate I had a rate booked for me that was meant to include breakfast but it turns out that in the fine print it said the rate was only available for cruise ship passengers Apparently the hotel values cruise ship passengers more than airport passengers because they not only told me that I would have to pay for breakfast fair enough I guess they did so in a loud manner that made it appear to all the people around that I was purposefully trying to mooch free breakfast off them Finally although the hotel markets itself as being an airport hotel it was a 20 Euro taxi ride from the airport after waiting unsuccessfully for the hotel shuttle to pick us up for more than an hour , The hotel was modern and clean 
293169,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The place is in the middle of nowhere If you are hungry be ready to spend more than hotel price is I had very bad experience about it and it is the first time I am writing any survey Restaurant opens just at 8 30 pm I ve arrived at 2pm Till that time there is caffee where you can eat smth I have ordered pizza price 10 eur Pizza was very very very small and too over cooked So I didn t eat it Of course they didn t take money As soon as restaurant opened I went there But food was very very very bad And despite this I ate it I was starving And after I ate everything all night I spent in the toilet while voming I told them but they said that I am just complaining That was the very first time for me with such experience and believe me I am traveling more than 200 days per year The conclusion I will better spend my night at the airport while waiting my next flight next time,No Positive
293170,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The heating system was blocked to 23 degrees but it seemed that there were 13 degrees Damn cold I got a flu for that, parking near the hotel and restaurant not bed

293173,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Couldn t find the shuttle When you arrive at Barcelona make sure you call them to let them know you ve arrived , Was looking for somewhere to stay near the airport but there didn t seem to be much choice I booked the best western as they had a free shuttle and it was great 
293174,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The large spray of the shower was ineffective and the smaller nozzle sprayed water everywhere The bar meals were unimaginative and restaurant meals very expensive for the choice but good A large selection for breakfast but the hot food was barely warm , Helpful reception staff and efficient bar staff A shuttle bus to and from the airport and a local bus service with stops nearby to take us into town I would stay again for the convenience and knowledge that there was a reasonably priced and clean hotel near the airport 
293175,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Was expecting a bath but I only had a shower and there was no kettle or complimentary tea coffee in my room , The location was only a 15 minute bus journey from airport and the free shuttle bus was on time and efficient The room was very clean and the double bed extremely comfortable 
293176,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No restaurants or food options around thd hotel after 23 00 local so it is better to grab something to eat from the airport before you go to the hotel , great hotel if you are laying over in BCN airport and need s room to sleep

293180,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The hotel website should indicate the location of the airport bus shuttle and scheduled timing instead of requiring the customer to call the property upon arrival at the airport to find out as indicated in the booking The hotel phone line could not be reached and we have to ask around to find the shuttle pick up location , The family suite for 4 pp is spacious with 2 bedrooms and a jacuzzi in the bathroom The free airport shuttle is a plus point 
293181,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The built in alarm clock which went off every half hour No directions on how to use it , Convenient for airport Mini bus from the airport Pleasant staff 
293182,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, A bit too far from the airport so you will need to take the shuttle bus I was lucky to catch it right after my arrival and it was all sorted for my departure However please stock up on water necessities before leaving the airport Dinner at the restaurant only starts at 20 30 and there is no supermarket nearby Also no tea coffee facilities in room and my double bed was composed of two singles put together which kept going apart However the staff are really accommodating and will help you find everything you are looking for , The staff are extremely polite and lovely I was carrying a lot of bags and they all helped me manage that from the shuttle driver to the receptionist Very big room comfortable pillows and good prices for both the restaurant and the minibar Really good for an overnight layover

293187,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, I am really shocked with poor management of hotel financial system I had a free cancellation booking but suprisingly 2 days after booking the money was withrawn from my card without any perior permission Upon check in the lady receptionist refused the payment and said the money has not been deposited in their account and it was only blocked I showed her the statement but she denied severla times I was really angry but could not do any thing Till midnight i was trying to tell them that is their fault finally at 1 am a new receptionist simply told me it was taken by mistake without any apollogy for this illigal action I will never recommend this hotel and would complain against them , Airport shuttle was goog

293201,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No hot water for a shower Room was next to motorway and you could hear the traffic all night long Toilet handle broke when pushed Door wouldn t open with key Management was totally unsympathetic to concerns Never again , The staff was very friendly The food in the bar was good and priced fairly 
293202,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, FREE shuttle does not start until 5am so no good for any flights that leave before 7 or 8 Staff are happy to arrange taxi which is 30 euros for 3 6 km ride More than airport to town center rate , Staff were available and helpful

293204,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Bus to and from airport is not that frequent 45 minutes wait when we arrived It would also have been helpful to have a bus even earlier than the first one of the day 05h00 to allow enough time for the earliest flights from the airport We had to take a 15 minute taxi ride which cost 26 Euros , Well appointed and spacious room Luxurious finishes big walk in shower Good air conditioning 
293205,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, No bad experience I just don t understand why the hotel just doesn t list where the shuttle drops and picks up passengers Instead you have to call them after you land which can be expensive for a international traveler , Airport shuuttle
293206,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Food wasn t so good and because it is in a remote area there are not many other choices , Nice bathroom comfortable room nice free shuttle to airport
293207,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The restaurant did not open until 20 30 hr at night It is located in an industrial park area so limited access to the main city and restaurants , The hotel has free shuttle service to airport Front desk staff were excellent Breakfast buffet was good

293217,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Only that it was in an industrial erea no where to browse nearby, We found the staff so helpful service was excellent food also really good plenty of choices
293218,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The shuttle from the airport comes far too infrequently At night one can stand in a deserted area alone for far too long or in the hot sun for nearly an hour while other shuttles come and go 3 to 4 times , Price of room 
293219,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Most of the staff do not speak english food very average and expensive confusing menu, Clean good location if you fly early morning reasonable value for money room only 
293220,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Only issue with this hotel is the location It is far away from the city centre and it is not a good place if your intention is to visit the city However it is a perfect hotel to spend a night near to the airport , Hotel is very nice clean and Staff is very friendly Breakfast is also good and we enjoyed the breakfast during our stay 
293221,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, We were worried when we first saw the facility come into view Besides being in an industrial area the exterior made us wonder if it was a dump What a great surprise as a young fellow held the door for us to enter a beautiful spot , The interior was very nicely decorated The food was exceptional and artistically arranged on the plate The staff was friendly and helpful Although the location was an industrial area it suited us perfectly because we just needed a nice place to sleep eat to rest up before going on our cruise 
293222,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, 1 Hotel staff said taxi would cost us about 20 EUR But actually taxi driver asked whole 33 EUR it is way too much Since we booked taxi through hotel reception staff we expected that it will be fair and trustworthy taxi company Very disappointed 2 We booked this not cheap hotel nearby the airport hoping to save some money on transfer to the airport with free shuttle service But it turned out that bus shuttle works only during the daytime This was a surprise We had a flight at 06 20 AM Cancel booking was not possible so we were actually locked to stay and we eventually had to order taxi anyway Then happened 1 read above 3 At the lobby bar staff is definitely not customer oriented We waited to place an order then we waited to pay the bill of 17 EUR for the tiniest pizza I ve ever seen in my life and 4 ordinary black teas , Polite staff clean facility 
293223,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The shower worked but had a slow drain and kind of a weird set up, Very friendly and accommodating staff great breakfast and a fantastic dinner Close to airport with a shuttle bus and served our purposes well which were to sleep and eat after a long flight

293226,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Bed was a bit too hard for me but my husband liked it Tea coffee facilities in room would be preferable to the free toiletries , Room was a suite rather than a room with sofa bed Fantastic circular bath Shuttle service efficient Staff helpful 
293227,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Location unless you are willing to take a long bus ride busses are frequent swimming pool not heated sauna is not working at all If you are city visitor this hotel is not for you as this is located in a remote industrial area No tea coffee making in this hotel but not many hotels in Barcelona provide this so it is your choice , Room staff bathroom free shuttle service which is on time and helpful closer to airport very good for early flights AC
293228,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, The only negative thing was the location but it was easy to get a taxi if we needed to go anywhere , Helpful staff comfy and luxurious rooms quick wifi and great facilities Overall it was a really good experience staying at this Hotel 
293229,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, This hotel has Aeropuerto in its name therefore mostly geared towards passengers arriving from a flight departing next morning or both Their airport shuttle should be the most important offering Instead if you book a stay at this hotel there is no guarantee you re getting a shuttle ride at all They run the shuttle from the hotel to the airport on a preset schedule with 45 minute intervals and there are only 8 seats per ride I would strongly suggest taking this into consideration before booking this hotel as this may screw up your plans very badly The hotel itself is in a middle of a industrial area not sure if you can get a taxi to pick you up from there Our reservation was breakfast included we came in and sat at a table The breakfast attendant asked us the room number which we thought was normal At the end without any explanation she handed us a bill for our breakfast which apparently we must pay now I pulled my smartphone showing our reservation on Booking com clearly stating that breakfast was included Instead she sent us to the receptionist to handle the bill situation At first the receptionist tried to convince me that breakfast was not included until I pulled my smartphone again then she clicked something on her computer and said it was ok and we did not have to pay for breakfast Breakfast area was not air conditioned hot and muggy the food choice was minimal and of poor quality Their only coffee machine was a hit or miss Had to complain it did not dispense hot water attendant came in and restarted the machine If you pressed Hot Chocolate you got Coffee If you re planning to use the indoor pool please remember that they require everyone to wear a swim cap , Very spacious two bedroom suite with the largest bathroom had a Jacuzzi shaped bathtub Very comfortable mattresses 
293230,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Breakfast was ok but many hotels including other Best Western providives free breakfast Not many choices in the buffet for vegetarians for the price No other restaurants close by , Clean and spacious rooms and washrooms very friendly and helpful and warm staff free airport shuttle service quite rooms Front office staff were very helpful in providing information on city tours etc Check in times were good 
293231,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, Difficult to find when driving to the hotel on an industrial estate Soap dispenser in shower was empty , Efficient and helpful check in staff Good service in bar restaurant serving food until early hours to accommodate arrivals Wide selection available for breakfast Great to have a mini supermarket on site to buy supplies when arriving late at night

293234,Hotel Best Western PLUS Alfa Aeropuerto, complementary in room coffee would have been nice or even guest coffee in the lobby without charge I didn t like getting the 5 30 a m wake up call I had asked for at 5 00 a m instead I feel the time between shuttle pickup at the airport 45 minutes is way too long especially if it is late at night after a long flight or if one has to stand in the sun waiting for this amount of time , Staff were great and helpful as well as friendly Nice room
