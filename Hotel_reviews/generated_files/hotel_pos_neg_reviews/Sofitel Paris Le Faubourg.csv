54817,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, I think it was great just as is , The location was the best part also it had quite a nice feminine but modern feel I especially loved the rich gray silver bronze and gold tones as well as the wood details 
54818,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The hotel is very close to the French President s residence and hence heavily guarded which is a bonus point for security but access by taxi may be inconvenient as they require permission to enter the lane to the front of the hotel , The initial rooms allocated to us were a bit small even to fit our luggage The front desk suggested we take a full suite with 2 bedrooms and a large sitting room but at a hefty additional cost We decided since we were on family holidays and that we can all be at the same suite cost ceases to become a part of the equation Checked out with an oversized bill but well worth the family fun times beauty and food of Paris plus the nice Spring weather 
54819,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The breakfast was expensive The service was slow if you didn t have the buffet The coffee was awful , The staff were very helpful and pleasant The room was big for Paris hotels The location was excellent The beds were very comfy The bathroom was large and very comfortable to move around in Th
54820,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, I liked everything BUT The breakfast Too little choice not good enough quality bruised apples one brown banana some mandarins mango out of a can no fresh baguette rest of bread quite dry cereals presented quite unappetizing in plastic containers and very little choice a la carte pancakes just not good warmed up in micro wave hence cold and soft when we got them Have stayed at many five star hotels in Paris Park Hyatt Mandarin Oriental Grand Hotel du Palais Royal and the breakfast at the Sofitel Faubourg definitely the lowest quality of all ,No Positive
54821,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, They gave us a very noisy room near the staff room we ve been very disturbed by all the noise an the staff talking And the breakfeast is very poor a shame for a five stars hotels in paris I saw better in a 3 stars,No Positive
54822,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Bed sloped from the middle Coffee cups in room not being cleaned On check in asked why I had booked with booking com and told that because I had I would not get the points on my card , The location
54823,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, music coming from next door restaurant that s it , The area was the big bonus and not to forget we where upgraded to a suite cuz we where waiting 2 hours till our room get ready the team where so caring waiting time thanks Sofitel Le Faubourg we are coming back next year 
54824,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg,No Negative, the breakfast was nice friendly staff a receptionist called Maria was real nice and helpfull we would like to thank her very much for her beautiful gesture however the concierge was good helper 
54825,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg,No Negative, Magical hotel with exceptional service from the manager right down to the kitchen staff We were amazed by our room which we were kindly upgraded up to a suite by rhe manager Highly recommend 
54826,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The house keeping staff member who attended our room could have been a little friendlier and shown a bit more patience when we returned to use the toilet , Beautiful old hotel that is in a great location along a particularly pretty street The ronly seption staff where friendly and very helpful 
54827,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Water would drain from basin without lifting pop up waste up using finger nails Three days of complaining before it was repaired Also bathroom door handle continually fell off as the screw at the side was missing and as it took so long to fix basin I didn t even bother my holiday was too short to waste it on complaints I just wouldn t go back or recommend it , Hotel location fab easy to access all popular sites Super comfy beds 
54828,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Nothing everything was perfect , The street is so safe with guards either side we were upgraded to a collection suite on arrival which we were delighted with Mary on reception who checked us in and showed us around the hotel was lovely the hotel was stunning and the room was absolutely beautiful The MOST comfortable bed I have ever slept in The hotel is so central within walking distance of most sights and galleries I would definitely recommend friends and family to stay at The Sofitel Paris le faubourg if visiting Paris you won t be disappointed 
54829,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The pillows were too soft and when we called to get different ones we were told that they didnt have any , The location was amazing staff extra friendly and the rooms were lovely 
54830,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Gym was a token gym to achieve 5 star rating not good enough to do a workout No bidet in bathroom Apart from that it s was perfect , Excellent hotel in great location I was upgraded to a suite which was nice and spacious although I think the room I booked was big for Paris Beautifully designed contemporary but classic room Bed a was like a cloud Staff were excellent and attentive remembering my name on checkout 
54831,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The Hotel is next door to the American Embassy so there is a lot of security near the hotel Can be a bit intimidating but you get used to it , The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in The room was very pleasant and a good size with great attention to detail The interior design of the room was very tastefuly done I actually enjoyed spending time in the room it had a very calming effect on me The bathroom was excellent particularly the shower The staff were very helpful and friendly I asked for a slightly later checkout which they had no problems with Along with the excellent location all in all a very nice Hotel that I will surely revisit

54833,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Cons I d bad experience in the check in process I ve came at 2 30 pm and checked in 4 00 pm it s unusual at all from Sofitel I was disappointed as the level of expectations were much higher than reality as I m still a big fan of Sofitel Groups, Pros Good fashionable design Great facilities as usual Very close to the Fashion Area brands 1 min Walk Very Close to Place de la Concorde 4 min Not far from the Louvre Museum 1 7 km Good for Families with kids
54834,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Security is really bad as i had things stolen from my suitcase Despite only narrowing down 2 people entering my room the hotel still said there was doubt as to whether I had these items in the first place They also refused to divulge the employees names that entered my room Needless to say I never saw those items ever again,No Positive
54835,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Nothing everything was perfect , The hotel is perfectly located and very clean very cozy and enjoyable The staff was awesome and upgraded us to a prestige suite which was 3 class above our booking because I mentioned me and my girlfriend just got engaged they also offered us champagne it was amazing The bar is nice to sit at and the atmosphere is enjoyable The breakfast is very good perfectly french The rooms are very comfy and clean the bed is huge and the amenities are new and of quality Definitely a 5 stars and very affordable compared to the 5 stars hotels prices in Paris Will definitely come back soon to Sofitel Le Faubourg thank you

54837,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg,No Negative, We got an upgrade to a suite so it was perfect Breakfast was excellent location is awesome Staff was very friendly Hotel was pricey but worth it for us
54838,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, There was a bit of confusion regarding the breakfast I was told it was included in the price but I was charged for all breakfasts when I checked out , Lovely room recently renovated A bit strange to see the bathtub as you entered from the hall but no complaints The location of this hotel is awesome on a quiet street between the Rue de Rivoli and Faubourg de Honore 
54839,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, My room was noisy probably next to the office or something The light bulbs in the room went on and off during the 3 nights , Love the the location Love the in room breakfast
54840,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Housekeeping kept removing our tea cups and saucers and drink glasses and not replacing them We had to chase everyday Nice to come back from a long day out and make a cup of tea This is one of the services offered but very frustrating chasing them up all the time, Location The room was very comfortable Bed was comfortable Front of house pleasant Concierge very helpful Room service staff delightful
54841,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, My room was noisy Probably located opposite the office on first floor and water pipe system The lightbulb and toilet seat were broken The room service delivery for breakfast was not reliable , The bed is comfy The room is well curtained to have a good sleep Some staff are extremely great whereas some aren t 
54842,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The room rate is quite pricey compared to hotels of similar quality , The bed was very comfy and location is excellent Special thanks to Albert who helped us with the luggage and found us a taxi in the morning of Bastille day celebration 
54843,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Breakfast was not as expected To much of a coffee shop with pastries cookies and goodies instead of real breakfast food, It s a clean nice luxury hotel with friendly staff
54844,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg,No Negative, Very nice hotel excellent location very safe There are armored guards outside the hotel due to the US Embassy next door Nice and clean rooms comfortable beds Quiet at night although in the very center Very friendly and helpful staff Enjoyed our stay at the hotel

54846,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, 1 We were arranged to the 1st floor room actually the guestroom 101 which was very noisy before 1am It s because there s a restaurant with side walk caf operated til midnight hours 2 The Nespresso machine doesn t work as it should be not only the cutter can t break the coffee capsule but also water leaking from the tank We used bathroom towels to clean the water leakage , 1 Beautiful lobby 2 Efficient and professional check in check out 3 Delicious and quality breakfast buffet we enjoyed the French pastry session and cold cut session 4 Beautiful fresh elegant and modern design of guestroom 5 We enjoy the Hermes toiletries especially the shower gel and body lotion 6 Guestroom is nice and clean with adequate source of light 7 Doorman are polite and responsible arrived less than 2 minutes after my making phone call to the switchboard 8 Front desk staffs are helpful and nice helped me to amend our restaurant reservation and make adhoc lunch appointments truly thanks 9 Airport transfer hotel to CDG arranged by doorman is perfect we are arranged a nice and clean Mercedes Benz minivan at a very reasonable and attractive price 10 The doorman wearing a hat probably an Asian is a nice and friendly guy who offered me great help to get a taxi to Louvre in the early morning 11 Breakfast serves til 11am which is slightly later than most of the hotel restaurant Even we arrived to the restaurant at 10 45am waiters are happy to serve us I can see how they value their customers 12 The location is the strongest point for our rebook this hotel Hermes Chanel Gucci Kenzo LaDuree and Foxnity bus are just around the corner Medeleine and Place de la Concord are just a few minutes walk 13 Security level is high The hotel is located on the street session which has security block on both ends Not all taxi are allowed to entered the block I guess this hotel location may be one of the most safest place in Paris 14 We enjoyed the evening dress display and art pieces shown in the lobby area 
54847,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Breakfast for the buffet You can have only fried egg besides that have to be extra charge such as boil egg It s so strange isn t it , The location
54848,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Bedding Very expensive for what it does for Poor breakfast Staff was more pish than anything else Gave the feeling that owe them something, Location and decoration Food was good Good room service

54851,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The lights in the rooms were confusing After a week s stay we still did not know how to operate them I think there was also a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom but it was unclear how to turn it on , The staff are extremely helpful and friendly Wonderful restaurant at the hotel and perfect location Beautiful facilities and furnishings Because it is tucked away on a side street it has lots of Parisian curbside appeal Highly recommend 
54852,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, I didnt like the fact that i was missing a necklace which I had kept in the room and no one has done anything about it , Boutique hotel that is comfortable
54853,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, The cleanliness could be better The housekeeping could be better Shower door was broken it was dusty too since its carpeted, The bed was comfy and the extra bed sofa bed at the suite was great 
54854,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Breakfast was extremely poor I have never seen such a little choice When we asked if there were boiled eggs we got advised that boiled eggs has to be ordered and paid separately which is just ridiculous Disappointed , Exceptionally perfect location very quite and safe street but at the same time in the very centre close to the main sightseeing places and shopping area Very nice and helpful staff coffee machine and tea in the room 
54855,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, 1 Drink my coffee in a drinking glass for the last two days coz there s no cup for coffee Several requests made from the housekeeper but to no avail No complimentary coffee available I bought it outside the hotel 2 I was told to check out on the 1st of January when it should be on the 2nd Staff inefficiency of not checking the reservation 3 Basic toiletries is not provided everyday 4 Very poor housekeeping 5 Following up your request from the Reception everyday is stressful Hence you must be contend of what is available in your room , The location Just a few steps away from the metro bus station tourist attraction and shopping center The place is very safe

54862,Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg, Construction across the street started at 7 30 in the morning Not the fault of the hotel The restaraunt was only open for a short time for breakfast and was overpriced in my opinion Staff holidays in August is common in Paris , The Concierge was especially helpful and loved when my 13 year old grandson spoke to him in French The ambiance was evident from the moment you passed through the doors and were greeted by courteous staff The room was well appointed and the bathroom stocked with Hermes products Would definitely stay here again
