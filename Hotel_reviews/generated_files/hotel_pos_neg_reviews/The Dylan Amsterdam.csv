356472,The Dylan Amsterdam, We missed a sauna and a pool after walking the whole day around the city but that could be easily replaced for drinks at the lounge or the internal patio , Perfect location close to the very charming shopping area of the 9 streets and close to nice restaurants and cafes You can walk all over the city from there Very nice staff 
356473,The Dylan Amsterdam, It might be a little more expensive but probably because it is a 5 star hotel Other than this nothing to complain about , The hotel is in a nice location Restaurants and shops were in a walking distance What I mostly liked about the hotel was the staff they were so polite and attentive to the guests I do recommend this hotel especially for couples 
356474,The Dylan Amsterdam, The Dylan like all Amsterdam hotels is expensive I would like to make it a yearly trip but that depends on the hotel rates , The Dylan Amsterdam is a 5 star property with 5 star service I was having mobility issues at the time of my stay so I availed of my hotel facilities more than usual The staff gave excellent service in every department especially the female servers in the bar The turn down waiter was also very helpful Concierge also gave 5 star service The decor in my room was up market modern and beautiful I enjoyed lounging around in it as it was so comfortable and enjoyable Normally I focus on the city this time I chilled out and enjoyed my surroundings in the hotel Am looking forward to a return visit 
356475,The Dylan Amsterdam, I booked a double room in this 5 star hotel as a treat to my wife We were then shunted to The New Annex to a room that could have featured in any 3 4 star hotel chain It had a pokey stairwell and looked dreadful When I enquiried about availability of other rooms it was obvious that 400 per night did not buy me a room in the main hotel During my three day stay not one member of management spoke to me On check out I notice an item on my bill for 9 euros this I found out was for having bacon with my breakfast which was included in my rate This hotel really needs to decide what it wants to be To charge 400 for the room I had is immoral, Location pleasant staff in breakfast romm
356476,The Dylan Amsterdam, The bathroom in our room could be a little bigger , We loved the Vinkles restaurant and had an excellent meal with great wine Breakfasts were good I really enjoyed the Bircher match museli Staff were very polite and helpful We would recommend it 
356477,The Dylan Amsterdam, The Occo restaurant really wasn t that great The roast beef sandwich seemed unconventional and was trying too hard The scrambled eggs for breakfast were also prepared unusual I think Occos menu is just trying to hard and should find it s own style but not be so modern and have a few simple things , Stewart the concierge was awesome He got me into a couple places and gave great Recs The coffee was also excellent The entire staff was wonderful and super friendly 
356478,The Dylan Amsterdam, Lighting in the room could have been a littlle better , Bed was massive and warm room facilties were excellent and quality of breakfast and drinks perfect Staff very friendly 
356479,The Dylan Amsterdam, Teas at breakfast on offer in an impressive Japanese glass jug teapot are Ceylon and Darjeeling Tasty enough but my regular request for Earl Grey tea each morning never resulted in it appearing and we were there for 6 days , Friendly helpful and professional staff Most enjoyable breakfast selection including fresh mango and pineapple homemade natural yoghurt and the cooked options that we tried of pancakes and poached eggs were well cooked The in house restaurant Vinkeles is a gem Sublime cooking if you remember to book well ahead Our bedroom was suffused with natural light and kept spotlessly clean 
356480,The Dylan Amsterdam, The shower pressure in the room we were staying in was quite weak and hard to regulate Also the breakfast that was included as part of the room rate was weak with very little variety on mmy opinion Otherwise amazing hotel ,No Positive
356481,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent and convenient location knowledgeable and friendly staff comfortable room great bar and restaurant what else would one ask for Wouldn t even consider staying anywhere else in Amsterdam 
356482,The Dylan Amsterdam, We was asked 400 when we arrived for deposit we wasn t told this when we booked we didn t bring our credit cards with us just money we end up using our friends credit card bit embarrassing , Staff was friendly always asked if you needed help
356483,The Dylan Amsterdam, The only thing was avarage was the wi fi It was complicated to get on line , We liked everything from the kind service of the staff the high class atmosphere everything 
356484,The Dylan Amsterdam, Bathroom needs re fitting shower leaked everywhere was too close to the wall bath so high it was dangerous to get out of Terrible hairdryer A little noisy from the other rooms as floors are thin, Amazing location Comfy bed Lovely breakfast Excellent bar Really friendly staff
356485,The Dylan Amsterdam, Asking for a type of bread at breakfast and telling me its over No can do in a hotel this type Plus very unorganized breakfast service , For what you pay I would expect MUCH more Poor amenities Poor room service tray comes without a flower without bread without butter
356486,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, The Dylan is centrally located in the heart of the Canal District which was a priority for us It is also an easy 25 minute walk to the theater and museum districts which was also a plus Our room was very well appointed and the staff stayed on top of restocking what ever we used throughout our stay in an expeditious manner The common areas reception living room bar and restrooms were always very clean and inviting We have enjoyed many properties in the city center of Amsterdam during our stays and will definitely return to The Dyan on our next visit to Amsterdam 
356487,The Dylan Amsterdam, Given upgrade without request a disaster Room duplex bathroom beneath accessed via spiral staircase with shallow steps not at all suitable for our age profile 58 60 yrs Also the wardrobe was in this bathroom area so one would have had to navigate the stairs in order to hang clothes Very little natural light capability in bedroom as when shutters open overlooked by lounge bar windows onopposite side of courtyard Breakfast total disaster Service slow So slow it necessitated us taking taxi to Van Gogh museum even though we had purposely breakfasted early in order to allow time to walk or take tram there Ordered tea for 1 and coffee for 1 Only coffee arrived so we had to request the tea again Cold tea served This was rectified eventually Ordered 2 fried eggs for 2 people with white toast poached eggs arrived with no toast We had to leave without completing breakfast as we needed to be at Van Gogh , Check in friendly and professional Arrived early needed to change clothes room Josephine s offered to do this Concierges both where excellent and gave good information on restaurant choices directions etc The main guy working in the bar was also very friendly later that night when we had a late drink after dinner Lady on reception phoned us when room ready which was helpful also 
356488,The Dylan Amsterdam, Buffet missing tomato juice is all, Beautiful building very friendly and helpful staff very clean room and common areas Lovely bar brasserie restaurant etc Bedding and toiletries excellent too 
356489,The Dylan Amsterdam, As other reviewers have commented the breakfast was quite disappointing Our main issue was the service Staff were friendly but the service was very slow and lacklustre Lots of orders were forgotten at various tables It was difficult to get the staff s attention We had no butter until we were finished with our breakfast Coffee is served in very small cups that never seem to get refilled We saw thermos tea and coffee pots at other tables but we just had an empty one at ours The choice of the buffet breakfast was quite modest Not really what one would expect from a 5 star hotel , Our room was beautiful and comfortable We had an espresso machine which is always a big plus The bed was extremely comfortable and the decor very understated and elegant 
356490,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Superb location excellent night s sleep Vinkles restaurant was incredible probably the best meal of our lives The staff were very helpful Do try the High Wine in the beautiful courtyard you won t regret it 
356491,The Dylan Amsterdam, A pity there was a wedding so we could not use all facilities , Loved the breakfast and the location The staff is very friendly en the room was perfect 
356492,The Dylan Amsterdam, We certainly did not like the arrangement of the door into our bedroom should be the other way around and the telephone was not fixed after asking staff to fix it several times Several lights were out so they needed to be fixed so maybe the room is hardly used Also there was tonnes of noise down below in the streets where our no 10 room was , The hotel design was funky and original Breakfast was nice Staff friendly Gym is amazing 
356493,The Dylan Amsterdam, Staff knowledge between restaurant and front office can be a little more aligned , Location and decor But could do better w the flower presentation at the entrance 
356494,The Dylan Amsterdam, There were a few strange things in the room window by shower had no cover so people could see in no hooks for towels and could not see the TV from the bed, Beautiful hotel great location very friendly staff with lovely architecture 
356495,The Dylan Amsterdam, Night menu only one pizza left and we were starving And I would have liked a fluffier duvet , Lovely hotel great service Beautiful building and styling 
356496,The Dylan Amsterdam, At the back of hotel early in the morning around 7 00 municipality workers collecting trash with pulling garbage cars with huge annoying noise So that will be great if Hotel management can warn them , Great room with a location looking over backyards of canal houses Great inner garden for a drink amd relax Great location Superb staff
356497,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Personalized attention was greatly appreciated thank you We very much enjoyed celebrating our anniversary at The Dylan and in the outstanding restaurant Vinkeles
356498,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Oops I mistakenly gave a poor review to this hotel earlier meant for another hotel The Dylan is wonderfly unique If you want to escape cookie cutter lodging this is the one in Amsterdam 
356499,The Dylan Amsterdam, The room felt damp For a hotel of this category it s a pity not to provide an air recycling system The room was historic but too old fashion with these curtains a bit dated The restaurant of the Hotel OCCO is not at the level of the Hotel , The kindness of the staff The privileged situation near the center and the canals The intimacy of the hotel The superior and rare quality of the restaurant Winkeles with a Chef of high value 
356500,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent hotel in quiet area of Amsterdam Great location for shops cafes restaurants of Nine Streets and walking distance to museums Lovely comfortable well appointed room and friendly staff 
356501,The Dylan Amsterdam, We thought the hotel had a spa center apparently there isn t , We loved the interior design of the hotel It was totally worth to have the breakfast 
356502,The Dylan Amsterdam, The wash basin tap was in an awkward position Bad design flaw , The service was excellent from the moment you step in and the hotel has so much character There were always extra amenities in the bathroom the bed is very comfortable and there was illy coffee too 
356503,The Dylan Amsterdam, Lighting in bathroom was too dim hard to see in magnifying mirror because of the set up sheets were stiff noise from other rooms , Welcoming staff perfect location beautiful property great bar 
356504,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, We arrived a little before check in time but receptionist arranged for us to get in our room no problem We opted to share several bar bites and they were delicious Enjoyed espresso in room and were wondering if you could share info on where to purchase those Illy cups All in all hotel and employees where wonderful Wish we could have stayed longer 
356505,The Dylan Amsterdam, Nothing , Fantastic hotel best I ve stayed in for a while a real 5 experience Excellent staff nothing to much trouble for them and the concierge on duty every day was first Class 
356506,The Dylan Amsterdam, the room is too dark when shades are down breakfast starts preparing early so there s some noise early in the morning, The location is amazing Very central Beautiful trendy hotel with friendly staff cool bar and nice restaurants 
356507,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, The old building has been turned into a contemporary boutique hotel which has been beautifully decorated The bedroom looked over the courtyard as I think most of them do The staff are extremely helpful and the location within the 9 streets is superb Lots of cafes and restaurants within the district 
356508,The Dylan Amsterdam, Staff seem very insincere and not very friendly Their billing system doesn t seem to work as we had supper and our bill got given to someone else and on checking out I realized I ve been charged for a breakfast I never had , Great location spacious room nice bar
356509,The Dylan Amsterdam, It was very expensive for what you got the room was nice but not value for money , the bed was really comfy the staff were lovely and its in a beautiful building 
356510,The Dylan Amsterdam, The food was OK not what I expected Bar area was very dark Great place to go if you re having a bad skin day Some of the bar staff were a bit too full of themselves busy swanning around More interested in catching their reflection in the bar mirror than the attention of waiting customers , Amazingly comfortable beds Attention to detail is what you would expect in this hotel Excellent reception and concierge service Fabulous location 
356511,The Dylan Amsterdam, Couldn t get the coffee machine to work in the room We should have asked for help but never seemed to get round to it Maybe some instructions would be useful , The staff were all lovely well trained and friendly without overdoing it The location is good and allows easy access on foot to all that Amsterdam has to offer The hotel itself is a beautiful building and its layout adds interest to the visitor as there always seems to be another room to discover We were upgraded upon arrival and our room 34 was really very nice I thoroughly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying there again 
356512,The Dylan Amsterdam, Not a bad word to say , Beautiful canalside hotel in the heart of Amsterdam s 9 Streets The staff were helpful and kind They even have my wife a present for her birthday 
356513,The Dylan Amsterdam, nothing , Had an amazing stay we were welcomed across the hotel and it was all the little touches throughout our stay that made it a great Christmas Amazing location and room Knew I was with my nephew and they went out of the way to make his stay special
356514,The Dylan Amsterdam, For room 12 Sub par in room entertainment media Limited average night room service offering Inconvenient room setting for business traveller needs eg easy wardrobe for hanging shirts , Friendly and attentive staff Responsive management to concerns raised striving for visitor happiness satisfaction
356515,The Dylan Amsterdam, Funny smell near the elevator not a big choice of simple food on the Brasserie menu and unfortunately only one person serving during a busy dinner time She was great very happy but needed assistance , Quiet Comfortable Wonderful old canal boat with happy uniformed captain Good draft Brand beer Very relaxed 
356516,The Dylan Amsterdam, Not a bad experience but I was unaware that our magnificent ensuite was down a flight of stairs If for some reason you have problems with stairs check which room you are getting, We loved our stay at the Dylan staff were so friendly and helpful Atmosphere was lovely and our room was really nice Great area near the nine streets 
356517,The Dylan Amsterdam, The room was very small For similar price you can have definitely bigger room in Andaz on the other side of the canal The breakfast experience was horrific We had to wait 30 minutes for scrambled eggs and they were barely edible The breakfast choice was very poor There were a lot of waiting staff almost one per table but they seemed to have a very little interest in satisfaction of the guests I would say the same applied to all the stuff in the hotel Again we stayed a few times in Andaz and breakfast there was amazing with smiling non pretentious stuff I will not be staying in Dylan again , Location is of course the best in Amsterdam Only Andaz can compete here 
356518,The Dylan Amsterdam,No Negative, Spectacular hotel with excellent service The staff was attentive friendly Not sure where to eat Just ask their suggestions were spot on Perfect location on a quieter street that is mainly residential but there are restaurants and shops within easy walking distance It s less than a 20 minute walk to the center of town We stayed in room 5 which overlooked the courtyard It was very spacious for a European hotel room We will definitely be back 
356519,The Dylan Amsterdam, Some of the younger staff appeared to be rather undertrained and amateurish in the restaurants and would have struggled if it had been busier and the guests more impatient , We thoguth the location was excellent and enabled us to enjoy an early morning dtroll before the crowds go out and about Taking a pre prandial aperitif and then dining on the terrqce was also memorable
