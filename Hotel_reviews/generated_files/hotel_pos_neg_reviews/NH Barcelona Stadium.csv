468018,NH Barcelona Stadium, The price of breakfast was expensive the restaurant in evening it felt like staff didn t want to serve so we went elsewhere , The cleanliness of the rooms were excellent and the whole hotel Staff also tried there best to help you as much as they could with information 
468019,NH Barcelona Stadium, There was a certain smell when the room was not A C ed for a while for instance when I entered it at the end of the day The sound isolation of the other rooms is rather poor , Clean and modern room 
468020,NH Barcelona Stadium, The staff were not very friendly, It was an excellent location right near the Camp Nou Stadium It was also close to a metro station which was helpful the next morning 
468021,NH Barcelona Stadium, Nothing to register Gym could be bigger but ok for a quick sweat , nice staff great breakfast and good location especially if you are going for a match at the Camp Now right on its doorstep Nice little pool at the rooftop for warm days 
468022,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, room was lovely nice big double bed and bathroom was clean and modern much like the room Would definitely stay there again as we had no problems and staff were always willing to help 
468023,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, Very clean and modern we choose it because we were going to watch Barcelona fc it didn t disappoint 2 min walk to nou camp could see stadium from our room
468024,NH Barcelona Stadium, The room I got would a bit small if you are there for leisure and or long stays but was good for a quick business trip , Great location if you work or visit in the Nou Camp Sports Complex which was my case Palau Blaugrana just in front of the hotel Good clean rooms Good bathroom with decent amenities Friendly staff Fluid check in and check out Helped me to book a taxi in advance to the airport in the wee hours 
468025,NH Barcelona Stadium, Whilst the shower was good an actual bath would have been nice , Bed was really comfortable Bathroom was great with a good shower Excellent choice of breakfast items 
468026,NH Barcelona Stadium, Free wifi was a bit slow however there is an option to subscribe to a business wifi Breakfast didn t include any vegetables , Clean room comfortable bed roof terrace hotel is very close to FC Barcelona stadium
468027,NH Barcelona Stadium, The pool was closed as it was a visit in January The surrounding area lacked some decent restaurants and evening entertainment , The hotel was clean and very well placed for the purpose of my trip to the Nou Camp It was modern and well presented The staff were extremely helpful 
468028,NH Barcelona Stadium, No provision for electric kettle in the room to make tea coffee Internet can be a bit slow , Good sized room with a balcony good views of Barcelona from the terrace 
468029,NH Barcelona Stadium, The location of the hotel there s not many things around like restaurants etc although it s 5mins from Barcelona football stadium and 2mins from metro station, The hotel rooms were tidy good value for money very friendly staff
468030,NH Barcelona Stadium, worse service ever they stole my bag inside the room no manager to complain worse and unqualified receptionist would never ever go again , nothing good about this 
468031,NH Barcelona Stadium, Booking com and the NH hotel staff were not helpful in resolving the duplicate booking we had We only received confirmation for 1 booking but got charged for 2 ,No Positive
468032,NH Barcelona Stadium, Could not fault it , Beautiful room and view Great shower Very comfy bed Supermarket next door Restaurants and bars close Very close to Nou Camp Stadium
468033,NH Barcelona Stadium, the hotel was classified as 4 star We felt that it was lucky to be 3 star , The staff were very friendly and helpful It was close to Barcelona Stadium and although it was not close to the city it was easy to catch a bus into the city centre 
468034,NH Barcelona Stadium, personally I felt that it was not worth for the money what they are charging It was showing that it was 4star hotel but corridors was not that clean and bad smell was coming from some areas of the hotel, Break fast menu was good
468035,NH Barcelona Stadium, Nothing was wrong , The breakfast was fantastic A lot of food The people help us with everything we ask Nice view from The stadium of Fc Barcelona We will Come back
468036,NH Barcelona Stadium, Bads were too narrow for me , Perfect location if you came for a footbal game Camp Nou few steps away If i come again to Camp nou i will stay at that hotel Swimming pool on roof with a stadium view Nice rooftop tarrace of course with a stadium view Friendly staff Good breakfast 
468037,NH Barcelona Stadium, Not a 4 hotel Low quality windows did not isolate the outside noise Peeling off paint damaged walls and stained curtains Uncomfortable bed , Good breakfast choices 
468038,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, Shower was amazing and room was lovely if a little tired Breakfast Buffet was great especially option to have an omelette or other egg dish made freshly for you 
468039,NH Barcelona Stadium, cost of mini bar was silly prices considering shops next to hotel etc BUT i suppose that is to be expected for it being there to hand etc as you arrive, Loved everything location was superb for the football game View of the stadium from the pool and terrace areas couldn t have asked for any more great hotel o very happy 
468040,NH Barcelona Stadium, The walls are thin so you can hear all the noise from the other rooms The pool is really small and crowded The double bed was two single beds pushed together with wheels and they were moving around The furniture looked very worn not what I d expect from a new 4 star hotel , Location is good closest underground station is about 5 min walk away Close to Camp Nou which is useful as public transport is very crowded after games and taxis don t come close 
468041,NH Barcelona Stadium, Old furniture the hotel needs to change and renovate the rooms breakfast was limited no varieties , Great staff at the reception very helpful and great location I recommend this hotel for football fans 
468042,NH Barcelona Stadium, The roof terrace could be amazing but needs a refit The pool is tiny so don t be taken in by the photo This was a major disappointment , Comfy bed Modern bathroom Higher rooms better
468043,NH Barcelona Stadium, location is not that good if you are not planning to watch a football match in Camp Nou Stadium the closest metro is 400 m which is not bad but to arrive the city centre it will take you at least 40 minutes and the metro close at midnight during weekdays so if you are planning to stay late you have to consider a taxi or night bus I booked for a superior room since I have a kid 5 years old but when I arrived I was given a small standard room then I complained to the staff and they gave a superior room with a sofa bed which was fair enough for us to get rest and relaxed the bed is slippery because it has wheels , staff are friendly room is clean breakfast has good variety of food and many kinds of fresh juice also you can ask for omelette 
468044,NH Barcelona Stadium, Couples request a double bed , Super clean friendly and helpful staff and great view of Camp Nou from the hotel room Amazing views from the rooftop super easy to get around via metro thanks to the staff providing maps and giving advice and directions Would defiantly stay again 
468045,NH Barcelona Stadium, No coffee making in room Beds on wheels so roll around room so can be noisy from other adjoining rooms , Great location as close to FCB stadium close to metro to get to main tourist sights direct route yet right in the heart of the real area where the locals live so easy access to local cafes and ramblas 
468046,NH Barcelona Stadium, Car park is available but not included in the price and it s expensive same as any other hotel in this city Swimming pool is tiny and not in the same level of the terrace so having a drink at the pool is not straight forward , Excellent location right across the stadium and 5 min walk from a busy metro station Great breakfasts and very warm treatment by the staff 
468047,NH Barcelona Stadium, Room layout Slightly cramped Tiny pool few plugs broken, Location was great near metro main road and near Camp nou Breakfast was awesome Fresh Fruits juices and eggs made to order the way i like them Restaurant manager Oscar was superb Balconies with each room
468048,NH Barcelona Stadium, The price was high but I guess it s expected with such close proximity to Barca stadium, Wifi worked OK on the 4th floor the breakfast was nice with various flavours The location was very close to Camp Nou and close by to Metro station Few shops just next to the hotel made it very convenient 
468049,NH Barcelona Stadium, Small room door onto balcony didn t lock properly 9th floor was really noisy bed was terribly uncomfortable and pillows were ridiculously soft I had to check that there was a pillow in there and not just a pillow case , Bathroom was recently renovated
468050,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, Couldn t of picked a better place to be able to see the FC Barcelona game with my son the room was first class the staff could t do enough to help
468051,NH Barcelona Stadium, Breakfast was 20 and was massively overpriced for the selection available, Beds were comfy and location was good for the purpose of our visit which was to see the football 
468052,NH Barcelona Stadium, really small swimming pool not clean I had a lot of problems with WIFI Free WIFI is acceptable up to 1MBit speed but when I upgraded to enhanced I had a lot of problems reseting the WIFI , nicely located just 2 minutes from stadium excellent value for money 2 different metro stations about 5 7 minutes from hotel Overall good experience
468053,NH Barcelona Stadium, There wasn t anything we didn t really like other than there was not enough milk and tea in the room but that wasn t a big problem , Breakfast was excellent good variety and the omelettes were lovely the staff were very good bar manager very attentive polite and knowledgeable on drinks Breakfast staff were also very good as were the Reception staff Room was very spacious and comfortable The mini bar was excellent had all kinds of snacks and drinks 
468054,NH Barcelona Stadium, Nothing, Helpful staff very clean rooms breakfast amazing selection of good and great gym and clean swimming pool with great views will defiantly be returning
468055,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, location great as our main purpose was to see an FCB game Would be less ideal if the purpose is a city trip although only 5 minute walk to the metro that goes direct to town Very good breakfast 
468056,NH Barcelona Stadium, No room service I arrived late thanks to flight delays and there was no food available Breakfast was expensive for what it was Choice was fairly limited , Location and helpful staff 
468057,NH Barcelona Stadium, Their breakfast is good but if they can change the menu for at least 2 times a week it is well appreciated When we stay for 4 5 nights it is boring to eat same breakfast everyday morning , It was a nice place to stay in Barcelona well connected to TMB Bacelona public transport services both buses and Metro L3 Staff is friendly and helpful If we want to check out early morning on last day and go for a tour They keep our luggage securely after checking out till when we collect back room is well maintained and clean Private bathroom is clean and with required toiletries Reception is 24 Hrs and any time we can check in and check out without any problem 
468058,NH Barcelona Stadium, Bathroom window area had some mold and not completely clean, Proximity to Barca stadium and the tournament I was attending Room on the 10th floor had a great view of the stadium 
468059,NH Barcelona Stadium, The location is perfect for Camp Nou and an FC Barcelona game although it might be noisy and chaotic on game days I assume because there were no games while I stayed Otherwise it is far from the centre but public transportation is very good accessible and takes you there in 30 minutes walk metro The main attractions in Barcelona are far from each other anyway so there is no perfect location , Everything but especially the great price with breakfast and extra bed for our daughter included Comfy bed good breakfast large and clean bedroom very friendly staff who was extremely efficient in solving small issues we had e g there was initially no extra bed in the room even if we specifically asked for this and the hotel replied with a confirmation beforehand but once notified they solved it quickly calling a taxi I suppose the location is very good if you want to attend a FC Barcelona game 
468060,NH Barcelona Stadium, A kettle in the room would have been nice to make a cup of tea in the morning s, Had to work out there was bacon and egg s for breakfast by asking staff did not talk much in restaurant at breakfast and buffey was ninimal for an Irish Man 
468061,NH Barcelona Stadium, Breakfast only began at 7 00 am and I needed to have an earlier time The sign said that this was possible but the night clerk at the front desk said no , Room was modernized and bed comfortable
468062,NH Barcelona Stadium, Lounge chairs on terrace would be nice, Good service at restaurant Excellent venue for going to game at Camp Nou Taxi readily available in the morning 
468063,NH Barcelona Stadium, Was expensive as it was congress week so to be expected unfortunately Although close to Camp Nou not the prettiest area of Barca and not many restaurants nearby but it s a short taxi into central town Close to the airport though only 15 minutes , Clean modern and quiet Loved the small snack in the room each day fruit ham chocolate etc and the free soft drinks TV with loads of channels including PPV and can switch to English on most Good quiet aircon and excellent wi fi and internet speed Comfortable bed and nice powerful shower 
468064,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, We stayed here as we ve Ben to this hotel before The location is great if you re there for the football and the view from our room overlooked the stadium Breathtaking views at night Staff were lovely Everything was really clean Good sized rooms The bar was a nice friendly place to have a drink and not too pricey either Smashing little hotel 
468065,NH Barcelona Stadium,No Negative, The main reason to go to Barcelona was to take my kids to visit Barca s Camp Nou so the location was perfect We arrived in train and the station is also very near from the hotel Metro station very near as well only three blocks away The hotel is very clean and everything seems to be new Very confortable rooms and huge bathroom 
468066,NH Barcelona Stadium, Staff were not particularly friendly and the twin beds felt more like a double bed , Location was perfect for Camp Nou and the hotel was very clean with good facilities 
468067,NH Barcelona Stadium, 1 Unavailability of hot water to make coffee tea in the room 2 TV Channels not suitable for international travelers 3 Staff in receptions are not helpful They don now anything about other hotels services They are not helping for taxi arrangements 4 Taxis park on the opposite side of the road 5 Breackfast is too expensive, Location
468068,NH Barcelona Stadium, A strange one the pillows were too big woke up with a stiff neck, I went to FC Barcelona match Camp Nou I tell you you cannot get a better location around 60seconds walk from stadium Phemoninal Price for location a bit out of town but my tour picked me up from there no problem nice staff facilities too

468073,NH Barcelona Stadium, Although we paid 70 pounds a night the staff refused to give us a kettle so we could boil water nightly for formula milk for our baby We had to keep going down to the restaurant to get it On our last night the restaurant had closed by the time we got back and the receptionist was reluctant to get up and boil some water for us It would be better if the hotel could employ some more helpful staff , 5 mins to Les Corts metro on foot Clean and comfortable but caters for business people 
468074,NH Barcelona Stadium, Not enough staff covering the terrace bar only one member of staff who not only had to deal with drink orders but had to go and fetch any food orders too, The location was excellent very close to the metro station and reception staff very helpful in giving info on the use if the metro and the best places to eat
468075,NH Barcelona Stadium, waterpool is closed at mornings and late evinging no toilet brush internet wi fi sucks bed is not big for 2 people laundry closed on sunday and requires at least 24 hours to wash anything They require to order something in a bar to be on the terrace 9th floor Gym is closed at mornings and evenings , 1 location 2 mostly clean 3 airconditioner 4 nice view from up levels
468076,NH Barcelona Stadium, The WiFi is very weak it is only remotely usable at the reception With non Spanish speaking kids to entertain at night it means they cant watch movies etc in their own language use their ipads phones etc when they return after a day out As an adult I also needed good WiFi The hotel is in a great location if your going to Barcelona FC stadium Nou Camp but your not going to be doing that every day s u and costs 15 The number 59 bus stops about 200 yards down from the hotel and takes about 25 minutes to get to the beach You buy a 10 trip ticket called a T10 that can be used on the metro also It costs 10 There is a large shopping centre about 15 minutes walk away also , The staff are all very friendly and helpful The roof top pool is great to come back to after a hot day The hotel is very clean The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean Ideal location if going to the Nou Camp Barcelona Football Club
