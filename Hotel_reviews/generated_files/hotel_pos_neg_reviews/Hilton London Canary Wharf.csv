454266,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We thought it a little misleading to say onsite parking when according to the in room information book there are only 25 car spaces available for a 13 floor hotel first come first served We were told the car park was full on our arrival We were directed to an NCP car park 24 for 4 24 hours that was a 12 15 minute walk away That was okay for us as the weather was nice and we don t have mobility problems Tailored more for use with public transport , Room was spacious and clean Staff were friendly and helpful Area was pleasant to stroll around and explore Close to Docklands Light Railway station 
454267,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing actually the 2 night stay was very pleasant, Stayed here previously will be planning on coming back next time in London staff are so accommodating
454268,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Parking limited as you would expect but 24 quid for the night in alternative car park ridiculous It s a short walk through the dock land area Next to Asda so at least you can off set the parking but buying a sensibly priced bottle of wine , Lovely breakfast staff super friendly and extremely helpful As it was I special occasion we were given a free upgrade to executive room 
454269,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Because the DLR runs by the hotel I as a light sleeper found it too noisy and I was on the upper floors I couldn t sleep after the trains started running again in the middle of the night Breakfast staff a bit too eager to clear everything away before you had even finished which was annoying I was ultra tired after no sleep The breakfast itself rather plain for the type brand of hotel nothing special The hotel is a walk 7 8 mins from Canary Wharf and not in a road that has anything much on it in terms of shops or restaurants so you need to be in CW for that Also the restaurant in the hotel closed at 10am early for a Friday night and their room service menu is limited in my opinion , I was upgraded to a Deluxe room nice and big size felt luxurious upper level with views of cranes and buildings nothing special Air con worked a treat The bed was comfy and the large bathroom was nice and clean Good products Staff on reception were great friendly and helpful Jubilee Line from CW is great for getting into town quickly 
454270,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Both hand towels were dirty looked like they had not been changed from previous occupants as make up mascara lipstick etc was still present, Friendly staff Received upgrade of room upon arrival
454271,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Sound from TV piped through to bathroom why would anyone think this was a good idea , Nice clean hotel a touch pricey but was London I suppose Breakfast nice 
454272,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Unfortunately the bed in the room was super uncomfortable it was almost like sleeping on a concrete floor I stayed in the Hilton London Wembley back in 2015 the mattresses there were like a dream they were mattresses you could just sink into when you lay down on them it seems since then all Hilton hotels have changed their mattress supplier I would love to continue staying in Hilton hotels but unless the mattresses change this will not be possible I suffer with bad back problems as it is this only exacerbates the problem I would however like to express highest regards to Chet at the Hilton London Canary Wharf Upon learning of my issue with the mattress in my room he immediately set about rectifying the problem upgrading my room to an executive room giving me exclusive access to the executive lounge which was very much appreciated Chet went above beyond in all honesty deserves a promotion Hold on to this guy he s a keeper , Originally booked a standard room the cleanliness of the room was top standard I would expect nothing less from a Hilton hotel Extremely friendly staff who went above beyond all expectations seeing to my every need Extremely good location within close proximity to Canary Wharf tube station
454273,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bar had run out of some draught beers on a Saturday evening , Spacious rooms excellent breakfast Staff very helpful Location within easy reach of underground stations and shopping centre

454278,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We were celebrating a birthday and a room with a decent view and on a high floor was requested but this request was not met Also most hotels would usually acknowledge if it is a guests birthday or any other special celebration but there was not anything , The location was good Friendly staff 
454279,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The hotel was conveniently located for the Grand Designs exhibition at the Excel centre being just a short ride from Canary Wharf on the DLR The room looked a little worn but we didn t spent a great deal of time in the hotel Expensive for what it was but it did the job 
454280,Hilton London Canary Wharf, On our first morning some guests were allowed to eat breakfast in their pyjamas wearing their bathrobes over as the breakfast is buffet they were able to walk around the restaurant collecting their food We considered this unhygienic and felt that the staff should not have allowed what we consider inappropriate dress , The staff were very helpful and the hotel met all our needs 
454281,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Hilton staff Queried booking did not allow access to rooms for 90 mins while clarifying with bookon com this was an NHS booking staff on desk hot helpful to find a resolution ,No Positive
454282,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We changed room as the suite we were given was way below the standard that is expected for the price that we had paid We were very disappointed We complained straight away and were moved The second suite was a bit better and complimentary bubbles and strawberries were given to us I was shocked at the shabby state of the rooms compared to other high end hotels Vastly over priced Very disappointing , The location and friendly staff

454285,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I liked almost everything Just the view from the window was depressing Construction sites everywhere That s why the hotel is not the best choice for a romantic weekend , The staff was amazing and charming A great feeling that you are welcome which is not so obvious in London I liked also the room and tasty breakfasts And the mini bar prices are wallet friendly 
454286,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing , Great location right in the centre of Canary Wharf and within walking distance of DLR Riverbus Underground and the Canary Wharf shops and close to The O2 and other attractions

454299,Hilton London Canary Wharf, My only minor gripe was that the bed matrasses felt a little tired and hard in the room we were allocated , Stayed again at Hilton again for London marathon weekend after pleasant stay in 2016 This year it was even better from arrival the hotel s staff facilities catering way exceeded our expectations The post marathon invite to a Sunday evening drinks and canap s reception in the executive suite for runners friends and families was a wonderful touch provided by the hotel management on what was for them a very busy weekend The breakfast choice and quality each morning was exceptional 
454300,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bed is uncomfortable It s old and very hard it should be replaced The ventilation is very noisy we had to turn it off during the night Cleaning could be better A comment about the breakfast service the staff works hard but I see a lack of organization The hotel was full during our stay and clearly the breakfast room wasn t large enough We had to wait in line to have a table There is only one island with water and juices and a full tank was emptied in less than 10 minutes There was a continuos shortage of stock of dishes and glasses The servers were running at full speed all the time and in all directions I feel like they were seriously understaffed Everyone had to do everything exemple the person at the reception had to leave a couple of times to serve coffee while people was waiting in line I understand the unusual peak of customers during Easter days but it looked like the management left the usual staff cover all the overcharge This is poor management IMHO they had to enforce the team and the facilities during these days I ve felt bad for the staff they were working way over their capacity The situation was chaotic , This is a business hotel with large room and good breakfast The staff is kind and helpful Located 5 minutes walk from Canary Wharf underground and DLR trains 
454301,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The room wasn t cleaned and refreshed while we were out in the day I had to request this on our return for later in the evening when were were out again , The size of the bedroom quietness initial cleanliness of the room bed comfort location Sufficient efficient and fast lifts 
454302,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Arrogant staff Bad room and furniture design I see designer s thoughts and his failures in everything Actually inconvenience in everything Cleanliness and bed comfort worse than in an average 3 star hotel , Good location 5 mins from both subway and public boat peer Canary Wharf Gym is 24 hours open 
454303,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Just make sure you know where you re going before setting off Not the easiest place to find being out at Canary Wharf but the hotel itself is very nice , Very comfy bed 
454304,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Our room was a little bit dusty and the bathroom wasn t quite right It was a series of little things like no handsoap but multiple shampoos , There was lots of choice of food at the breakfast buffet and it was all good quality 
454305,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Poor air conditioning in the room Complete chaos having breakfast in the restaurant , Good location really friendly staff allowed an early check in

454307,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Can t think of anything we didn t like , Was able to get glutenfree bread very easily in the restaurant for breakfast Excellent breakfast Beds were extremely comfortable Although we didn t need it our room was a disabled room The bathroom was huge with lots of features for the disabled Very quiet no noise from outside Easily accessible to Docklands light Railway 
454308,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Quality of the food Exec Lounge staff were a bit hit and miss some were great others poorly trained and more concerned with their tasks laying tables or clearing up than gues comfort , Ate breakfast in the Executive Lounge it was OK not brilliant but just fine for a business stay
454309,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Fridge was bit dirty and tired looking Throughout the hotel a lot of electric switch covers socket points were all wonky and offset not a massive thing to our overall stay but did expect a hotel of this standard to have a better standard of workmanship, Bed and pillows very comfy Great choice of food at breakfast and all very tasty 
454310,Hilton London Canary Wharf, A little more comfortable seating in bar area , Location comfort helpful staff With Canary Wharf underground Jubilee line close by it provides easy access into central London 
454311,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Not impressed with reception staff and management I booked a twin room and a double for 3 nights My colleague and her father arrived first and were told that they could not check in because I had made the booking My friend had a copy of the reservation emailed from me and her father was the named guest on the booking for the double room Both offered to provide their credit cards to guarantee the rooms but they said it was against their security policy My friend contacted me whilst I was on the train to see if I could do anything as her father a pensioner was very distressed The hotel eventually let them in the rooms When I arrived I asked if I could straighten things up and provide my credit card which I booked it on they said this wasn t necessary now since it was all sorted So whilst I was annoyed that this had happened I decided to let it go However on the 3rd morning whilst my friend and I were out her father was having a rest in his room and he was contacted to say he needed to check out because he was not booked in for a third night Again her father rang us up distressed A nice reception lady did sort this out for him so we didn t need to come back but it should never have happened When I returned that evening I spoke to the manager about the unnecessary distress caused to us all on two occasions He said that it was the hotels security policy to allow only the person that books to check in and the issue with the unwanted checkout was a booking com fault which I doubt since I have not had this issue before He did not take on any blame and did not offer any apology to me I didn t want to distress myself any further so I left it My friends dad pursued further and he offered us a free breakfast next morning I think they took this up but I didn t since I could not stomach any more of the hotel after a bad nights sleep following this altercation , Cleanliness and location good
454312,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing, Everything Proximity to O2 Easy access to DLR or Tube Shopping in the area The breakfast fabulous And the attention of the Staff was outstanding
454313,Hilton London Canary Wharf, the bed was very hard and very low but when I mentioned this to staff when checking out they said that if I had said something on arrival they would have sorted it for me so that is good enough for me, food was outstanding the service was outstanding the location was outstanding in fact the whole package was OUTSTANDING apart from one thing 
454314,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The abruptness of one member of staff which bordered on rude but the concierge was very helpful and friendly Was not pre warned that they needed a 50 per each night we were staying deposit which would be refunded when we left as we had fully paid for the rooms 4 months earlier The bath was very slippery Only one comfortable chair in the room to sit on when there was 2 of us , House keeper very helpful and friendly Rooms were very clean and comfortable Lovely shower Curtains blocked out light completely No noise from outside Lovely waiters and waitresses Quiet hotel with no rowdy clientele 
454315,Hilton London Canary Wharf, WE LIKED EVERYTHING, THE STAFF WHERE EXCELLENT ON ARRIVAL WE WHERE GREETED WITH A BIG SMILE AND HAD OUR ROOM UPGRADED THE ROOM WAS LOVELY VERY CLEAN AND LARGE WE ALSO HAD A BOTTLE OF RED WINE DELIVERED TO OUR ROOM FREE ON THE FIRST NIGHT A NICE TOUCH

454320,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The room was booked for three ladies We only had two cups two wine glasses two glasses in bathroom and two sets of soaps We did mention to reception and the extra glass was added We didn t realise until the morning that the cups tea coffee etc and wash soaps were only for two , Excellent hotel

454325,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Bedroom was very spacious and well furnished The staff were exceptionally happy and helpful Breakfast was also exceedingly good A very good hotel indeed in a great location
454326,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Required to pay 100 deposit on arrival this after the room had already been paid and they had our credit card details The implication is that the guest is a thief who will try to leave without settling his account That leaves a very bad taste from the moment of arrival I ve never encountered such a rule at any hotel I ve visited in the last 40 years and will not be using any Hilton hotel again whilst this offensive policy prevails No facility to make a hot drink in the room Hot water supply to the bath failed on the second night , Very good breakfast Friendly and helpful staff especially in the restaurant and bar Easy to reach from the tube and DLR 
454327,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We had to change our date due to the rescheduling of a concert at the 02 but the hotel would not honour the room rate This meant our evening costed more than we anticipated as the new room rate was considerably higher This will put me off rebooking for future concerts , Staff were very helpful and I enjoyed the casual style of breakfast 
454328,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Asked on arrival 2 30 pm what time breakfast in morning and what time vacate room was tol 11 am breakfast and 12 pm vacate room next morning went to breakfast at 10 30 and was told breakfast ends at 10 am on weekdays by lady waitress and all given was tea coffee and couple pasteries another couple also arrived and was told the same at arrival the man waiter was very apologetic and offer same as ourselves was offered manager of restaurant came over no apologies all he asked was room number we were not happy as was looking forward to your recommended breakfast on departure at checkout the gentleman offered if would like a another coffee which did not please my partner who is a person who needs a breakfast in morning the outcome was the reception staff apologised and did not charge for couple drinks had in mini bar night before they was very pleasant not sure if would stay again hotel very nice but breakfast on overnight stay everybody looks forward to and this did spoil our weekend trip to the 02, The room very nice and bed excellent
454329,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Checking in was really fast Served with complimentary coffee as we arrived very cold and tired Izzy and Andre introduced us to everything and other staff members who all made us feel very welcome

454336,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Perhaps the fittings in the room were a bit dated, Staff very friendly and helpful The room was spacious and very clean and breakfast was excellent We will definitely recommend the hotel
454337,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The only thing I suppose I could say bad about the hotel was the price of drinks from the mini bar in our room were Very Expensive But that s not much of a problem as there is a Tesco Express practically next door , We stayed here as we were seeing a show at the 02 which is just one stop away on the tube Just a 2 minute walk over a footbridge is the Canary Wharf tube station Which is also connected to a shopping centre Breakfast was Lovely The bar area and restaurant also Good 
454338,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing only found bath a bit slippery while having a shower , Very clean and comfortable room staff helpful and happy Excellent breakfast such a choice of wonderful food 
454339,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The customer service was brilliant Room and facilities were excellent Plenty of choice for breakfast Afternoon tea and evening canapes in the exective lounge superb Close to the O2 and some lovely shopping malls on the doorstep 
454340,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Executive lounge looked good but we went at the wrong time really Hardly any sandwiches or cakes for afternoon tea and we weren t late 2 cups left one not very clean and no saucers But as we were nearly finished everything was topped up and refreshed just bad timing , Location was excellent for O2 very near the tube Breakfast was excellent Friendly staff Nice surroundings Good bar meals Rooms excellent with 60 minutes free WiFi

454344,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The view from our window wasn t great I wasn t told about at 50 deposit that they require you to give , Clean easy check in out Good location
454345,Hilton London Canary Wharf, only criticisms would be we wasn t aware prior that we would have to pay a deposit of 50 per night stayed There wasn t any plugs near the bed and didn t have a main light in the bedroom so was quite dark would have liked complementary bottled water in the rooms as you couldn t turn air con off our throats were a bit dry , From arrival we were made to feel so welcome by all the staff check in was very easy and quick Our room was very spacious had everything we needed loved the fact there was a sound system in the bathroom very cool Breakfast was included in our stay and we would highly recommend it it was delicious it was set up like a buffet and it was the best we d ever had any where good quality food and fresh as well Thank you to the Canary Wharf Hilton team we had such a good stay we didn t want to leave 
454346,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Beware that you have to pay a deposit of 50 quid a night while other hotels just hold your credit card liable at this hotel you will actually have to pay that amount say you are staying for 2 nights thats 100 quid you will get back when you checkout I stayed for 4 nights and im not from UK so having 200 pounds just sitting there until my departure wasnt that pleasant , The staff were amazing and not just at the reception Any employee was able to help me with all the questions i could have had Don t expect a lot from the standard rooms not the executive a solid 4 Had everything a person might need but the furniture was a bit worn out not everywhere More than good for a couple of days stay Location was excellent close to the Canary Wharf Jubilee line station plus there are 3 big malls in just 3 minutes walk from the hotel 
454347,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing to comment on , This hotel was picked for its location to O2 So great location for tube and DLR Hotel struck me as very clean and modern As it was just used for the room didn t t spend too much time there so hotel perceived as functional rather than cosy or quaint etc Again for this reason no real comments to make on wifi or other facilities 
454348,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Being chased after by the barman saying we hadn t paid when we had Highly embarrassing The bar area could have been cleaner No parking spaces left Crazily hot in the bar area , The breakfast was nice with a large variety and the bedroom was spacious

454351,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The only problem we had was car parking Had to use an alternative car park which was closed when we went to collect car the next morning However it was fortunately resolved , Everything
454352,Hilton London Canary Wharf, There was nothing that could have been better with the hotel the room the staff or the breakfast I wouldn t hesitate to mention it if there were , The room was spacious and the beds were so comfy you didn t want to get up The bathroom was huge and had a walk in shower and bath The breakfast choices were limitless A huge selection of cooked breakfasts a choice of at least four speciality freshly baked breads muffins bagels croissants pain au raisin almond croissants chocolate croissant twists Bircher porridge fresh fruits I could go on for ever The drinks were the same endless list cranberry juice fruit juices coffee tea sparkling and still mineral waters all in abundance

454368,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Their breakfast offered bad bananas when I were there for the first morning I asked the staff if there are good ones The response I got is good ones are already taken by other guests This kind of service attitude is absolutely not acceptable and do bad to the reputation to the hotel ,No Positive
454369,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The executive lounge was disappointing constant lack of plates and glasses so stood around waiting for ages for a member of staff to unlock a cupboard to get more out this seemed to be the same the last time we stayed to so I m guessing it s an ongoing issue Also food and alcohol was only available from 6pm until 8pm this time rather than until 9pm , Great location and rooms nice and spacious 
454370,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The restaurant food was limited in options and very overpriced the breakfast however was good and the staff had extended the breakfast time to 11 am which was very handy THe pillows could have been more comfortable beware of booking taxi from the hotel cause a luxury taxi will arrive and charge you similar rates so specify that you need a simple taxi unless you prefer only luxury beware and avoid drinks from the mini bar very over priced , A lovely experience of our stay the lobby is nice and welcoming the rooms very spacious ours were on 11th floor so a very picturesque view of love neon skyline and the beautiful canary wharf in fact we could see tower bridge from our room as it was a river view shame we didn t stay for New Year s Eve we could have enjoyed the fireworks from our bedroom window nice and clean as well and comfortable the location is excellent as a short walk on the foot bridge you are right into a wonderful shopping mall through which one can access the jubilee line the check in and check out was easy and straight forward tesco direct just a block away so very handy THe overall feel of relatively new canary wharf was awesome especially the river side good facilities in the room such as iron mini bar beware don t use it very overpriced drinks buy yourself from the next door Tesco express tea making facilities and security box would definitely stay again

454440,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I was not happy about the 50 00 deposit that had to be paid in addition to the hotel bill when I arrived This was unexpected and takes a few days to credit back to your account after check out This should have been made clear on booking , Rooms were clean and comfortable
454441,Hilton London Canary Wharf, My daughter and her friend were not allowed in the room despite me speaking to reception to confirm my payment details as I was going to be delayed in arriving at the hotel They had to go out without changing after a long journey from Somerset When I arrived the extra bed was not in the room so had to wait for the bed to arrive and then housekeeping to make it up Reception staff have definitely read from a script without personality or any empathy We were given complimentary breakfast to compensate not being able to get into the room until late but were going to be charged 11 00 per person for room service which is totally unacceptable when I also had to wait until 9 30pm for the extra bed to be ready Beds were not comfortable at all Would not return to that hotel our experience was not a good one at all , Staff in the bar were genuinely very polite and helpful The room was spacious

454467,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We stayed at the hotel for two nights we spent majority of the Saturday morning and afternoon in the room we left our room for about 5 hours in the evening and expected upon return our room to be cleaned with fresh towels In recent experiences with other hotels it is managed that the room when unoccupied will be cleaned whatever time during the day Unfortunately this one wasn t which actually put us off using the shower on the Sunday morning Yes we could probably of called a number to get this sorted but for a hotel as pricey and with such a name as the Hilton this should be taken care of No complimentary wifi either, Good location and very friendly staff Employee Izzy checked us in and he was very helpful and greeted us with a friendly and welcoming smile He took us up to our room which was very nice of him He asked about what we had planned and have us information on how to get around the area as I was planning on taking my husband out to the o2 for his bday

454474,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Really have to be nit picky but the chair in the room looked very comfortable although it was very much the opposite but very trendy , Our first contact with the hotel was a quick coffee and snack at the cafe bar The member of staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful putting together a quick snack of croissants and coffee After local errands we came back for lunch were met by a different member of staff but received the same excellent customer service The lunch 2 salads was very tasty and well proportioned The double room was a good size and we found the TV speaker in the bathroom quite amusing Bearing in mind the busy location and our room was at the front of the hotel the glazing was very effective and we slept well The buffet breakfast was also excellent with quality items The Nutella muffins were a welcome surprise treat We ll definitely be staying again at our next trip to Canary Wharf 
454475,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Not exactly to do with the hotel but If the hotel parking is full there is an NCP parking lot which is about 10 12 mins walk which is 18 for 4 24 hours If you re just parking and taking public transport everywhere that may be okay but I was driving about and the cost of parking was really high May be being a little fussy here but TV was not Full HD, Very friendly and competant staff Hotel was spotless Gym sauna steam room was excellent Beautiful Location Standard room was really spacious There is a delicatessen next door named Hazev really good

454483,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The lack of a decent early breakfast when I was advised by a manager the day before the Ride London event I was riding that a good breakfast could be brought to my room and I could if wanted even order a hot meal This was not I understand an option and I had to remind reception that at the agreed time of 4 45am I had not received my breakfast which arrived at 5am and was a poor takeaway I had said before that I had to leave by 5 30am for the start of the event Bearing in mind that a large number of other riders were staying at the hotel I paid for a full breakfast for that day and I received no discount On one morning I went to get my hot breakfast and my table was cleared away and it took a few minutes to get my table re laid and a new pot of coffee brought I think the default milk on the table at breakfast for health reasons should be semi skimmed not full fat I had to ask for the lower fat option , The big bedroom and very comfortable bed and the facilities available The parking on site but I think the cost per day is a bit high The helpfulness of the staff in general The good location of the hotel for getting to the West End 
454484,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The hotel took from my credit card double the amount that was needed for my room and they explained that once was for the reservation once the actual payment a crazy explanation The amount was withheld for at least two weeks before being returned Quite an inconvenience to be honest especially since this makes no sense whatsoever to be charged double what you owe ,No Positive

454566,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The lighting for the bedroom was really poor Two girls traveling and trying to put on make up you cannot even tell if you put on too much blush The breakfast was ok The eggs were watery and the ham looked like it was sitting in a bowl of oil The healthy options were basically just fruit Not the worst thing that can be offered Something concerning We saw a guest lost his luggage as he was checking out of the hotel The hotel cameras did not catch anything But he lost his laptop and passport etc That was a bit concerning because his things were inside the hotel He had to stay in there longer until he could go to the embassy on the Monday , The staff was very helpful and welcoming Even during the busy breakfast buffet the staff was still very helpful friendly and always available The location was perfect we could get to everything via the tube There were enough restaurants close by to choose

454572,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Very comfortable beds free fast wifi and very professional staff The breakfast buffet was to die for The hot food was always hot the selection of foods reminded me of a smorgasboard on a cruise ship Smoked salmon and ham off the bone through to a full cooked breakfast or individually made omelettes Fresh fruit and gorgeous pastries rounded things off The location offers fast and easy access to the rest of London via the London Transport network With Canary Wharf and its high class shops near by a great place to stay for a weekend in London 
454573,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Andrea who was working on reception when we arrived was rude patronising and be littling towards me I was appalled at the way he spoke to me and how he dealt with my request He implied my card was going to be declined when he was refunding me I was shocked and disappointed I expected more , the location was ideal and the breakfast was to a very good standard 
454574,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful When we arrived they kindly gave us a upgrade Nothing was too much to ask for and the breakfast the next morning was delightful Anyone going to a concert in the O2 this is ideal as it is one tune stop away 5mins Keep up the good work

454583,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I am not happy with my credit card being asked for as a guarantee and me discovering that it had been used without clicking with me for a payment while I was still booked into my room I was also surprised to be phoned to ask if I was checking out when I was booked in for a further night, Adequate accomodation Check in and out OK
454584,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Poor view from our room back of hotel so no view at all Check in quite slow , Bed really comfortable room clean and warm plenty of refreshments Didn t eat in the hotel so cannot comment Excellent location for O2 arena Not the cheapest hotel I ve stayed in but as it is a high class hotel I feel we had good value for money

454589,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We stayed the night before the London marathon We got conflicting information around what time the roads were actually going to close from reception staff and concierge In addition to absolutely wrong information on what was open and what was not In the end we left at 6 00 am on Sunday morning after a very late night just to ensure we did not get stuck as did not know what to believe Would have appreciated accurate and consistent information, location was perfect for the O2
454590,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Our room key failed on a couple of occasions but it was dealt with fairly swiftly , Staff efficient and pleasant Owing to the hotel being busy we were upgraded to an execuive room which was quiet and comfortable

454592,Hilton London Canary Wharf, If I had to really think of something I didn t like I would just say I would of liked a charge point next to the bed and also free wifi in the room as the hotel itself is not cheap, All the staff we came across were extreamly accommodating making you feel really welcome the minute you enter The hotel itself was lovely Room was a great size especially for a London hotel Breakfast was beautiful a little steep in price though 
454593,Hilton London Canary Wharf, No spare blankets in the room Pillows were a little too soft When switching off the lights in the room there was a ticking sound that persisted , Room was really spacious Amazingly comfortable bed

454599,Hilton London Canary Wharf, None , This hotel is very clean and the room was spacious and spotless We will return again for sure By the way our receptionists Kristen provided us with very helpful travel information and was very attentive 5 stars for Kristen 
454600,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The only bad aspect about this hotel is the view from the room We were greeted by buildings under construction and cranes However this was not a major issue and goes with the location Many hotels in the same area would most likely have the same problem , With the South Quay DLR station less than a minute walk the location is perfect Especially for the O2 Breakfast was lovely with a varied choice One of the best hotel breakfasts I have had 
454601,Hilton London Canary Wharf, As I booked on this site opposed to direct I couldn t claim HH points I found that annoying , Perfect location for requirement to attend the O2 wonderful stay Made a very relaxed weekend Couldn t fault the hotel

454605,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Rooms very clean but oppressive not enough natural light and lighting poor Constant background noise from air con blowers in corridors this bordered on offensive Check in was a shambles Understaffed and staff lacked usual standard Paying for wifi stop it Had to complaim to Duty Manager when young upstart bar man stated no hot drinks Saturday evening Its late A hit and miss hotel At the prices they charge you would expect a more slick setup, Breakfast was good
454606,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Car park was full on arrival but we weren t advised to book parking in advance so had to make several trips to and from the nearest NCP car park , Excellent location 
454607,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Stayed hear whilst visiting a show at the 02 arena it s very handy for the arena as literally one stop in the underground Decor was very nice all round lovely hotel would defanitly stay again

454615,Hilton London Canary Wharf, That the bedroom window couldn t be opened a little Air con on all night is a bit annoying but not a big deal, Nice big clean room with comfortable bed Good range of toiletries and tea coffee facilities and decent hairdryer usually rubbish in hotels Breakfast was really good with lots of choice and staff very attentive Would highly recommend Staff helpful and friendly Great location very easy to get to the o2 arena 
454616,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We had afternoon tea and I just thought the service was a bit slack , The room was lovely and the staff were very friendly Check in was quick and simple 
454617,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing I didn t like so much so I m booked in again next Friday , Friendly staff and treated to complimentary drinks when our room wasn t ready for us had to wait nearly an hour but we didn t mind we were in no rush
454618,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Took 45 minutes to check in because of a simple mistake due to the way the man on reception was trying to authorise my card Made out that It was my fault my card was declining and cost me 45 minutes on the phone to my bank when nothing was wrong and it just had to be put in a chip and pin reader instead of typed into the system Not much sympathy from the guy Just lots of assurance that it wasn t him doing it wrong Not a very nice way to make a customer feel I decided after 45 minutes of the man trying to go to a different person on check in and there Joyce and Mollie were helpful and very friendly and instead it took 30 seconds The girl Mollie seemed to know exactly what she was doing very nice girl and good at her job Lots of hassle when it wasn t needed They should make sure everyone on the check in desks knows what they re doing Also there were 3 of us staying in a family room but we only had 2 dressing gowns 2 slippers and were told the next day at breakfast that there is only 2 guests under our room number Seems to have been a system error that caused a lot of confusion over our stay , The beds were comfy even the pull out bed in our family room The breakfast was nice and the hotel was smart The staff were very helpful and friendly apart from one on arrival which immediately gave us a bad first impression The rooms were very big and soundproof couldn t hear a thing 
454619,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Everything was great Pricey drinks at the bar but that was to be expected , Went to the o2 Hotel was an excellent location for this and so easy to get to from there From check in to check out the staff were friendly and went out of their way to make our stay an enjoyable one 
454620,Hilton London Canary Wharf, As I have a feather allergy need synthetic pillows duvet Quality of pillows was very poor , Excellent breakfast Comfy bed Great local information from concierge Suggest you go to look at the Roof Garden at Crossrail Easy journey to O2 
454621,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bar staff were a little rude well one lady doubting that we were residents there Felt like we weren t good enough to be there , The reception staff were so friendly and very helpful We really enjoyed our stay and it was right near to where we needed to be It was clean and comfortable and we would definitely recommend it 
454622,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I didn t get offered a cup of tea until I had finished my breakfast The interest was awful it kept disconnecting me with every click I did, Nutella Muffins Breakfast was lovely many many options 
454623,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, First impression in the reception is really good due to nice and modern atmosphere staff were very friendly and polite at check in Check in was easy and quick got an upgraded room too with a nice surprise of strawberries in the room with a card saying happy anniversary as me and y boyfriend were having on the day We got a room on the 11th floor spacious modern bath amenities were great big bathroom with a nice big bath
454624,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bed was very hard and the pillows ridiculously flat so unfortunately we didn t sleep terribly well , Breakfast was excellent and our hotel room was spotless 
454625,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The hot plates for the cooked breakfast were stone cold and the cooked food was only warm therefore by the time you got back to the table the food was practically cold A hot plate would have made a difference , Excellent variety of foods available for breakfast Most staff were friendly and helpful 
454626,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Bed could feel the springs in your back Silly price for water in the room Cooked breakfast was no better than a travel lodge to be fair Expected more for the price ,No Positive
454627,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The staff where absolutely excellent polite courteous we even got a good morning from the night porter after his long shift I would highly recommend this hotel The breakfast was divine lots to choose from 
454628,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Maybe a bit more dairy free snack options but made the vegetarian I was traveling with very happy , LURRRVVVEEE the executive lounge They accommodated my special breakfast request quickly and cheerfully 
454629,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Hotel and Rooms were dark with subdued lighting that made it feel gloomy in all areas except Reception and the Restaurant Due to a large function in the Quayside Suite the small car park under the hotel was full and we were advised to use the nearest NCP which was half a mile away This was the only alternative and once I got there I was nervous leaving my car in the car park as it was away from the main South Quay area of Marsh Wall in a less safe area The barriers were also closed but the car park not manned or locked from 10pm to 5am so my car would have been unavailable if a home emergency had arisen in the night It was also the worst hotel breakfast we ve had for a while except for the fruit yoghurt Watered down fruit concentrate weak tea cooked breakfast was manky and barely warm tasteless and unappealing Finally the view from our room window was a building site and internal courtyard hardly stunning , Temperature in the Hotel and rooms was sensibly cool Staff attentive and efficient 
454630,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The hotel was spotlessly clean light and airy and the staff were wonderful Our stay was great The breakfast selection and service was fantastic And my husband had just had a significant birthday so the hitel upgraded our room and had put in a lovely birthday cake and some chocolate dipped strawberries which was a lovely touch 
454631,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Room was a bit warm Had to keep turning down temp Toilet paper holder was irritating Pillow very soft but that was actually preferred over too hard Would love to see outlets near the bed or at least the usb outlets next to the bed instead of across the room at the desk Also would be helpful if we didn t have to sign into the wifi every few hours , Comfortable room with all the mod cons Location was top notch to get to the O2 Arena The room was clean and quiet 
454632,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Was handed our room key after check in then told we could take the lift to our room but not told which floor we would need to take I know it s small matter but felt unsure if this was done due to customers privacy or not also weren t told where breakfast would be taken or what time breakfast was to be held at We had a small issue with the alarm clock being more than 30minuets late but had no way of resetting the time which wasn t a big issue as I just used my phone for an alarm The main desk has a plug socket which I thought was great I could charge my computer as I did bit of work while we were at the hotel but I was worried because as I put my plug into the socket the board felt like it jolted back and had been loosened over time from wear and tear probably due to people trying to charge devices and pulling their plugs out quickly not major issues but just somethings could probably be worked on , All the staff were very kind and polite during our stay which was lovely great comfy bed with lovely pillows Had a great sleep each night 
454633,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Was offered and upgrade cheaper on arrival as the room was free suite was awsome great view on 7th floor We also ate at the resturant and the food was amazing would go back again 
454634,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Absolutely nothing Perfect stay, Excellent service they asked the reason for our trip to Londonwhen we checked in I mentioned we were celebrating my husbands birthday that night When we returned from dinner that night they had placed 2slices of chocolate cake along with strawberries passion fruit and some berries on a platter with a birthday card for my husband in our room What a thoughtful and unexpected touch Top marks to the Hilton for going the extra mile and making our weekend even more special 
454635,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Staff were terrible tried to take over 80 pound of us for no reason then again tried to do same when they corrected the bill saying we owed parking when we had payed very poor,No Positive
454636,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Internet in the room not included only in the Lobby , The size of the Room is generous modern fresh design Bathroom and Room was very clean Comfortable Bed 
454637,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I didn t like the price when I looked to re book for November 439 for one night stay Ridiculous beyond words, The bed was so comfy it was clean and modern I got a deal for 79 including breakfast so this was a good for two people
454638,Hilton London Canary Wharf, My own fault when booking I always include breakfast at the time and for some reason this time must have pressed the wrong button so was not included in the price so had to pay 21 95 each for the two nights we stayed that s nearly 84 00 for breakfast which I find very overpriced even thou it was very nice I will not make the same mistake again, Comfy bed great location for O2 very nice staff great shopping center on doorstep
454639,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Parking space is limited to 30 space only i have a sprain could not find a place to park was not a good value for money for 1 night Not stunning View, i love the location and the service i was given by Billal the manager i arrived late to check in he fully understand the room was clean big and comfortable
454640,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Upgraded to an executive room which included breakfast and access to the executive lounge Worth every penny highly recommended if you get the option 
454641,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I missed slippers in my room not very comfortable to walk around the room in my shoes or barefoot Otherwise everything was just perfect , Room was nice bathroom clean and staff was very friendly rich and tasty breakfast 
454642,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Some staff members made me feel uncomfortable as if we weren t the type of people they wanted staying with them, Large selection for breakfast and the room was huge 
454643,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing Everything was perfect , Booked as a birthday treat for the wife also booked romance package Amazing We will deffo be returning thanks again for all your help
454644,Hilton London Canary Wharf, My coffee at breakfast was left on the table way before I was ready to take it However on my second morning I asked for it to be served later after I had my fruit etc No problem , The room was very comfortable The reception staff were approachable and helpful The bar staff were very pleasant and the food was delicious 
454645,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Bed was a little hard but after all the walking I was knocked out like a light , Large room even after we were given an extra bed for my toddler Staff friendly and accommodating Rail network within walking distance Excellent choice of breakfast especially the vegetarian sausages delicious not to mention the fresh selection of cakes and pastries A truly 5 service 
454646,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The restaurant was busy during the breakfast rush The waitress that showed us to our table was very rushed and didn t take the time to advise us on how the service would work Having to pay for WiFi in the room is very old school , We were upgraded to a Deluxe room and were able to check in early Ideal location for the o2 
454647,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Had some sort of chewing gum by the smoke detector around the sink was dirty by the desk the plasting blue plate was scratched and should of installed lighting in the actual room I know all hotels rooms are not brand new but plug sockets near the bed would of been good , Friendly staff and allowed us to check in slightly earlier
454648,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Would of liked some sort of deal from the cost Maybe a offer next time for us to stay again , very clean and comfortable breakfast a effiencent smooth turnaround plus a wide range of choice of food 
454649,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing to complain about , Lovely hotel couldn t fault it clean and tidy nice comfortable beds and good size room space I also liked there was an ice machine in hall way for guest to use 
454650,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Would have like a little more lighting in the room, Great breakfast choice Very helpful concierge Easy walking distance but a few steps from canary wharf
454651,Hilton London Canary Wharf, No car parking especially for a pregnant woman and being kept up all night by rooms either side of us hosting a bunch of young kids celebrating a 21S so lots of noise especially on our valentines weekend , Hotel was nice so was our room 
454652,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Parking wasn t available so had a ten minute walk each way every time I needed to go out and the reception staff were very friendly but not an enough of them had to wat behind 3 other couples for 25 minutes to check in, Nice and close to the dlr and jubilee line Great if you re going to the O2
454653,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The link from the app to give directions took us to the wrong place so it seemed harder to find than it should have been , Convenient location for an evening at the O2 Large comfortable bedroom and would be happy staying for more than one night in future 
454654,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We forgot our booking confirmation and when looking on the Internet only the Doubletree by Hilton came up We ended up at the wrong hotel Search engine poor , We were upgraded and it made the weekend extra special thank you 
454655,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The room needed to be a little cleaner the comfy chair was dirty There were no bathrobes and on calling down to house keeping as advised they had none either Some of the executive lounge food was poor the afternoon scones were stale and very cheaply made as were the mini cakes at breakfast which are mass produced and made of very cheap ingredients again The room was way too hot the thermostat would not go lower than 18C and you could not open any windows which is such a waste of money The welcome at the reception desk could have been much more friendly , The executive lounge was good the food mostly very pleasant and in the evening the canapes and alcohol sufficient The breakfast was appealing The bed was very comfortable and clean Room service was very prompt The location for the O2 is perfect 
454656,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The alarm clock pre set for 07 45 that didnt stop going off and woke us up Also passed on 21 50 for breakfast per person as daylight robbery , Bed and room very comfortable
454657,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Lovely staff Pre ordered a birthday cake to be in my room on arrival they provided cocktails cake and balloons it was Fab Highly recommend for the 02 arena as it s one tube stop away 
454658,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Extremely disappointed hairs on the bathroom floors and carpets in room were dirty Poor and unprofessional service in reception Will never stay again waste of money and a huge disappointment Not worth the money ,No Positive
454659,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Location is excellent and whilst we chose the location because between Christmas and New year we new it would be still be open without being too busy this unfortunately meant that a number of restaurants and bars were closed over the break We would still book but look further afield to eat and drink 
454660,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The view of our room was not great We were staying just on the same level as the overground train We would have like to be told that before we got the room However during the night we couldn t hear it , We absolutely loved our stay in this hotel Canary Warf is a great place to stay The staff were very friendly and the room comfortable This hotel is just a few mins walk from the underground too which is very useful 
454661,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The exec lounge seemed to have limited choice for refreshments and snacks at teatime and breakfast time , Location was very convenient Very good room service 
454662,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing, Perfect location We rented the room there for our parents when they visited in January Because of the low season we got upgraded to a Deluxe room on Level 8 with a very nice view 
454663,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Staff were rude unattentive and had a not bothered attitude Due to my age being in my early twenties the staff did not give me the same treatment as a family you or older couple Filthy cutlery and hard egg yolk on the table when we were sent our breakfast and extremely rude and unhelpful night staff who refused to help Awful hotel hospitality Will never be staying in a Hilton hotel again ,No Positive
454664,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Excellent facilities would recommend the Breakfast it was beautiful Close to Canary Wharf underground and one stop to the o2 arena which was the reason we went 
454665,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I didnt like that you had to pay for parking Ive never once before had to pay for parking in any hotel and 20 for a night is abit of a con And 20 odd for breakfast i would rather go hungry , The lay out of the room was really nice very clean and i liked how the bathroom had a speaker in it so you could still listen to the radio whilst taking a shower 
454666,Hilton London Canary Wharf, trying to find directions from underground station to hotel was little challenging upon our arrival It was easy after we knew exactly where to go A provided link with clear walking directions from tube and DLR would have been very helpful , Friendly staff downstaris
454667,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Rooms are corporate no individuality but then this is a business hotel rather than a special place to stay , Very comfortable bed and easy short walk to Canary Wharf tube and shops 
454668,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Can t fault any thing , Excellent location right in the Canary Wharf Impressive building staff at reception very efficient during check in and check out 
454669,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I didn t have a bad experience the car park was full so had to park elsewhere I stayed in a Hilton Hotel in Glasgow back in 1994 Comparable to my recent stay at The Hilton it s just not an extra special place hotel to stay anymore The standard of The Hilton now is the same as many hotels it does not distinguish itself above the competition anymore It s always the little things choice of furniture pictures etc etc The 1 s of effort here and there People have an eye for interior design because of the focus on interior design in the home and we can tell when things are little bit below a high standard or quality however people will accept less The Hilton is good not Excellent it used to be , The staff were really friendly informative and cheerful They were absolutely great well trained and attentive 
454670,Hilton London Canary Wharf, No free wifi absolutely unacceptable in this day and age Dirty floor who has carpet anyway gets ruined so easily bathroom felt uncomfortable , Staff super friendly Great location close to DLR and a short walk over South Quay footbridge to Canary Wharf
454671,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I am not sure why many hotels including this one fail to understand the single most important element that makes people go to hotels to get a good night sleep It is impossible to do that if you have a bad bed and or bad pillows I am not sure if it is the room that we got but I could feel the springs in my bones and the pillows were just terrible all 5 of them for a name like Hilton that should be unacceptable so If getting a good night sleep is not important than I think this hotel is probably OK but if like me you care about getting up in the morning feeling like you got some decent sleep then this ppty is not 4u , location is great right next to the DLR and just a few stops from downtown many attractions the staff was simply amazing
454672,Hilton London Canary Wharf, No facility for drying clothes after being caught in downpour Would like notice saying if cold water safe to drink Found hair dryer hard to use as flex quite short , Quietness comfort of rooms Never disturbed by early morning room service plenty of hot water for loads of baths room temp perfect insuring a good night s sleep Fantastic to have use of room till 2 pm
454673,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Great stay on New Year s Eve for a good price Everything was perfect Spotless bedroom comfy large bed and put up bed for daughter Large choice at breakfast brunch which had an extension to midday as it was New Year s Day 
454674,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Our 5 day stay at Hilton hotel was an amazing experience from every aspect The location of the hotel is very close to the tube underground this advantage makes it much easier for visiting both the centre of London the must visit outskirts of the beautiful capital of UK Hilton is definitely a luxury well decorated hotel with spacious rooms modern bathrooms plenty of other amenities The breakfast is also very good The staff and especially Kostas whose excellent professional skills his expertized knowledge of his sector his gentle friendly attitude made our stay an amazing experience A very very very warm thank you Kostas for everything you did to make our vacation unforgettable We will definitely recommend Hilton hotel to all our friends we will definitely come back soon 
454675,Hilton London Canary Wharf, There was no effort made to cater to a request we made before we arrived It was a special occasion so we asked if there was anything they could do We didn t receive a reply and there was no mention of it when we checked in either Staff at check in weren t overly friendly , The room was very nice clean and comfortable Really useful we could leave our bags with the concierge before and after check in 
454676,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The location being so close to the tube station was perfect for our trip and the hotel was very good in every way the staff were very friendly rooms were a nice size and the beds very comfortable 
454677,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Shower facilities weren t giving off hot water So I had to complain I was offered another room to shower in on the same floor Apparently some tube had broken and it would ve taken over an hour for the maintenance staff to fix it I was checking out that morning hence the offer of the use of another empty room s shower facilities A little inconvenient and some sort of offer of a concession by the hotel would ve been nice Ultimately the staff attended to my situation promptly and courteously , Nice large spotless room quiet floor 6th Floor 
454678,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The only thing that could have made it perfect would be if the room had actual lights instead of lamps But te room was still beautiful and you could still see and the lamps gave a nice warm feeling, Te room was prepared very nicely it was welcoming the bed and pillows are very comfortable and te overall hotel was beautiful 
454679,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Cost of in room wifi I have stayed at less up market hotel chains which offer cheap wifi passes or in other cases free wifi throughout the hotel I mean it is 2015 we are living in 15 pounds for 24 hours is pretty ridiculous Also tray charge for room service is disappointing room menu doesn t state that this is a service charge bar and restaurant automatically add 10 service charge so you have to pay tray charge and also feel obligated to tip the person delivering the food , Location is excellent especially for getting to O2 Arena Canary Wharf tube stop is only a few minutes walk from hotel Staff were all very friendly and helpful 
454680,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Not that we were there to watch TV but for an executive room it was tired TV had only 3 channels working and 2 of those had poor reception I complained and reception said they would send someone but it did not rectify the problem , Location was good
454681,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, greeted with a smile very quick check in very helpful with directions to the O2 All staff were polite and cheerful the breakfast was superb with everything you can think of to eat We were upgraded to a superior room which was spacious spotless and very comfortable It was a lovely gesture and made our stay even more special
454682,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Car parking was a disappointment They should make it clear that there are limited parking facilities The car park recommend is some distance from the hotel and costs 16 00 per day Therefore I had to pay 32 00 for my 2 night break instead of the 20 00 advertised by the hotel , Staff and service were excellent
454683,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bed seemed a little noisy , The quality and standard of accommodation was most enjoyable and the location was excellent for tube access for the O2 and central London 
454684,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Failure to service the room from our 1st night when we returned to the room by 16 00 hrs We were compensated for their omission , The room was quiet ie no evening noise Good breakfast facility staff quick and professional 
454685,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing, The receptionist was very friendly We were upgraded to a executive room free of charge The room was excellent the bed was huge and the view from our window was great The concierge was very helpful and explained how to get to the O2 and back again 
454686,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The room was a good size and really clean Was very surprised to find out an ironing board and an iron The breakfast was excellent Plenty of food friendly staff 
454687,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Not in central London so difficult to return to the hotel if you want to change for the evening etc but we were aware of this when we booked the hotel , good friendly staff good location for the tube station with a shopping centre next to the station
454688,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Booking com didn t inform the Hilton we upgraded and although they tried to help us I m not convinced we received an upgraded room it was very basic and disappointing and I would like a refund for the upgrade , The staff were very good
454689,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Room service menu after 11 could have a few more options on as was quite basic, Gteat location for events at o2 arena without being too far away Hotel have their own private taxis which is fab Breakfast was great room service was good
454690,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Great room well prepared for family of four Friendly staff Access to executive lounge a real plus with a wonderful view over city Evening meal in hotel restaurant was excellent Overall a perfect stay Short trip in hotel cab to Excel next day which was purpose of our visit

454692,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Beautifully presented room fabulous bathroom loads of leg room as well Room service was spot on a slight slip up from the young boy serving my boyfriend and I but everything was very quickly resolved Overall a lovely place reception was very helpful and explained all facilities very well

454694,Hilton London Canary Wharf, If you walk away from the wharf into millwall can get very dangerous to a non local very quickly I am a HHonours member a was little dissapointed with room view i was given, Excellent rail links 5 minute walk to Canary Wharf tube which can take you to centeral London or direct to the Olympic Park Stratford Checked in at 11 which was a bonus staff very accomodating and the bar staff are very friendly Also keep an eye out for sales can be very cheap for a Hilton in London
454695,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Rude unhelpful staff I am in a wheelchair and the staff were not accomodating at all The bathroom stunk of smoke and the staff wouldn t allow me to us the onsite wheelchair when mine broke , Good location comfy bed 
454696,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Breakfast was impressive but cooked food wasn t hot We did tell a waiter who said he would pass on to the kitchen Think the food needed covering as the hot lights obviously weren t hot enough to keep the food hot It was a shame but it won t stop me staying again as the rest was perfect ,No Positive
454697,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We can t fault anything for our stay Oh only that when the room was topped up with milk coffee etc there was no traditional tea bags left only the flavoured ones but we just had coffee instead so not a major issue , We got an awesome price for our two night stay a real bargain it was so close to the o2 which we wanted as we had an event to go to so very happy The breakfast was excellent too 
454698,Hilton London Canary Wharf, nothing really coffee wasnt that great, Really handy location for Canary wharf Upgrade to a very large room was an unexpected bonus friendly helpful staff

454701,Hilton London Canary Wharf, A bit skimpy on the toiletries Coffee at breakfast was luke warm plates not very warm at breakfast , Liked having the use of a bath Plenty of space in room 
454702,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Had no hot water on first morning Quickly sorted by staff and Hilton gave free breakfasts for whole family to compensate so very happy about that , great location for the O2
454703,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The only problem we experienced was the small milk pots in the room had gone off and left flakes in the tea , Beautiful room helpful staff and good food 
454704,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Not 300 metres from Canary Whart tube No free wifi in public area 12 99 charge for wifi use in room Most other hotel chains offer free wifi or nominal charge not this rip off charge , Clean room excellent staff good breakfast 
454705,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Very welcoming and helpful staff Arrived early and we got the room well before the checkin time which was great Good location for O2 and tube station Breakfast excellent choice 
454706,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The fact that i could not pay my account in US for some very strange reason , Return Stay I was attending a conference at Excel the location is close by but also located in Canary Wharf so there is plenty to do and close enough to go to the west end The Executive lounge service was exceptional
454707,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Only small negative comment Tea at breakfast not very hot but very quickly rectified The waitress went to the bar area to get 2 fresh pots Excellent service , We arrived around lunchtime Check in was extremely quick as our room wasn t ready we were upgraded to an executive room The room was very comfortable with a huge bed very clean modern bathroom Breakfast was one of the best we have experienced We booked this hotel because it was close to the O2 Arena very easy to get to from South Quay on the DLR Would definitely stay here again 
454708,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Every member of staff that we came into contact with was very helpful friendly and professional We ate in the bar quite late and the food was very good The breakfast was excellent 
454709,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing we encountered in 3 nights , We took advantage of special bargain rates at a luxury hotel Helpful staff and clean rooms Good value restaurant for menu range Easy 4 minute walk to one of the Canary Wharf Shopping Centres Weekend of Lord Mayors Show excellent 
454710,Hilton London Canary Wharf, paid a lot of money and breakfast was not included it was an extra 20 for full English and 12 for normal breakfast some mix up with the booking i guess , front desk staff were very welcoming
454711,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Nothing all good, Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent choice of breakfast Comfortable and spacious bedroom shower and bed extremely enjoyable Parking the car was easy and fantastic choice of restaurants close by also huge shopping centre at rear Everything you need really very impressed 
454712,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We didn t like having to leave the bed behind , The staff were really polite friendly and helpful The bed was 10 out of 10 for comfort we also received a more than generous upgrade after being allocated a smoking room by mistake 
454713,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Dirty rooms there were used contact lenses on the floor by my bed I mentioned it when I checked out and although they were apologetic I was disappointed by the low standard, Lovely receptionist
454714,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Directions from Tube on hotel website says to head for the glass building which must be a joke as every single building surrounding the tube is glass , Very convenient for the 02 Breakfast very nice Room modern clean and quiet
454715,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Reception staff poor had to wait in queue to be checked in only one staff on front desk no apology Disorganised staff first morning at breakfast Could also here train early morning although on 4th floor and at back of hotel, Breakfast buffet excellent choice Comfort of room very good Near to underground location good
454716,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Bit pricey in comparison with a premier inn etc which we stayed in the night before and was every bit as good if not better but less than half the money , Good location near to local transport etc nice room clean tidy and spacious 
454717,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Difficult to spot the Hilton sign from the road and ended up in the wrong hotel car park just before the Hilton The car parking for one night at 20 I felt was rather extortionate The bathroom was a little bit grubby and the extractor didn t work The layout was poor with the toilet behind the door and the flusher behind the toilet seat also there wasn t enough toilet roll The view from our window was of scaffolding and not very nice Would have asked for another room but couldn t be bothered moving everything The breakfast for 12 75 per persons was far too much considering the quality of the food which was very dry and didn t taste of much rather disappointing , The facilities and the bar area was very pleasant and the room was quite comfortable The location near the Quay was beautiful and it was reasonably close to the O2 area which we were visiting 
454718,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Room was a little stuffy which I guess happens a lot these days with hotels not having any opening windows to get fresh air in Breakfast was rather tasteless particularly the scrambled egg Again typical of bulk produced food but the choice was good and staff friendly , Nice size room and comfortable room 
454719,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Such a clean and smart hotel and every member of staff was very friendly and served with a happy face Nothing was too much trouble and they all gave the feeling that they were happy to work there

454722,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Around the building there are lots of building works not a great sight , The room was very clean and comfortable The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice 
454723,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We were in room 419 and the view wasn t good scaffolding from building work next to it also this made the room a little enclosed and dark, The hotel room was large and very clean
454724,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, The staff on reception were excellent very helpful and pleasent as was the valet Room was very clean and a good size larger then the normal size of hotel room 
454725,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Gorgeous hotel with really friendly staff the room was fantastic and had a great view of London 15 minutes on the tube from the centre of London and a 5 minute walk to the tube station Very cheap for the quality of hotel and location We got upgraded to a deluxe room for free to celebrate a birthday too Definitely stay there again 
454726,Hilton London Canary Wharf, No smoking balconys had to keep going out of the front of the hotel for a cigarette Had to pay extra to watch movies on you re tv The shower wasn t a power shower it had no power felt like an elderly shower no pressure Feels like you pay extra for the name , Rooms were big and spacious clean and comfy Nice gym area Polite staff and overall a good experance

454729,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, From the second we arrived the staff made us so welcome even upgrading our room due to it being our anniversary rose pettels and chocolate dipped strawberries awaited us 
454730,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The room was large enough to accommodate a king size bed which would have been lovely It would have been nice to have been told by reception which direction the underground was we spent quite a lot on unnecessary taxis until we discovered where the tube station was , A lovely spacious clean room Very helpful staff Close to the the underground see comment opposite We were going to a concert at the O2 Arena which was only one stop away on the tube 
454731,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Only thing we thought was bad was 5 50 for a bottle of water was WAY over priced Other than that no complaints at all , Loved everything Location room size room decor bed was comfy bathroom was beautiful and clean lifts were quick breakfast was good check in was quick staff were lovely 
454732,Hilton London Canary Wharf, view from room not good of brick wall carpets in room stained I did expect London prices for room but no free Wi Fi and 2 for a snicker was a bit much even for London , Excellent location for Canary Wharf and O2 Staff all polite and helpful Lots of choice for breakfast 
454733,Hilton London Canary Wharf, I was surprised to find charges for the minibar which I hadn t used on my bill However the receptionist removed these immediately without question, Felt safe as a single traveller close to underground with very pleasant and helpful staff 
454734,Hilton London Canary Wharf, ended up arguing with front reception because we had already thrown away our booking slip after we had stayed there They were adamant that I hadn t added the breakfast and wanted to charge an extra 42 on top They had no record of our booking we got the address wrong too but we know where we live right This was the day after our wedding and it genuinely wasn t the way I would treat someone if I was on reception She finally relented after she could probably see a queue forming as she made me go through all my emails on my iPhone to try and find the booking confirmation and decided to change it Not very impressive , The proximity to a party at Plateau restaurant
454735,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Our room wasn t ready until 16 20 and we had a meal booked at 5 so it was a quick in freshen up and out as we were straight on to the O2 , Executive Lounge 
454736,Hilton London Canary Wharf, couldn t order room service as had pre paid for room 214 seemed silly salami on exec lounge cut far too thick to eat , easy check in and check out
454737,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The unpleasant ozone smelll in the room at the beginning however the AC sucks in and leaves fresh air Also there was no signs for car park so I had to go reception first for help The only water bottle was 10 and other snacks and drinks in the fridge are not complimentary , i loved the room spacious clean and modern I can watch latest movies and other kinds of entertainment however had to pay for it I also enjoyed my work out in the 24hrgym They have steam and sauna 
454738,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Following two nights of blissful sleep I awakened on the third morning at 4 10 am to the noise of scratching and fiddling at my bedroom door This went on a while which bewildered me but I was ok and tried to go back to sleep Then I really woke up when I heard my locked door closing and it terrified me It transpired that it was my Express CheckOut form being delivered and I can only assume whoever was delivering it simply couldn t get it underneath my door all the scratching about and had quickly opened ians closed the door to get it through easier As a lone female sleeping on top of the bed I didn t realis this and was really scared It took me a while to calm down and get back to sleep I would have rung reception to complain but needed to sleep as I was driving home that morning and so needed to relax On leaving I informed reception of my horror and dismay that this had happened and was told they would take me off Express Checkout at all their hotels so it couldn t happen again That felt like a punishment as opposed to a real apology and has actually made me reconsider staying at a Hilton in the future as I felt as though the implication was that no one else would have been worried about their door suddenly opening Totally missing the point that not only had my sleep been disturbed I then had to really work at calming down and not letting my fears run away with me It must have taken me a good ten minutes to work out why it might have happened as my initial reaction had been real fear followed by checking whether my belongings had been disturbed etc as I was half asleep and couldn t quite comprehend why my door had opened and or whether anyone had actually been in my room In the cold light of day I could tell that no one had entered but at that time I had no idea I didn t get back to sleep for well over an hour later and had to read to take my mind off how vulnerable I now felt , The location is excellent as was the room and breakfast Staff were courteous and friendly Bed and pillows so very comfortable Cleanliness couldn t be faulted 
454739,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Bed mattress was too soft and of poor quality Deluxe Double Room is advertised as having a range of exclusive bathroom products but all we found was a couple of shower gels a soap and a bath cream Photos of this rook show a sofa but our room did not have one WiFi is only free at public areas 15 per day if used in room , Location room size quality of food at restaurant check out time 
454740,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Could do with bigger beds in the standard double The rooms are so big it would be nice to have a little bigger bed, Location great choice at breakfast never waited too long for a lift

454746,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Based on its location I was expecting more in terms of room size facilities and breakfast Compared with Hilton park lane this Hilton is probably not value for money location, General cleanliness of hotel was good Location was close to Canary Wharf

454749,Hilton London Canary Wharf, Only one person at a time could use the Wi Fi which was a bit annoying But this is a pretty minor point , The room a junior suite was decent value for money and the room service food was surprisingly good the breakfast in particular Staff were very friendly and helpful 
454750,Hilton London Canary Wharf, We are a mature couple and we shall not be returning to the Hilton at Canary Wharf The bathroom had a nice bath but I could not get out of it there was no help rails to assist me It is obvious that older people need to use help rails to exit baths I felt very embarrassed and for this reason my wife and I shall not be using your hotel again , The location was good but for the reasons mentioned in What didn t you like we shall not be returning 
454751,Hilton London Canary Wharf,No Negative, Lovely room good location for O2 one stop on the tube to North Greenwich very nice breakfast Overall a very enjoyable stay Would definitely stay there again

454753,Hilton London Canary Wharf, It was a bit too cold in the public areas AC could have been turned down , The staff were fantastic I really have to praise the restaurant staff for responding to quickly and effectively to a comment I made after my meal in the restaurant I happened to say that I felt the cost of the chicken supreme was out of proportion to the size of the portion I was not expecting anything to be done as it is a London hotel and therefore I expect prices to be high However I was pleasantly surprised when a waiter brought a complimentary desert to me as I sat in the lounge later on Then the resturant manager I think or perhaps the duty manager came over to explain that he had read my comment card and wanted to make up for the small portion hence the desert That was good enough in terms of service recovery but it got better because when I checked out the whole meal had been taken off my bill Really above and beyond what I expected but very much appreciated So I would happily return to the hotel because I feel I can trust them do what they can to make me feel valued 
454754,Hilton London Canary Wharf, The bed was too soft for me and the pillows too soft , The general state of the hotel was impeccable the staff exemplary and it just had a very good friendly vibe about it all
