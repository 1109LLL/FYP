36646,The Athenaeum, Beds bathroom counter storage space Door did not always close properly We came back to our room one day after maid service and the door was not fully closed and not locked , The shower was the best I ve ever experienced in a hotel superb water pressure and temperature High quality towels Very minimal counter space in bathroom though Although the hotel boasts about it s beds I was not overly impressed with ours Good but not great Overall experience very good Very nice cafes in Shepherd Market area which is only a few blocks away 
36647,The Athenaeum, Waited for a long time outside to get a drink when we arrived The waiter kept walking past us looking stressed so went inside to the bar in the end , The bar was lovely and very friendly staff We were upgraded to a Deluxe room which is was very nice and comfortable The location was brilliant for us as we were at BST in Hyde Park The doormen were very
36648,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Beds were very comfortable after long plane flight Lovely accomodations Staff eager to please except for one grumpy lady at the bar who wasn t friendly Appreciated them seeing to our needs quickly for taxis anything else we needed Very quiet room facing away from street Could use some instructions on how to use the shower MUCH better instructions on using the Nesso machine 
36649,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Breakfast in bed was fabulous All staff were very helpful and professional at all times Immaculate bathrooms with luxurious products and super comfy beds all in all a great hotel 
36650,The Athenaeum, I reserved a room in the hotel and they give me a small room in the resedent when I asked them to change they said there is no room available and they promised to change next day but they didn t, Only location
36651,The Athenaeum, I would have liked a walk in shower, A warm welcome Efficient check in Wonderfull park view from the bedroom Lovely bar with a very wide varied drinks list Excellent Restaurant with wonderful food The best breakfast ever with a huge choice catering for all tastes Friendly helpfull staff in every area of the Hotel In a very good location
36652,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Excellent service as usual Warm welcome and friendly conversation as we were taken to our residence The apartment was spacious with luxurious linens very clean and there were good facilities in the room full kitchen including washer dryer Fantastic location for a walk through Hyde Park places to eat and drink 
36653,The Athenaeum, There was no microwave oven in the kitchen but otherwise it was very well equipped And there was no access to the apartments without some steps difficult with a pram though staff was very helpful carrying the pram in stairs , The apartment was an excellent stay for our family with two small children The staff went to great lengths to make sure we had everything necessary for a perfect stay and we were provided with high chairs toys cartoons and even complimentary milk for our children The breakfast buffet was excellent as well and room service from the same restaurant was great We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will certainly be back 
36654,The Athenaeum, The walls were so thin that I could hear everything that was happening next store like drawers opening and closing Fortunately I was at the end of the hall so I only had one room next to me Also the light fixtures and decor in my room felt dated The switch for the lights was by the room not by the bed And it took me a while to figure out why the room was so cold the master switch turn off the lights but on the AC Strange Not a bad stay but a bit lacking for a boutique hotel , Nice ambiance very friendly staff 
36655,The Athenaeum, Cost was a bit too expensive for the standard of hotel Was in Mayfair though , Didn t have breakfast Very quiet room upgraded wee birthday cake as a surprise Lovely staff fab cocktails 
36656,The Athenaeum, Our room was a bit noise noise coming from the AC system and the temperature regulation did not seem to work very well as it was always a bit cold inside the room It s a fine hotel in a fine location but its price level is also on the high end side , Excellent location for this hotel in a relatively quiet area just in front of Green Park but within walking distance of most of the main attractions in London Rooms are large enough very modern and comfortable and fully equipped Staff was friendly and helpful Good breakfast especially the British Breakfast 
36657,The Athenaeum, Our bathroom smelled liked cigarette smoke the entire time we were there , I liked having a side entrance and not having to use the lobby The elevators are very small 
36658,The Athenaeum, Reception check in not efficient, Location convenient to business venue En suite calm lighting Shower spacious water power Homelywith fluffy bathrobes
36659,The Athenaeum, Staff were not friendly and completely ignored us when trying to check in The check in process was a shambles they couldn t find our booking and the first member of staff that served us just walked off and left us waiting for over 20 minutes very unprofessional We were also charged 1000 pounds deposit for having our dog stay 1 night which is ridiculous surely just a money making scheme , Well equipped but small room 
36660,The Athenaeum, the lounge is a bit cramped for space, we got an upgrade after we had expressed some disappointment about our room the entire matter was very professionally resolved with a smile by the duty manager Very friendly staff and concierges Very comfortable suite 
36661,The Athenaeum, I had to check out early due to a family issue I didn t like how I was quizzed on why I was checking out so early by one of the reception staff, Good location Excellent room and good services
36662,The Athenaeum, Last time we visited the contents of the mini bar snacks etc were included in the price of the room It s a shame that this has changed and is no longer included as it was a real differentiator Also 250 a night is a lot to not include Breakfast , Excellent staff in every department
36663,The Athenaeum, Nothing to dislike Very very good , Very good location at Hyde Park Very cozy non corporate style club like Excellent all round Also has use of car park just behind which is fabulously convenient with 24 7 attendant 
36664,The Athenaeum, the staff never smile it didn t make me comfortable at all The bathrooms were very cold had 2 ask the staff to bring me heating System Electricity socket wasn t working, The location is amazing the flat I was in was very good 
36665,The Athenaeum, The place was filthy dirty ceiling was ripped When we checked in and saw we asked to check out and for a refund they refused and insisted they charge for 3 nights a manager on duty called Jamal the worst hotelier we have ever seen He was so disrespectful and laughed at what we said when we were complaining about the cleanliness Made us feel very uncomfortable as guests and he was so rude ,No Positive
36666,The Athenaeum, Only minor details was not a fan of the cedarwood scented bath products and the fancy stone flooring in the bathroom meant the toilet seat was freezing , Wonderful room cosy nice bathroom and bathtub nespresso machine great location within walking distance of Buckingham Palace Big Ben and the Westminster area 
36667,The Athenaeum, We stayed in an apartment which only had internal access to the main hotel via a staff service corridor not what I expected The living area was nice if a little dark The bathroom was tiny and cold The bedroom stank of cigarette smoke because HOTEL STAFF WERE SMOKING directly underneath our window all night the window didn t seal properly So disgusted we left after one night , Good location
36668,The Athenaeum,No Negative, It s a very nice and cozy boutique hotel in central London with fantastic location and view It s only 5min walk to the Green Park Underground Station and easy access to most attractions So ideal for travellers It s also a very romantic place with nice Green Park view if you prefer quietness you could request for rooms not facing the main road so good choice for couples who would like to celebrate special occasions or just to have a weekend out It s a bit expensive at full price but we booked at 40 discount so feel much more value of money Would definitely recommend it to young couples or families if you are not constrained by budget 
36669,The Athenaeum, I stayed in the residence part not what I booked I felt a little exiled from the hotel and in order to get to and from the main lobby I had to use an underground tunnel that is meant for staff It ruined the effect and made me feel like I was trespassing , The rooms are big and spacious and bed was so comfy 
36670,The Athenaeum, Check in was poor With the refurbishment they seem to have done away with a reception desk and staff meet you with an iPad rather like visiting an Apple Store It doesn t work maybe in theory but not practice Leaving guests with bags in a busy area feeling a bit abandoned Maybe this is a new way of doing things but in an established five star property it not expected it wasn t quicker and it wasn t welcoming The restaurant was very busy with a great atmosphere and staff were efficient The food wasn t as good as expected however maybe it was just our choices The chips were amazing though , Always our favourite London hotel All the reception floor frontage recently refurbished and very smart with plush new furnishings The bar is fabulous the staff cocktails were great fun All the staff especially the doormen were friendly welcoming as always Room was clean and smart although small never not had a park view before would say they are definitely worth paying extra for We missed that Location is perfect within walking distance of most London spots and close to tube station Perfect for shopping 
36671,The Athenaeum, Not convinced enough that the hotel is 5 stars the lobby lounge is the actual lobby of the hotel with no reception when entering the hotel there is no specious area reflecting that your entering a 5 stars hotel everything is cozy and next each other The hotel suffers from employees shortage during the night shift as I noticed in general their No is not too many I booked superior rooms but in reality it has nothing related to the represented pictures on web that was a shock to me in the beginning I have been provided with rooms outside the main building which was not stated clear in the web about it the that didn t let me feel comfort safe money worthy enough till I have been moved to the main building Moreover the connected building needs a true renovations the management has to give extra attention to it Superior rooms are not recommended to stay in they are too small as well as their bathrooms they are in a bad shape in the connected building , The hotel concept is more into modernity the staff has nice attitude willing to help I have to thank the management of understanding my needs trying to meet my expectations giving me an upgrade to Deluxe category to one of my rooms Very good housekeeping services 
36672,The Athenaeum, Yes I m perhaps a traditionalist but it lacked a focal point on arrival i e No reception Standing about in a small lobby being checked in on an iPad is not my idea of a welcome Breakfast is really good quality but fairly expensive , Very spacious and comfortable room Loved design features very nice bar and restaurant area great location great staff Very good food quality 
36673,The Athenaeum, First of all the apartments were basically student living and had nothing to do with luxury Everything was outdated and the bathrooms were tiny and weren t cleaned properly A housekeeping member forced her way into my room and told us she needed to clean the room so that she can finish her shift early while I was sleeping The food is something shocking for a hotel to serve me a raw burger patty and think that it was acceptable actually its illegal in the United Kingdom All I can say is you re better off staying at the Rosewood Hotel ,No Positive
36674,The Athenaeum, It wasn t clear in the room breakfast menus that you couldn t order a omellette by itself downstairs in restaurant without paying 27 Plus service charge, Bed was comfy and enjoyed the pillow menu ha
36675,The Athenaeum, I miss the foliage all out the front Bar staff seemed pretty depressed D, This is my Fave central london hotel Staff are awesome its my second favourite afternoon tea sorry the dorchester just pips you but costs more its just lovely I actually had never heard of this hotel until someone I know cant say who mystery shopped it years ago and they aced everything Glad to say every subsequent stay has been lovely The staff are friendly efficient and un pretentious which is amazing for a piccadilly hotel I m sorry but over the top airs and graces are just not my thing Its not the 80 s anymore The bar has now moved but I like the switch its intimate with good surroundings and the prices aren t excessive either for the location I didn t give the facilities 100 purely because post refurb I didn t use them all as we had a complimentary room upgrade which I wanted to make the most of So I cant comment fully One of my favourite things and I travel a lot for work being a musician is the fact that when asked if I would like my bags taken to the room and I said no its cool as I had a small case there wasn t that awkwardness This happens in so many hotels and it really annoys me They have ESPA toiletries which are my fave I don t live in london anymore but not far out so never really need to stay but as a treat this is the place I was working in Mayfair that evening and thought why not Brilliant hotel 
36676,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Lovely hotel in a great location and brilliantly attentive staff and no complaints at all just an opinion that the room we had really didn t justify its price but that did not spoil our stay stayed in a hotel the night before for a third of the price that the room was amazing just a comment most certainly not a complaint and would stay again 
36677,The Athenaeum, Just one thing but it s a common thing in England no flexible hose for the shower, Staff is very nice and helpfull Beds are supercomfortable Very Quiet rooms Rather big rooms for London hotels
36678,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Absolutely lovely staff The hotel is beautiful and both me and my partner would highly recommend the restaurant The room was light and comfortable we will definitely choose this hotel again in the future 
36679,The Athenaeum, The staff are friendly but the service isn t as seamless as you d expect no major mishaps but a few minor lapses The bathroom was mainly lovely but needs a little TLC the grout is going mouldy over the bath and the bath had a rust stain , Comfortable bedroom with glorious view Stylish hotel interior and the new bar is atmospheric excellent cocktails Breakfast is superb 
36680,The Athenaeum, Nothing I just wish we could of stayed another night , The welcome we had was superb the room we had was superb the whole experience was outstanding I would definitely recommend this hotel 
36681,The Athenaeum, Porter is fine Other staff is just so so When your hands are full they saw you but nobody help you to press the lift button And the room card does not work for the lift on the righthand side , location is perfect Room bigger than expectation bathroom is fine 
36682,The Athenaeum, Took nearly two hours to wait for one of the rooms for our group We checked in at 2pm and didn t have the room until 4 we had to cancel a reservation we had elsewhere whilst waiting for this room and were there to celebrate an anniversary so this was extremely frustrating Staff were uncoordinated and slightly arrogant to our situation not something I would have expected from one of London s top 5 star hotels , Bed was super comfy location was great and a nice breakfast 
36683,The Athenaeum, Air conditioning was very poor Heated towel rail and heated mirror in bathroom made the room almost sauna like , Clean comfy bed private room location
36684,The Athenaeum, That I was paying for a 5 and had incoveniences u would meet in a 2 hotel , Their mentenance service is next to 0 2 nights we were without A C the lights were not functioning frm the side table monitor Security serveyance not on 24 hr for a 5 hotel Things were lost and if not for my persistence they wouldn t be found frm the lobby 
36685,The Athenaeum, I m speechless Nothing , They cared for every little detail about my kids They were friendly and professional They joked with us and with our kids Every evening there was a surprise for us and our kids I would like to thank everyone from the doorman to the manager Wonderful family experience 
36686,The Athenaeum, arrived at 1 15pm and registered and left bags as room was not ready came back at 4 30pm and told that our room was still not ready and would be another 20 30 minutes ,No Positive
36687,The Athenaeum, first morning of breakfast a smartly dressed lady with shoulder length hair showed us to our table and just left us there we didnt know if we helped ourselves to things like juices or even if they were included in our rate etc I had to get up and go find someone to ask no vegan or vegetarian breakfast options even though we paid for full breakfasts I was offered a hash brown to be made which I accepted then upon checking out the hotel attempted to charge us extra for it thankfully Michael who checked us out spotted the mistake and removed the charges our room was very small and needed a freshen up old yellowing grout in bathroom along with old tatty bath mat picture placed on top of the dressing table mirror very inconvenient we couldn t really find anything superior about the room Iron was dirty and marked my cream top which I m hoping will wash out requested a mocha which is a very common coffee and was twice brought a black coffee Was also confused by the breakfasts being brought out on a tray or left at the juice table by one waiter then served by another , We enjoyed the central location it was so close to everything we wanted to see We had a lovely waitress with short curly naturally greying hair who could not have been more helpful went out of her way to find me something hot and cooked that was vege and wasn t a mushroom or cheese 
36688,The Athenaeum, Occupants in rooms next door arriving in early hours slamming doors at 3 4 AM and smoking outside the bedroom window , Staff were so helpful Cheery and accommodating
36689,The Athenaeum, Reception desk has been taken away which makes checking in and out a little Messy , Very friendly staff Good sized rooms Great Location Doorman particularly good 
36690,The Athenaeum, NOTHING , This is our favourite home from home place to stay our recent visit did not disappoint lovely staff great service and the apartment is exactly what we expected beds amazing we will see you all soon 
36691,The Athenaeum, Breakfast did not appreciate the cost of what was being ordered 145 was outrageous for breakfast , Service outstanding clean new facilities Breakfast food excellent 
36692,The Athenaeum, The hotel staff were very poor A very important letter was received on my behalf and I never got it They denied receiving it until registered mail showed who received it I reported and I was promised a phone call Nobody ever called me back i will never stay there again horrible experience when i checked in I was put into the most horrible of hotel rooms ever After I complained i was moved immediately but i never recovered from the shock of the first room It left a bad taste in the mouth,No Positive
36693,The Athenaeum, Self service hot breakfast previously cooked to order and served to table Assumed gratuities, Friendly Service from regular team we have seen through many previous visits
36694,The Athenaeum, Not really an issue but no information when we booked that there is extensive refurbishment being carried out in the hotel and therefore the ground floor dining rooms and bars were out of service, Excellent accommodation and great room facilities very comfortable
36695,The Athenaeum, Noisy staff the room is small than expected and the money spent on the room isn t worth it could have booked two rooms in another near by hotel for the same price , The location
36696,The Athenaeum,No Negative, We liked the extra attention we received from the staff on my wife s birthday We got a cake and a nice card We have been there a few years ago when there where no construction works going on the lobby was very nice and unique This time the construction was going on so we had to get in from a side entrance Although without having a proper lobby the staff did a great job of receiving us every time we cam back to the hotel great work everyone 
36697,The Athenaeum, Housekeeping did a very bad job The bed skirt needed lots of therapy Carpets were not clean Beds were never turned There was no that feeling of cleanliness each time housekeeping came One housekeeper came to lecture us that we were staying too long in our room and that she needed to go and do her job on a different floor At the bar upstairs we were served instant coffee and a cup was dirty had to return One of the three members of staff at the bar had torn pants and the tear was near his butt That was not a new tear the pant has simply not been upgraded It was a bit embarassing for this calibre of hotel The gym was neglected Hated that I didn t get to soak in the spa , The upgrade was awesome id est views of the Green Park Close to everything in a prime location I loved the natural soaps in the rooms The TV menu was quite wow They had me at Jazz I d return but some points bothered me 
36698,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Location location location PLUS rooms are beautiful We were upgraded as it was our second time during this vacation our room was large and with a view to the park The staff was really great and accommodating even though they are in the middle of their lobby remodeling they made our stay really phenomenal The hotel is across from Green Park a 5 minute walk across takes you to Buckingham Palace 15 minute walk takes you to Soho or Central London to Harrods and all the shopping We will be back 
36699,The Athenaeum, Tv did not work taps in bathroom broken old dried room service food left inside hotel room info book, hotel location door porter at front was the only positive things 
36700,The Athenaeum, I was not informed that the entire hotel is under renovation at time of booking If I had known I certainly would have booked elsewhere for the price The staff were not sympathetic to the situation However did say they were lodging a complaint with Booking com because it was not clear AT ALL that this was renovation taking place The entire front entrance was blocked by construction walls No lobby No tea room something we had planned to enjoy No spa available despite the advertisement that one existed WAY too much money for a 5 star hotel in this condition We could have stayed in a 2 star hotel and had a better experience Will not book this hotel again May not use Booking com either as this was misrepresentation , Location That s it 
36701,The Athenaeum, The hotel was being renovated which was noted in tiny print on the bottom of the bedroom description of your page I would not have booked this hotel if I had known They were good and upgraded us and so we were in s separate building away from any noise , The location was excellent and the size of the room
36702,The Athenaeum, I known you re renovating but having concierge tucked away in level 10 makes no sense If he had to be there at least put a sign and have him leave the door open Shame there was no bar I know there was one in a room on level 10 by not the same so hopefully next time , Staff were super helpful and friendly Great location and great cost assume this may go up post Reno 
36703,The Athenaeum, Just being developed at the moment so no lobby until May , great location and nice staff one of the best smaller hotels in london with a bit of class It is a classic hotel with quite a bit of history I have stayed a few times and it is one of my favorites 
36704,The Athenaeum, We booked a suite for three nights There was pair of dirty socks underneath the table in sitting room on arrival lights not working in the sitting room had to ask twice to have fixed no flannels in bathrooms and all the clocks in the suite were wrong but hours not minutes Considering the competition for 5 hotels within a short distance of this hotel I was suprised how poor it was ,No Positive
36705,The Athenaeum, at the time i was staying there the lobby was under refurbishment and had no access this lead to having a tough accessibility as every time i had to go through very narrow stairs to reach the elevators , the location is very superb on piccadilly in the hub of central london and everytime you come back they greet you with Welcome Home Sir 
36706,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Difficult to single things out as overall it was a pleasurable experience with all staff aiming to give the highest service possible The room the bed and general facilities provided were of the highest standard We really would recommend it and cannot wait to return and see the refurbishment of the garden room etc A fabulous experience 
36707,The Athenaeum, Being asked 3 times where I had travelled from The manner in which I was initially dealt with at reception I understand very well there are procedures policies and systems in place which staff must adhere to but extra care needs to be taken when speaking to guests as I did feel as if I were being suspected of not being genuine very quickly Luckily the manager handled the situation we got into very well and quickly with little fuss I won t judge the entire experience based upon misunderstandings as this is an excellent hotel and I chose it due to having stayed once before in one of the suites , The pillows the comfy mattress the bathroom the room layout the design of the room the fact it was so quiet the size of the room the friendly doormen Luca the manager the location the standard of cleanliness 
36708,The Athenaeum, Whilst we were made aware of the refurbishment works the way the other facilities were described that is the bar and restaurant were very underwhelming to say the least I accept they are only temporary but inadequate for a hotel of this stature , Room amazing reception staff and doorman great First impression very good
36709,The Athenaeum, Value for money because of the above was poor I would have asked for a reduction if the bill had not already been charged, I think we should have been informed about building work the public room on the ground floor was soul less on the tenth floor was a small area that was full with one family stunning view but very cramped 
36710,The Athenaeum, The front ground floor of the hotel is a building site for a couple of months entrance is temp around the side so a cramped temp front desk in a narrow corridor the bottle of bubble on ice requested was delivered after we d gone out for the evening and left warm in a bag come on Service was pleasant but slow and drinks and snacks v expensive in the room 3 50 for a bag of crisps really I d avoid it for now if I were you, The room was great and comfortable
36711,The Athenaeum,No Negative, Had an extremely pleasant stay here Staff were super friendly Anna gave me a lovely room with an amazing view of Green Park The doorman are very attentive and always go out of there way to greet you The hotel is under going refurbishment but other than there being no lobby area I would never have known Little things like the teddy in the room and housekeeping ringing a door bell instead of knocking were a nice touch 
36712,The Athenaeum, building work started earlier than stated parts of the room d cor were a bit tired, friendly helpful staff comfy bed good location soft towels nice toiletries
36713,The Athenaeum, Lack of Public rooms due to the building works the extent of which we were not sufficiently informed Had we known we would not have booked Disappointing for a five star hotel, Desk and especially Doorstaff very helpful
36714,The Athenaeum, We were not told of all the building work No where to meet our friends Entrance was round the side and very dark and narrow Check in in a cupboard Would not have booked with current building work , Nice apartment
36715,The Athenaeum, Pity to discover this when we arrive and are told that rooms have been moved next door need to go out of hotel to access rooms and back in for breakfast Works should clearly be stated when doing reservations , Happy to see that hotel is being renewed and undergoing works I understand works will last till may 2016
36716,The Athenaeum, Room small massive refurb going on normal bar and restaurant closed most rooms closed main front door closed small Coke 4 breakfast not included 27 50 each , Location staff room price
36717,The Athenaeum, Spa facilities not available Was led to believe that it was because staff were giving treatments but this was patently untrue as there was dust everywhere Clearly not operational I also heard this same excuse given to someone else who enquiries Also no a la carte breakfast , Bedroom ace
36718,The Athenaeum, Major refurbishment going on No reception bar front entrance Would have appreciated to have been informed of all this prior to arrival Would have spent money on a better hotel for the money ,No Positive
36719,The Athenaeum, We weren t warned that the hotel was undergoing major renovation and that there would be no proper reception bar or restaurants, rooms were excellent
36720,The Athenaeum, The hotel was under renovation so the first floor was not accessible Felt restricted to my room The carpet in my room was freshly washed and still wet I asked to move and was told they were fully booked Went online and found availability I was eventually moved The room service food was awful but to be fair I only had one meal ,No Positive
36721,The Athenaeum,No Negative, As all such properties have to do from time to time this one is going thru a major facelift however there was no noise the rooms are still perfect cleanliness is at its highest degree and the staff are working overtime to keep the standards up as always This is a five star hotel that knows how to go thru a refit and not lose class 
36722,The Athenaeum, the hotel is in the middle of refurbishment which is not mentioned no bar lift out of order entrance via back door no contact from management despite complaints at the time a shame as I stayed ten times in 2015 but never again ,No Positive
36723,The Athenaeum,No Negative, As with another guest who left a review I was very disappointed with fact that this hotel is in middle of full refurbishment however nothing noted at time of booking booking com take note I have book this hotel in March but will not be going a much better hotels for the money around this area Traveller be wear sa 
36724,The Athenaeum, Room with fitted carpets that need to be replaced noisy room because it was close to the maid s room bed matress probably too old smelling sweat,No Positive

36726,The Athenaeum, Room a bit small for the very high price we paid , Excellent service and attention they were very helpful in considering our needs whilst traveling with an infant 
36727,The Athenaeum, Used the spa which looked like it needed cleaning Changing rooms untidy Treatment room smelt like bins Staff friendly but not as professional as I have experienced in other hotel with spas , Very accommodating staff Lovely room 
36728,The Athenaeum, Room attendants let themselves into our room to clean whilst we were there and didn t want it making up , Good sized room bed super comfy and Nespresso machine was a nice touch Whisky bar beautifully cosy and Garden on Piccadilly cocktail delicious
