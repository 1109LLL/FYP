121004,Hotel Opera Cadet,No Negative, Very good restaurant nearby Cadet street is a very old area which gives you a feeling of old Paris Remember to visit passage panoramas 5 min walk to hotel Finally the breakfast was perfect 
121005,Hotel Opera Cadet, They change towel and make bed everyday Even when we hang the sign do not disturb on inner door they have two doors to separate bathroom and bed room but didn t provide toilet paper which is pretty weird logic , Breakfast is good Both front desk and restaurant stuff are very nice Perfect location convenience to 3 metro line 
121006,Hotel Opera Cadet, Water barely comes out in shower could not have appropriate shower at all Took so long to wash myself cause literally water not comes out but leaks Room was bit small too , Big lobby good breakfast 
121007,Hotel Opera Cadet, The room is so small While taking a shower water accumulated in the bath and not drained which was fixed after we spoke to the reception , It is located very close to Cadet metro station WiFi is excellent Staff are very kindly and helpful especially Romain and William 
121008,Hotel Opera Cadet, Hotel guests mainly over sees tourists thus the Hotel experience was not that intimate , Very good breakfast Excellent location just off Grand Boulevards 
121009,Hotel Opera Cadet, Nothing that would warrant a mention on a review , While the hotel is small in size you get all the care and attention to detail that you expect at the more exclusive hotels It s location is quite good for your short Parisian break 
121010,Hotel Opera Cadet,No Negative, An actual 10 mins walk from Gare du nord station but far enough away to be in a nice district and close to the metro Nice hotel for its price This is my third visit 
121011,Hotel Opera Cadet, Rooms are small , Excellent breakfast with some vegetables could be great Excellent facilities in the room tea and coffee toiletries water refrigerator Storage room close to subway Lafayette Galeries 10 min by foot Stuff was helpful A lot of restaurants nearby 
121012,Hotel Opera Cadet, Nothing all was good and I m picky , Great hotel ideally located in a small very Parisian street with loads of restaurants and shops Arrived late in the evening and had no problem finding a restaurant serving dinner at 11pm Great value for money an outstanding deal for Paris 
121013,Hotel Opera Cadet,No Negative, The breakfast is very good fresh food of high quality The location is excellent The hotel is just by the metro and the area around the hotel is nice The rooms are very small but we were lucky and got a triple room 
121014,Hotel Opera Cadet,No Negative, The reception staff were superb and extremely helpful We received a free room upgrade which made the stay even more appealing The location of the hotel is great lots to do in walking distance with a metro stop only 100 metres away which was 5 mins into central Paris The rooms are a little dated but no complaints and would definitely recommend to others 
121015,Hotel Opera Cadet, The installations are old but everything is correct The relation quality price is not good , We arrived via train to Gare de Lyon and the subway allowed us to arrive half a block from the hotel The hotel is very near to a lot of attractions by subway Great breakfast 
121016,Hotel Opera Cadet, Breakfast could have been better Very basic stuff limited options for hot breakfast 900 meters walk for Gare du nord Paris hotels rooms are generally smaller I selected this one coz it was offering 18sqm room for aprox 170 night which was reasonable as compared to other hotels it was a exhibition period , Bigger rooms Nice staff quiet rooms
121017,Hotel Opera Cadet, Interior walls seem really thin as a lot of noise from other rooms and corridor Towels in our bathroom smelt of cigarette smoke which was somewhat unpleasant , Very friendly staff Breakfast included and perfectly adequate Room simple and clean Location really good 
121018,Hotel Opera Cadet, We couldn t regulate the room temperature so we had to leave the window open the entire time we were there , The staff at the front desk and in the breakfast dining room were excellent It was also a comfortable room 
121019,Hotel Opera Cadet,No Negative, The Hotel was a 10 minute walk away from l Opera with the Cadet Metro stop 2 minute walk away giving easy access to travel to all the wonderful locations within Paris The facilities and room were excellent Breakfast had a good choice of breads pastries continental style Staff were friendly and approachable We could not have picked better and will certainly stay again 
121020,Hotel Opera Cadet, Housekeeping service only upto some time and if you need any thing you have to wait till next day morning Requested for 30 minutes late check out was categorically told NO , Location was good 
121021,Hotel Opera Cadet, Height of tub was unsafe and no handels to hold on to Size of room was small for the Price not a great value for the price , The breakfast had a good variety The room was of small and the tub was extremely small and you had to step up about 2 feet to get in the tub I recently had knee surgery and this was a bit difficult since there was no shower handles to hold on to The staff was extremely friendly 
121022,Hotel Opera Cadet, Nothing negative found in this hotel , Hotel located in the heart of Paris close to everything Not so big but very comfortable Very friendly and English speaking staff Not so fast Wi Fi but I m came not for surfing web internet speed is enough for made reservations for tours Tour vouchers you can print at reception 
121023,Hotel Opera Cadet, Part time staff at the reception when we arrived very crude Regular Guy Ramon was spectacular Again a part time barman I had to train a bit of a pain , Our upgraded room was a good layout with the bath and wc in the entry area away from sleeping room Very clean room upper floor very quiet 
121024,Hotel Opera Cadet, I would have liked to find a water boiler in the room , Considering that the breakfast was included it was a good bargain The hotel s location and vicinity to Cadet subway station are phantastic Friendly and efficient personnel

121030,Hotel Opera Cadet, we were first given a dark smelly and extremely small smoking room After asking for what we had booked we got a much bigger family room with huge windows but movng around was still difficult due to 4 beds in the room , location ist great a lot can be reached by foot if not metro station is right at the corner friendly staff and breakfast all right
121031,Hotel Opera Cadet, The only complaint I would have is that we could not get English speaking channels on the T V , I loved the location not to crowded so easy to travel around by foot or metro Hotel Opera Cadet is a very pleasant hotel to stay in 
121032,Hotel Opera Cadet, The content of the breakfasts was pretty meager The staff did their best but during the tourist season there simply isn t enough room to cater for the guests , The reception was incredibly helpful when my husband injured himself in a street fall The room was small but quiet as it is on a pedestrian only street The metro is only about 75 yards away
