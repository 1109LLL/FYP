258070,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The hallway on our floor smelled a bit funny We couldn t tell if it was because the carpets had been shampooed recently and still were a bit wet of if someone peed somewhere ,No Positive
258071,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We had two 2 dinners but unfortunately we were ushered in both occasions in the Bar area only we would have liked to be in the main dining hall Also the previous guests must have brought in food and place it in the fridge The fridge has a terrible odor when opened I complained about it and someone must have done something although the odor was lessened it still bothered my wife and me , Breakfast is great We enjoyed the various choices both cold and hot dishes 
258072,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Why cant we asked cheekily retrospectively get some Club Carlson points for this stay I have now registered and have an account 6015 9950 6907 8911, Sean of your customer relations was very helpful and gave us a great welcome 
258073,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The hotel was a distance from many other museums that we wanted to visit the Tates the Science Museum the V A etc , The staff were lovely Our first room was pretty bare bones because I chose the standard least expensive room There were some folks starting their partying early in the afternoon but the hotel IMMEDIATELY offered to change our room to a quieter place and even offered to help us move and we re so nice about it We had already used the room and taken showers The hotel is literally 200 steps from the British Museum And fairly close to Paddington Station where the Heathrow Express terminates Lots of good small restaurants close by 
258074,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room smelt of cigarette smoke when we arrived and was on the small side Also there was nowhere to sit and do hair make up etc The mirror at the desk was too high to sit at too low to stand at In the end I used the mirrored wardrobe door However this didn t provide anywhere to put makeup etc except on the bed not great with white covers , Location was perfect Bed was very comfy 
258075,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was dark and felt small and claustrophobic and this was a free upgrade The bed sat on a frame with corners that stuck out wider than the mattress so my legs are black and blue with bruises from walking around the room , The bed was very comfortable 
258076,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was a very loud party in the hotel The music kept us awake until 1am This completely impacted on our enjoyment the following day as we were extremely tired We had booked this break to celebrate our birthdays and had been looking forward to our trip for some time We were not told about the party at the time of the booking and was told by the manager it was an impromptu party We were compensated which was very kind but I would rather have had a good nights sleep and been able to enjoy the following day , Location was excellent Decoration of the hotel was lovely 
258077,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Because we travelled with a theatre trip we were not allowed to sit in the main restaurant they had 4 5 long tables seating about 12 each They were covered in empty dishes dirty plates stale food Not one waitress came near the tables the whole time we were there and we had to clear a space and get our own cutlery the tea was in an earn and was cold and grey The food was cold too I have never stayed in a hotel as bad as this before for breakfast, Proximity to shops restaurants theatre etc Comfortable bed and good fecilities in the room Friendly staff
258078,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Have stayed in far better hotels for less money TV didn t work but despite reporting it twice there were no apologies or explanations , The location of the hotel
258079,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The staff were not really interested We did not feel like they could be bothered We asked for something at breakfast and then she never came back to us Did not really feel that our room was any thing special for the price we paid We left feeling a bit underwhelmed , The breakfast was very good 
258080,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, my wife arrived an hour earlier but could not check in as the receptionist insisted to debit her card for the complete stay in advance she refused as i was to pay the hotel and she only had 1 card which would then be blocked for the entire trip she had to sit unattended at the bar for 1 5 hours until i arrived I ask myself if the reception could not have been a bit flexible knowing that I am on the way and I had anyway my card details on the booking com as security ,No Positive
258081,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Pillows are miles too hard Requested softer ones but had to do so 3 times before they arrived , Bar service great drinks Nice reception area to meet up with friends
258082,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, on arrival we had booked 3 rooms only 2 were allocated to us the receptionist then found another room for our friends and to their horror on entering the room they found other guests already in the room The breakfast room is far too small for the number of guests Most tables could only be accessed from one side which did not lend to a relaxed meal a lot of moving about to gain a seat , the location the size of the room and the bathroom
258083,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Very difficult to arrange parking On arrival I left my husband in the car while I ran in to ask for the Valet parking as promised on the phone The receptionist said he would be several minutes as he was doing another job She told me to phone my husband to tell him to park at the side of the hotel There were no places to park Both my husband and myself spent the first 10 minutes of our trip waiting on the pavement next to our car to prevent it receiving a parking ticket etc until he arrived to park it for us On checkout it took 3 receptionists to work the computer in order to pay for our overnight parking We were at reception for almost half an hour We then had to wait a further 20 minutes for our car to be brought to the hotel It ended up literally being parked in the middle of the road while myself and my husband scrambled in trying not to get knocked over I understand that parking is an issue but the whole organisation of this was not acceptable even though the staff were trying so hard to remedy the problems , A lovely room Breakfast was good Staff on reception were friendly and helpful 
258084,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Unlike some of the previous comments we found the hotel to be great Our room was spick and span the breakfast was more than good every morning and the location was perfect very close to the British Museum The employees over all had a great attitude but of course as the day wore on they did to To be expected We were in and out of the Hotel all day long and overall had a very nice experience Yes I would go back 
258085,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was a bit on the small side , The breakfast was amazing well cooked and presented The staff were friendly and helpful Reception staff were extremely helpful advising on transport and use of the Boris bike s 
258086,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Superior double was too small and the ensuite ridiculously small Breakfast staff grumpy and I have never had a breakfast buffet on a side plate Cold coffee, Reception staff lovely
258087,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Desk staff rude and tried to over charge for breakfast For the money spent would expect some manners , Comfy bed incredible location ideal for West end shows 
258088,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Comfy bed pillows were too big I have a preference for flatter pillows and as it was very warm so I had to remove the cover from the duvet to use as a sheet as no separate sheets were provided Online checkin and checkout and room selection are great Nice hotel I would stay again 
258089,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Delighted with everything about this hotel Location was great so close to Oxford Street Tottenham Court Station Soho etc but on a relatively quiet and attractive street Lots of cafes and handy corner shops nearby Decor was lovely everything was spotlessly clean and staff were super friendly and really helpful Free WIFI and some nice touches in the room like complimentary water really nice quality toiletries and excellent air conditioning Bed and pillows were extremely comfortable Overall a brilliant stay Excellent value for money 
258090,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The overall cost was at the top end , Reception and overall helpfulness of the staff Quality of rooms on 7th Floor The restaurant we found to be very good for the evening and breakfast 
258091,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The shower in our room was in a wetroom and unfortunately ours has a nasty habit of overflowing into our room , Staff were lovely Hotel was fairly central British Museum was around the corner Breakfast was fabulous Though not included in our package it was worth every penny We had a Nespresso machine in our room which was a lovely touch 
258092,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, If I was being picky the only thing I could mention was that when choosing a room online it didn t say if was twin or double so we ended with with a king size which was absolutely fine for us but some travellers may not have been satisfied with this , We got to the hotel really early way before check in but our room was ready and they allowed us to the room at no extra cost Polite friendly staff as well 
258093,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The blinds did let light in at the edges so had to wear an eye mask as I like it dark , Normally in hotels at breakfast there is always something that is missing like the sauce but literally everything was laid out Loved the little boxes with the croissants and marmalade in such a nice touch 
258094,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, When i complained about room that ot was nothing like pictures on booking com staff informed me that the rooms had been reclassified ans simplified also the display in foyer was not like the one on booking com i was told it had been changed and staff syated they would have to look at the photos and attend to new ones very disappointed nothing like photos on website Also poor check in late at night it was staed that i would be treated as a no show my daughter thankfully rang as there were plane delays due to weather Not the experience i wanted, i was Relocated to another room after showing the staff pictures of what i was expecting The room had a nice view and was a little more welcoming
258095,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Initial room had a drill like noise coming from air con system upgraded to executive room which was lovely When booking with booking com we ticked the Breakfast included filter which threw up this hotel But then found out we had to pay an extra 30 00 for our breakfast which was annoying Booing com should make this clearer But on the whole the hotel was lovely Was there the night of the London Bridge attack but felt safe in hotel , Room was lovely
258096,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Terrible nights sleep Placed in a room adjacent to the lifts and only got 2 hours sleep I ve had better nights sleep in the travelodge , Very nice decor interior was well designed
258097,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Poor breakfast side plates had to be used for hot breakfast no hot plates Had to ask for further plates and knives for toast no marmalade staff too busy talking, Poor breakfast side plates had to be
258098,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The service was a little lacking at breakfast and we had to find our own way around the place no one took our order or asked if we wanted tea or coffee at breakfast That may be due to some of the staff s English skills but still it could have been better as other guests were being served properly The beds were lumpy and hard and the shower was very weak Not what I expected from an expensive hotel , Breakfast was very good Clean place and very easy to get around 
258099,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Coffee and tea at breakfast were only warm, Friendly and unobtrusive staff Hotel is perfect for theatre land and Oxford St shopping Hotel very clean and comfortable 
258100,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My bedroom was next to a store for housekeeping I could hear a lot of activity in this room at odd hours Very very comfy bed BUT please be aware there is a hospital nearby with ambulances passing ask for room away from road , The self service breakfast was quite varied with a nice selection Airy room and helpful staff Pastries served in small boxes only one plate provided for cooked and cold food rather confusing No offer of more tea Good bathroom but slippery bath beware of tiles with wet feet Bedroom nicely furnished with modern touch 
258101,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The water in the shower went from hot to cold and back every few seconds with no change in the setting , The staff were very helpful and the room pleasant
258102,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I experienced and issue with the room booked but with all respect the staff handled it very well leading to the fact that my sons and i had a absolutely wonderful weekend in London , Location was rather good Nice hotel with overall friendly staff 
258103,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, I was happy with hotel I however wasn t happy when one of the staff stoped the lift and got me out saying my American express card wasent connected to my room after we had a meal in the restaurant but I was told when I checked in I would be charged for any extras on my card very upsetting as there was poeple in lift very embarrassing and he found out it was Regards Joan plenty
258104,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I changed rooms because one was too noisy The second room was great spacey had everything needed Staff was generally friendly and helpful although the first reception could have been better The gym could have a bit bigger it seemed a bit stuffed , Very well located hotel next to shopping museums restaurants and the Soho and Mayfair area I would go again 
258105,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Absolutely nothing , Every member of staff was friendly smiley helpful and pleasant to deal with Quiet room with an opening window in central London a very surprising plus Relaxing surroundings and breakfast real treat Great hotel excellent location will definitely stay again 
258106,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The dimmed lighting was still really bright and harsh late at night , Room was very nice Staff we re great and went the extra mile to get us a phone charger at 2am which was incredible 
258107,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was only 1 small spotlight over the large bathroom mirror It did not provide enough general light for basic things like shaving The bathroom was very large but the actual tub shower was very tight They could have given up some unused space in the bathroom for a larger walk in shower The doors are thin and you do hear people in the hallway Most troublesome when you have an early morning and there are people coming through from their late night out , Friendly and accommodating staff 
258108,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The Staff were very friendly and extra helpful in the evening We changed our room because of a Birthday party downstairs This was no problem and Andrew couldn t have been more helpful 
258109,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, the room was very noisy all night unfortunately we had hen parties in the rooms near us who were still playing loud music until 6 in the morning so we had very little sleep , really lovely breakfast
258110,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing, When we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite which was lovely The reason for travelling was my husbands birthday and when we returned to our room there was a birthday card and a delicious bottle of prosecco on ice We were very impressed with the whole experience and would like to thank all the staff for making our visit most enjoyable 
258111,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The staff most unhelpful rude from start to finish Reception staff did the very least they could 25 mins to check us in Gave no details of breakfast times what time checkout was very disappointed as that is the basics of hotel check in Our room was very basic tired needed some tlc Plug sockets loose from the wall faulty lights so getting ready was interesting Hairs in bed don t expect this ever Luckily as we were there to celebrate my mum s 70th their room was lovely which as we had all paid same price surprised me but I d rather my mum have the plush room The bar staff in the evening just looked at us when they were both doing a job left us waiting there until finally one deemed it their job to serve Breakfast once I had asked where and what time it was served was again a shambles things not replenished staff not clearing plates coffee and tea cold so having to ask for more but our other cups not taken away so we cleared our own table There was one lady who actually made a fuss of my mum which was lovely unfortunately I didn t take her name I just wish all the other staff could follow her lead All in all very disappointed certainly wouldn t return, The location for our weekend plans was perfect
258112,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, the room was one of the smallest I have stayed in in London Due to a pitched roof almost a third of the room wasn t usable We had the ironing board up in the evening and wasn t able to walk around the bed to use the toilet , quick check in
258113,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Cold plates at a hot buffet had to eat from cold food section No side plates , Bed was great Bathroom was good Room was fantastic thank you for the upgrade we are members We have stayed with radisson 5nights this year Like the nesspresso machine home from home Dressing gowns and slippers a good touch too 
258114,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We got an upgrade as the hotel could not give us the requested tvin room Unfornunately this upgraded room came with a brick wall view from the window ,No Positive
258115,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast room was chaotic Cold plates no access to extra cutlery and dirty plates and cutlery left on tables We asked for milk and the jug was taken from a table that had just been vacated Scrambled eggs were cold Very poor for a 4 star expensive hotel , Good central location in the heart of London Easy access to both bus and Tube
258116,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, nothing, Firstly the staff were wonderful polite friendly and helpful the hotel very pleasant room not huge but big enough for us d cor comfort and cleanliness 100 for Covent Garden and theatre district perfect we walked everywhere most definitely will return 
258117,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The view from the room was of air conditioning units which was not great but not a real issue as we were not in the room much One real issue was the showerhead which would have hit my forehead if I had attempted to stand underneath it I admit I am tall 6 feet 2 and a half inches but surely the bathroom designer should have considered this before the shower was installed , The hotel room was very quiet and the location excellent we were going to see An American in Paris at the Dominion Theatre which is just 5 minutes walk away The breakfast was very good with an extensive choice 
258118,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The rooms were terrible and bore no resemblance to the rooms shown on the booking com site They were brown and miserable very small and cramped with terrible views , Location and staff 
258119,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The rooms were terrible They were very small with views over the back of some buildings They were gloomy pokey and miserable looking The furnishings weren t great and the lights in one of the rooms did not work properly either They were not what I would have expected of a 4 star hotel , Staff were helpful Location was great 
258120,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, No improvements needed , The staff were so friendly and helpful They gave us a free room upgrade as I was celebrating a special birthday and made me a delicious cake Lovely rooms and beds were so comfortable Had a very enjoyable stay in London Great location for the theatres 
258121,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The bed was amazing best night sleep ever Breakfast in bed great service great breakfast This stay was a surprise for my husbands birthday Came back to find a large chocolate cake with a hand written card from the staff such a lovely thought
258122,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room keys where very sensitive and got easy demagnetized Also the breakfast could be cheaper than we would consider eating in , The extra polite and service minded staff
258123,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Couldn t really pick fault with anything , The bed was very comfortable The room was very clean with very good facilities Everything we needed within easy walking or underground distance And the breakfast was excellent The staff were very friendly and helpful 
258124,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was a mix up regarding our names which took a little time to sort out as they couldn t find our booking but again the staff were lovely and did their utmost to help, The reception team upgraded our our room choice as we were celebrating a special birthday
258125,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Great location staff really friendly and helpful Clean towels and beds made every day blindsee drawn and lights left on in the evening before we arrived home Fabulous hotel with a lovely room nice and big for two of us with plenty of storage and good facilities Would definitely recommend and would stay here again tomorrow 
258126,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The bar area was a little rowdy in the evenings at the weekend due to corporate events or weddings , Comfort and style of the room including the large bed The location from Euston and also to the shops and Tube were great 
258127,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We had requested a room with twin beds and had received an email confirmation stating that would be possible upon check in they did not have that room available for the first night so we had a double bed which was very small the second night we were upgraded to a bigger room for the remainder of our trip which was lovely We also had a not so good experience with the driver that the hotel scheduled for our pick up from Heathrow but upon arriving at the hotel the charges were taken off of our bill , The location of the hotel was terrific very close to the theater district shopping many restaurants and bars Also close to the sightseeing bus pick ups The staff was brilliant and very helpful 
258128,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The Wardrobe inside the bathroom Quite a small twin room considering we had an upgrade Asked for a quiet room but it had extractor air conditioning plant outside window , Pillows and the topper on the beds were really comfy Good to be off main corridor 
258129,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Would have preferred a king size bed as it was a bit cramped but with an inner city hotel I understand the smaller sized rooms and therefore a smaller bed , Fantastic location 
258130,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bit noisy late into the night outside the hotel but hey its London , Great bar and loved the free candies and fruit infused ice water at the concierge desk 
258131,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We d asked for twin beds but were informed at check in that they d run out of twin rooms so gave us what they described as an upgrade to a king size which was fine as we were sisters sharing However the bed frame was sharp and we both ended up with bruises on our shins from walking into it The room would have felt quite small for any longer than one night This isn t a cheap stay at 215 for one night room only but it s London and it s where we wanted to be , For one night the room was fine big bathroom plenty of space to put overnight luggage 
258132,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The hotel was fantastic and Edward who was on duty when we were staying was so polite and helpful we d definately stay again location was perfect only thing that would be nice is a continental breakfast would of been nice included in the price as was an additional 15 for breakfast but that would not stop us from staying again 
258133,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was smaller than the pictures suggested The pre prepared coffee at Breakfast wasn t warm enough and we were first in at 7 , Generally a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere
258134,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The Loud music must be my age , breakfast very good walking distance to the dominion theatre I had the lobster roll for lunch very good with caring staff 
258135,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bed creaked and drink prices in the bar extortionate , Good choice at breakfast ordered the eggs benedict was worth the wait Reception and concierge were excellent and very helpful Looked after our bags so we could enjoy London even after we had checked out Planning another visit to London later in the year and will stay at this hotel 
258136,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My wife complained that there was no dressing table with mirror and nearby socket in order to do her hair and make up, The bed was very comfortable THe breakfast was good albeit could have been hotter 
258137,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was not good both days Food tepid Coffee cold had to send back both days Poor provision of crockery cutlery e g one plate for everything , Comfortable bed Particularly liked the pillows 
258138,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The only thing I didn t like was the fact I couldn t stay longer , A lovely hotel that has friendly and helpful staff Absolutely delighted to receive a room upgrade which had a wonderful view overlooking the street great for people watching Breakfast includes everything you could wish for Traditional English fresh pastries cheeses meats yooghurts fruit The list goes on Rooms are well decorated and immaculately clean We will definitely return 
258139,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Like all London hotels it is expensive but it felt worth it , The staff were absolutely brilliant nothing was too much trouble and it just felt that they all wanted us to enjoy our stay Breakfast was superb too the hash browns were something special 
258140,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Light most hotels lighting over mirror and surface space for my wife to do her make up and hair is lacking Lighting is lovely but not very preactical Bed side lights dimmable or less bright would be nice too Clothes storage in the bathroom is a bit odd Shower over the bath is never great and water pressure was not very good , Excellent staff and service great location excellent food lovely room Overall an excellent experience and a lovely relaxing stay 
258141,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast was good apart from the toast didnt come with butter and the tea never came with milk , The bed was very comfy and the staff were very atentive 
258142,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We upgraded our room but I wonder what upgrade was as the room was very small for the amount of money we paid I was quite disappointed, The room was very clean and comfortable the bathroom was very nice and big Excellent staff
258143,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, They take a 50 deposit on hold for any damages which is fine as most hotels do however I was unaware and it left me short for my stay two days later I still havnt received it back but I understand it takes a few days however it is very awkward for me , Amazing room and amazing reception staff one guy in particular was absolutely fabulous Loved having steak and lobster downstairs and the 15 towards the restaurant was great They had texting service like Siri for any questions customers had it was amazing 
258144,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Cleaners walk into the room before we even checked out and put any clothes on then it made us uncomfortable hotel was really nice apart from male barman that kept on walking off whilst serving us which was rude location and other staff were great ,No Positive
258145,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bathroom doesn t have an electrical outlet hard for a woman Also very dim lighting in the bathroom However it was a fantastic size , Hotel is clean and the staff was lovely Great location and book with the breakfast happy I did 
258146,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Cleaning staff regularly knocking on the door to check everything was ok presumably looking for a tip , Reception staff were lovely we we re upgraded and a birthday cake was left in our room for our birthdays lovely touch
258147,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was awful Cold coffee no brown sauce and no sweetner for hot drinks Took ages to get fresh coffee staff were indifferent to our waiting Hot options e g scrambled eggs luke warm was not what I call an English breakfast , Location was great for the theatre Reception staff very nice 
258148,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room didn t get cleaned one day despite please can me sign being on all day and us being out all day No plug socket near a mirror Overpriced for what is at the end of the day somewhere to sleep , Location is excellent Lovely large comfy bed 
258149,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, For the money breakfast cold Tea coffee cold room wasn t ready they tried to stick us in A box room for 800 The room pictured is the room they moved us too which was quite nice but very hot we couldn t put air con on as it was full of dust You could see it blowing out the vents Lift and room cards a nightmare Took ages to get into room and get lift to work Oh and a can of Coke out the mini bar 3 00 , Location And cleanliness
258150,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, breakfast could have had more variety ie scrambled eggs only no fried eggs no mushrooms at all no black pudding either compared to previous stays, room was comfortable and clean Staff were very helpful especially on reception desk Hotel is in a excellent location central london Enjoyed a tasty breakfast while watching the world go by through the main window Especially liked the individual trays with pastries preserves for one aThird time of staying at the hotel and nothing changed execellent all round
258151,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Over priced breakfast for what it is eaten cheaper for better quality Rooms not worth the price I would prefer a budget hotel for more space and same view from the window , Location was ideal for us
258152,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing , the staff were so attentive friendly so helpful and extremely efficient We could have stayed longer the room was so comfortable A very happy stay My ideal breakfast couldn t have asked for anything more 
258153,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We use Radisson on a regular basis and this is the worst and smallest room we have ever experienced The Aircon worked on a sine curve it was either freezing or unbearably hot in the room The bed creaked continuously with any slight movement like a 5 mast sailing ship in a hurricane I didn t sleep for 2 nights The bathroom looked trendy but was totally impractical I have limited bend in my left leg and access to the in bath shower was very hazardous because you enter at the slope end of the bath and there is no grab bar to steady yourself The grab bar is at the other end of the bath which is neither help nor ornament There is also only a fixed overhead shower which I think are a waste of time because you can t wash or rinse your private bits Overall a very trendy looking room but essentially a very annoying experience , Very friendly helpful staff who changed our room when we were initially offered a double room that had a significantly small bed in it 
258154,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Fantastic location staff were more than helpful room was spotless and the overall welcoming feeling of the hotel was fantastic we can t wait to stay again best stay we ve had
258155,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Only couple of things that could be improved the breakfast was adequate only one choice of egg which was scrambled and the beans where BBQ there was a menu that you could order from but I cant see why fried eggs couldn t be on the buffet the hotel was very busy and quite cramped with tables also no plates for your toast we asked waiter for another plate he asked what it was for so think that could be a tip to put some plates by where toaster is, Hotel was in central location just short walk from most thing theatre and tube shops hotel staff were very helpful room was pretty big but then it was quite expensive for over 160 a night but I suppose if you want central location and nice hotel you don t mind paying that over all nice hotel
258156,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was a little small and the shower design did little to prevent water splashing into the bathroom , Bedding was comfortable and bathroom was spacious and nicely fitted The breakfast was excellent with an impressive array of options 
258157,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, the bedroom doors could be on a restrictor so they wouldn t make such a noise throughout the night just couldn t cope with the noise any longer, wide selection for breakfast and a decent shower with a very clean room
258158,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, low water pressure small TV and without free smart features these could be better for the high price per night, The 15 pounds per day credit is superb and is a value added perk The location is perfect for shopping and for the British museum visitors 
258159,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, All of it was good nothing negative to say, Staff friendly nothing too much bother breakfast great choices buffet and a la carte Room was nice and contemporary bathroom lovely quiet location on side of building with virtually no noise Would definitely stay there again Handy location for walking into centre a stone s throw from Covent Garden British Museum virtually on the door step Quaint quality bookshops and tea rooms within 100mtrs
258160,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, On the second day the breakfast staff appeared to be confused as to the breakfast I had paid for and was made to wait until they verified This took over 5 mins and I was embarrassed at having to wait at the desk in full view of other guests I chose to leave the desk as they still had not verified this was despite having breakfast the previous day I complained on checkout and was told sorry The pillows are too hard and full and no natural give in them They are not good quality and are synthetic , The reception staff were very friendly and very helpful The hotel is very clean and looks amazing Near to central London without being too close to the noise of the city 10 minutes walk to get to Oxford Street 5 mins from Tottenham Court Road station The rooms had everything needed hairdryer iron ironing board etc
258161,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Online checkout process was poor Having to pre authorise a credit card for 0 01 1 penny on check in was ridiculous the room had already been paid for I wanted to pay for extras by cash the credit card could have been checked manually to confirm that it was the card used to pay for the room and that therefore I was the right person Absurd , Location

258170,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast cost twenty pound per person and it was a breakfast that did not deserve its price tag The scrambled eggs and the beans were done in the microwave and tasted horrendous I would recommend going out for breakfast as the price does not match the breakfast they deliver , The bed was really comfortable and the pillows were plush

258172,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room was tiny the wardrobe doors didn t fit large gap around the bath lots of grouting missing in the bathroom but the main thing is that bed which has a solid base which sticks out further than the mattress which means in a very small room you are constantly hitting it with your legs we both left with bruised shins,No Positive

258209,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The bed was ultra noisy and we wasn t even doing anything just trying to get to sleep if we had of been up to anything in the room all the hallway would ve heard us because the bed was quite near the door The room itself was small but the bathroom was a good size, The location was very good and the staff were pleasant The breakfast was fine but as I m gluten free I have to be careful with what I eat
258210,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I did not like to have a room in the 1 floor and it was not a nice view outside the windows I missed to have a night lamp light by the bed , I liked central location close to Oxford street and Covent garden Nice breakfeast and a very friendly lady who welcomed us both days at the breakfeast I liked that the room had a fridge 
258211,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Not really a complaint but it was a little too hot during the night so had to put air con on which was a bit strange for December , The reception staff and concierge were very welcoming and helpful Although compact the room was nice with a comfy bed and great shower in bathroom The breakfast was good and the location was perfect I would definitely recommend this hotel

258213,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The refusal by those on reception at check out in the morning to give a proper credit card receipt on the specious grounds that the paper had run out in the machine The unhelpful attitude of one member of kitchen staff when asked for another plate , The warm and very helpful welcome from the lady on duty at reception on the afternoon of my arrival

258232,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We booked for one night bed and breakfast as my husband had appointment at UCHL McMillan Cancer Centre We had to stay an extra day so receptionist booked us in and gave discount Turns out she took the breakfast off as the discount and caused us embarrassment of going down for breakfast and being refused We were told we had been upgraded We didnt ask for an upgrade we asked for bed and breakfast so to refuse breakfast when we were over to see a cancer specialist as my husband is very ill was absolutely pathetic We are back to London in 2 weeks time for another 2 week stay and we will definitely not be staying at this hotel again Reeption staff would need a bit of training ,No Positive

258235,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Pricey but probably not by London standards , Very luxurious room with all the mod cons including bath robe slippers Under floor heating a pleasure on feet after bath shower

258245,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Wel The marble in the shower was slippery when showering And the water didn t go away fast enough , The extra service that I received The efforts to accommodate my requests The restaurant had wonderful steak and lobster The art and the interior and the original Bloomsbury book at the reception 
258246,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I booked this hotel for my daughter and myself as we had tickets for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre and it was only a short walk away We arrived early as previously advised to discover there were no available rooms despite the hotel Booking App advising otherwise I was informed we would be Upgraded from a Standard room to a King Delux and this room would be available to us when we returned in the evening The upgraded room we were allocated was less than I would expect from a standard room but would have sufficed if there had not been a horrible dampish smell made worse by a raging hot radiator When I asked to change rooms I was advised the hotel was at 100 occupancy After informing the night manager of my disappointment we were given an upgrade which was lovely However I felt more of a nuisance than a valued customer The room including breakfast had been paid in full 3 months prior to our stay Upon checkout I discovered a further 24 had been added to the invoice for items from the mini bar which had not been used I was later advised this was a mistake and the full 50 they had deducted for incidentals from my card upon arrival would be refunded in full All in all a disappointing stay and the first time since using Booking com that a hotel has given the impression my business was not what they really desired To that end they will not be receiving it again ,No Positive

258268,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We asked for our bags to be taken to the rooms when they were ready which was agreed this didn t happen but when we went to collect them the concierge couldn t do enough for us and sent the remaining bags up to the rooms there then Breakfast was ok Great selection but everything running low and it took quite a while to replace When asked if we would like teas coffee this was brought to us in dribs and drabs Was very hard to attract the attention of a waitress to ask for more of anything as they were so busy and only 2 on duty , We booked this hotel because of it s location more than anything Pleasantly surprised The staff were welcoming and friendly upon arrival even though we arrived early so our room wasn t ready Didn t return until 3 30am but we all felt safe and comfortable in the hotel and around the area Overall visit was fantastic and just what we were looking for on this occasion The rooms were spotless and the bathroom was massive and well looked after too 
258269,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The food we ordered from room service arrived luke warm We also booked a superior room on booking com but the room was quite small so I believe we may have been given a standard room , The bed was extremely comfy Friendly staff always rushing to open the door for you 
258270,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Check out reception staff particularly the male member were distant remote and arrogant in nature and demeanour Sadly lacking in customer empathy Higher reception staff training standards expected at Radisson hotels , Convenient location for meeting on Tottenham Court Road beautifully appointed interior bedroom and communal areas Excellent sound proofing in bedrooms Helpful and understanding check in reception night managers 
258271,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Everything was great , Although the bedrooms were quite small the beds were very comfortable and not noisy The staff were very friendly and the bar area was really nice A great location to stay for getting around London easily Would definitely stay here again 
258272,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Lovely room comfy bed excellent tea and coffee choice Lovely staff Excellent place to stay for theaters and places to eat out and it takes less than 20 mins to walk there from Waterloo station Excellent 
258273,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Two big windows let in plenty of light but our view wasn t good Not an issue as we were only there for one night and a scenic view wasn t expected or required , The staff were lovely we were only there for one night The location was fab I would definitely go back 
258274,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, If you like a cooked breakfast order from the menu as the buffet hot breakfast was not the best , The hotel location is very good the staff are friendly and helpful Worthy of its 4 rating We celebrated a special occasion and the Hotel Guest Relations Manager upgraded our room Nice touch 
258275,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Despite all that s good here and there is a lot the pillows are a real let down it s almost as if no thought has been given to whether they re actually comfortable From a frequent traveler these are some of the worst pillows around and let s face it it s the sleeping experience that you re really paying for when you book a hotel room , This is our go to property in London and we always stay in the same room Location suits us perfectly room is great spacious although we choose and pay for the 1 bedroom suite 
258276,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The rooms could be a bit bigger, The location was perfect next to the British Museum and close to multiple tube stations Local nightlife shopping and eating were also easily accessible 
258277,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Daytime service within the bar area made customers unsure if to sit and be waited upon or approach bar, Friendly and approachable staff great location with transport links easily accessible Welcoming breakfast buffet service 
258278,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I honestly can t think of anything I didn t like , The friendliness of all the staff really made us feel at home the breakfast was superb and not forgetting the upgrade which was a complete surprise 
258279,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Thought the pillows were a bit thick and the choice of a thin one as well may of been a great extra to your room but all in all a very good room , Staff at entrance were so quick to help to your needs
258280,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, the room was nice however it needs a table and shelf areas for personal things the coffee machine and water kettle occupy the only table in the room, the rooms were nice and comfortable location was excellent
258281,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Very small room despite upgrade pillows were very hard and I ended up with a crick in my neck At 16 the breakfast was very expensive It wasn t included in my rate and therefore I would never pay so much , Great location super clean
258282,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I asked for a twin room as I was travelling with a friend I didn t get it I ended up sleeping on a put you up bed it was my birthday and had booked the hotel as a treat was very disappointed breakfast was disappointing , Beautiful hotel
258283,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing not to like , Excellent location Lovely staff especially at the reception desk Fab room got given a free upgrade when we arrived Only stayed one night Would definitely use again 
258284,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast room and tables a bit cramped , Given a room upgrade due to Birthday visit which was a nice touch Room very large and comfy and also quiet which we asked for Buffet breakfast was good too Ideal hotel for theatre visits Will be booking again 
258285,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Booked a twin room and was told on arrival they didn t have one so had to have a double no dressing table and nightmare of a shower it was really hard to get into the raised bath with no suitable hand rails l am mid fifties and struggled God knows how an older person would cope it is an accident waiting to happen,No Positive
258286,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Although I have rated the hotel well for the questions asked I will not be staying at the hotel again A group of 6 of us went 2 in King Suites the other four were meant to be in twins When we got there the hotel informed us all they had were doubles The other four blokes in the party did not wish to share a bed So two ended up staying elsewhere Very poor on you radisson , Nice place 
258287,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Although I have rated the hotel well for the questions asked I will not be staying at the hotel again A group of 6 of us went 2 in King Suites the other four were meant to be in twins When we got there the hotel informed us all they had were doubles The other four blokes in the party did not wish to share a bed So two ended up staying elsewhere Very poor on you radisson , Nice place Clean 
258288,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Organisation between reception the restaurant was poor we paid in advance for breakfast on check in and the restaurant weren t informed which led to lots of questions about payment while we were trying to eat but we were assured it would be sorted out and I had no worries that it wouldn t be apparently it is a common problem The breakfast itself was good but lacking in variety by the time we arrived at 10am there were some cheeses missing that were not replenished , The decor of the hotel is lovely the location was perfect for The Palace Theatre and there was plenty around the hotel itself The staff were helpful and very pleasant easy to deal with The room we were upgraded was also a very good size and very clean 
258289,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, being told rather rudely that I could not have breakfast until I paid for something I thought I had already purchased I went to the cafe next door , The location and helpful porters 
258290,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The cleaner during our stay was outstanding He or she placed my daughter s soft toy in different positions e g reading a book etc and when we returned to the room it really made us smile 
258291,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, One barman was miserable which killed the mood in the bar Only one negative out of a great stay though , Loved the breakfast such a great choice and the staff were great The reception staff were lovely and very helpful 
258292,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Most of the time the music in the bar and restaurant was too loud and inappropriate which made us want to leave This is definitely an improvement point , An additional 15 pounds a day to be spent at the bar gets added to your account Very clever 
258293,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Unfortunately we had to relocate rooms at 4 30am in the morning due to the lights constantly flickering we where then accommodated for the rest of our nights sleep in a lower standard room then originally booked before the upgrade The lighting issue had a very ery feel to it and didn t quite feel like it was your usual case of bad wiring I would say the hotel where very good in the solution they proposed to this problem and the complimentary afternoon tea was a nice touch Albeit if the member of staff we spoke to was adament the manage couldn t offer us any more Overall a lovely hotel with stunning decor and a brilliant location we would deffinatley stay again just not in that room O , The location of the hotel was perfect and the decor was amazing 
258294,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Liked it all, I ve stayed in a different hotel in London at least once a week for the last three months always based on price due costs in London being hugely different nightly even on same hotel there never being a medium I m an a budget of around 150 for one night so millenium knights bridge Piccadilly West end thistle Holborn Etc etc This bar far the best would stay every week back to 200 plus as if today its a shame there is no consistency in London price wise Lovely food good room shower bath staff all good 
258295,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I left some jewellery in the room and when I called the hotel a few days later was told it hadn t been found So someone else must have it Disappointing, Generally good
258296,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast buffet messy spilt milk food and buffet items needed replenishing, Lovely room Very comfortable Nice front desk staff and restaurant staff
258297,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Staff excellent polite helpful happy friendly immaculately presented Room very clean very comfortable well thought out facilities had everything we needed Public areas fabulous decor welcoming and interesting Breakfast was lovely great selection and very organised
258298,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Breakfast was good but thought the layout was a little chaotic especially for the guests sitting close to the servery people were in and out and in between the tables which personally had I been sitting there would not have been happy Also waiting staff were a little slow on bringing out tea and coffee but generally overall it was good 
258299,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bar staff complete lack of attention to tables had to order food drink at the bar and after eating it took 40 minutes to pay First they sent me away saying they would send somebody then I went back to the bar to be told I couldn t stand there as it was reserved for staff at the till end Then I asked if they wanted the money or not Finally I got a sensible response and they got no tip ,No Positive
258300,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, I like the additional 15 credit we could use at the restaurant or bar This was unexpected and a lovely surprise Also I like Edward the virtual assistant he became very handy during our stay 
258301,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast food layout and organisation is chaotic and completely wrong They need to rethink the layout Only 2 lifts and 1 of them wasn t working so a bit of a wait from time to time , Excellent and friendly front of house staff and also those who clean the rooms Could not have been better Excellent sausages at breakfast 
258302,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was nothing we could complain about Ten out of ten for service breakfast friendliness and cleanliness , Everything was excellent When we checked in the reception staff were really friendly and chatty We were staying there as a treat for my daughters 30th birthday and when we got back from our trip to the theatre there was a surprise cake and birthday wishes in a card for her a very lovely special touch 
258303,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was a Roman blind over the window instead of curtains and it did not keep the light out As a result I did not sleep as well as I needed to as it let the outside light in at night and the sunlight in very early in the morning , Food was lovely Location was excellent Bed was extremely comfortable although small if sharing Bathroom was lovely but very dark for trying to put on make up 
258304,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The reason we chose this hotel was because it had an option of twin beds as we were two friends travelling together for Wimbledon Men s Final Despite trying to ascertain twin beds through Booking com twice before our visit twin beds were not available The hotel eventually upgraded us and gave us a Z bed very lumpy They told us it s better to book direct not with booking com , The exceptional friendliness of the staff They bent over backwards to be helpful
258305,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Lounge and bar facilities a little cramped and sometimes understaffed , Very good location for central London Excellent breakfast selection which was all very fresh 
258306,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, View from the room was over the air conditioning units nothings perfect , Staff are lovely friendly and efficient Food was very good had room service yummy 
258307,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Could have done with some shower gel to use in the bath as opposed to just shampoo and conditioner , The staff were exceptionally helpful The bedding was lovely exceptionally comfy It was refreshing to have such a warm welcome at breakfast One of the best breakfasts I ve had in a hotel 
258308,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing it was a great stay, The staff were absolutely lovely couldn t do enough for you and were very helpful when suggesting how to get around London and where to go The breakfast was very varied fresh and well cooked
258309,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast Waited on pot of tea for 10 min had to re ask a second time Also butter for toast wasn t sitting out had to ask and it was in a closed cupboard ,No Positive

258311,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Cost of birthday cocktails in the bar a bit steep , A traditional property well modernised Excellent comfortable room with views over to the British Museum Great location Friendly welcoming Reception staff 
258312,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, In that particular room limited window view but actually it wasn t a problem and wouldn t stop us from visiting again , Hotel spotless staff friendly and supportive
258313,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing really a good base for our weekend , Staff were Polite and helpful on arrival room clean and ready good breakfast variety with plenty of fresh fruit 
258314,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The gym Too small Not modern , Excellent hotel beautiful decorated The staff and their personalities are absolutely amazing Haven t seen that service mindset in a long time Clean quiet 20 min beautiful stroll from Piccadilly Circus very happy with my stay Oh and the lobster 
258315,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Concierge service could have been better Staff were impeccably dressed but came across as snooty in demeanor and lacking in warmth A smile would have been appreciated Room furnishings were better and brighter in the pictures Our room was rather grey and sombre This hotel is on the far end of Oxford St for shopping The Tube was being serviced that weekend so it was a bit of a walk back with a lots of bags ,No Positive
258316,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I phoned the day before to confirm my request for a twin room Assured by the call handler at the hotel we had been allocated a twin room On arrival none available This was EXTREMELY upsetting travelling with a same sex friend who didnt really want to share In London on a birthday treat for her We were given single duvets We asked for more milk for the tea in the room as only enough for one cup each It never arrived We purchased a pint locally Where are the biscuits , It was well located for our visit Plenty of variety for breakfast shame cooked food was cold The waitress didnt clear between courses and the table became very cluttered and we had to move the dirty dishes ourselves She was nt too busy just not observant 
258317,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Despite booking twin room for me and sister were given double but upgraded to king size Not happy complained and given complimentary breakfast ,No Positive
258318,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Night manager was unhelpful not interested in guests was more interested in completing online tasks was quite abrupt and curt Staff at breakfast appeared confused about their role and duties Manageress even started clearing the table while we were still eating Room was cramped with little room for two to manoeuvre , Bar staff day reception staff and cleaner were really accommodating polite and helpful 
258319,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, continual whirring day and night of some sort of unit fans in courtyard outside our room 2023 think many would find the noise rather annoying , good breakfast nice decor 
258320,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing wish we could have stayed longer , Lovely comfy room bed and linen good quality clean bathroom nice size room for central London handy for University College London Hospital staff very helpful especially Luckas on reception

258322,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Maybe more choice in the restaurant or even bar snacks , When we complained about the lack of a bath in our room we had requested earlier and had confirmation we were moved very quickly All the staff were very friendly and helpful 
258323,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, When we did check in on may the 8th the receptionist did use our credit card telling us that is was just a old reservation on it NOT a charge The next day she the same girl Grazziella D did use it again when we did checked out she did use the card and told us that THIS time the payment would be effective I was surprised and did asked her twice as on the evening of the 8th I saw our credit card balance showing us the amount of the 8Th charged She told us that it was just a hold on the card that I did not had to worry And now guess what we have been charged TWICE Well done guys See the capture We have been charged 217 89 on the check in on May the 8th We have been charged 277 40 on the check out May the 9th,No Positive
258324,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The free TV channels were limited , I was lucky enough to get an upgrade to a Deluxe room There was plenty of space a lovely bathroom and a very comfy bed 
258325,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Getting out of the shower very slippery a handle on the wall at the end of the bath would have been helpful , The bed was the best we have ever slept in very comfortable The breakfast was excellent The staff very helpful 
258326,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Standard room was really quite small even for a standard View really wasn t great either we could see the person opposite taking their shower, Location was great for pretty much everything Very central Very chic and clean
258327,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The only thing and I don t think it could have been helped was it got a bit noisy on early Saturday morning other guests I think It genuinely did not harm the weekend though , The staff were excellent and were very engaging The location was excellent for us to explore It was our 15th Wedding Anniversary and helped make a perfect weekend even better 
258328,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My husband had been to reception in the afternoon without my knowledge to organise a bottle of Champers and a surprise birthday cake to be placed in our room as a surprise when we got back from a show later that evening as it was my birthday However much to his dismay No Champers and no cake even though reception had written his request down He was really disappointed Rang reception and they knew nothing about it ordered a bottle and it did arrive within 10 mins but it did spoil the moment Also staff forgot to place teaspoons on saucers and butter on the table at breakfast had to ask for both unusual for this chain of hotel , Good breakfast Nice decor Staff mostly helpful
258329,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Night staff were not very accommodating and our room was stuck right next to air con machines outside and couldn t have window open as it wouldn t fully open due to these machines the smell and the noise and the heat in our room was unbearable , The location
258330,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The bedroom view of a wall wasn t great but to be fair we had booked a lower ended priced room so we knew it was unlikely to have been the London skyline , Efficient friendly and helpful staff Fantastic breakfast spoilt for choice Stylish interiors Fantastic bathroom and a shower I could have stayed in all morning Great location at just 10 15 minutes walk from Covent Garden 
258331,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We got put in a room first that didn t look like the pictures although then asked to be moved got given a twin room straight away which was much bigger , The beds were extra comfy Room was light always clean 
258332,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was poor many hot items were running out too often and we had a very long wait for tea coffee to be served , Close to the theatres and Covent garden 
258333,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Some staff were difficult to understand Even for London the price was a little hot , The room was spacious Very clean thr out Staff very friendly Liked the menu
258334,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The bed was very squeaky , Excellent location for West End theatres Warm welcome from all staff reception housekeeping and restaurant Very clean room but small standard room which was okay as we only wanted an overnight stay Lovely crisp bed linen and fresh toiletries 
258335,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, room could have been bigger and our room was on the main street , The beds where comfortable needed biscuit as well as tea and coffee more tea bags and coffee
258336,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Unfriendly and unhelpful staff , Night staff are rude and not helpful The day staff that helped with checking are very pleasant Should get rid of bad staff as they ruin the hotels reputation Location was good 
258337,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bathtub a little awkward and small but overall beautiful room and bathroom , Wonderful breakfast Amazing selection Helpful staff Perfect central location 
258338,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The only thing was the pillows were too thick I know it s a bit picky sorry , The location was great The staff were very helpful Breakfast was very good The rooms were clean and well appointed 
258339,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My friend s Son and partner tried to arrange a bottle of Prosecco for the room as it was my friend s birthday However the staff on the Radisson central number were not very helpful and it took them most of the day to try and get this sorted When it eventually arrived at our room it was delivered with a smile Also the breakfast wasn t great and service poor , The room was lovely and location excellent 
258340,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, TV didn t seem to have a very good guide for what was on No biscuits with the tea and coffee And no Earl Grey tea , Bed was very comfortable Pillows especially Lovely modern room Staff exceptionally polite and helpful 
258341,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The only thing is they could put on fried eggs for breakfast but they happily made these for us when requested so no hassles , Bed was lush mattress so comfortable
258342,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast very busy needs another juice bar Breakfast should be included in room price , Rooms very nice Beds comfy Bathroom very nice fluffy towels Location good for shopping and covent garden 
258343,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There were too many guests cramped into one space in the breakfast area making it uncomfortable to eat The cooked breakfast would have been better if it had been warm as on our previous visit The breakfast manager was unhelpful re seating explaining that the other area was not in use but did not really give a valid reason for this The toaster was slow and there was only one slowing down the pace of breakfast staff slow to replace empty dishes , The location was very good The hotel was clean Most of the staff were helpful The room was comfortable 
258344,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room was tiny desk chair was atrocious Restaurant service was non existent we were ignored most of the time Choice of cereals at breakfast very poor , Beds were very comfortable Proximity to our theatre was excellent 
258345,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room was a little small with a lot of extra space for the bathroom , Bed was the comfiest we ve ever stayed in In fact we now need a bed just like it for home 
258346,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast could have been better the scrambled eggs were cold and I had to ask several times for my tea to be brought over , The hotel was very clean and there was a lovely shower in the room

258348,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, On the second floor and the bathroom fan sucked in the smell of the kitchens the breakfast was ok but let down by slow delivery of the made to order , For the money the room was on the small size though the bed and the duck down pillows were top notch slept well
258349,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, No biscuits or hot chocolate with tea making facilities, Very comfy beds and lovely shower Very clean Food in restaurant was delicious Very helpful staff
258350,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Unfortunately the television was on a timer of some sort and woke us twice in the night , The beds were very comfortable the room was quiet and the staff helpful 
258351,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, See above, Liked the location quiet but central and good restaurants close by Only negative the bedroom was just too warm even with the air conditioning on and it was noisy with the window open 
258352,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Everything excellent, A perfect location for all the best bits of London on its doorstep no need for taxis Quality hotel with very modern and extremely clean facilities
258353,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, A small room with a view of a brick wall very claustrophobic No mini tubes toothpaste , Central location Breakfast very good Service friendly helpful and with a smile Soaps etc from good sized dispenser no little bottles 
258354,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was tiny and the bed was a 4 ft bed we felt cramped The bed had sharp edges so I caught myself because the room was so small No view dark and depressing , It was near the theatre and the bar area and breakfast were good too
258355,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Got a very small double room without Windows Too many people at breakfast so sat very close and had to wait for a long time for coffee, location excellent
258356,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The Pillows are so thick they are practically useless and they are not even soft pillows There were 6 pillows for what Finally Reception sent me a small one which I used The temperature setting was hard to figure out I turn down to 17 C from 19 but it does not stay there it comes back to 19 C I requested for a nicer higher floor room I got a room facing the back unsightly roof of some building To be fair the reception lady was willing to switch but I did not want to change to another room just for one night The staff is very helpful and courteous I thank them Overall I felt I should have stayed at Hampton Inn cheaper and includes breakfast, Closer to train Station and Key attraction like British Museum
258357,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Small room and bathroom looking out onto a brick wall requested superior room and booked early with some VIP guests Further from Covent Garden than anticipated across some busy roads Staff at breakfast very unattentive , Comfy Bed
258358,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Pillows too big Tv channels poor expensive to watch films , Breakfast very good quality and nice Card security very thorough Quiet even though in the middle of the city 
258359,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Checked in online their app which was easy to use When I arrived the room keys were ready straight away The room was immaculate with a large bathroom which is great being in central London Only a 5 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station
258360,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The milk for breakfast cereal was contained in tiny glass bottles Three needed for the average bowl and one would be kept waiting for full bottles to appear The other small grouse the four slice toaster inadequate for the job and far too small for the bread slices with one third sticking of the slice poking out and untoasted Otherwise first class with the staff always willing to oblige , Our room was really comfortable and clean and the bed superb What else can you ask One minor grouse was the view Being at the rear of the hotel half of the view being a brick wall the other overlooking other dwellings hotels I suppose the good part of this being at the rear there was no major traffic noise 
258361,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Some minor problems with the airconditioning and with the shower drain Didn t get any complimentary slippers nor bathrobe this time which was a bit disappointing , Excellent service from the hotel staff as usual clean room and bathroom nice sized room 
258362,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Couldn t find any instructions for heating control and I accident y pressed wrong button and struggled to get information To correct it, Comfy bed Pleasant staff Good food in restuarNt
258363,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast could be better quality of food is good however it could be placed at the counter better, Very committed staff I left my card which was used for prepaid booking and was not able to present it upon arrival After conversation and listnening to my arguments they confirmed my booking and I got my room They also made a late check out for me I had to finish my presentation slides and was looking for 3 hours of extra time and they also granted me this opportunity
258364,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Not sure I like the idea if wardrobes in the bathroom didn t feel I could hand anything up in there in case it got damp from the steam and dampness a bathroom can cause , The bed was very comfy 
258365,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Dirty towel on floor in our room on arrival We were seated for breakfast but our table was given away to another couple while we got our breakfast we had to ask to be seated elsewhere in the restaurant , Comfy bed nice layout modern Easy to check in and out on my phone 
258366,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Booked a room from the pictures advised was upgraded re bed size and told was deluxe room after sending an e mail but room was nothing like the picture advised However this wouldn t stop me from staying again, Great hotel staff very helpful and bed was very comfortable
258367,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, everything else staff were rude grumpy unhelpful we went to breakfast but no tables so put in bar and told would set one up while we got out food no table set up food was freezing had to ask 2 3 times for everything when making a complaint the woman at reception couldn t of cared less overall a completely disappointing stay , the bed was very comfortable rooms were nice and clean shower was amazing 
258368,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Wardrobe space minimal and no chair Staffing levels in restaurant inadequate and poor customer awareness Tables too close together , Breakfast was excellent The bedroom was comfortable but quite small 
258369,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Somewhere to put my towel closer to the show as had to walk over a slippery floor to get to it, Nice room average view as in a corner Bathroom was clean and restaurant was nice
258370,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was tasty but having eaten breakfast by the time our coffee arrived and told that we would be charged extra for it was a joke There service is very very slow , The room was great for what we needed smart clean and well presented 
258371,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Service Asked for tea got coffee Asked for butter they picked up used butter off the next table and gave to us Did the same with the milk Also we had finished breakfast by the time the drinks arrived The next table were seated went to get their breakfast they then sat another couple there The table the other side asked for poached eggs they never arrived No cutlery Just generally a bit all over the place Orders wrong forgot to bring items asked for waiting for a long period the staff actively avoided trying to make eye contact to try and avoid serving you , Hotel nice and good location breakfast nice but the service was terrible Hotel bar nice and food good but again terrible service We still enjoyed our stay we found the bad service quite amusing in the end at how unorganised they were 
258372,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bar service was quite slow as they were also doing the drinks for the restaurant which seemed to take priority over people waiting at the bar , Breakfast was good quality and good variety Restaurant does steak or lobster for 20 including unlimited fries and salad really good value for Londond and food was fantastic Rooms were very modern and well designed Hotel located a 5 minute walk from Tottenham road tube station which is right next to Oxford street 
258373,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The incredibly small room the wardrobe in the bathroom The very very creaky bed The way we were treated like cattle at breakfast almost on top of each other , The location was good the hotel was clean checking in was OK staff friendly 
258374,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, At breakfast tables were to close to each other also had to wait for eggs and beans whilst the food on the plate was getting cold , Friendly staff Hotel was lovely and clean 
258375,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, unfortunately the staff at breakfast were not great they were wandering around in a bit of a trance and when we asked for coffee its seemed as though we were asking the earth , Hotel was clean and comfortable and the location was great not all the staff of course but unfortunately the good ones were let down by some rather under whelming colleagues that morning other wise the breakfast was good and the hotel very pleasant
258376,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Ice machine made tiny ice cubes, Lovely bright room with large windows two comfortable arm chairs could sit and look out at local scene Thick towels walk in open shower Generous buffet breakfast Good bus service across the road 
258377,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My only criticism and it s a minor thing but felt that the tables were very close together making it awkward using buffet service breakfast, Reception staff so friendly and helpful Suite ws excellent and all food we had was so very tasty and well cooked from breakfast to the two occasions we used late night room service it was superb
258378,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Mini bar prices , Excellent over all Breakfast superb Room good value but at little small but this did not take anything away from the experience happily recommend to others 
258379,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was the let down for the Hotel croissants were stale bacon undercooked nothing very hot , comfortable beds nice to have coffee machines in room
258380,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast well cooked well presented but cool cold toast not readily available had to que 12 5 optional service charge automatically included ,No Positive
258381,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The adjoining restaurant was poor They were so busy but just couldnt cope Our mains came before our starters and then they came with the wrong order and the chips were cold We asked for more chips and they never materialised So dissapointed , Excellent stay We were upgraded so had a fantastic room Breakfast superb Great location Friendly staff Would stay again 
258382,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Initial superior room offered was tiny did swap us to better room when asked at reception helpful staff just initial dissapointment , Clean and helpful staff
258383,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Nothing , Rooms were beautiful and clean most comfortable bed ever and staff were polite and friendly Breakfast and bar drinks also great Great location with walking to many attractions very easy and close A very lovely stay Will definitely recommend 
258384,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Every day I had to get my room key reset because it wouldn t let me into my room I reported a faulty soap dispenser which wasn t fixed Overall I felt as if the front desk staff could have done better , Great location plenty of things to do and see within walking distance 
258385,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was not always hot enough but there was enough of it Butter not portioned out adequately Breakfast room staff generally left sth to be desired except for the elderly gentlemen waiter , Bed was very good and the room itself very clean and inviting Miserable view from the window AGAIN 
258386,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Having had a good day out we just wanted a small snack in the bar in the evening but were told this was not available although I had earlier rung up to check and been given the wrong impression ,No Positive
258387,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I booked a twin room as I was travelling with a male friend however we were apparently upgraded to a king size room although we were not informed of this until we were checking out We would in this instance have preferred the twin room rather than a larger double bed,No Positive
258388,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The pillows husband and I could not get used to then over the three nights Very hard to catch the eye of staff for tea and coffee at breakfast and drinks in the bar area in the evening , Check in Candy was very polite and helpful Room very clean 
258389,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, More tea and milk in room even though when asked for more I received them , Bed were very comfy The Breakfast and Staff Fantastic apart from having to ask for fried eggs 
258390,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room and hotel was very clean a couple of minor things wax that the corner of the shower leaked and it was difficult to climb out of the bath without slipping , Breakfast was lovely and the hotel very comfortable Location was excellent with everything you could want nearby 
258391,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My impression is that once you pay for the basic room via Booking you get the most inconvenient room such as very very small room or with a wall in front of your window or giant aircondition engine in front of your window I have experienced all of them and only upon insisting to have a reasonable room the staff gave me one , The location is excellent Stuff of the hotel are very responsive to your needs Once they have change my room it was a very pleasant stay 
258392,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Thought the layout of the tables was far too close to the breakfast buffet for comfort , Thought the room was very nice comfortable bed Food was good Staff very pleasant Reception staff very helpful 
258393,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, picture on bedroom wall was a little risqu breakfast was good but cooked food could have been warmer , the bed was very comfortable excellent shower and bathroom room nicely appointed 
258394,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Only downside I would say is there were only 5 free tv channels so if you find yourself in the room for a while there s not a lot of options Freeview would be a good idea as it would give more choice , Staff very polite and helpful we had breakfast the following morning which was very nice and a wide selection of food still available towards the end of service Good location if visiting the theatres 
258395,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, First we where given a small room adjacent to the aircondtioning which made a high pitch noise Upon request we more moved to a larger room a few rooms down the hall If a better room within the same class is available it would be preferable to give out these without having to complain first, Nice lobby and wonderfull shower
258396,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Move the chairs further away from the breakfast worktop insufficient room to pass other people and those seated were being nudged in the back , Hospitality
258397,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Kettle didn t work in the room and staff at breakfast were a bit disorganised, Atmosphere location decor comfort majority of staff were excellent
258398,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast could have had a little more variety , The service was lovely It was warm compared to the cold outside We were on honeymoon and we thank you for celebrating us and with us
258399,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Not a bad experience necessarily but my Superior Double room was on the small side and had no bath , Convenience familiarity of Radisson Blu brand amenities in room very friendly and proactive staff
258400,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was awful it came free with room if I had t I would not have paid Also shower bath had long hair tangled round the shower frenetic bottle, Staff very friendly
258401,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Good afternoon We have just returned from a stay at your hotel last night I have to say I m somewhat shocked and disappointed at the service we received whilst staying with you Firstly a member of your staff knocked and then proceeded to come straight into our room yesterday afternoon They quickly left shouting sorry once they realised we were there We thought this to be somewhat odd but quickly dismissed it as an obvious mistake This morning the same thing happened again This was a different member of staff and presumingly they were waiting to potentially clean our room on check out but even so I feel it s unacceptable and inappropriate to knock once and then use their own key to enter uninvited In all the years of hotel breaks I have never experienced something like this let alone it happening twice On check out this morning we explained the situation to Nelson who simply said sorry about that it can happen sometimes I didn t feel this was an acceptable apology it sounds like it s a common occurrence at your hotel Maybe it s a policy that needs revisiting Finally there was a discrepancy with our final bill when I politely questioned this with Stephanie she came across extremely rude and condescending The bill was in fact correct but a simple explanation with less attitude would have been greatly appreciated She made us feel very uneasy and it was very unnecessary and disappointing from a hotel of your caliber We paid 200 for our room last night our experience with you did not justify the price we paid and we feel very disappointed with our stay I have felt the need to add this post as our concerns fell on deaf ears at check out this morning I hope you will address these issues so that other guests are not in the same situation Kind Regards , Location Nice rooms 
258402,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We requested an extra duvet and the new cover had eye makeup on it We requested a twin room in September for a January visit and was told the room type was subject to availability That should surely have been enough notice We had to pay for the upgrade to a bigger bed rather than have a double We were offered a king room that looked like a double Staff said the room was bigger than a twin room which was also a joke , The softness of the bed and the bathroom facilities in the room 
258403,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Check in took ages When we went down for breakfast we had to queue for at least 30 minutes When we finally got our pot of tea it was cold , Room was very nice with a comfortable bed 
258404,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, I thought the room for saying superior was going to be much bigger for the 220 a night fee The wash stuff didn t pump out so that took time to shower and the dressing mirror in the bedroom was just for show unless you are really tall , Lovely hotel and easy to locate once you knew the way Staff friendly Stayed one night and was 20 min walk to Leics sq so overall pretty good Room was clean etc and I loved the two long mirrors on the doors fab for when 2 are getting ready and no fighting The bathroom was lovely and spacious however shower was easy to work and nice 
258405,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, This hotel is in a great location as its a 5 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station The staff are friendly and the breakfast was great with a huge choice of food It was very good value for money 
258406,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, There was a strange smell on our floor not in our room but in the hallway Room got very hot at night Hotel restaurant staff were kind but seemed understaffed so service was a bit slow and tables remained uncleared after diners left for quite a long time , Location was great and room rate was good 
258407,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room upgrade the way this was suggested was that it was 40 but when come to pay it was 80 this was 40 per person this was done very slyly in my opinion and the room that we where upgraded to was not as nice as the room I had staid in a cupple of weeks earlier, Friendly staff
258408,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The hotel room was absolutely stunning I had also arranged for the hotel to decorate the room for my boyfriends birthday which was done so beautifully much better than expected The staff were so polite and tentative I couldn t of asked for a better service
258409,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Pillows in room were to big and didnt have any soft ones in the wardrobe and my boyfriend said he had the worst night sleep ever Getting served a drink in the bar area was under staffed and staff were very slow so you were left waiting a long time Drinks and cocktails were lovely when you finally got them , Great breakfast and got a free upgrade on the day which was really great due to it being my boyfriends birthday Reception staff were really helpful and quick I would stay again 
258410,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We ordered off the breakfast menu the first morning it was very slow the 2nd morning it didn t come at all and the waitress said we didn t place an order when we certainly had and it was difficult to get a member of the staffs attention, Location was good the room was fine
258411,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, My traveling mate s room stayed cool while mine was fine Her towel rack stayed cold while mine was burning Bar in dining room Lobster and Steak was way overpriced You couldn t just buy a simple cup of coffee in the morning so I went to nearby Pret Manger a savior Lobby not conducive for just sitting Music in the restaurant too thumping unnecessarily loud not sure why they think they need music to be so loud The best restaurants I know have NO music , Staff was helpful polite patient when I didn t like the obstructed view Each room had different view due to the older exterior s architecture Beds and room terrific Location excellent short walk to tube stations British Museum within sight 
258412,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Room location was awful view outside the window room 1019 was a bank of generators and fans that kept us awake through the night The room was also near the lifts that had tiled floors so all we heard was ping and clippy clopping high heels from one side of the room Not good at all for the price we paid for a Deluxe room, Well located and good standards
258413,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The lack of staff to cope with a very busy breakfast at 9 30 on the Sunday morning It was chaos food not replenished frozen bread tables not set correctly tables left dirty having to repeatedly ask for service of tea coffee cutlery butter sauce etc , Warm welcome and a friendly departure 
258414,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The room was rather small although it had a big bed The view was awful I wanted to go higher for the view and got a tiny view of flats , The cleanliness of the room and hotel was beautiful and the staff were all friendly and attentive 
258415,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, Cleanliness of rooms Additional extras such as shower caps shampoos etc The bed was very comfortable Staff were helpful when providing guidance to me about directions to landmarks There is a great selection at breakfast time 
258416,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Had a Twin room with shower prefer a bath but the option was not explained on your website, The location was between 2 and 15 min walks from where we needed to visit eg British Museum Soho and Shaftsbury Ave
258417,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, A few things that spoilt our stay Firstly the constant alarm that you could hear from our room We were on the 7th floor and I appreciate the alarm was coming from else where but it was difficult to sleep Secondly after a night out at the theatre we returned to the hotel with the intention to order room service after we missed our dinner resivation earlier in the evening due to traffic We called the number stated in the information book and to our surprise we were abruptly told the kitchen was closed and we needed to ring back in 5 minutes and order from the after midnight menu So we selected from the after midnight menu which is a bit more expensive but felt this was fair given the hour and the impressiveness of the late night menu Sadly the person that answered our second call was as unhelpful as the first Told me several times the kitchen was closed I said I understood but was it still ok to order a sandwich I gave my order to be told it was unlikely as they could only use what was left in the kitchen Why have an extensive evening menu for room service if the only thing they could offer me was a cheese and tomatoe sandwich But both being diabetic we needed to eat so agreed to the sandwich But it just got worse 20 or so minutes later a knock at the door Before I was even off the chair to answer the door the in room phone was ringing Which woke my mother I opened the door to find a very grumpy man rolling his eyes at me and thrusting the phone back in his pocket and literally shoving the plate at me He then asked me to sign the receipt which he placed on top of the covered sandwich which I was holding he appeared very impatient with me when I asked him to hold the sandwich while I signed it Seems silly I m sure but it was quite upsetting to e met with this attitude considering the cost of the room I ve honestly had nicer service in a travel lodge The most disappointing part of this whole story was the sandwich itself , Beautiful hotel very clean and felt luxurious The lady who checked us in was amazing Very professional yet friendly and put us at ease It s because of her that I ve not marked a lower score She referred to my previous emails and asked how our evening went for my mums birthday The lady that knocked the door offering a trim down service was lovely friendly and happy to explain I d lit a light on the out side of the door that meant I needed something She wasn t put out one bit that is made a mistake and was utterly lovely Also must mention the guy who seated us for breakfast was both cheerful funny and attentive 
258418,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We tried to get a drink when the bar was fairly busy with just two bar tenders working who not only failed to acknowledge waiting customers but we re pretty inept all round , The location was fantastic the reception staff and concierge were friendly and very helpful 
258419,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street,No Negative, The welcome and interest in our stay for your receptionist was lovely and she was so helpful The room 2030 was great with a really nice bathroom comfortable beds and lovely dual aspect 
258420,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We booked a superior twin room but were given a standard double fifth floor The view pretty awful When we complained we were told that it was because we booked via booking com They keep their twin rooms only for guests booking directly We were then moved to a king size double 1st floor a nice one However we were asked to move out after two nights as there happened to be a party right under our room And we were promised a business room as a compensation But in the end we ended up in another king size double 3rd floor very nice but extremely noisy We were too tired to complain again as it was just for one night At check in I gave the name of my company to the receptionist and I made sure she got the name right On the invoice at check out however was a completely different name unknown to me only the address was right Messy The staff at the reception has no idea which room is which and where it is located I would suggest providing the receptionists with some floor plans It would also be useful for the guests at check in to know where their room actually is , Breakfast was just perfect included in the price of the room I enjoyed the afternoon tea yummy scones as well as cocktails in the evening Rooms are spotless clean and so are the bathrooms Standard rooms are very small one feels like in a card box Superior and King size rooms are large enough Staff is very polite attentive and tries to be helpful 
258421,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The receptionist asked personal questions about whether someone was likely to join the guest later The guest felt embarrassed as she was travelling alone ,No Positive
258422,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Music far too loud in reception sitting area could not have a normal conversation even when sitting close Staff said they could not turn it down as it was set that way , Very friendly and helpful staff 
258423,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Had a small room for myself and daughter shared s small double bed in which was very uncomfortable , Staff very friendly and helpful location was brilliant easy to get to shops and restaurants 
258424,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The fact that they block your card for the total stay Then you pay again at checkout 3 weeks later my card is still blocked Hotel says not there problem as they release the blocked amount on payment Every day you see people at reception complaining about this , Great room for London standards
258425,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We was on 6th floor and was not advised that we had to enter our room card in the lift so we spent 15 mins going up and down in the lift in the end we asked the cleaner Also still awaiting 50 to be credited to my account as overpaid Checking in was a long wait and checking out not enough staff on the desk , Room was very presentable breakfast was great
258426,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Tiny tiny room this was the 4th time I stayed at this hotel and on previous occasions I always stayed in a normal size room to London standards This time however I got a very small room think large shoe box I never paid as much for my stay than this time so I was expecting a little bit more than an over sized shoe box , Very friendly staff excellent location very clean room and bathroom
258427,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Traffic noice from the street was so loud that I couldn t sleep without ear plugs Note that I m a very light sleeper I also can t get over the high prices of London hotels They are ridiculous , Great location a spacious room and a good breakfast 
258428,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Key cards to rooms were constantly not working which was annoying having to go up and down to reception to get them sorted , Rooms are beautifully furnished very clean along with good sized and spotless bathrooms Room service food was lovely and reasonably priced 
258429,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, No plugs in washbasin in bedroom Waste of water difficult when shaving Also had to ask for fried eggs at breakfast when they finally arrived they were like rubber needs improving , Attitude of staff friendly efficient very good 
258430,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The cooked breakfast was very lukewarm We appreciate it s difficult to make sure it s piping hot all the time but this really was disappointing especially alongside the superb choice of fruit etc , Friendly efficient staff both at reception and at breakfast very clean and comfortable room 
258431,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Reception staff a little off hand at times having conversation mid sentence receptionist answered the phone Female staff on reception very good, The room had all we needed Breakfast staff very attentive Location excellent
258432,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, the rooms tiny everything in the hotel every aspect was stingy the hotel reduce everything it was possible to economize on the stay was most an pleasant and spartan , location the stuff was pleasant and helpful
258433,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Bathroom shower water spilled out onto the floor due to a poor design and the bathtub was shallow, Great location down the block from the British Museum and within walking distance to Leicster Suare and Soho very conveniently located Also was not happy with the tv movie pay per view selection definitely needed updating Also couldn t believe that we needed to pay more money to watch cable channels based on our daily rate we stayed on the exclusive seventh floor which was a business floor bigger rooms and more Although the late check out was great together with the daily breakfast which was included in our stay
258434,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Them trying to get more money out of us do you want an upgrade no Are you sure yes Would you like to make a donation to charity , Excellent location everything within walking distance Breakfast great room lovely 
258435,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Over expensive for what you got Rooms are the biggest Sat right next to the buffet bar for breakfast which was not worth 21 Guests banging into your chair and walking between the tables Asked 3x for a pot of tea , Location
258436,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast Self service was cold the breakfast room was very crowded so it was pointless ordering something like an omelette or eggs benedict It took us ages for the staff to get our beverages Not their fault it s just so cramped and crowded in there , Ease of check in Friendliness of staff Comfortable well appointed room we got a free upgrade 
258437,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Party on till 1am music was loud I had booked a upgrade room as I didn t want it to be too small but our baby s box room was bigger Breakfast was a complete shambles from start to finish seated on dirty tables no tea coffee butter unless we got up and asked for it several times Just useless Management needs to sort out some form of structure in this place as it was embarrassing , The decor was quite nice and We did have our meal discounted due to complaint 
258438,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, 1 One of the lady in the front desk didn t didn t provide a very nice service Attitude 2 There was a hair on the bed 3 The hand towel had a yellow stain 4 Recommendation I saw there was a tag on the bathrobe saying Want to take this home Sure we will take 80 couldn t remember from your card Personally I think this sentence is not OK , Great great location in central London Very convenient to go everywhere 
258439,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, there is nothing we didn t like would recommend to anyone, staff all great lovely and clean and spacious room food in the restaurant was delicious great location and would definitely go back again
258440,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We were celebrating our mums 60th birthday and phoned ahead to inform the hotel of this I was told that they would put a cake in the room for her however this never happened We were also on the 5th floor where there was work on other rooms being carried out which we were not informed of At 8am each morning the noise was very loud and due to work being carried out there was an awful smell in the corridor , Hotel was clean and staff friendly especially the helpful doorman Breakfast was tasty with lots of variety and location of hotel was fairly good for getting around and close to tube station 
258441,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The staff member checking us out wasn t terribly friendly and wasn t very helpful explaining what our different charges were for , It was very clean and attractive 
258442,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The washbasin and mixer tap Also the temperature control system for the room did not work satisfactorily , The helpful gentleman who looked after us for breakfasts 
258443,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Lighting is very dim and the room carpet was quite dusty so may bother those with allergies , Very decent hotel in a great location Lobby has nice decor Bed is comfy and shower is wonderful 
258444,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, We booked this hotel as it very clearly said that single beds were an option for the deal we paid for When we got there the staff advised that not to be the case and we had to pay an exorbitant amount to have a rollaway put in the room I would not ever recommend this hotel because of what I consider was misleading advertising I will never consider a Radisson again because of my experience, Jug of fruit enhanced water at reception 
258445,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Asked for a twin bed room as travelling with my cousin not husband we had a small double bed we were very disappointed with this, Friendly staff nice breakfast
258446,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Cooked breakfast was very disappointing Food not hot and swimming in water juice Waited 20 minutes for butter having asked 3 members of staff for some , Rooms lovely Clean and staff wonderful 
258447,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The breakfast was a disaster Had to wait for someone to take us to a table for 4 5mins and then we had enough and just walked to a table We have our table number to a waitress Had to wait a further 10 mins for 2 poached eggs and 1 fried egg People waiting for ages for a table no organisation no communication between staff, Really comfy bed and great location

258451,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Right after checking in we went to our room and there was pee in the toilet And foot stamps on the bathroom floor I thought the manager would react stronger but all he did was to send someone to clean the bathroom and change our room the next day No discount No one free night Nothing One day we came to our room to find A DIRTY RAG sitting on the chair Again no strong reaction from the staff After reporting it to the manager he sent the housekeeper to pick it up The bed was stiff The bedsheets kept on pulling out of the bed while sleeping And the duvet covers as well which I found disgusting My key kept on stopping THE WHOLE STAY I had to replace it every other day if not twice a day It was really painful to go up to my room and to find out that the key does no longer work Then to go all the way to the reception to get it replaced The towels were a bit rough , Most of the staff were friendly especially the ones at the breakfast buffet The wifi is really good Good location 
258452,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Layout of tables for breakfast right next to self service buffet meaning other guests constantly squeezing past with plates etc, Staff lobby atmosphere 
258453,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was lovely but needed a wider choice of cereals as there were only two , Fantastic location and helpful staff Nice extra touches e g Offering a towel on entry to guests given the torrential rain and complimentary use of an umbrella kept in wardrobe 
258454,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Dinning area far too cramped Unable to get to the food bar unless you bump into diners Very Bad layout and would alter my decision to stay here again, Hotel and staff were as we expected of a Raddisson Hotel
258455,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Switch in dark area of room which was supposed to be on to have room cleaned Expensive bar , Excellent location Beautifully decorated Really friendly and helpful staff 
258456,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Apart from one member of staff who seated us for breakfast who was excellent and made us feel very welcome the other staff wearnt welcoming or warm at all and made us feel on edge for what should have been a really special stay as it was our anniversary apart from the staff the food and hotel is itself is lovely, Lovely hotel food and services were excellent yet service wasn t fantastic
258457,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The staff in the restaurant breakfast had serious morale issues They were not friendly looked as though they really didn t want to be bothered or be there I really didn t want to ask them for anything and so took butter cutlery off other tables so I wouldn t have to bother them Our group also witnessed two separate altercations between hotel guests and the restaurant staff once at night and once in the morning The restaurant staff really let the hotel down and were not a true reflection of the rest of the hotel This was not at all what I expected whilst entertaining two friends who are new to London The reception staff were excellent , The reception staff were excellent Interior of main hotel areas were very nice 
258458,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Breakfast was awful along with the service We asked 3 different waiting staff for a teaspoon and some butter by the time we got it it was 10 min after the last time we asked and our tea got cold along with our toast We asked for more tea and that took too long as well so we just got up and left Bacon had more fat than bacon scrambled egg looked nothing like scrambled egg beans all mushy and non of it was very hot We arrived around 6pm and one or our room was still not ready The floor in the bedroom by the bed felt like it had holes under the carpet and very uneven We had to wait at least 15 min to book out as there was a long que, Location reception staff was nice and friendly helpful 
258459,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, Stayed for two days First breakfast was perfect in terms of food and service Next day complete opposite 15 min wait for tea which was served without cups Asked for butter and received some form of grunt followed by a plate thrown in my hand had a pancake which was like leather , Gorgeous room comfortable bed everywhere spotlessly clean Location was great 
258460,Radisson Blu Edwardian Bloomsbury Street, The noise of traffic from outside we were on floor two although not too bad it could still be heard also banging of room doors in the early hours of the morning , Everything about this hotel was really good friendly and courteous staff breakfast was excellent
