972,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Air con not great , Great location and very comfortable rooms Room was available for early check in Easy walk to attractions and trains for onward journey 
973,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal , We had the most basic room which was great value as well as spacious and comfortable
974,Apex Temple Court Hotel, No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food , Standard rooms are very comfortable Good central location 
975,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Very large room Hidden courtyard view with backdrop of the city is beautiful Short walk to public transport Blackfriars Tube Station and Temple Station

977,Apex Temple Court Hotel, It would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station Customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel , Guest svc manager Francesco was very helpful with our questions on places to go and ways to get there Room bed was extremely comfortable and good sized Bathroom was also a good sized bathroom with a long bath and a cute Apex duck a very cute and novel idea

981,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, we were very pleased with the Hotel and were especially pleased at the spaciousness of the Standard room and the quietness of the bedrooms and corridors

985,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Nothing, Brilliant location so close to the tube Room was GORGEOUS and spacious lovely and modern The hotel was quiet and so so clean Loved it Really made our stay extra relaxing 
986,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while , Nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area 
987,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi , The location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the Underground Tube We also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district There were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice The staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly They also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them 
988,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows , We were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite As part of that you get access to the Club Lounge The room was lovely Looked as new comfy bed very clean And the Club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available 24hrs 
989,Apex Temple Court Hotel, They don t have parking and there is no easy parking available nearby , Very comfortable room Spacious bathroom Excellent service Great location 
990,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation The view from the hotel was quite uninspiring , Easy to reach Covent Garden Soho and City However the hotel is quite far away from Westminster Room is clean comfy and nicely designed Very nice couch good bath
991,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Book a room that comes with access to the Club Lounge The Club Lounge offers a continental breakfast free water soda wine and beer throughout the day and sandwiches and fruit during the afternoon The coffee machine makes the best lattes along with a variety of other types of coffees and hot chocolate This lounge really made the stay for us 
992,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary A la carte was also possible but we didn t try , Although it s a fairly big hotel the overall vibe we got was very cozy which we liked a lot Staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we needed Upon arrival we received a reduction coupon for the breakfast The location is exquisite 
993,Apex Temple Court Hotel, More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets , Very clean large rooms with high value toiletries Extremely comfortable bed and pillows Friendly staff 
994,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, This is without question one of London finest Hotels I have never slept that well in a very very longtime and I love the duck Amazing reception and great facilities 
995,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody 
996,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft , The hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic The room and bed were extremely comfortable Excellent personalised service Food was excellent 
997,Apex Temple Court Hotel, This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time ,No Positive
998,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building, The design facilities and location of the hotel WIFI and also Gym were quite convenient
999,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too , Staff were lovely reception sent a card and a box of chocolates up for my birthday Room service food was fantastic and nice cocktails served in the bar Room wasn t the biggest but had everything we needed Very clean and lovely bathroom too 
1000,Apex Temple Court Hotel, A few more little milks maybe as I drink a lot of tea but I was given a little jug of milk when I asked , The bathroom was light pleasant and very clean The wardrobe space was good and there were tea making facilities The bed was comfortable 
1001,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels , The room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious 
1002,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Nothing your doing a fantastic job, Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again 
1003,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better , It was located in a cosy corner off the street 
1004,Apex Temple Court Hotel, If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything , The staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely
1005,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction , Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment 
1006,Apex Temple Court Hotel, At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel , Beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent 
1007,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay , The location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket 
1008,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view , The staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly The shower and bath were fantastic 
1009,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them , Staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm Good location to walk around London 
1010,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector , Nice bathroom with big shower and bath Quiet if you get a room on the top floors 
1011,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, I spend the weekend in the Apex Hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from Apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london For this THANK YOU SO MUCH We will come back Best regards Theresa
1012,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street , Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud 
1013,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed , Comfortable room which was very clean
1014,Apex Temple Court Hotel, My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison ,No Positive
1015,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Everything was genuinely perfect , Everything from the reception greeting of Luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception The cleaning staff were polite and warm My standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room 
1016,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Nothing Our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our Green Band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors, Very comfortable and clean room Balcony was a little plus 
1017,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code , Alex Hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was amazing Free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh 
1018,Apex Temple Court Hotel, It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room , Hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex hotel 
1019,Apex Temple Court Hotel, its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet, location would have been great
1020,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this , Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing 
1021,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries 
1022,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast , Location of the hotel
1023,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Really lovely and luxurious hotel Special thanks to Gosia on Reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you Gosia 
1024,Apex Temple Court Hotel, A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans , The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable 
1025,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side , Excellent location good standard of hotel Professional service
1026,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked ,No Positive
1027,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but I am aware I m fussy with my baths , Location was reason for booking and was spot on Staff were all very pleasant Time was spent out and about as we were visiting friends and family so didn t use facilities or eat breakfast Room was clean and tidy with great black out curtains Check out swift and easy 
1028,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Location of the hotel is fantastic The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and the staff are very helpful The room was massive particularly considering its location in London The breakfast had a great selection and was perfect to prepare for a long day walking around London 
1029,Apex Temple Court Hotel, A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room , Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location 
1030,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay , Given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience 
1031,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted , Room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need Bed was very comfortable as well The surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road
1032,Apex Temple Court Hotel, 1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced , The bed really confortable Location is good walking distance to tube and train 
1033,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Can t think of anything that could have been improved , Room was gorgeous and very clean Lovely big bed High quality furnishings and technology and air con as well which was an unexpected bonus 
1034,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating Pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go , Location and price so close to Christmas was awesome room upgrade on arrival was much appreciated after a long and difficult flight Staff very welcoming and attentive helped us with our bags and shopping when we checked in and out were on hand to order taxis and help It was also quiet and out of the way despite the central location 
1035,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Sorry can t think of any negative thing , It is tucked away but near to public transport The staff were friendly efficient and helpful Their restaurant had a great selection at reasonable prices Beds comfortable very clean and we had a lovely walk in shower 
1036,Apex Temple Court Hotel, How hasn t this place got a extra star It should be five star not four , What didn t we like about the hotel it was beautiful We loved everything at the Apex we couldn t ask for any more the staff were so lovely friendly The food and the cocktails were amazing made with the best ingredients the room was beautiful and amazing so modern and comfy just never wanted to leave the room The nights sleep was one of the best we ve had in ages And the Elemis free toiletries was a lovely touch Elemis is a amazing brand to use 
1037,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Really we could find fault with nothing , The location so close to the centre but beautifully quiet The efficiency of the whole operation including breakfast which is often the weak link in hotels The stylish decor within an old style exterior 
1038,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The basin doesn t seem to be clean enough It s difficult to drain waters down the basin, Location Close to city center Big Ben and river Thames 5 minutes walk to Temple station Bed is comfortable
1039,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty , The location was great near the main attractions but nice and quite The staff was more than helpful

1041,Apex Temple Court Hotel, As always the price of breakfast is far too expensive There are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices , The location of the hotel is perfect It s within walking distance of the major attractions of the city or close to Temple or Blackfriars tube stations should you want to go further afield The superior rooms have very modern decor and the large bath is a real pleasure after a long day walking There are safes in the rooms and tea and coffee making facilities for that first morning cuppa The room was very quiet at night the bed is very large and comfortable the curtains keep the light out overall giving a good nights sleep The staff are very attentive polite and helpful 
1042,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We heard our neighbors bathroom in the night, We arived the hotel late in the night and the staff service was exelent without extra charge upgraded our room The ducks idea is unique and fun

1049,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The rooms and corridors were much to hot however I was able to lower the temperature in the room There is absolutely nothing else to complain about A lovely hotel, I liked the green elephant outside The condition of the room after it was cleaned was exceptional The bathroom was stunning Having a free bottle of still and sparkling water every day was brilliant There was an ironing board kettle hairdryer safe fridge Free wifi I was very comfortable the whole stay It was also very quiet Food in the restaurant was 5 star
1050,Apex Temple Court Hotel, There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup , Love Elemis toiletries modern bathroom and clean Liked that the shower was separate to the bath Beds comfy Overall very pleased 
1051,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available I did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free , Room and comfy bed

1053,Apex Temple Court Hotel, I realise that good accommodation is expensive in central London but neverthelessI feel this hotel is somewhat costly We were on a room only rate so I cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel , The location is unbeatable both from the point of view of access to all the sites and attractions of central London but also the area where the hotel is located is very attractive The hotel is quite The staff were very friendly facilities in the bedroom and bathroom were first class 
1054,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day Maybe need to book very early to get a good deal , Great sized room and bathroom with separate bath Very comfortable bed and nice touch of some free jelly beans 
1055,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered Service was very slow one hour and a Half for 1 burger 1 risotto and 2 pies , Room was excellent bed very comfy and quiet staff were great especially Leandro who was working in the bar on sa
1056,Apex Temple Court Hotel, I can t think of anything that could have been improved , Staff were extremely friendly and efficient I mentioned that we were taking the trip to celebrate my husband s birthday so staff arranged for chocolates to be left in the room which was a lovely surprise Breakfast really good too 
1057,Apex Temple Court Hotel, All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping , The location of the hotel is great Room and bed were comfortable and clean We arrived at the hotel a few hours before check in time however we were able to get an early check in with no problems Would definitely stay there again

1059,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips , Enjoyed use of club lounge perfect for continental breakfast Hotel not too big Situation great for visiting many tourist sights Would stay again 
1060,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else , The bed was extremely comfortably And the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it 
1061,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, They were more than accommodating with allowing early check in and complementary late check out Would really recommend the Apex group of hotels for your business or leisure travels

1066,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive , Location and staff were excellent arrived early and was aloud to check in with no problems

1069,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky, Room was spacious as was the bathroom with lovely complimentary toiletries Beds were extremely comfy Check in and out was a breeze and staff were attentive Great cocktails in the bar
1070,Apex Temple Court Hotel, All good , The room was good size very clean and comfortable Good menu at reasonable prices Best to get room with club access for a little more money as you will save this on breakfast alone

1087,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned , The bed was very comfortable and the pillows were really plump The bathroom was a descent size and the shower was especially good due to its size my wife and I also had food in the restaurant my steak was full of flavour and cooked to perfection and my wife really enjoyed her salmon I passed this view on to the chef because I think in England were to quick to complain and don t compliment very often The whole room was nicely decorated

1090,Apex Temple Court Hotel, In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault , The hotel was a 5 minute walk from Blackfriars station Beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance On arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade Rooms were fantastic with everything you need Ideal for our romantic weekend away Bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs They had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in London without our case having to come with us Also a 10 minute walk from Covent Garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t

1117,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day , Staff were brilliant rooms spacious proximity to where we were going amazing and free rubber duck

1120,Apex Temple Court Hotel, When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months , The hotel is great The staff was friendly and very helpful actually this is one of the reasons that I will visit the hotel again The room superior double 5th floor was excellent and it had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard Considering the central location it was quiet with a nice view of the rooftops Very clean good sleep And I liked it aesthetically It has a unique style for example nice colors in the rooms the elephant and the cow outside the hotel I would definitely recommend it

1124,Apex Temple Court Hotel, We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading , We were mother and daughter away for a few days in London The room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring

1129,Apex Temple Court Hotel, area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only 10 15 mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception , very modern comfy rooms very clean lovely staff good wifi ok location good breakfast not included with room price

1132,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything , Beautiful hotel Everything was very clean bed was VERY comfortable Drinks at the bar were great and staff there was pleasant

1147,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Bar and food prices but then it is London and the whole City is a rip off , Close to a lot of things and that added walk will do you the world of good Although on Fleet Street it s tucked away and suffers little from street traffic noise The bed was probably the best I have ever slept in

1162,Apex Temple Court Hotel, My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI ,No Positive
1163,Apex Temple Court Hotel, The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated , I did not like very much The location was good There was a good shower That is about it 
1164,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Room was lovely Spacious and luxurious Excellent bathroom One of the comfiest beds we ve slept in Location is quiet and yet so convenient We walked to Drury Lane very easily and quickly And it s on a bus route from Paddington so we had a leisurely scenic journey back to our train

1176,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Absolutely nothing, Staff always had time for us and when they printed out tickets for the Tower of London for us gave us great advice to visit the Crown Jewels straight away as the queues build up later This proved to be the case 
1177,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage, Great connection to public transport polite service

1339,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, Although it s a busy city centre hotel it felt really peaceful and relaxing throughout The soundproofing in the bedrooms must be excellent because we hardly heard anybody else

1348,Apex Temple Court Hotel, Breakfast is very expensive 21 12 5 even if compared to hotels like the Househorse Guards where it costs some 18 for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service It s better to go to Balthazar or even a Starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get , The hotel is clean and well located between both Temple and Chancery Lane tube stations but not exactly that close to them The room size is very good clean and you ll find everything you need The bed is more for the very soft kind I personally would prefer them to be neither soft nor hard Staff is efficient and very kind 
1349,Apex Temple Court Hotel,No Negative, What a superb hotel The room we had was beautiful and we had a great view of the London Eye As it was my boyfriends 30th birthday they also provided a complimentary cake Everything we wanted to get to was in walking distance which meant traveling round even late at night was easy
