426433,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, Didn t realize it from the hotel description but there s basically no hotel territory just the inner yard No view from the rooms either Furniture and bathroom charming but old , Great neighborhood with many good restaurants within walking distance Big rooms Great breakfast with fresh fruits and local products We were glad to stay away from the noise of the city center 
426434,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, The room had a bad smell There is no air conditioner and we had to open the window which attracted many mosquitos The sofa bed was uncomfortable for our 5 year old son , The breakfast was very good and the staff was extremely helpful 
426435,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, Nothing Leave the hotel as it is , The hotel ishantastic the people are very nice and the inside of the hotel with the beautiful Austrian furniture is very nice I went to the restaurant owned by the sister of the owner Meriella Huber and I have been traveling for 50 years all over the world but I have never seen a bathroom so clean as in that restaurant Psst Very convenient to such a good restaurant close by The breakfast is excellent what ever is on the market is at that breakfast table 
426436,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber,No Negative, The room was lovely with a balcony overlooking the flowery yard the halls and the inner courtyard were beautiful with a relaxed atmosphere friendly guests and staff
426437,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, It takes a few connections of public transport to get there from central Vienna but the transport is very reliable and stops very close , It is a charming family run guest house hotel in a village where there are some nice places to eat and drink the village wine I liked the village feel of it after the trams and crowds of central Vienna They provide an excellent breakfast 
426438,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, No Bacon and Sausage at breakfast , Very nice European style breakfast a little difficult to find initially but once you know where you are going it is great Vienna travel system is very easy
426439,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, nothing , Beautiful very comfortable hotel Staff were very friendly and approachable The breakfast had a great selection and we loved the village the hotel was located in with its own vineyard The village has a good variety of restaurants very close by Not in the centre of Vienna and it takes a bus tram to get into the city but a good reliable transport service allowed us to do this easily We would thoroughly recommend this hotel 
426440,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber, The hotel does its best with the resources it has however an elevator from the parking garage to the main floor would be helpful for people with baby strollers or disabilities There is an elevator in the building that goes up from the main floor however to get to it one still needs to get up a small set of stairs , A very cozy great atmosphere hotel not far from Vienna s center Located on a quiet street Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber invites with its feels like home decor with old late 19th early 20th century chests and wardrobes board games and books for guests perusal and a restaurant that literally used to be someone s dining room a long time ago The room was spacious and well kept The hotel also has an underground garage which was very helpful for us in the winter Breakfast buffet was very good albeit simple The food quality is high Staff is very friendly and helpful 
426441,Hotel Landhaus Fuhrgassl Huber,No Negative, I like the fact that staff has been very efficient in giving directions how to get to hotel from the airport how to get to different locations from the hotel where to eat etc It is very easy to get around because of the staff s spot on instructions for direction The staff is also always willing to help You feel the genuine concern that they have and they always want to make you feel as comfortable as possible The room was always clean when I get back from a day of touring different parts of Vienna The breakfast every morning was filling You could have fresh eggs cooked however you want it and hot chocolate There is an array of cold cuts cheeses breads spreads cereals and fruits I even had some food packed for snack for the rest of my day The location although a bit on the outskirt isn t a problem at all The transport system was efficient and it s nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet and relaxing atmosphere where the hotel is Lastly when I checked out the nice lady gave me a free ticket to get to the airport because my 72 hour vienna card has already expired I appreciate the gesture again the entire staff make you feel as comfortable as possible
