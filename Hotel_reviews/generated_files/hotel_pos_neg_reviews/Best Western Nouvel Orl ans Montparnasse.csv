121613,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Reception at arrival was very poor disappointing Lift very small even to lift a stroller No staff to help in luggage specially we had a 10 months baby , Metro station very close 
121614,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, A clean towel was stained would have asked for a replacement had we stayed longer , Lovely large comfy bed Clean room apart from dodgy towel Out of town so easy to get to with car but with excellent shops restaurants bars close at hand Metro station a few steps away to get you into the hub The Car Parking felt safe and was very good once we worked it out It was great as an overnight stop but would seriously consider staying longer Good value for Paris
121615,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse,No Negative, I want to highlight the support received by the Front Desk responsible Alexandre and the BEST Babysitter EVER Charlotte We planned to be in Paris for the Coldplay show We originally were my wife my 12yo daugther and myself In the last minute we had to change a little bit our plans and bring to Paris also our 3yo boy I asked for a Babysitter service to take care of our boy during the afternoon of the show not an easy thing considering that he is always sticked around his mother and he only manage to speak his very particular Spanish Alexandre made the arrangements to have the Fabulous Charlotte in charge and the result was OUTSTANDING A very BIG THANKS Charlotte and Alexandre Without your assistance our plan to attend to this fantastic show in Paris wouldn t be possible I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR FAMILIES On a logistic aspect the metro station Mouton Duvernet is just crossing the street and you can get any place in the city from there 
121616,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Don t really like the toilet separate from the shower and wash basin but I suppose it is worth it for the extra space in the room Also the hotel insists on the keycard being handed to reception every time you leave which seems a bit old fashioned , Unexpectedly good sized room for the centre of Paris USB charger in the wall socket Fast free wifi 
121617,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Parking was in plaza close buy and no lift there Rooms were exceptionally small Toilet and shower were seperate in small room and were very small area in room AC cooling was not good and staff could not do much about it All A C split unit needed was cleaning of filter and gas reload , Next to underground metro 
121618,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The single room is not spacial especially the bathroom design and facility are incredible e g the sink is too small to be used , I have to say the hotel is not that recommendable except its good location 
121619,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Small room for four people the bed were a sofa bad and wasnt very good not enough place to put our luggage , The hotel is in front of a Subway station and it had a lot of good places to eat close to the hotel The staff was very polite and helpfull we had trouble with our flight been canceled and the recepcionist called the Airline Company trying to help us Even though the room was very small for four people it was very comfortable It had a coffee machine and a minibar inside the room great shower and clean bathroom 
121620,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse,No Negative, The location is great Metro access outside the hotel The lift is a bit crowded old but it s cool Overall we had a great time at the place 
121621,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The color scheme in the rooms is bold and may not be to everyones taste Rooms are a bit on the small side The single elevator is VERY small and very slow The pillows are not that comfortable a feather pillow option wold be nice , Extremely convenient location close to RER B direct to CDG Airport as well as OrlyBus to Orly at Denfert Rochereau 500metres away Easy access to the Metro and buses to take you to wherever you would like to go in Paris Eg bus 68 which stops in front of the hotel passes St Germain de Pres Musee d Orsay the Louvre the Opera and Galeries Lafayette Printemps department stores along its route Traffic along the street is relatively heavy but I have not been bothered on my 2 stays I ve stayed on the 3rd and 6th floor and with A C you do not need to keep the windows open Staff are helpful enough without being overwhelmingly so Breakfast is decent value but if you have the time to stroll around there are better options in the neighbourhood Rooms are well equipped and clean The beds are great Very good bathrooms if judging by Paris standard Very good selection of restaurants along Rue Daguerre which is a block and a half away Also L Ordonnance restaurant deserves a special mention also about 1 2 blocks away but in the opposite direction from Rue Daguerre 
121622,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Poor view from window an alley Carpets were dark and apparently a little dirty impossible to know for sure Room was a bit small for the price , Staff was very friendly and helpful Breakfast was fresh tasty and ample Very near Metro and other transportation Good access to food markets Locale is generally safe and welcoming 
121623,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The elevator I do realize it was an older hotel and space is tight and expensive in Paris I m grateful it was there but it was frustrating not being able to get the elevator quickly some of the time I think I was there 9 days so quite a long time , I did not take the breakfast so cannot evaluate that For the costs in Paris I think it was a very good deal I ve been in small elevators in Europe but this takes the prize I was one person and had a 21 inch suitcase and a carry on and I could not have fit another paperclip in the elevator And there is only ONE Several times in the morning I was on 6th floor which I believe was the highest I would walk down because it took too long to try to get elevator I figured out that the day I left I needed to allow plenty of extra time in case the elevator was booked by someone else I HAD to have the elevator then Once I came home in the evening I was reluctant to go out again because of how difficult the elevator situation was I know I ve dwelt a lot on this But overall I know how expensive hotel rooms are and for the most part this was a good experience The room was very tight in the way furniture was arranged and it was not easy to figure out how to use my laptop on the small desk The staff was very good and I m appreciative of their assistance since I did travel solo Hotel is RIGHT across the street from Metro I do wish I had figured out however how convenient the bus stop was It didn t involve all those stairs that the Metro did you could see things on the surface of the streets But that was my fault Great location clean reasonably priced for high cost Paris and appeared safe I did like the heated towel rack It was handy for rinsing out some clothing items and they dried quickly I did appreciate the mini bar so I could store water or soda bottles and fruit or yogurt I liked the safe
121624,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Double bed is in fact two single beds tightened together which may be a problem for a young couple This problem is common for small European hotels though Small bathroom not too small but still , Beautiful and cozy rooms Very friendly staff
121625,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Rooms are very small Car can be parked on the street but you have to pay between 8 am and 8 pm Problem the maximum length of a parking ticket for non residents is 2 hrs Better come without car , Refrigerator in the room Bed was really big and comfortable Windows are soundproof room was silent although it was on the road side Subway station just 20 meters from hotel entrance 
121626,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The wifi did NOT work properly most of the time probably too little bandwidth for all the customers Breakfast was basic and definitely NOT worth 13 Euros , There is a metro station of line 4 directly in front of the hotel this takes you into the heart of Paris within 15 minutes 
121627,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse,No Negative, It s an Amazing Hotel Had to book urgently there and we ended up staying the whole duration of the trip Amazing Hotel Nice People Excellent Location 
121628,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The hotel itself was dirty The carpets had dark stains all over and the cleaning staff throws things into the narrow hallways as did the construction workers leaving us tripping over vacuums and dirty laundry It s also rather dimly lit in the hallways , The place had nice decor and the desk mate Aleksander was very accommodating 
121629,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, noise noise and noise once again We got a quiet room facing some dumpster better than facing the street and I mean it but extremely thin walls made us hear everything I mean absolutely everything couple upstairs having romantic moments or using toilet neighbours moving their luggage neighbours talking to each other people walking on corridors Also there was some shouting in the middle of the night included in the package deal that woke us up 2 nights out of 3 people were shouting from floor below us and we could hear them very well very poor facilities no bar no really waiting area no nothing staff they were not bad they just did not care We had the fastest check in out in the world and I do not mean it in a positive way We got zero information about hotel facilities if there are any breakfast etc we just got a room key and wifi password Another thing is how the receptionist lady checked if our room is ready she basically started yelling like crazy to somebody upstairs and after several shouts she got confirmation that the room is ready yay our room was cleaned although we left card saying we do not wish it to be cleaned, As I do not want to leave this part of my review blank for the first time since I joined booking com let me say that the receptionist gentleman was ok as he at least smiled
121630,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Some noise from other rooms not sure if soundproofing is 100 but didn t ruin trip , Great location comfortable beds and rooms nice bathrooms and easy to get to shops restaurants and attractions 
121631,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, I was in my room when the cleaning lady wanted to come in She opened the door and wanted to enter and was not happy because i didn t let her i was just out from my shower , Perfect location Good breakfast Staff at the reception desk very friendly and helpful 
121632,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Like a lot of European hotels a 4 star is really more like a North American 3 star The lobby is tiny There s not really comfortable common area , Very friendly staff clean room quiet right across from subway station not as touristy as right bank
121633,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, the layout of the room was a bit funny as there were 2 rooms but the desk almost touched the bed so the use of space was a bit strange, breakfast was good and was good value for the express one
121634,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Room is very very very small There is no place to left luggages If you put the luggages you cannot walk in the room When you open the door the door touch the bedstand Elevator Old and small Also you need the call elevator five minutes before getting out the room , Location In front of metro station and very close to OrlyBus Station Denfert Rochereau We could leave our luggages after check out Umbrella Coffee and tea in the room Airconditioner
121635,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The lift is the scariest thing on earth This definitely needs replacing or upgrading to somewhere else in the hotel I don t understand how they haven t changed it or had complaints about it before , The room is great I wish we had breakfast thrown in for the price Location isn t too bad 
121636,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, the desk was too close to the bed and not very big which made it almost impossible to sit at the tv would not turn off from BBC which was fine we reported it to the receptionist when we went out and it was still on when we came back after 2 hours, good location and staff room had 2 sections as it was a triple with a tv in each and toilet in one and shower in the other two nice balconies with the one at the front overlooking the main road
121637,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Very thin walls if you re keen to have a really quiet place this is not your case you ll be hearing every neighbour s activity around your room This is the only disadvantage, Very close to metro station line 4 that goes to Notre Dame and to Les Halles few minutes to RER to CDG airport Nice breakfast nice rooms 
121638,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, the hotel was too expensive for what it offered inconvenient elevator very small and slow if you have luggage this is ok for a cheap hotel but not for 340 E per night breakfast in the basement also without any daylight this is too expensive very dark room hard to work there for business because you need the lamps and the light of those was not bright and rather dark loud traffic even if the windows were closed you could hear the cars and the street was very much frequented with cars,No Positive
121639,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse,No Negative, The hotel is comfortable and clean the staff is friendly and nice There are a lot of restaurants and shops around but not noisy Will be back if we come to Paris again 
121640,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The elevator is quite small and old and we usually had to wait quite a while to get on it From reception to the room it looks quite old and dark inside but auto on lights on the halls light your way , The room and bathroom were very clean and very comfortable The room supplies were very nice The location of the hotel was OK and over the main street 
121641,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Not sure why this is classified as a 4 star The lobby and hallways look like a 2 star The Junior suite washroom were very small but still modern I bit tight for your suitcases and to walk around your bed , The rooms were clean and the internet was very good 
121642,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Bathroom floor is really cild in the winter, Nice location cool design in the rooms friendly staff shops and restaurants close metro 15 metres away 
121643,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The person at reception when we arrived was strange and not very welcoming The person there when we left on the other hand was very friendly and competent I feel the lobby has a cheap vibe that doesn t come back in the rest of the hotel could be better , The room was small but very nice and practical The door of the room is extremely heavy for safety reasons obviously and that makes leaving it with a lot of luggage complicated 
121644,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, It needs a soap dish to put soap around the sink And there is no shower cabinet or shower curtain for the tub It is difficult to take a shower without splashing the water , The room was so clean Breakfast was so delicious and enough Good location
121645,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Double rooms are too small If you have a stroller the elevator will only fit that nothing more very tiny elevator so several trips if your a family Also stairs are narrow slim and tiny so makes it difficult with kids or luggage Wifi was hit or miss and the computer was so slow I could not print out my tickets or access the page My parents said breakfast was also not worth it for the extra pay so we never tried it we just went out , Great location to metro staff spoke English the triple room was spacious but the double is very tiny so if your use to space shell out for the triple There is lots of shopping good restaurants and the catacombs are three blocks away 
121646,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, For the first time the rate of the hotel at website booking com 8 2 did not reflect the real situation First il is definitely not a 4 stars hotel Forget about it No standard of 4 stars hotel not even 3 stars in many aspects The room was extremely small even for the Paris standards and for sure it was not of the 14 sq m surface what was promissed during the booking Some of the rooms are bigger but we have got a really small room which however the receptionist defined as bigger that the others The entrance to the bathroom was right in the middle of one side of the bed and only 25cm from it so it was very difficult to step or move there The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen Once the door was closed it was very difficult to open the door to enter the shower or even simply to turn around The more so the decoration of the whole room was very dark the wall stores on the windows the floor etc what made the room even smaller In our room the predominant colour was violet which in some countries is a colour of the mourning We asked for another room they promissed to do something but they did not do anything despite of the fact that they had at least one room free that night which was bigger but as it was a room for 2 1 persons they did not decide to upgrade us leaving us unhappy in our room Then they decided to resolve the problem the following day but it was never happened they gave up this problem and never come to us again with the solution or justification We stayed the whole stay 4 night with the room being far below the standards expected from the booking com site To summerise we did not like at all the decoration of the hotel The main hall is not nice the main entrance to the hotel is even worse similar like in very cheap hotels The corridors are also very dark all that is very depressing , The room is newly renovated Althought we did not like the decoration style it should be underlined that the facilities are new and the decoration is fresh on the website the room example looked much better that in the reality We appreciated the fridge safe box coffe maker in the room and free water offered by the hotel but only for the first night The breakfast is good and various as for the French standards also meat cheese yogurts not only croissants and confiture however after 2 days remain very monotonous for ex eggs only in one style des oeufs brouilles and already prepared so not really freshly cooked and always the same type of ham or cheese or even pastries The lady at the breakfast was correct but not friendly without any smile We liked also the balcony on the 5th floor it was convenient to have a look on the Paris streets We appreciate also a nice welcome at the reception the day of our arrival by Alexandre very professional and kind person We appreciated also a good location not very far from the metro station and in a lively area 
121647,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Just the first lady could have been more pleasant The rest was lovely, The location was perfect as it was quiet and just a short walk to the metro The Orly bus was there too which was perfect as we had flown in from Heathrow to Orly One guy on Monday and Tuesday and Sunday was great but the lady on Saturday was a bit surly I had paid extra for an upgraded room but wasn t sure I actually got one Breakfast was marvellous didn t mind about the lift 
121648,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The shower needed a screen to protect the remainder of the bathroom shower water tended to spray everywhere even with using little pressure , Nice and quiet Comfy beds Awesome location with useful rail links around the remainder of Paris 
121649,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Not sure if it s the norm in France but fans in the toilet room and shower are would be an asset I know things can be hectic for housekeeping but they were inconsistent at replenishing our nespresso station , We had a rear facing room not so picturesque but greatly minimized the steet noise The location for metro access was excellent Lovely area with good shopping bakeries and restaurants The shower was fabulous bed was comfy rooms are modern and very nice Good wifi too The nespresso machine in room was lovely 
121650,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, A bit more space to move around in the room would have been nice , The best plugging availability we have ever seen including direct USB plug Very chic and parisian decor in the room 
121651,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, No exhaust in the toilet Sometimes the cleaners forget to put back the toiletries near the sink or arrange back the bedside drawers after cleaning , The room and bathroom are modern and always maintained The receptionists are friendly and speaks english except for the lady on the last day during our check out 
121652,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Small room for a 4 stars hotel, Renovated Special Paris decoration Friendly receptionist accepted to serve us breakfast to our room exceptionally after we woke up late 
121653,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Did not like the black stairway landing d cor Very dark The lift was very small and needed TLC to use , Clean well looked after bedroom Efficient and pleasant receptionist 
121654,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Wifi was poor in both rooms Small elevator but that s typical for Paris , Perfect location close to metro station We had breakfast further down the street there were several possibilities Our triple rooms with airconditioning were at the 5th floor and we had a great view at Tour Montparnasse We reserved a parking space and they made up to their promise A safe parking space next to the hotel Very friendly staff at reception 
121655,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Breakfasts are not very tasty I would suggest to have breakfasts in coffee shops nearby Bathroom is very small , Beautiful and cozy room nice Paris view from the window perfect location not far from the city center many restaurants and coffee shops nearby etc very friendly and helpful staff many thanks to Alexandre helping us with all possible matters 
121656,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, only one elevator and tiny one no internet connection in my room No many options in the breakfast menu , staff were very nice nice view very clean
121657,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, So small it was hard to move in the bathroom or hotel room We each had a suitcase and a carryon there was not enough room for these Wifi was free but it was not good I had a hard time logging in to Facebook It was frustrating , Excellent staff The rooms were decorated beautifully Outside the hustle bustle of Paris but there were homeless people sleeping in the street as you walk from the Metro to the hotel Metro was a 5 10 minute walk from the hotel so that was convenient 
121658,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The attitude from the receptionist I think it s typically French Arrogance , Bed is comfortable Room a bit small but you have all you need The bathroom is excellent good towels and very clean 
121659,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Location far away to many famous place however it is not important, i was pleased with staff Ahmed he works patient and kind i like him the way treat client also the other staff good Wifi here nice small nice room easy to travel everywhere

121661,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, At times there was a bit of a bad smell and couldn t detect where it was coming from However it wasn t constant just a little unpleasant , Personnel extremely friendly and polite with particular attention to our needs Generous breakfast with a good selection to choose from Hotel just across the road from metro station

121667,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, To be honest the elevator is a bit tiny and old As this is an old building so it is acceptable , The room is very clean and with balcony This is out of my expectation as the water pressure is pretty strong Very good And the staffs are very nice with great smile on their face They are very helpful 
121668,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The lift didnt work and the water in our room stopped twice during our 3 days The staff did their best but the french have become bone lazy only interested in striking and not working , Proximity to Metro
121669,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, I didn t like the management of our room We arrived one day later and they confirmed to us to pay however that night But we discovered that it was sold to another customer The breakfast was not very good ,No Positive
121670,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Very very small room No tissue box in room They give you small packs of 3 tissues each , Location Right on the metro Line 4 They let us check in earlier which was a big plus 
121671,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Check in is supposedly at 3 00 pm We were drenched in a rainstorm when we arrived at 3 10 pm We had to sit in the small lobby soaking wet for half an hour before our room was ready Every morning there were bags of dirty linen cleaning supplies and cleaning carts cluttering up the narrow hallways The staff while not necessarily rude were rather aloof and not exactly welcoming Probably would not return , Location Directly across the street from the Mouton Duvetnet metro stop and just a couple blocks from the RER B to both CDG and Orly It seemed clean 
121672,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Hotel is very small and everything inside whether its the rooms staircase lifts can accomindate only 1 person with a large suitcase is tiny We had a Junior suite 2 rooms set and struggled to find a place for 2 suitcases and there was hardly any space to move in the rooms , Its a nice modern hotel with the convenience of restaurants and metro station in the vicinity
121673,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The front seats were worn down the hall were painted on black in the beginning i thought it was graffiti but later I realized it was the decor, It is in a quiet street no much noises the hotel is pretty clean 
121674,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Size of room was small as expected but I was not expecting the main hotel areas to also be small the breakfast was expensive for what you get but overall it was a good stay, Not in the center of paris but across the street from a metro station and walking distance from a main hub that connects to both airports easily Staff was great and very helpful Room was small expected but comfortable 
121675,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Air conditioner doesn t work The bathroom lock was broken Annoying water pipe sound in the air conditioner, The staf was moreover the excellent

121680,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, air conditioning heater central control panel far too complex but that s just a tiny inconvenience , perfect for a business or city trip close to metro and RER station quiet good breakfast with nice pastry and more than enough choice
121681,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Day time receptionists seems more interested with other things than the hotel guests Almost spoiled the day with not able to sell the sightseeing tickets at reception and we had to find the travel agent in central Paris to buy it from them and is quite a task when you don t know the city , Location is excellent with parking Good transport link to the famous sights Room is very modern and comfortable Bathroom is a little tight The gentleman at reception was very friendly and helpful at check in The night receptionist also very helpful 
121682,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Well it has been renovated recently but im not sure if i like it better The colors are kinda harsh its too modern for me P, Location and staff is the best I love the neighbourhood

121684,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse,No Negative, Location perfect with a Metro station very close to the hotel A RER station about 500 meters away connecting directly to CDG airport and by bus to Orly airport
121685,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, I felt we could find the other hotel which were more in center and more comfortable cleaner with this price I am wondering why this hotel is marked as 4 stars , The reception were gemutlich very flexible Hotel was just in front of the metro 
121686,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, although that was generally clean it did not change the sheets for the period 6 days we stayed , metro station oposite nice restaurants near the hotel 
121687,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Lift was bit small but this was not an actual problem, One of the best rooms i ever stayed very clean and worm with free coffee Metro station is opposite the road Price was very ok Reception guys and cleaners were very polite and smiling 
121688,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Slow Internet Tiny Room Extremely poor sound isolation need to whisper One unwelcoming staff at the reception Smelly towels, Full range of bath supply like body lotion and shower jam One nice staff at the reception Location
121689,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Unfortunately the internet was very very bad in the rooms while I needed the internet those two days I was very dissapointed The pictures on the onternet showed a more spacious rolm than what we got Our room was extremely small All in all it was just a plain OK nothing more nothing less , The location was great 
121690,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Design shower heads are famous for their looks not for their water delivery , Small hotel recently redecorated and clean as a whistle My preferred place to stay in this arrondissement Price was good this time 
121691,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Nothing , Pleasant welcoming staff good size room spacious comfy bed clean room and toilet Room was on the 3rd floor overlooking the street Close to restaurants and shops supermarket Metro station just across the street 10 15 by metro to Eiffel tower or Champs Elysees 
121692,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The elevator and room was small Plus the walls were thin and I heard everything in the hall , The location was great and the rooms were clean The staff was extremely helpful and patient 
121693,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Bathroom a bit tight on space but not a real issue for me as I am not a large person A bit further from Montparnasse Station than I expected but close for train station to CDG airport , Bright and modern interesting interior Location was good 
121694,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, The room is very small We were in 3 with 3 big luggages Although it is situated opposite to the tube station the station is quite far from the center , The hotel is located opposite to the tube station 
121695,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, elevator too tiny barely fits 2 persons with one luggage breakfast does not have more choice hallway too tiny and dark I stayed at th floor and the hallway are like a warehouse full of towel, in town
121696,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Wish the rooms were a bit larger but after all it is Paris where every accommodation is generally smaller than in other countries , Very convenient location in front of a metro station near RER Clean recently furnished rooms Good Internet Polite and helpful staff 
121697,Best Western Nouvel Orl ans Montparnasse, Rooms were tiny but this is standard in the City of Light and whilst there was a Nespresso machine in the room as promised we were only given 2 pods after which we were charged 1 Euro per additional one , Great location helpful staff and relatively comfortable by Paris standards
