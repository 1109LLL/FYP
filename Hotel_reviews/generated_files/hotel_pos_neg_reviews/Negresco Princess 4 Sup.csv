432148,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, It was my birthday during my stay in the morning I had opened my birthday cards and put them on display on the desk When I returned in the evening the hotel staff had noticed my cards and left a cake with a candle and a note to say happy birthday It was a lovely touch Great hotel friendly staff and perfect location 
432149,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Great breakfast but the restaurant for meals was a little lacking in variety The atmosphere on the terrace was outstanding with views all over Barcelona Staff were very helpful and obliging although on one day our room wasn t serviced Never had a bed linen change in the 5 nights we stayed 
432150,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, the bed is uncomfortable bed sheets are like hard paper and the AC is just over your head It isnt a 4 star hotel maybe a 3 The pool area is tiny and there is no option to just relax on the roof You are either sitting at the bar or dip in the pool There is no lounge area Staff is very fake friendly I love Barcelona but there are much better hotels than this one NOT RECOMMENDED and overpriced , not a 4 star hotel maybe 3 The rain shower is cool tho Location is good as well 
432151,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room too small and bathroom should be with a door for the standard room for privacy at least, Very modern chic interior the hotel smell sooo good very clean and so convinient to the city center
432152,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing i asked for when i booked was available breakfast they said afterwards was not included but i insisted on and i had to show them my booking confirmation repeatedly over all it was the worst hotel experience i have had and i will never ever go back there Wifi was not good and all tv channels are in spanish ,No Positive
432153,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nada, Guys I wouldn t go online to recommend if it was not worth it It s nice and a small hotel very clean staff was great and very close to the main attractions walking distance to la ramble and ten min drive to anywhere u want to go Definitely recommend it also amazing bakeries near it for break fast Also go to restaurants in barcoloneta beach and try the sea food
432154,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Hotel makes you pay your bill at arrival unseen Rooftop bar is nice but service and offering average The pool is tiny so do not count on it Noisy with poor soundproofing Torn bed sheets , Great location modern rooms happy staff 
432155,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, There were some old slippers under our bed and they did not empty the bins or take glasses they gave us on arrival There was no natural light in our room as we were overlooking the internal atrium , Gorgeous roof terrace and great location
432156,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Everything was perfect , The location of the property could hardly have been better The champagne on our checking in was a welcome sight The room was immaculate The staff were exceptionally helpful in providing us directions Metro Casa Batllo etc and in obtaining tickets for excursions A

432159,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Very friendly staff great roof terrace and modern comfortable rooms The location is perfect for sightseeing being close to the Ramblas and the Gothic area 
432160,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I feel the basic room was still a little too small was not keen having a window that looked into the lobby the breakfast very expensive for what it is we decided not to pay extra for breakfast and ate out which resulted in a cheaper better breakfast More seats tables in the rooftop bar could be provided , Location was very ideal very welcoming staff great shower in the room
432161,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Everything was great , The staff at the front desk were amazing and answered emails promptly that we sent with questions before our stay They even had a toast ready for us upon arrival The breakfast is well worth the price and was amazing as well We loved having cocktails up on the terrace by the pool each evening The staff up there were great too Beautiful rooms and what a shower The rooms had a fridge and a little market is right across the street They recommended a restaurant a few doors down on the left and it was exceptional They also booked a tour for us to the Sagrada de Familia which was an unbelievable place 
432162,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The pool looks bigger in the photos and the ladder into the pool was very shaky and needs repair , Very nice helpful Bellman Adam Also liked that there was an interesting Jesuit Church across the street Great location to walk the Ramblas Nice view from pool and rooftop terrace Free beverages in mini bar is a refreshing touch 
432163,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Only 2 sunbeds at the pool and a couple of chairs No bodylotion in the room , Very friendly staff From the beginning till the end you ll be treated like princesses The room was good with a great shower free minibar safe Breakfast is perfect a lot a variety and good quality Rooftop pool is like heaven with great drinks lovely tapas Try the nachos with quacamole Stunning design of the hotel Location just perfect Tip we rent a bike to discover Barcelona it was really amazing You can ask the reception the bikes will be delivered at the hotel 
432164,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was a bit small just ok for 2 people seems to be the standard, English speaking staff good location impressive bathroom quiet room and loved the nespresso machine
432165,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Larger pool would have been better , Great check in staff especially Audrey Complimentary champagne in afternoon Complimentary mini bar every day 2 beers 2 waters 1 juice Comfy bed great shower Buffet breakfast excellent with huge choice and open until late morning 
432166,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The roof top pool was so tiny with hardly any room to sit by it , Front desk was very welcoming and helpful with suggestions of the city Rooms were big with comfortable bed The roof top bar was very chic with good drinks and lots of sun 
432167,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Would recommend booking Sagrada Familia and Gaudi and other major venues pre journey as the tours where not available until 5 hours later You can book on line , From arrival to us leaving the hotel was fantastic It was my husbands 60th birthday treat we came back to our room and found a lovely cheesecake with a candle and a note from the staff The hotel is central for walking to Catalunya Place to catch buses and taxis all over the city recommend the bus tours would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Barcelona weather was very hot at the time 28 30 had to keep stopping for a beer Camp Nou great visit for football fans and Partners Roof top terrace hot during the day but lovely in the evening We walked 10 000 steps one day up and down La Ramblas 
432168,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Pool was pleasant but tiny vs picture Service on the terrace was friendly but extremely relaxed Really Price vs Service was too high, Location is fine Reception was helpful to change restaurants bookings
432169,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing, The location was great The staff were always helpful and very pleasant The breakfast was good It was made with lovely fresh local products We would highly recommend staying at the Negressco Princess 
432170,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was quite compact , Great modern hotel in ideal location an easy walk to everything Loved the roof terrace for morning coffee and evening beers Daily Mini bar refill a nice touch 
432171,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, No view from room Rooftop bar shut at 23 30 which seemed early , Comfy beds Good location Reasonably priced restaurants and caf s a stones throw from the hotel 
432172,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Having to leave the sunshine to come home , We were upgraded to a superior room with cava on arrival which was lovely It was my partners birthday and they brought a cake to his room which was a really lovely touch Well located clean friendly hotel with an amazing rooftop bar 
432173,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Reception area was mid re furnishment on arrival, Reception staff were exceptionally helpful with excellent recommendations for dinner Audrey in particular deserves extra praise for her helpful friendly approach 
432174,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We didn t try their breakfast but I think it s overpriced since there are a couple of coffee shops nearby serving a nice food with much lower price Apart of that there is nothing we disliked about this nice hotel , Super nice location The hotel is new with good facilities Nice staff always smiling and saying Hola The minibar is free and refillable Good size room with nice bathroom 
432175,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was small on a value for money basis and unfortunately at the time the ground floor was being renovated putting coffee shop out of action during the day Pool was empty , Rooftop bar area provided good venue for end of day relaxation 
432176,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, i asked for late check out as genius member but i got refused swimming pool not working and was small gym was too small not enough equipment and space , WiFi 
432177,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing serious but door locking mechanism too powerful due to this at morning sound of closing doors wake you up , Hotel has great location not at touristic epicenter but close to all sights There is pool at the top and gym Bar at top level has a great view on whole city 
432178,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing, From our greeting with a glass of bubbly to our check out with personal service we had a fantastic time The room was great and the rooftop terrace is amazing The staff at the hotel couldn t of been more helpful and we would stay here again if going to Barcelona again 
432179,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Ongoing building works caused nuisance noise and dust during day and therefore no indoor bar or eating facilities throughout the day or night As there was no heating facilities at the rooftop bar it was uncomfortable at night time The room was extremely noisy and definitely no soundproofing despite the brochure the noisiness was not helped by the cleaning staff Minor maintenance issues in the room should have been carried out before occupation , Location reception staff were very friendly 
432180,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, roof top pool was out of order with no notification of this prior to the visit Hotel bar was unavailable at the time of the visit as it was being refurbished Again there was no notification of this prior to the holiday Continuous noise pollution throughout the day from the bar Due to the property design this filtered into the rooms during the stay Had I been aware of this prior to the visit I would have availed of the free cancellation policy provided with the booking and would have selected a different hotel , Roof top bar
432181,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, A Nespresso machine in the room does not yet make a 4 Sup hotel The Hotel is only 2 years old and it is really cheaply built materials used are low quality and I would give this hotel max 3 No class no comfort The rooms are small and the beauty products very bad quality The staff is friendly but not very attentive I was really disappointed with the quality of the Hotel , The best of the Hotel is the top floor terrace even though the pool was empty 
432182,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room was so tiny Therewas nothing to put your shampoo on in the bathroom There was some renovation in the lobby all the time with terrible noise , Only the location 
432183,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The swimming pool was out of action and it was a key feature in our booking But free wine and tapas every evening did make up for this a bit , Staff were fantastic 
432184,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was overpriced for what it offered It was overlooking at the hotel s atrium and that made it being dark throughout the day even when it was bright outside plus the noise from the main hall was quite annoying Cleaning standards were not the greatest , Great location close to the beach and the city centre Communal space especially the rooftop bar was nice 
432185,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Minor note The pool was empty and the downstairs bar was being refurbished so would have liked to have known this before booking That said it didn t really affect our stay and the hotel laid on free snacks and wine in the roof bar every evening between 6 8pm as a gesture of goodwill Brilliant , Fabulous location and close to most attractions lots of local bars restaurants and coffee shops very close by The roof bar is excellent and the staff very helpful Couldn t fault this and will definitely book again when next in Barcelona 
432186,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We had late check out but the key card didn t work even when reception did a reset of the key card Little bit anoying , Great breakfast and nice room with perfect bed 
432187,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Aircon shuts down after you leave the room card removal difficulty to use the controls Pool not open Minor fresh paint smell Drainage issues in the shower Toiletries were replaced once in a weeks stay 3 elevators not entirely connected may have to press 2 buttons to go up down , The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful knowledgeable about Barcelona The hotel is quiet new very unique modern design Comfy bed and pillow Free minibar drinks Everyday Extra bonus for the arrival drinks Amazing terrace view on the rooftop Great location 5 mins walk from airport Aerobus drop off Catalunya metro bus stop close to supermarket mall 
432188,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Paper thin walls didn t replenish coffee milk etc window onto covered court yard made room with no day light , Beautiful food in restaruant location central friendly staff
432189,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I felt the breakfast was overpriced for what they were offering it was lovely however 18 euros each was really quite steep they did offer a deal for 14 euros each if we took for the three mornings however still feel there are some beautiful bakeries and cafes very close offering very reasonable breakfast deals, Rooms were lovely very comfortable and spacious with everything you could think of very central location easy access to everything staff extremely helpful and courteous would definitely recommend
432190,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Small room hotel walls seemed to be made of cardboard easy to hear snores neighbors , Great location very friendly staff clean room and large shower space
432191,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We chose this property primarily for the rooftop infinity pool this is the only reason we didn t opt for a cheaper hotel however the swimming pool was out of use for the entirety of our stay which was extremely disappointing Next time will pick a cheaper hotel , Rooms were lovely and clean loved the shower in the room fresh towels when requested 
432192,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Only tiny niggle was that the pool on the terrace was closed and had been drained for repair Bit unfortunate as this was a major consideration when booking but didn t detract on the whole , Hotel was beautiful and smelt incredible Staff were the loveliest people and couldn t have been more helpful Food was fantastic everything was amazing 
432193,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Poor attention to detail Room of an ok standard however skirting boards in room missing Nails exposed Roof top Pool out of service roof top bar only open 3 days a week, Good location complimentary mini bar is a nice touch 
432194,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The reason I rated this so low especially on Comfort is because I was given a room with a door that joined directly to another room This door looked like a cupboard so when I opened it and saw it was backing onto the other room through a door in the wall I was pretty shocked Then all I heard all night was tourists next door talking really loud it was as if they were in my room Because I was shattered and it was gone 1am I did not have the strength to call down to reception and complain The next morning whilst checking out I was not asked about my stay either I guess the staff know this room is like this This is shocking considering it is a 4 hotel and I paid a high price and even selected quiet room and wrote this as an additional request The next day I felt awful from sleeping so late not how you should feel after sleeping at a 4 hotel Again really shocked a 4 hotel could do this and it completely put me off ever recommending this hotel why would I recommend a hotel that could have a door like this in every room no sleep and relaxation ,No Positive
432195,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Bedroom facing inwards to atrium Making room dark and hard to see unless with lights all on even so pretty dark Think the large mirror along the wall didn t help either , Beds were comfortable Quiet Great shower Housekeeping were great We came back from a tour low and behold there was a tray on the bed with water glasses and a little cheesecake with a candle alongside a note from the hotel to wish me a Happt Birthday that was so sweet
432196,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Building of the hotel is not reflecting the sprit of the Barcelona My room was looking at to lobby and not so big, Nice and polite staff Welcome drink Good breakfast and perfect capuchino 
432197,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Breakfast was a little expensive for someone who did not fell hungry maybe more options like half portions etc, the location was great and staff were really nice and very helpful hotel and rooms were clean and bright 
432198,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The tedious WIFI registration process with e mail registration expiring sessions etc totally unsuitable for older people and or those not knowing english , The welcome Cava and snacks The free drinks in the room that were replenished daily The reception and maintenance guys are the best The rooms are small but cosy and functional The free safe box
432199,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Due to March not being busy season the rooftop bar pool area was not open much But it made me just want to come back again in the summer for the pool and view , The location made travel around the city incredibly easy Their main reception made us feel right at home as soon as we had arrived Their Sangria s in the reception bar were some of the best we had during our entire holiday They made the trip even more special as they surprised my friend who s birthday we were celebrating on the trip by calling to our room on the evening of her birthday with a beautiful cheesecake and candle wishing her happy birthday So thoughtful I can t wait to come back and stay again 
432200,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The only thing we can fault is the view from our room We were a little disappointed as we paid for a superior room so we expected to have a good view however this wasn t the case , Everything about this hotel was amazing The staff are great and every little added touch made the experience even more enjoyable The free cava on arrival every day in the lobby the robes and slippers in the room the free minibar that s re stocked every day We can t wait to stay again 
432201,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, There was no coffee in the room , Roof top terrace and location walking distance to most tourist attractions The staff sent a birthday treat to the room for my partner and were very friendly and helpful Free mini bar in room They allowed us to check in early Double mattress rather than two single pushed together Complimentary cava and treats at reception 
432202,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Excellent all the staff were first rate and all the extra details in the room were considered and thoughtful to make the stay a good one I was given a free upgrade to higher rating room and was very pleased with that thankyou As a solo traveller I have often been made to feel like a secondclass citizen when checking in to a hotel in complete contrast the staff here made me feel like I was genuinely welcome and the difference was really noticeable I highly recommend this hotel 
432203,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Superb hotel bright and spacious Staff were excellent very helpful we had our 20th anniversary and they sent up champagne and chocolates for us The room was spacious and the bed was so comfortable and huge The shower had great power can t wait to go back lovely views of the sights from the roof top bar and pool fabulous location 
432204,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Having to leave go home , The rooms were fantastic much more than we expected The bed was huge so was the shower A fantastic roof terrace with even better views of the city very relaxing way to end the day Very friendly helpful staff too We would certainly stay here again There is also a delicious deli a few doors down for your very own picnic of the roof terrace 
432205,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Very little maybe a trolley pass at the entrance , For Spain the hotel breakfast is just excellent The location is excellent The hotel is very modernistic let s say Gaudi would not feel comfortable but we did appreciate it The staff is professionally nice 
432206,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms a bit on the small side but fine for short stays and weekend breaks, The hotel is in a excellent location for exploring Barcelona The staff were very friendly and helpful Will definitely stay there again
432207,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, They don t cater for British people as no English channels on TVs or no English newspapers only French and german, Good breakfast but mini bar not good
432208,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The food was perfect and all the staff were very helpful and couldn t do enough for us We are planning another stay soon All the room services were excellent 
432209,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Having paid for a better room The view was dissapointing No instructions on how tp use the coffee machine But it was a great addition to the room out door pool should be heated when its cold , Fab location Had a warm welcoming from the hotel I would definitely and have given recommendations for friends to stay Good breakfast too 
432210,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room is on the small side although the bed is pretty big When booking a bubble bath was mentioned but room only had a albeit very nice shower , Great central location but quiet enough street to not be very noisy at night Two metro lines within 3 minute walk many places to eat around Friendly staff fantastic breakfast available 9 12 with almost everyting still available also at 11 30 Minibar was minimally stocked but complimentary and it is really nice to be able to have a drink coming home late without every water costing 6 euros like other hotels charge 
432211,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, the fact it stated the pool was heated when in fact it was not the rooms said sound proof yet every little noise in corridors and other rooms could be heard, the Cleanliness of hotel
432212,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing really although the floor at the front of the toilet still had urine from previous stay on it and the cleaner failed to wash it away the whole time i stayed , Reasonably close to everything not a lot of staff could speak english all that well Free drinks in the fridge Noise from the street was very loud and noisy but i didnt have any trouble sleeping 
432213,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The heated pool advertised on the website as being open all year round was out of service which was disappointing , Staff were very accomodating and friendly Place was gorgeous and modern Location was also perfect 
432214,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The only thing was that the view from our room was towards the atrium , The hotel was a unique experience Amazing location great modern comfy rooms and very clean The staff were very helpful and super friendly They even left a birthday cake for my boyfriend in our room without us telling them that it was his birthday The amazing receptionist must have noticed when we did our check in We were also very happy with the amazing breakfast Great variety and very tasty 
432215,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Security could have been better My daughter s bag was taken from the sofa where I was sitting by two professional thiefs working together in the lobby where guests were relaxing This was a real disappointment as we were super aware of pickpockets when out and about but were relaxed in the hotel big mistake Never leave your possessions down anywhere The police station was full of crying tourists who had been robbed of money passports etc The hotel have provided us with a voucher for a future stay and we re very sorry for what happened , Breakfast buffet was very good with excellent coffee Location was really central near to metro etc The hotel staff were helpful and charming 
432216,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Pillows could be improved, The staff at the hotel are amazing and added to a fantastic experience From guidelines on routes to booking tickets for football they are helpful in whatever you need This over and above the friendly and welcoming nature that ALL reception personnel demonstrated A special mention for the shower in the room which was excellent Wonderful stay in Barcelona at a fantastic hotel 
432217,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Lovely staff We were informed prior to our arrival that there would be building works ongoing in the lobby These didn t interfere with us at all and the staff were extremely helpful and apologetic
432218,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The system to tell housekeeping do not disturb could be better as the light was ignored on one occasion Minor detail , From the moment we arrived the quality of the hotel was obvious from the welcome drinks to the friendly staff The location is absolutely perfect luxury rooms and fantastic roof terrace They were having some work done in reception which didn t disturb us at all but to compensate they invited all guests to a free buffet for two nights That s quality service Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all 
432219,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, swimming pool was not at all good it was also not working No jaccuzzi gym has very limited facilities Lobby was just ok , Overpriced pool was not working Its a four star hotel rooms were good Tv channels were good to shower room great but overall below from my expectation location was great
432220,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, No free coffee for the electric kettle only two teabags and sugar The maid forgot to leave a new bar of soap after taking the used one and didn t supply new tissues for the bath room , Great location clean and modern facilities Friendly staff Free minibar 2 small bottles of water 1 bottle of cola juice and beer Safe for notebooks end valuables in the room Relatively small but very comfortable room perfect bathroom Excellent breakfast 
432221,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Good location Breakfast was awful on second day had to ask for food to be replenished No water in room and had to wait over an hour to shower We were aware that work was being undertaken but advised it would be completed at 4am Not what you really expect ,No Positive
432222,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The weather outside could be more like the averages for the period Inside felt very fine indeed , A really comfortable place to be hosted Very central near a multitude of eating places supermarkets main shopping areas fine culture institutions Palau de la Musica Catalana Museo Picasso Comfy well engineered room and bathroom Slippers and bathrobes Abundance of toiletries Free minibar VERY FRIENDLY HELPFUL STAFF 
432223,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Heating pool was not functioning when I stayed, Great location in the centre of Barcelona and just a few minutes walk from the coach station to airport at Catalunya Plaza Beautiful and modern style room was very lucky to get a free upgrade to superior room with the street view outside Room was spacious and clean with large double bed Breakfast is quite nice although there may be limited choices but still good enough for a four star hotel Rooftop bar and pool have incredible view of sunset 
432224,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The uncenternty of the reception about our request to do late check out, The smell The shower The location The wifi The simplicity of managing The elevators The housekeeping
432225,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The staff were amazing extremely helpful and would always greet us with a smile The hotel is a 8 10 minute walk from catalunya plaza where the aerobus stops That made it convenient to travel to and from the airport The nearest metro is like 2 minutes away from the hotel Would definitely stay there again 
432226,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, we had room with window to canteen in the morning really wanted to open window to get some fresh air but realised that our window is to the canteen not outside , Great location amazing view from rooftop perfectly clean and staff was nice 
432227,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, nothing, Location was perfect Very near to La Rambla and Catalunya station Lovely staff and very helpful We loved the shower and welcome drink 
432228,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, could not make use of the rooftop bar and swimming pool as arrived very late in the evening and had to leave already at 5 AM but very nice view overlooking the town and the surrounding hills, very warm welcome of the staff at the reception desk
432229,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, I love the facilities the location the staff and the hotel in general The night receptionist Juan was particularly very friendly he went above and beyond to help Will definitely be coming back 
432230,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Great breakfast buffet very clean rooms great shower great location walking distance to everything Great tapas just round the corner I would recommend and stay here again 
432231,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, A few minor pieces of feedback we called for 2 fresh towels on Saturday evening reception answered and said they would be up shortly And they never came No one came by or said anything We also wanted help with a certain restaurant reservation And while I realized it was Christmas weekend and a very very popular time of year both staff members were very resistant to make the phone call to see if there were any last minute cancellations I would have appreciated immediately picking up the phone to check we only had 3 days in Barcelona might as well try , The breakfast was quite good everything fresh I also appreciated the fact that all beverages in the mini bar were included with the room Nice to have The staff was generally very friendly and helpful 
432232,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Poorly isolated room I could not get one night of good sleep because of other guests talking loudly in the hallway and my door didn t seem to stop any sound at all , Very friendly staff no hidden costs perfect location nice sauna and very nice room Free WiFi with decent speed 
432233,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Location of the hotel was near to the centre Hotel was clean We liked the roof top pool as it had a relaxing atmosphere Near to transport links like the metro near to the airport shuttle bus too 
432234,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel was awesome It was clean warm and the beds were really comfortable There is a pool on the terrace that could be used on summer and also a small sauna The people from the reception were very friendly and willing to help The hotel is close to a subway station so you have access to the entire city from there You can take the bus to the airport from the station located in Catalunya plaza 7 minutes walk till the hotel 
432235,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Could have had more in free mini bar ie 2 beers, The breakfast had so much choice the view from our terrace and roof was far reaching and amazing we watched the sun coming up staff very helpfull to advise in sight seeing 
432236,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room was a bit small but nothing that would prevent me from staying again , Clean and modern The location was great paseig de gracia is two blocks away Gothic area is also walkable The staff was great Nespresso machine in the room along with bottled water soda and beer A small bar downstairs Also it smelled really nice 
432237,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The roof terrace was closed for a private function and was very noisy Breakfast very expensive, We loved the roof terrace with the pool and bar reception staff very friendly 
432238,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, we booked a room which has a window only to the internal lobby area no street view no natural light and literally shows the elevators We upgraded it and got an amazing corner room but still if there was no option to do that this is a room that could have killed our holiday for me I wonder how anyone thought of this idea as an interior designer working with architects I would never have suggested that I came across this info about the room in the comments asked about it and forgot so it s not the hotel s fault But again all the rooms facing the inner space with no street view or hardly natural light Horrible idea , central location beautiful rooms dream shower and helpful staff We loved everything about this new room Nespresso machine in the room free mini bar 
432239,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We had a room facing the atrium so no daylight plus the walls are pretty thin so you can hear everything that s happening right outside your door coffee downstairs at the bar in the lobby was 5 which is pricey even for Barcelona , Perfect location great rooftop terrace and heated pool requested an early check in before arrival and I got a quick answer that it s possible rainshower was excellent everything was super clean the housekeeping was there the whole day so even after sleeping in and leaving the room in the afternoon we had the possibility to arrive back to a cleaned room 
432240,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The lobby and cafeteria area could be improved to make them feel more inviting and less sterile looking We found better places to have breakfast around the corner from the hotel , Great location in central Barcelona this new hotel is well appointed with sauna roof top pool and comfortable rooms 
432241,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, There were not many gluten or lacto free options for breakfast Breakfast was other than that ok but could have had some more variety Dont forget your balsam for the hair as its not provided the minibar only holds about 1 bottle of coke and a water, The hotell is clean nice and modern Nice bathrooms and comfortable Friendly staff and a nice glass of champagne at arrival
432242,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Check in wasnt very smooth as the transaction through card was declined by the hotels bank so I had to pay by travel money I had in person and because of the card decline I wasn t able to access the money that I had sent to their bank This left me with 599 euro less spending money Though I got the money back 24 hrs later it was just a inconvenience and not a great start to our break away Though after this issue the hotel was faultless for our stay here and was a splendid place to stay , Great location Great facilities Rooms were very good with cleaner coming everyday Rooftop bar was amazing at night and served excellent cocktails and played host to a nice view of Barcelona Taxi spots outside hotel were very helpful for getting around too and I would recommend this hotel to others
432243,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing to complain about, We loved the hotel When we just arrived the super nice staff at the reception offered us a glass of Cava it was impossible to refuse Our room was very clean big comfortable bed and wonderful big shower There s a Nespresso machine and the mini bar is free The interior design of the room and hotel in general is beautiful There s a nice terrace and outside pool The breakfast was perfect We will surely return and recommend others 
432244,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I unknowingly didn t take the breakfast option or forgot to email request it and they only reminded me about this after I had paid on arrival Not a huge problem logistically as you can put it on the room and pay later but I would have liked to have selected the option and paid with the room in one go And it s definitely worth taking breakfast So check your booking But that s really my only complaint , The hotel is new and modern located about 5 10 mins walk from P Catalunya It s very clean has wonderful recreation areas The breakfast is excellent with a wide selection of delicious options The rooms are spacious limited minibar included in the room fee and very comfy beds The bathroom is great I liked that they separated the toilet from the shower and basin area The shower was lovely and big and you can tell they pay attention to the quality of the materials they use The staff were friendly and helpful very professional 
432245,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Had to ring reception on first night to turn volume down in the bar Room had only one window to the atrium inside light was insufficient Too few clothes peg for towels robes missing toilet brush , Abundant breakfast comfortable room great location Pl Catalunya is only 5min walk so we were right in the downtown 
432246,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The walls were a bit thin either we had neighbours who put a lot of strength in banging their doors open and close or the walls were just too sound conductive as we heard a lot of doors opening and closing every night For the wifi you had to log in every single time either with your SNS credentials or with a log in account which you had to create It seemed unreasonably complicated as we had to do that every time we reconnect after coming back to the room , The location the really huge bed and comfortable pillows the large bathroom and shower the extra friendly staff Despite everything it was a real pleasure to spend time in the room 
432247,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, we booked this hotel nearly half year in advance how come hotel just give me a very poor room with window facing the corridor also the lobby is very noisy during the night not sure THE CORNER have party every night or not,No Positive
432248,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, They put us on the first floor above the lobby very noisy as a result Also the bar was right below us Room was very small and very noisy difficult to get to sleep before midnight Asked to be moved wanted 20 euros per night to move They had a info box in the room stating that continential breakfast was included There was no continental breakfast available There was a very good breakfast up until twelve pm for 18 euros could be purchased on the street for 10 euros ,No Positive
432249,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, New modern hotel Best shower I have ever used Comfy bed full amenities mini bar the young lady who checked me in was so friendly helpful
432250,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Hotel doesn t have lots of charm beyond the terrace and room Bed a little too soft, Location Terrasse Breakfast Space in the hotel and in the rooms Kindness of the staff
432251,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The rooms do not have any sound insulation You really hear everything people talking in the next room staff using vacuum cleaners doors opening and closing the noise from the street As other hotels in Spain have the same problem exzeption W Hotel in Barcelona I suppose that Spanish architects are not able to plan good sound insulations Thus I recommend German architects They are absolutely able to implement a good sound insulation In the corridor there is rubbish from the rooms nearly all the day No seperate elevators for the staff , I really liked the shower Sauna and pool were also great 
432252,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nil, A beautiful hotel with lovely staff who were always friendly The welcome drink was much appreciated as it was a hot day The roof top pool was very inviting and the breakfasts were sensational

432258,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Directions on the website could be better Public transport in Barcelona is notoriously difficult to understand but the hotel is actually far easier to get to than it seems, For a central hotel it was amazingly quiet 
432259,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, We had an issue with our credit card being declined on check in Before knowing that the credit card was perfectly fine they still checked us in and allowed us to go to our room to sort things out That was awesome Nothing worse than dealing with this on arrival 
432260,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The breakfast wasn t good value for money especially since it wasn t included Not worth the spend I recommend eating else where , We loved everything The room was clean and comfortable and everything in the fridge was free of charge We loved the roof top bar and pool 
432261,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, There was some perioidal noise on the ceiling during midnight and we decidied to change the room we lost some belongibgs during the room change and could not find them We called only for 5 minutes and they charged us for 33 5 Euro There was no place in the bath to put soup or shampoo , Bereakfat time was great from 7 to 12

432264,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The public parking next to it is excessive expensive 49 for one night At the hotel you can get a reduction but it still remains 38 , Friendly reception with a glas of cava The terras on the 7th floor with little mini pool is great Also nice to grab a bite there You can even see the roof of the Sagrada Familia from there 
432265,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooftop terrace and hotel bar only open until 11 00p m Room had only a Nespresso machine with espresso cups and no milk so no facility to make a large coffee or a cup of tea Tried the stairs to one of the fire exits but found myself in darkness before reaching the ground floor would suggest they install automatic lighting , Good central location close to a tube station and 5 minutes walk to the Placa de Catalunya for the direct bus to the airport Spacious comfortable room with fantastic shower Complimentary beer water and orange juice in the room s mini bar and welcome glass of cava Good air conditioning temperature control in the room Friendly staff

432271,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing , Clean and modern hotel Amazing showers We really enjoyed the roof top patio pool great drink menu We enjoyed drinks up here twice during our stay Central location you can walk to everything you need to in Barcelona it is a bit of longer walk to the beach port though probably about 30 mins Staff were extremely friendly really enjoyed the welcome glass of Cava We had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary When we returned from site seeing on the first day we found a bottle of Cava on ice and a plate of chocolates sweets on our bed with a note thanking us for celebrating with them We cancelled a more expensive room at the last minute at chose Negressco Absolutely no regrets We actually ended up booking this hotel again for our last night before flying home 
432272,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, A few more shaded areas with lower umbrellas on the roof terrace would have nice when it was really hot , Room was large and very clean and comfortable Staff very helpful and polite Welcome glass of Cava on arrival was a nice touch Breakfast really excellent although a little expensive if you pay for it separately Rooftop pool area a very enjoyable place to relax with a drink

432279,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Warning the standard rooms have no exterior view view on the corridor all the clients and maids can see what s happening in your room unless you keep the curtains closed Very small and not sound proof,No Positive
432280,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Super hotel Just 1 thing the main door of all rooms close very noisy So that being said use it as a wake up call in the morning unless you re an early bird 
432281,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The bed wasn t the comfiest and we think there could have been more sunbeds , The location was perfect a short walk to the beach and la ramblas great facilities rooftop pool and bar were superb with lovely views over the city Great atmosphere and very helpful staff 
432282,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms very small with tiny window opening into entrance below, The big fluffy bath towels were great and the showers one of the best I have ever encountered in a hotel Welcome glass of champagne 
432283,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Free wifi was slow and the food and drink were excessively expensive Hotel in general was a bit overpriced and even though we booked a double room we were given two single beds instead , Well situated hotel with very clean and high quality facilities Staff were very welcoming and helpful 
432284,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms were quite small we had 2 interconnecting ones and for a day and night stay ok but a bit tight for more , The roof terrace with the pool was lovely Clean and v modern great shower 
432285,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, air conditioning much too cold in lobby for sitting at breakfast, really friendy service top location Metro 100m supermarket 50m bus station 10m la ramblas 2 min walk rooftop pool bar versatile breakfast
432286,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was a little tight and has zero view from the room, Terrace is amazing Location good Massive comfy bed Amazing shower Staff very helpful and friendly we were here as part of our honeymoon and were spoiler woth champagne and chocolates
432287,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Our room had no natural light which I didn t feel very comfortable with considering how much we paid I would have expected a better room, The rooftop pool and bar was lovely 
432288,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, very small rooms deluxe room does not have 24sqm but less than 15 noise is a big problem at this hotel you hear everything like it was happening in the room if at the 6 floor at 7 15 7 30 max you wake up due to the noise on the terrace staff starts preparing the pool terrace although they open at 10 , Location is good and hotel is renovated
432289,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Some mornings we were woken by other doors slamming shut , The location was fab and we loved the rooftop bar and pool The shower is a deal breaker on holiday and I wasn t disappointed plus the free minibar was restocked daily 
432290,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, 18 Euros for breakfast but there was a good selection Had a problem with the socket points in the room but got it sorted soon enough , All good Other hotels with same facilities seemed more expensive Nice large room with a big double bed not two singles as happens so often elsewhere Nice staff a pool not huge but good enough for me a sauna and a rooftop bar made this a very good experience 
432291,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Free mini bar was a bonus although it wasn t overly stocked The roof top terrace was a perfect chill out zone of an evening The hotel was away from the hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to La Rambla etc
432292,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing , A new hotel open 7 months Enough time to fix any teething problems but still immaculate Great central location but also quiet We loved everything about it Lovely chilled atmosphere at the rooftop bar pool 
432293,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Everything was awesome , Absolutely awesome stay Great location The staff was very kind and helped us with all the questions we had The pool is really nice specially to unwind after walking around the city The rooms are spacious and clean but my favorite thing about this hotel was the showers They had really nice pressure and were really modern Also it s really close to an Aerobus stop so transportation to and from the airport was convenient and cheap around 6 euros per person 
432294,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The staff were abrupt and rather grumpy Could be that we comparing with Olivia Balmes where we also stayed and the staff at that hotel were exceptional Nearest Princess lacked personality because of the cold and indifferent attitude of the staff , Modern hotel good location 
432295,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I do not have one bad thing to say about the hotel or the services they provided , The staff was tremendous We arrived at 8 00 in the morning and by 10 00 they had a room set up for us They were helpful every step of the way And this means every staff member we had contact with The facilities are great especially the roof top area 
432296,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Really happy with the hotel and staff Welcomed with a glass of cava by the friendly staff Everything about the hotel was great The roof terrace was nice gets the sun all day and has a view of la sagrada familia Perfect at night with a drink
432297,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing really, Staff was very friendly and helpful and also had a smile on their face Very close to major attractions If I ever go back to Barcelona this is where I will stay
432298,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Some of the staff at roof top bar need to learn some customer service skills Looked very disinterested Corridors need hoovered more often , Room was absolutely lovely and very modern Roof top bar is absolutely amazing 
432299,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Staff were rude Service was slow Gym equipment not working Overpriced Rooms were small Air conditioning not working properly either too hot or too cold Mini bar was limited and no bottle opener Limited English TV channels wanted to watch the Tour De France but couldn t , Rooms were decorated well Shower was great 
432300,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Well looks like I have nothing bad to say this time, This is one of the best european hotels I have ever tried Location staff room sauna and swimming pool bar and breakfast house keeping air conditioning system elevators even the air aroma in lobby everything was really amazing I liked the indoor outdoor design of this new hotel the service and food quality even the prices are ok I shall definetely book this hotel once again 
432301,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, More attention is needed to people arriving We had several bags and lugged them up the steps only to find a door man standing inattentively inside doing not much This person is there to assist people arriving and leaving I suggest they stand at or outside the door and make an effort to assist people , Great location the pool on the roof was the draw card and served a a great spot to relax after a long hot day walking the city Breakfasts were great attentive staff and I love the idea of a little bubbly to start the day 
432302,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, This was a very comfortable hotel where nothing was too much trouble for the staff The bed was really comfortable and I enjoyed the rooftop bar for a afternoon chilled out drink 
432303,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, A small but lovely roof terrace but unable to use it a couple of evenings after a long day sightseeing as there was no shade available for those who didn t want to sizzle in the hot sunshine , Central location ideal for sightseeing Fabulous breakfast spread All staff very helpful and all speak very good English 
432304,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, No dislikes whatsoever , The hotel and facilities were wonderful in particular the roof Terrace for evening drinks and meals and the breakfast was top class 
432305,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Bed could have been bigger We had a double bed not sure if they offer a queen or king , Friendly and helpful staff New hotel with modern design We had a quiet room on 7 th floor with fabulous shower bathrobes and free mini bar The rooftop bar and pool with views over the city good eats and drinks and a very mellow DJ was a great place to unwind after walking the city streets Amazing breakfast Loved this hotel Will certainly come back 
432306,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Bed uncomfortable and no quilt just a sateen under duvet with no cover on it and sheets not nice to think of how many other people had slept in it Staff apathetic and just generally no good feelings Style over substance ,No Positive
432307,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, More English TV channels, Excellent location very attentive helpful and friendly staff Comfortable room lovely modern bathroom and excellent rain shower Very clean 
432308,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The only minor comment I would make is that although there was a Nespresso coffee machine in the room which was fine not least because it included a decaffeinated option there was no facility to make other hot drinks if you don t want or like coffee , This hotel was in a great location for accessing on foot those parts of Barcelona we wanted to visit and was also just a few minutes walk from a Metro station when we wanted to travel further afield The staff were all very helpful and friendly The choice at breakfast is very good including some hot food The bed was very comfortable The minibar in the room was free which was a nice touch We were only in Barcelona for 5 nights and realised there was much of the city we didn t get to We will have to return and when we do we would definitely consider staying in the Negresco Princess again 
432309,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, More travelers about the city Also convenience towel rails for bath towels plus instructions on how to use the coffee machine, Proximity is just right to travel to do shopping or visit other places 
432310,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The terrace restaurant is very slow and sometimes may be frustrating , The location is in center Barcelona not on a very noisy area very good restaurants in walking distance good shops and also one can walk Placa Espanya Rooms are small about 20m2 but the ones facing the street are ok The minibar free is a nice touch The personal is nice and friendly the breakfast is very good 
432311,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room very dark Requested a room with more light however none where available, Amazing hotel The location is perfect Very clean and modern Staff all friendly Couldnt have asked for a better hotel 
432312,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, It would have been lovely to have snacks available on the roof in the afternoons , The breakfast buffet is excellent in both variety and quality we especially liked the mini grilled ham and cheese The roof terrace and pool were definite bonuses 
432313,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Shower control not possible air con effectiveness was not good no space for keeping toileteries in thebathing area, Breakfast spread was good Even the bar xollection was decent staff was courteous and helpful
432314,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The lifts are painfully slow , Loved the roof top pool and bar area everything about it was beautiful Although it could have done with some more sun loungers during the day 
432315,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The curtains let in quite a lot of light and also the position of the bed means that your head is actually underneath the curtain which means the light shines on your face in the morning Got to the point where we had to put the pillows on the other side of the bed Didn t know how to use coffee machine which was a shame as it looked great The lifts are probably the worst feature of the whole hotel very slow to open doors and come to your floor sometimes the point that we had to climb 4 flights of stairs Pool was very very shallow and not very big These were just minor criticisms as the hotel was absolutely fantastic , Brilliant location Fantastic bed Great shower and bathroom area Brilliant roof terrace and bar The views of the city from the pool were incredible and worth every extra penny The staff were extremely helpful and friendly Loved the free mini bar Really good safe and storage Air con is brilliant Rooms were cleaned fantastically well Really modern design 
432316,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Staff from the room service didn t understand what is the service of a 4 stars hotel I asked them some ices and reply I am busy sorry What I asked glasses they never came so I had to ask again , Amazing Terrace in the delux room and great pillows in the bed Great pool area 
432317,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Nice modern hotel friendly helpful staff nice rooftop bar small pool on rooftop bit crowded but nice fun atmosphere Good location Overall a nice base for a great city break Barcelona was fab 
432318,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Would have preferred a room with a view but I only booked a basic room so I would definitely pay the extra next time, The staff were kind and helpful the roof terrace is gorgeous with lovely views of the city the rooms are clean and very comfortable We had such a good stay 
432319,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Hotel let down by soundproofing Always knew when running machine in gym above free no pounding feet Lateral sound insulation also poor Disappointing in a new hotel Spanish Building Regs clearly very different to uk , Staff very friendly roof terrace very pleasant although pool is somewhere to cool not swim 
432320,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, None I m very satisfied overall, The hotel just opened this December 2015 So it s fairly new and clean Rooftop bar and pool is nice with good view importantly location location location It s near passeig de gracias La rambla el Gotico l example And most importantly the friendly staffs especially the front desk They are very helpful and accommodating You have a complimentary cava rose wine at the front desk on your check in You also have complimentary water orange juice coffee soda in your room The bed is comfortable Good shower which is important to me I will stay here again in a heartbeat when I come back
432321,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room is is extremely clean but very small Next time I will pay a little more and get a larger room Great place to stay close to everything , Outstanding staff very professional and helpful 
432322,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, our room was directly below the weight room BEWARE the noise was very annoying we had to change rooms soundproofing is terrible in this hotel didnt get much sleep here room was extremely small for this price and the window was facing inside literally inside the lobby of the hotel so you cant get fresh air or direct sun and there are no hangers to hang a jacket or coat or eyebrow mirror little things in life go a big way for comfort , decor is modern and new room was clean and shower was great staff was nice location wasnt bad although i will stay closer to the beach next time i go to barcelona
432323,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, the bar closes at 11pm, bed was large and comfy quiet air con great location lovely hotel pleasant and helpful staff terrace bar has great views over city 
432324,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing , Great location modern rooms fresh plentiful breakfast and great staff A rooftop pool and bar with fantastic views of Barcelona A plus a Nespresso coffee machine in our room Would definitely recommend this hotel 
432325,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Deluxe room was too small bathroom was too small dirty bed sheets for two days they dind t change until we told it to the staff , Location staff breakfast
432326,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We had an interior room with very little outside light Additional lighting would have been welcomed , The rain shower was heavenly We appreciated the robe slippers and toiletries The front desk was very helpful with a restaurant suggestion calling a cab and storing our luggage for a late departure 
432327,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms are too small no drawers for putting cloths in Ok for an overnight if we did not have luggage Lights in stairwell can go off if you do not touch switch when entering even if they are on when you start Happened twice left in pitch black going downstairs , The location was great Easy walking and lots to see
432328,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Some of the Maids for example On our last day the maid came into the room early morning while we were still sleeping , the location was perfect Rooftop bar lovely to chill at nights Every single member of reception was helpful and lovely 
432329,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nice rooms but not confortable We were two adults staying for a week and had to keep almost everything in our suitcases There is just a small closet where you can hang a pair of clothes and the rest is occupied by the Nespresso machine the refrigerator and the cups The shower doesnt have a place to put soap or shampoo so everything must stay on the floor Air conditioning didnt seem to work Bed was changed just one time and it was on the day before we left , Hotel is brand new and clean well located friendly and helpful staff 
432330,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The reception service wasn t good Bad room small with no window Clastrofobic Bad elevator slow and stucked twice , New hotel Good breakfast Nice location
432331,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room we had looked out onto the foye rather than outside so it felt a little closed in Also the guy at the desk when we checked out was a bit rude not as nice as the rest of the staff All minor points though , Amazing location and amazing rooftop pool area Everything was so clean and the staff were generally lovely It was also extremely reaonable and the mini bar drinks were all free which was a lovely surprise 
432332,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The room service was amazing the mini fridge because it was free and got re filled everyday and they brought my boyfriend a strawberry cheesecake up on his birthday which I didn t have to ask for the staff where just lovely
432333,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, This is a lovely modern hotel in an excellent location perfectly located for exploring the central city on foot The staff are very welcoming and provide a very friendly and professional service We arrived in the middle of the morning and were delighted to be offered a room immediately After 23 hours flying this was much appreciated We found a nothing is too much trouble attitude prevailed at reception Every effort was made to ensure our stay was perfect The breakfast is excellent value and first class in terms of variety and quality We would certainly return to this hotel 
432334,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Car parking to expensive , New hotel and beautiful Perfect location near to placa Catalunya The staff was great helpful and friendly The rooms were large and very clean Very good breakfast 
432335,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The gym is really tiny and has limited equipment and a cupboard door in there springs open every ten minutes The window from our room looked straight onto a wall so there was no natural light at all which gave it a depressing feel Especially as we were there for my mums 60th I would have hoped for a room with a view of some sort and some natural light The lifts are really temperamental and a couple of times I ended up walking many flights of stairs as they just didn t arrive at my floor , The staff were really friendly and helpful The terrace is lovely with nice views The room is also really nice and comfortable with an awesome shower
432336,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, There s no one will take your luggage to the room when u arrive and no one will take them to the lobby when you leave So we had to carry our bags throw the front stairs it was rude of them coz I m pregnant, We loved the location And the cleanliness and they change the towels and renewed the toiletries every day
432337,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Hotel bar only open until 11PM Pool area a little small when hotel is crowded , The location is unbeatable close to anything you want to do in Barcelona and a stone s throw away from a Metro station that can get you anywhere amazing place to walk around and see the city The hotel Bar is very good with friendly staff and well trained bartenders the pool has a great view and great for relaxing with an amazing terrace And of course free minibar 
432338,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms could be cooler AC did not work Bar should be open later than 11pm Snacks evening meals would be nice in bar, Excellent breakfast Lovely staff
432339,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The weather but that was NOT any fault of the hotel, The hotel staff were all fantastic I have travelled all over the world and can say that ALL the staff were very helpful friendly and a credit to the hotel
432340,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room was poorly isolated we could hear distinctively the neighbours as well as the people having breakfast although We were on the 6th floor the construction is not in good material, The lobby was spacious and the breakfast big and a lot of choices
432341,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Base room is really base It is like a small box In the room u fell like tuna fish in supermarket shelves , Breakfast is good Location is good Minibar is free and thats a good compliment Staff was kind 
432342,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I wish the bathroom door had locks but that s not a big deal when traveling with family , The hotel is located steps away from Catalunya plaza The breakfast was always fresh I love the rain shower 
432343,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The beds could have been a touch higher to allow the suitcases to fit under the bed z f at, The location was excellent Drinking sangria poolside on a warm sunny day was a great way to unwind We would not have been as happy if we had ended up with a room facing the inside 
432344,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room service food not hot enough , Great location friendly and helpful staff breakfast superb roof top pool and views great we spent a lazy Sunday afternoon up there we took our drinks up there and the roof top bar doesn t open til approx 4pm This is a lovely 4 star hotel I have visited Barcelona on 4 occasions now the only thing that needs improving is the room service as the food was luke warm I would reccomend staying here and I personally would stay here again 
432345,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Our room was a bit small for a superior It was at times hard to manouver in it for 2 people Even after multiple calls to reception and reminding the staff in person the broken lock of a window in the room was not fixed and so we couldn t open it Being sick i was forced to use air conditioning By one of receptionists I felt almost lectured for not leaving green light switch for them to enter During seven days nobody took care of it I m sure with some explanation but when you try to fix something you find a way when you don t you don t , The hotel is rather new so all is tidy It was a nice touch to have a coffee mashine and some beverages in the room free of charge The bed was comfortable Cleaning staff worked good and seemed friendly 
432346,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The pool was freezing A shame because it was one of the main reasons I chose that hotel seeing as it was looking to be a warm weekend It is also much smaller than it appears in photos Breakfast is not worth the 16 euros pp , The front desk was helpful the room very clean modern and perfect size for 2 people over the weekend 
432347,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel was fabulous from start to finish The shower is amazing and the beds are comfortable The location is great with just a short walk to Las Ramblas and walking distance to the Marina 
432348,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, no Internet at the reception desk to get Restaurant Information the bar at the SPA area which is not offering drinking water charges 4 euro for a glass of water Windows in the rooms cannot be opened, very good breakfast
432349,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Queues at the coffee machine preferred to have hot drinks served at breakfast One domestic 4 slice toaster for everyone not enough No cava with breakfast , Great shower comfortable bed Fluffy towels Friendly staff Good location
432350,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Absolutely nothing to complain about , Extremely fresh and clean hotel friendly staff very good breakfast and coffee nice terrace pool and sauna and very good service We got upgraded from a standard room after we complained about lack of light and disturbing noice from hotel gym 7th floor Staff very helpful 
432351,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Rooms were meant to be sound proof but weren t Very noisy coming from lobby and outside traffic we were on the first floor Staff were not interested in dealing with anyone that wasn t Spanish, Location was excellent Hotel was very clean
432352,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We stayed two days and the room was great on the first day but it was poorly cleaned and was not made up on the second day Somewhat sloppily that was disappointing , We liked almost everything We did not eat there 
432353,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We booked a Standard room with a Basic Room being one below I believe the room we was first given was a Basic Room The window of the room looked out onto the hotel lobby no natural daylight was in the room We complained however was told it was a Standard and the rest of the rooms were full The following day our hot water was not working we complained and was upgraded to what I think was a Deluxe room This room was amazing View from huge window looking out onto other buildings the majority of the buildings in Barcelona are gorgeous , The view from our upgraded room was amazing sun woke us up with a smile each morning shining through the window Waterfall shower was amazing Red rose left on bed for Sant Jordi Day was a brilliant touch Saving the best till last would have to be the rooftop pool and bar terrace The view from this is absolutely unreal You can see both Tibidabo on top of the mountain and the Sagrada Famalia 
432354,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The lifts are slow , The hotel was great rooftop pool and bar was lush great rooms very clean friendly helpful staff Champagne on arrival breakfast was lovely 
432355,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The hotel is new and many of things are not thorough foreseen For example there is no soap box at the sink no toilet brush no shelf in the shower cabin The hotel is very noisy you can hear your neighbours living 2 levels up or down There is an excellent bar on the terrace on the roof but it works couple of hours a day , Excellent location Placa Catalunya is in a 5 minute walk staff is more or less helpful if you book superior room you ll get an excellent city view 
432356,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, As a business traveller I need everything to just work effortlessly This property fits the bill Comfortable clean and efficient A vey high standard 
432357,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Breakfast from 7 12pm was cold and not worth the charge Mainly a cold buffet and poor service in the breakfast hall , Excellent location central to placa catalunya a few minutes walk Placed a few blocks back from a the noise hustle and bustle of central Barcelona Clean contemporary styled rooms just smaller than what they look on the pictures 
432358,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We had a standard room and our window looked on to the corridor which was very disappointing We had the curtains closed throughout our stay , Location was great and in a quiet area just off the main shopping area Was easy access from the train that we got on straight from the airport Whole hotel was spotless and modern Staff where friendly and helpful Comfortable bed and the best shower we ve had was like a waterfall 
432359,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The price Unfortunately Barcelona is very expensive for accommodation so it s not entirely their fault I have stayed in a luxury villa in the Maldives for a similar price per night and it was just a basic room , Excellent location staff were very friendly and helpful Loved the rooftop terrace bar 
432360,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Bedroom only had one small window and felt quite pokey despite being a superior double , Roof top pool and bar were great and the location was excellent 
432361,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, The hotel is in an excellent location It s modern very clean and contemporary The staff are extremely friendly The breakfasts were excellent with a great selection The rooftop bar was lovely and again with great staff The room was finished off very well and the shower was fantastic The free mini bar was a nice touch The airport transfer bus drops off and picks up about a 2 3 minute walk away I would highly recommend this hotel When we return to Barcelona this will be the first hotel we ll check for availability 
432362,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The coffee automate is to slow when there are several people at the same time having breakfast , The Negresco Princes is a recommendation for everyone who has to be in Barca Breakfast is splendid Swimming pool on the top is marvellous 
432363,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room Because it was too small and claustrophobic and it didn t superior as the room was on booking s site pictures I paid for a superior and I took a basic one I didn t have the time at all to say it at the reception but still I am disappointed , Iliked the modern design the breakfast and the location 
432364,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing , The room had an excellent large private terrace which with extensive views over the city Complimentary mini bar very comfortable bed friendly staff excellent location 
432365,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, we had a corner room so i think we may have lost a few sq feet in space the room was a bit tight with our luggage all around on the floor , The bed was comfy the shower was quite nice and the Nespresso in the room was very convenient Loved the roof top bar area for sitting in the afternoon with a glass of wine 
432366,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Nothing everything excellent, Fabulous hotel close to all attractions and sights Rooms were spacious very clean beds were so comfy shower was probably the best I ve ever had in a hotel Maid service every day The breakfast was excellent and so much choice Available from 7am to 12 mid Gives you a great start to the day Roof top bar gives to great views of the city There is a gym pool and sauna up there too although not warm enough for us to use in March 
432367,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, It was not visible from the booking that when you book a standard room it will mean cave small room with a tiny window to atrium and not outside So book a superior room if you want daylight 610 is a connected room you can hear every word that is said in the next room if you understand the language , Loved the shower The building and facilities were new the location was great 
432368,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I could say bigger swimming pool and fitness center but honestly this is a hotel in the city center good to have it at all , in the middle of Barcelona close to all attractions new facility all brand new and modern I loved free mini bar small gesture making a big difference comfy bad very good breakfast sun terrace great to have a drink after very long day at work
432369,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, We needed a late check out this was charged at 90 which we felt was pricey for an additional four hours , Deluxe room was fabulous large room big terrace comfy bed rainfall shower FREE mini bar Reception staff were kind friendly very helpful 
432370,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was small I can barely move A bit overpriced But maybe compared to other hotels in the area it s considered good , Staff was excellent very welcoming helpful Breakfast was very reasonable Location is good Wifi was good
432371,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Coffee machine insufficient to cope with breakfast and kept breaking down Position of bed allowed light under curtains meal in restaurant average Felt ambience a bit clinical No shelve in shower annoying , Good wifi mostly of the time and most of the staff were nice Good shower liked the push button design Good variety at breakfast 
432372,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The only pickup would be that our room was inwards facing so we didn t have an outside window It throws you off a little in the mornings and was something I missed , The bed was incredibly comfy and despite our short 3 day stay we didn t want to get out of it The staff were excellent and very helpful and the location was incredible Very central and less than 5 minutes from the central square To young couples travelling I would suggest using the aerobus which is very frequent to get to and from the airport it drops you off in the centre of the city and is much cheaper than a normal transfer with minimal waiting around for 10euro return 
432373,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The tea facilities weren t changed when the room was cleaned which meant we didn t have tea the second day very English problem , Hotel was gorgeous perfect location within walking distance of the main areas Beautiful view from the roof terrace of the sagrada familia and the pool is lovely The room was really clean and modern Staff were so friendly loved being offered cava on arrival Bar is really nice and not outrageously priced 
432374,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The housekeeping didn t do a good job most of the time, It s very modern and the room size and design just perfect they provide us with water and soda every day and the espresso machine in the room can t get any better
432375,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, We were very surprised to see that the hotel is new beautiful and there was space in the room The staff is very nice and the location is perfect The food at the hotel was very good too breakfast room service and the bar on the groundfloor 
432376,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The bar downstairs finished at 2300 a bit early if you wanted a drink after a night on the town , Staff were lovely rooms excellent very modern and stylish
432377,Negresco Princess 4 Sup,No Negative, Modern hotel with welcoming staff located ideally near Paseo de Gracia Room had a great bathroom Loved the shower and the free bar with daily 2 beers cokes orange juice and water Let s not forget the free Cava at the lobby On same black Don Alfonso Restaurant has delicious morcillas caramel egg plant with manchego cheese and fried pigs ear Underground garage parking on same block Don t buy from hotel We are planning to return to Negresco Princess 
432378,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The lifts were very slow and at one point it stopped completely when I was alone Scary Though the breakfast was nice not good value too expensive Although there were glasses and bottles of wine at reception I didn t see anyone getting offered a drink I had written when booking that a room with a view would be appreciated as we were on our first wedding anniversary Not mentioned on arrival and no view , The location of hotel was fabulous It was spotless and loved the roof top swimming pool
432379,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room was deluxe but room is small , Perfect location Amazing breakfast Shower excellent Friendly staff and good value for money Couldn t ask for much more
432380,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The housekeepers were a little unobservant as they didn t replace the tissues box which only had one tissue in it on our arrival There was no coffee in the drinks cupboard o our arrival and they didn t replace the tea or coffee during our stay or the shampoo and shower gel on the second day These are minor issues and in no way spoilt the experience Loved the Hotel and we will return , The breakfast was excellent with so many choices The bed was so comfy and the pillows were perfect The shower was fabulous and we loved the high ceilings The roof terrace and pool were brilliant and the views from the roof terrace over the roof tops to the Gaudi Cathedral were amazing 
432381,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Missed more choice for dietary food for breakfast lean bread and cheese , Had everything I need on business travel including good WiFi and Nespresso machine Great choice at breakfast
432382,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, All good except the roof top didn t have a fixed waiter had to call to get some stuff but also great view, Modern clean spacious rooms very good location to main streets Price 
432383,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Room size on the small side for 2 people with luggage , New hotel with great location in the city center Very friendly and forthcoming staff Amazing rooftop terrace Very extensive and tasty breakfast buffet
432384,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The rooms have been put together very cheaply poor quality materials doubt it will stay in good shape for very long , The buffet breakfast was the best we ve had in a very long time highly recommended 
432385,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The night shift one middle aged man on the receptions is terrible It took exactly 30 minutes in the middle of the night to check in to two rooms and he tried to charge 30 EUR more for our stay after long argument he gave up The rooms facing the inner part of the hotel a noisy because of the breakfast After complaining they put us into another room , Very good location and breakfast The rooms are also very nice and modern 
432386,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Basic rooms are small so we upgraded to superior room Also no coffee making facility in basic room only tea which we found strange , Very welcoming and helpful staff who clearly enjoy their job The hotel is very modern and furnished beautifully in minimalist styling Beds and pillows are divine The roof terrace is stunning Easy walking distance to centre and all public transport 
432387,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The lobby and lobby bar was not very comfortable to sit and have a drink or socialize, The hotel was modern and clean It was a good location and the staff was very freindly The breakfast in the morning was very good with fresh options 
432388,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Some rooms has no windows to outside Doors shuts quite loud, Location very central Good amenities incl gym sauna and pool on top of the roof Room had good facilities as coffee maker slippers tooth brush free bar drinks Bed very comfortable

432390,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room could have been a bit bigger , Room was stylishly decorated Hotel location was very central Huge walk in shower with enormous shower head Free mini bar 
432391,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, I won t say that it bothered me but want to mention that rooms overlooking to atrium not to the city are little bit noisy Also when arrive to hotel on the back of it there is some construction though inside the hotel you don t see it , Locations is great rooms are fresh clean and the amenities are very impressive for 4 city hotel proper bathrobes slippers dental kits mini bar safe box Bathroom is very good beds are comfortable Also should mention great breakfasts good verity and great quality 
432392,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The walls are a little thin so quite noisy in the room but I did sleep ok in the very comfy bed The windows in my room were at an angle so the curtains let a lot of light in no matter how I adjusted them , Very pleasant staff nice room great shower Roof top bar will be great when a bit warmer Good location in a nice part of the city Very good breakfast 
432393,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Er payed 420 Euros for two days The suit room was not different orbetter than normal room The Price was extremly unfair In our bar we found opened bottle And it was not opened by us,No Positive

432395,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Not a thing, From arrival to departure we were met with great service luggage was delivered to our room trips taxis tickets and any information we asked for organised without any effort Hotel overall is so well looked after we couldn t fault a thing and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for superb location service comfort and affordable luxury Showers are great proper hairdryer plush robes slippers free water soft drinks beer in mini bar comfy bed funky decor and a perfectly positioned tv It s all these little things

432397,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The room has one window but you cannot open it and the room was too hot and I think the guests can have the key to open the window and change the air inside the room when re they want Only this for the rest the hotel is amazing , New hotel and just 5 minutes walking from Placa Catalunia The room was really big with new fornitures and big bathroom All the room has the nespresso coffe machine and it was really nice to do your coffe every moment also free bar but only with drinks Very big hall with elegant bar 
432398,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, Parts of window trim missing small mini bar door slams loud , Staff excellent and friendly I got a double luxury room I believe it is called and let me tell this was literally the tiniest room I ve ever been in The only reason I got it because it was half off from quite a number Thinking I will get some extra comfort on a luxury room boy was I wrong I can only imagine what the standard room is like Maybe itil is OK for a couple of penguins Also I made a nice video of the window trim missing and exposing the construction part underneath quite ugly The door slams like a mother And will keep you awake at night poor mini bar choice Otherwise a decent looking boutique hotel 
432399,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, No outside window the window looked out on an open space inside the building This meant that we couldn t really cool down the room without using a c despite it being quite cold outside , Great location
432400,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The coffee making facilities in the room could have been better Instead of a coffee machine perhaps a kettle would be better so that guests who prefer tea or herbal tea would be catered for , Modern hotel in a superb location Staff were friendly and made us feel very welcome The room was clean comfortable and quiet 
432401,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The size of the room too small and going into the London and Paris trend The thin walls and doors and the huge noise from the neighbours the cleaning staff the people in the corridor The absence of boiler and coffee in the room The poor minibar at water level The absence of any view in the street only a view on a wall The sauna not on in the morning The lifts not functioning properly, The welcoming and professional staff

432408,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, It would have been nice to have tea facilities in te hotel room there was an espresso machine with coffee pods and sugar but no milk or tea this would have been preferred as I m not a coffee fan Also it would have been nice to have some conditioner pots there was only shampoo and shower gel but I don t want to complain as it was still very nice , The hotel is in a good location and the staff were very helpful The breakfast was lovely and also the room service was value for money and very good 
432409,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The noises from other people in their rooms was exactly in our room and surprised when complain to the reception they told us you are right but we can t do anything for you it s same in other rooms in our hotel When other guests goes to WC in their rooms it seems that some bodies are in your room , Location was quite close to the Caralunya Sq 
432410,Negresco Princess 4 Sup, The elevator from the pavement to the reception was not working there was no sign in English out of order or something else and i was stuck inside Another thing such a hotel should had a thermometer some basics from a pharmacy kit , The location of the hotel is ideal Not in the center which is noisy and a little dirty but in the next neighbourhood where you are close to everything The hotel is brandnew and the beds the matrasses and the pillows are lovingly supersoft you just do not want to get up Also the girls in the reception are very kind smiling and always helpful
