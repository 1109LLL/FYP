33963,Op ra Marigny, Expresso cups only No kettle just coffee machine although tea bags Could of asked I suppose Did ask for milk and quickly dealt with my request , Very friendly staff couldn t do enough for you Great location Very nice small boutique hotel 
33964,Op ra Marigny, Room small Cleaners didn t do much Leak from sink overflow never repaired despite reminders Difficult to adjust air conditioning Lift broke down for 2days so had to carry baby and pushchair up to 3rd floor , Staff were friendly and helpful Location in quiet road near to shops and public transport 
33965,Op ra Marigny, The room is not very spacious and if travelling with kids will be a bit difficult The carpet was smelling a bit we thibk this because it was just cleaned before we got into the room as it was wet so we just opened the windows to let the room aired a bit As the shower cabin is a bit small water was splashing on the floor , The hotel is centrally located easy access to nearby touristic places and shops and bus to the airport The staff are very kind and helped to store our luggage as we were there before check in time and when we left the hotel our flight was in the evening and they stored our luggage for a few hours after check out 
33966,Op ra Marigny, The rooms had no UK TV the WiFi did not work properly The rooms were not very clean the bed had a stain and the toilet had hair in it Breakfast was poor croissants were stale there was very little choice for the hot food and what was there did not look appetizing , location
33967,Op ra Marigny, The kettle could have seen better days , I really appreciated the mini fridge The setting and atmosphere of the hotel was also really romantic Breakfast was enjoyable a wide variety was available 
33968,Op ra Marigny, Not many English speaking channels on the TV , A small hotel in a quiet central location in Paris Beautiful period building and close to the metro station and I was able to walk to most central sites in Paris good sized rooms with comfortable and good quality fittings Quiet at night and a very good sleep in a comfortable bed Good sized and modern bathroom Lots of shopping and restaurant options within walking distance from the hotel Professional staff and eager to please Recommended 
33969,Op ra Marigny, I did not like the fact that I was given a room on the ground floor facing the street while I had requested a quiet room when I booked over a month ago as I have problems of insomnia Also I did not like the way the staff handled my complaint as they said that that was the only room available and they couldn t move me to another one as they were fully booked so if I was not happy I could leave Not one apology very rude staff I also had a prepaid rate so could not leave unless loosing the money I had already paid The room was noisy as beside the cars on the street I could hear every single guest going in and out of the hotel and also their conversations The room was also very dark as I had to keep the curtains closed as my window was facing the street and so was open to everybody to look inside Breakfast was very poor and the Wifi didn t work and when I asked the concierge to help me to log in they were unable to make it work so couldn t work on my laptop unless using my mobile connection Phone reception was also very bad so I had to open the window the one on the street in order to make a phone call As I often travel to Paris for business I just wanted to try a new hotel but this one was definitely a huge disappointment I hated my stay at Opera Marigny I will never go back Thank you , The only thing I liked about this hotel was the location as it is very convenient for me 
33970,Op ra Marigny, The air conditioning in the room stopped working but as it was the weekend it could not be fixed A very small minus to an otherwise enjoyable stay , The location is fantastic on a quiet street just around the corner from La Madeleine and with pleasant walking distances to some of the best sights in Paris The staff at the hotel were very pleasant and helpful Rooms were quiet and clean if a bit small 
33971,Op ra Marigny, Everthing is so bad The room is very small Breakfast is poorly There is a no garson breakfast time Here is like 4 star hotel, Only location is good
33972,Op ra Marigny, The hotel is old Bathrooms need to be updated Rooms have a musty smell The desk chair was plastic The tea coffee set up is quite cheap This hotel does not feel like at 4 star hotel at all I would rate this hotel 3 stars , The bed was extremely comfortable The location is great Rooms were quiet The staff was very nice 
33973,Op ra Marigny, Although the room was comfortable there was no drawer space at all so we lived out of the suitcase for our smaller items Leaky tap on sink created a puddle rainwater showerhead sprayed water everywhere toilet refill sometimes just kept running and tea coffee supply was not always refilled ,No Positive
33974,Op ra Marigny, Lifts were slow although that s not a big deal Rooms were slightly tired around the edges especially the bathrooms Rooms were very small but this is also to be expected , Comfy bed staff were very helpful and exceedingly pleasant The location is fantastic though and this is a reason alone to stay here 
33975,Op ra Marigny, We really couldn t fault it , Friendly staff clean rooms great location we walked to most tourist attractions Louvre Notre Dame Arc de Triomphe Eiffel Tower lovely simple European breakfast available walking distance to many cafes and restaurants 
33976,Op ra Marigny, When you use shower the whole bathroom floor gets flooded as it s only a half cover shower door They give kettle with tea and coffees etc but don t put any milk or stirrers not a biggy but would just make sense to put them if they giving the others but I asked at reception and they gave me no problem, Location perfect for walking around and exploring room quite small but good for the money
33977,Op ra Marigny, The free wifi was awful not good signal the rooms looked a lot bigger on photos than they actually were could of got a bigger hotel room somewhere else for the price, Really clean good location
33978,Op ra Marigny, There is a tea pot in the room but they do no serve any complimentary tea bags nor sugar or sugar sustitute Also I had to ask for shampoo ans liquid soap because they did not supply a new bottle, The personal is very attentive and polite 
33979,Op ra Marigny, Our room had a really strong smokey odor I think because of the guests before us lt wasn t nice to sleep in as non smokers, Location price quality we booked a regular room but got a superior room instead we found out only later very kind and helpfull staff 
33980,Op ra Marigny, Minor detail but the lift was a bit on the small side I must admit I was quite loaded though with a stroller and big suitcase Its surely ok for a standard traveller with cabin size lugages Thanks Opera Marigny, The staff was so helpful and made my stay very comfortable I checked in late in the night on my arrival and the attendant was very courteous inviting and smiling He also gave me good tips for my stay The lady the next day was equally pleasant to deal with and proactive I was trying to find my key as I was making my way to the lift and before I even knew she was there handing me another cut I was impressed I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel Just a shame I didn t get to taste the breakfast they had some pancakes and pain d epices 
33981,Op ra Marigny, Unfortunately when we arrived our room was not ready as we arrived early morning but they notified us that the room would be available at 1pm We went out and came back at 1pm the room was not ready They still had to take measurements of the room and said it would take another 20 minutes 45 minutes later we were allowed to enter the room There was quite a lot of noise within the hotel because the walls are so thin you can hear your neighbour s conversation No new sheets were given everyday they would just re make the bed even though the sheets were dirty We also put up a do not disturb sign once but they still entered the room The staff were polite but not very enthusiastic and engaging Overall I wouldn t return back to this hotel , The location was a good area near Opera Garnier 
33982,Op ra Marigny, When we came into our room all we could see was a sofa bed and a child bed next to the sofa on different levels as it was all dark we didn t know the actual bed was in another room once we have figured out that there was another room with a nice bed it was ok however if the staff would have removed the child s bed and had left a nice sofa it would have been much nicer and no missunderstanding , very quiet nice balcony nice bed once we discovered the actual bed room
33983,Op ra Marigny, Breakfast is not breakfast if u come to turkey i would like to show you what is the breakfast room is small and choky , bathroom was good and clean bed is comfortable 
33984,Op ra Marigny, The room service ordered the wrong food and forgot an item took a long time to fix and I ended up giving up , I got one of their biggest rooms for a really amazing price 
33985,Op ra Marigny, There is no shuttle bus offer to airport as other hotels do going to airport is by taxi which they call for you but you pay an additional 4 euros for the call City taxi charge you a flat rate of 50 euros to and from CDG , Proximity of curiosities restaurants shopping etc Room was small but cute 
33986,Op ra Marigny,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff made the late night check in easy Excellent comfortable room with great air conditioning for a hot summer night The location allowed easy access to all the downtown Paris attractions 
33987,Op ra Marigny, the staff really rude when i check in he doesn t feel welcome to the guest He has attitude my room on the first floor so you can hear everything in the lobby people in out and loudly basically for handicaped facility I did request for up floor but I don t bother anymore The room no remote control after hours to find the remote finally i asked the rude receptionist for it he gave me without say sorry or anything instead give it stranged look to my face For sure he forgot give the remote to me I will stay in the next Arcade hotel next to it much nicer and friendly Thank god when i check out next day the other guy from reception with glasses in charged and he is very friendly and nice , location only 
33988,Op ra Marigny, The shower wasn t very good You either had to be submerged in water or not getting wet at all There weren t enough power point facilities next to the bed , Size of the room was great Beds were very comfortable
33989,Op ra Marigny, Wifi was not good on upper floor lobby is a bit cramped, Location location and location Two of the staff members would make me want to return to the property The night manager who was on duty the evening of August 3rd And the cleaning lady These two members went out of their way to ensure that we had an enjoyable time in spite of a confusion with the type of room we reserved they helped by providing solution to a problem that I though would damper our enthusiasm Kudos to these two individuals the hotel should recognize them 
33990,Op ra Marigny, The bed uncomfortable the breakfast was poor and the room very small , I managed to book a cheap deal so the value for money for this particular case was ok 
33991,Op ra Marigny,No Negative, Wonderful staff and the rooms are SO quiet The staff helped us with so many things and made us feel very welcome Very comfy and luxe Loved this hotel 
33992,Op ra Marigny, Staff was rude housekeeper was knoking to door till i went from shower with towel on me and she asked can clean now what my answer was a bit later she started to make upleasant noise came later and didnt leave hygenic kit cream as supossed to be I wont pay to hotel again which has such staff , The place and room were good as small boutique hotel style
33993,Op ra Marigny,No Negative, Stayed in the hotel for 2 nights on a last minute booking Our corner room was very spacious compared to most Paris style rooms Room was quiet even facing the street which is quiet after the hustle and bustle of the work days Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again 
33994,Op ra Marigny, soundproofing was not that good we could hear our next door neighbors talking having a coffee machine in the room we had to remind them to refill the capsules every day bed not too comfortable but after long walking days we would very tired and sleep rooms a bit dark could use extra lighting, geat location 5min walking from madeleine metro station which is well connected hotel situated on a quiet street so not noisy at all we were upgraded to a suite so we were very happy we also had a small balcony with a cool street view great bathroom the toiletries are amazing everything was clean and modern reception offers free newspaper and magazines in the morning very helpful and friendly staff for the breakfast it is a buffet served next to the reception area which is a bit small but we werent bothered by that choices are not a lot but ok minimarket open till midnight 1 block away from hotel
33995,Op ra Marigny, When we arrived at the hotel the staff was not able to answer our questions about parking costs and spaces we came by car , The room was beautiful and very clean A nice neighbourhood and close to a lot Paris must sees like Arc Triomphe and Eiffeltower 
33996,Op ra Marigny, No coffee Nespresso for our machine in the room They were all out of nespresso pods So we had to go to the dining hall to get our cup of coffee Very small room Not enough space for 2 open suitcases , Comfortable twin beds Very quiet location Close to metro 
33997,Op ra Marigny, Noise out on street every morning 6 30 when they collecting rubbish just woke us up , Location just perfect for shopping for walking central Paris for getting to best restaurants and art exhibitions 
33998,Op ra Marigny, How s this for scraping the barrel for ideas the TV setup is such that the sound can t be turned up too high to avoid disturbing others I presume but as a confirmed BBC watcher it was just too quiet just on that channel even turned up full Not really the hotel s fault Otherwise nothing , I really can t fault this hotel even a couple of really trivial things I asked to be done were sorted out perfectly and straight away The room was a good size double with everything you would need for a few days stay I was there for only two nights but would happily have stayed longer if could have and I wish I had booked this instead of the hotel opposite Gare du Nord where I spent my first night in Paris I will definitely book this hotel in future if I can 
33999,Op ra Marigny, No other facilities in hotel No Milk available for in room coffee machine Building next door being refurbished got some noise from bedroom above us, Location Many Metro stations in easy walking distance
34000,Op ra Marigny, When we entered our room we could smell the smoke of the previous guests although it was a non smoking room and hotel We complained at the reception but immediately got a new room , Good location quite rooms great beds
34001,Op ra Marigny, Rooms are extremely tiny No shelves at all Imagine nowhere to put things and clothes on Very very poor breakfast Omelette was swimming in milk fried eggs smelled like something has burnt No waiters It seems the lady helping around was combining a position of a waiter cleaning lady saw her throwing the garbage outside and a cook I totally do not recommend to stay in this hotel Pictures are lies , Location
34002,Op ra Marigny, Paris room sizes are always on the small size and prices very high Breakfast was too expensive better and cheaper just across the road Lighting in the room was broken couldn t turn off at night and works going on somewhere in next building from early morning Soundproofing in room wasn t that great could hear next door Overhead shower sprayed everywhere but where you wanted it , Location fabulous staff very helpful room was very clean and as advertised the lift fitted our pushchair and two adults just 
34003,Op ra Marigny, Room too small not good air con only heater so when the open window also noisy from outside and another room on the top the breakfast charge not the same everyday some day 12 someday 18 euro depend on what same food , Locations And staff frienly
34004,Op ra Marigny, I was disappointed with many things starting with the lobby tiny reception no lobby to the breakfast area which seats up to 15 people only and seats are cramped with no room to circulate comfortably to the elevator there is 1 small elevator only which does not fit three people with their suitcases When you get out of the elevator on the room floor level it is very dark and the lights do not switch on right away you actually have to walk in the dark for a good few steps which is a risk hazard especially that there is a steep spiral stairs to your right and someone can easily trip over it in the dark Not enough light in the room either very small closet I was staying in the superior double room so I was expecting better Room was not cleaned properly Dirty tea cups were not changed Friendly staff though, location Bathroom is the best though standard quality compared to other 4 star bathrooms
34005,Op ra Marigny, It s very cold in the bathroom Room service works only till 2 30am I was too hungry and wanted to order but everything was closed, Nice shower gel and pillows
34006,Op ra Marigny, i asked for a new room as i was put on the ground floor no bars on the windows a simple lock to get in and out As a solo female traveler i wanted a room above the street not on the street level I was woken up at midnight to change rooms could have waited until the next day ,No Positive
34007,Op ra Marigny, A fully closing shower door as powerful shower caused bathroom floor to flood somewhat Would add to relaxing aesthetics to have gentle music playing in evenings in bar and mornings at breakfast , Friendly helpful staff Requests were honoured Great breakfast choice Comfortable warm low lit room Relaxing environment 
34008,Op ra Marigny, Typical Parisian size room Overpriced Adjacent building undergoing renovations so if you like to sleep in a little get used to the sound of hammers drills etc OR request a room on the opposite side of the renovations , Location
34009,Op ra Marigny, La suite en duplex with the jaccusy is quite ordinary and not worth the exitment The sqm2 announced is quite misleading because there is a useless little room next to the bathroom in the 2nd floor At the end it is a smaller room than it is advertised To avoid , The breakfast is okaish
34010,Op ra Marigny, Rooms are a bit small particularly the ones on the first floor The hotel website offered a better price than bookings com, Good location friendly staff 
34011,Op ra Marigny, There was not many storage possibilities in the room for example no hangers for the coats You have to put them in the closet all the time and I would be happy for some additional drawer or rack but this is really a minor point , Location was excellent for our planned activities Champs Elysee Tour Eiffel Louvre Montmartre we could reach by foot It s central but quiet location so good sleep at nights We booked the hotel as late deal and got a really good discount I would not suggest to book it for a full price because then it s overpriced for sure although it s a 4 star hotel the best think about it was location all the rest is totally ordinary but ok for me as I was not hoping for luxury 
34012,Op ra Marigny, Negative points 1 the absence of a real bar restaurant at the hotel therefore breakfast is poor and you can t order a whisky sour and 2 business traveler shouldn t expect to be able to work from their room room not properly equipped , The location is great The room are very cosy and comfortable elegant mix of boutique modern value for money all the way 
34013,Op ra Marigny, At the end I was requesting about the refund The receptionist didn t seem willing to help and talked to my friend in French even she could speak in English Other staff are really nice though , Location is excellent We arrived very earlier but they helped us checked in so we can get some rest after a long ride Will definitely come back 
34014,Op ra Marigny, I booked a superior room nesepresso machine was provided however they charge 1 per capsule no other beverages such as coffee tea were provided as stated in their website The bath shower screen was broken ill fitted had to spend considerable time drying the flooded bathroom Not much attention given to presentation of the room I found half drunk soft drink bottle in the minibar fridge , Helpful staff good breakfast comfortable bed 
34015,Op ra Marigny,No Negative, Great location very close to Auber and Opera where you get Roissybus and open top buses to tour the city Also a short walk from Galeries Lafayette and Madeleine Small room but excellent bed and shower Also great breakfast
34016,Op ra Marigny,No Negative, Excellent place Enchanting atmosphere fine and cozy design super soft bed quiet and clean rooms A perfect choice to complete your Parisian experience 
34017,Op ra Marigny, False advertise I booked classic double room 16 sqm but when we arrived the room was only 2 5mx3m which is not more than 7sqm in total We couldn t walk or move in that room When I asked the receptionist to get what I paid fore she has asked me that I have to pay extra 90 per day I already paid 290 for that little room for 2 nights Honestly it doesn t worth 20 The breakfast is very poor with Just waste money absolutely scam, The location is good
34018,Op ra Marigny, There is repair works in the building near by which start at 8 am After this time its impossible to sleep feeling like they drill the wall in your room , Good location good rooms comfort bed
