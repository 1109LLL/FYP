374622,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, One of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in The inter room noise was so disturbing it woke me up every day The beds were so hard it aggravated a previous shoulder injury There were several functions held at the hotel which meant that the pool area was in accessible due to people attending the functions Very frustrating , The location was fantastic and the staff were very accommodating and friendly 
374623,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, We had booked a Delux King Room for 4 nights and had asked to have a quiet room On arrival we were given a room facing the busy street with windows not able to close properly Another room same problem Also no sofa in room even if it said so on the booking confirmation Also not soundproof Third room facing back with old furniture old rug falling apart taped rug under the bed cracked toilet Next day new room with peculiar smell in bathroom dirty madrass cover ripped curtain and ripped old towels We were told that Delux King Rooms only are facing the street A day before we arrived an e mail came from the hotel asking when we will arrive They cuild easily have told us that our wish of room will not be possible and suggesting another room We found the front staff very arrogant when we were complaining and spend a lot of time arguing with front desk team They did not compensate for anything The pool was one reason we chose this hotel but it was a childrens pool only 80 cm high and did not open until after 10 o clock in morning to 8 o clock evening My husband scratched his knees while trying to swim I came to breakfast in the robe from the first room and on the second breakfast was demanded to leave and change clothes The lady from front desk said they had dresscode I asked where it was written She did not answer I wanted to go swimming before breakfast but because the pool opened so late I ate in the bath robe The superior from front desk on the second day offered us to cancel the last nights and help us book another hotell We did not want to spend any more time of our vacation looking for hotels so we stayed We learned that Hilton Hotel save the best rooms for their members inc ase they make a late booking so if you are not a member do find yourselves another hotel and save money and nerves We were told 11 rooms were moving out after our first night ,No Positive
374624,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Staff weren t the best They weren t very attentive Some were nice some weren t On tripadvisor all double rooms are with balcony regardless of if it is twin or king Our room didn t have a balcony and when we complained after waiting an hour they offered us a smaller room with balcony and it wasn t even clean The staff wasn t very kind while doing this Our room wasn t properly cleaned Not a good selection of breakfast All in all this place didn t feel like a doubletree let alone hilton Hilton should review this hotel more often and consider their contracts This hotel doesn t deserve the Hilton name but has it s price , Great location Comfortable beds and big room Nice restaurant not the breakfast 
374625,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, pool was not usable couldn t find the massage room room service was late the main pain was the card system had trouble every day sometimes several times I needed to ask reception desk to fix my card problem, friendly staffs good breakfast clean room Wifi worked well
374626,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The room was dirty along with the lifts being out of order The toilet did not Flush in the room and the telly remote did not work The swimming pool looked good but after allowing my son who is 7 to swim in the pool he came out and his legs and body turned red I had to shower him for nearly an hour to get the chlorine off he was extremely upset The fire escape we had to use was in my mind dangerous as the levels changed and the stairs changed from white to black this was confusing and could lead to people miss judging the steps and falling One afternoon we stood at the bar for about 20minutes and left in the end as the bar tender ignored us The breakfast was not good as the cooked food was badly presented and not cooked very well , Nothing
374627,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, the room they gave me is very uncomfortable and noise I told the receptionist to give me higher floor and he said there is no other room available checked in at late night and my employees check in the next morning and they had higher floor and better room , location is very good 
374628,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Struggling to find anything I didn t like to be honest I had everything I needed , Comfy beds liked the little balcony looking out onto the bustle of the Barcelona evening Only stayed for one night as a stop off to a conference but had a little time in the morning for a wander and this hotel was ideally placed to see Gaudi houses and Sagrada Familia and had an excellent caf nearby for brunch Oh and the free cookie at check in was a welcome snack after a long day 
374629,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Expensive buffet breakfast No warm water pool Short gym open times Staff are great but last day the less senior reception staff were not that helpful, A boutique hotel taken by Hilton It s kept its charm while brings extra comfort
374630,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Only way to reduce uncomfortably warm room temperature was by opening the widow a few inches overnight Very awkward if arriving by car Nowhere to park on street to drop off luggage check in get direction to the parking garage which is a 5 min walk away One doesn t have this information prior to check in A bit far from the majority of sites that people typically want to see in the city , Located in a posh neighborhood with plenty to see and do in the vicinity A safe area to be out in after dark Lots of dining options around Very close to the main Gaudi houses Very excellent breakfast Staff very pleasant very helpful 
374631,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, It is my third time staying at this hotel I shift between this one and two others in the area based on best booking com deal No direct negatives, Best area to stay in Barcelona Great restaurants in the area good shopping away from La Rambla etc
374632,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Value of money vs room hotel facility is not comparable it s too expensive The smallest elevator I have ever seen only 2 ppl very slow, Location
374633,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Couldn t take towels to the beach Noisy kids at the pool splashing jumping and the staff ignored it, Nice pool Free room upgrade Great location Lovely bar
374634,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton,No Negative, Hotel right in the center but very quiet inside Really friendly staff Swimming pool was also really fun for the kids Cosy Area at the swimming pool
374635,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, My only issue was that they begin cleaning rooms at all hours of the morning and it could be heard through the walls This woke us up earlier than we would have liked on a couple of occasions , The terrace and pool are absolutely perfect We loved spending late afternoons laying out after a day of touring Additionally the location of the hotel is in a safe and nice part of the city It s away from a lot of the crowds and within walking distance to tourist sites and wonderful restaurants 
374636,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Didn t like 2 single beds pushed together for a couple And making you pay for wifi Everywhere else in the area was free No good, Location was good 
374637,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Staff was impolite We arrived with the child and they did not assist us with the luggage We asked for the parking place in the garage and they just gave us card with the location of nearby garage where we could park our car Rooms need renovation We expected that they follow the Hilton standards and from that reason we selected them however this was very disappointing We will never come again in this hotel ,No Positive
374638,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The room is quite dark Would like prefer more lighting Prefer a neutral colored corridors , We liked the firm mattress Also like the extra shelves space in the bathroom for toiletries 
374639,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, It would have been nice if they had more options for lunch when raining , The room was more stylish than I expected The staff was very friendly helpful 
374640,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The room was not cleaned very well Dust on the headboard and side tables stayed for all three days Reception desk took over my postcards and one euro per postcard and said they ll post them out I d sent one to my children and one to my in laws I ve been home now for two weeks there is still no sign of the post cards , The location is perfect 
374641,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The rooms are so small and clostrofobic window can not be opened nothing like hilton standart Breakfast was ok nothing special , The location is great
374642,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Dark decor and hardness of furnishings, Decor is quite dark I think they were going for a midern feel but failed Not inviting Could use an update Rooms were small
374643,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Rooms are not soundproof at all Front office staff woke us up two nights in a row to tell us to turn off the TV which wasn t even on We were sleeping We could hear the TV s in surrounding rooms however I complained and only got we re sorry Breakfast was OK but nothing special and set up in a conference room Amenities are a bit poor , Location is very good nice comfortable bed good shower although in the bathtub clean room The cookie offered at check in 
374644,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Very disappointed that both the bar and restaurant were completely closed due to refurbishment the whole time we were there for all we wanted to explore the city this really dampened our experience as we do like to have a few drinks in the bar either at the start or at the end of an evening The replacement area had no bar or atmosphere and not really any staff present to order a drink The first we knew about this was a letter in our room as we arrived Spa and wellness centre was also a bit of a joke Sauna wasn t even switched on , Location was good Very clean 
374645,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The hotel has two parts My experience of one of them is not too good We were accommodated in two rooms in the part from number of floor 8 In this part the corridor to rooms was very poor and old carpet and walls The windows in both rooms were overstruck by not transparent foil The view was to some yard We were not able to see what was in this yard because we were unable to open the window totally only to narrow spacing And in one of our rooms was spreading the very bed small from out through the windows The air conditioning in one of our rooms was unfortunately broken Because of the bed small we were enforced to have closed our windows and due to the fact that the air conditioning was out of order in the room there was very hot air , the staff was very kind and the breakfast was good 
374646,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, AC was hot since I traveled in winter time Slept with window ooen which made it better but then street sounds can be a nuisance , The food at restaurant was fantastic Staff very acomodating 
374647,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, My two friends had a twin room and it was tiny The place was very limited for two people For that price we expected at least a normal size rioom , The staff was really good and nice and very helpful The area is great for those who want to live in a safe and more quite area There are tons of luxury retail shops around and it s still very central 
374648,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, All great, Rooms are great Personnel very kind and available Breakfast is great Nice position quite central Honestly you couldn t ask for more Best Hotel that happened to me in a long while 
374649,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, Our room never had any natural light coming in which was a minor downer, Brilliant Staff who were extremely helpful and told us about the best places to go
374650,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton, The walls were too thin I could hear the neighbor showering in the next room It was particularly annoying in the morning when cleaning the other rooms we could hear the vacuum and the beds moving , They gave us amazing cookies when checking in and out very welcoming reception staff location was excellent 
374651,Alexandra Barcelona A DoubleTree by Hilton,No Negative, On Arrival We were robbed at the airport and we lost our passports among many other things The staff specially the trainee Gerard were very helpful in supporting us during our difficult period and I would like to thank him and all the staff
