136945,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The reception staff could have been friendlier The hot water in the bathroom was very irregular while it was fine in the basin and shower we could never get hot water in the bath and had to fill it by hand using the kettle , The price wasn t bad compared with other hotels of a similar standard We really liked the location and the design and comfort of the hotel and its rooms Our room was a decent size especially for Paris It was great to have breakfast included with our rate which made our stay extra comfortable The room came with free coffee and tea which was a plus 
136946,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, In a perfect position within easy walking distance of metro and many of the must see places and museums Made to feel very welcome and all staff were extra helpful 
136947,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, We had two problems which were on arrival I had pre arranged a transfer from the airport to the hotel with the hotel and when we arrived the driver was not there We waited an hour and a half and contacted the hotel when in the end they said he wasn t coming and we had to organise our own taxi They said their driver was usually reliable but not this time I had also pre arranged for the hotel to book our lunch at a cafe for Christmas and when I checked that also hadn t been done but they did it once I checked So probably have to keep ensuring they do what you ask even though I had sent emails and received confirmation of the arrangements I had asked for The staff were apologetic and were very helpful with other things during our stay and organised the taxi on our return journey to the airport , The rooms were very comfortable the bathrooms quite large and the shower great Staff were very helpful The hotel is in a great location 
136948,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, During winter there could be a bit more heating on the 5th floor , It s a central very beautiful Hotel The staff is very friendly and the rooms are really nice The best thing about the Hotel room was the bed Never slept more comfortable The best bed in the world 
136949,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, There was nothing I didn t like, Superb travelled with 2 teenagers and my partner loved everything about this hotel Breakfast was perfect prestige rooms were excellent wifi working throuout the hotel Hotel staff were very polite and accommodating
136950,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Would have loved to rate this beautiful establishment higher but the staff wasn t very friendly or helpful We were only allowed to checkin at 5 30 Not a pleasant experience after a very long flight We had to hang around feeling tired and needed a shower desperately Absolutely the worse you could do to your guests , Excellent location beautiful historic building next to the canal Room were very clean with good quiality linen Modern well appointed room and bathroom Nespresso machine Stunning reception area 
136951,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, If you were late down for breakfast some items were gone and had not been replaced so selection was a bit more limited For some reason the shampoos in our room were not replaced topped up during our stay , Hotel was clean and well presented throughout Modern style Breakfast was typical continental style buffet with enough to fill you until lunch time
136952,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, no complaints , perfect Paris location close to Assembly Nationale and the Invalides Metro Quiet street beautiful area very close to Musee Rodin Small hotel that is very luxurious large room that is modern but still feels like older paris building with lots of wood working and tall ceilings Staff was very friendly and gracious The breakfast is excellent and worth adding Scrambled eggs pastries meats fruits etc Not an inexpensive hotel but for the quality and location in Paris we think it is a good value We look forward to coming back 
136953,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, We erroneously left a wallet in our room when we left The hotel management contacted us immediately and then at our request mailed the wallet to our home We were very very pleased

136956,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, Great Hotel quiet but close to the centre The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever had The staff were friendly polite as well as helpful we had a fabulous time can t recommend highly enough 
136957,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The location is good because it s quiet but it also means that it is a little walk to go to almost all restaurants That s fine Use uber You can walk to some museums and Eiffel Tower and a few other things But if you want a happening nightlife look at Latin quarter Bastille Montmarte I would choose this place though and just uber there like I did, Nice clean place great breakfast recommended so u don t have to run out Good wifi Excellent shower Much better than most places in this price range No language issues
136958,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, can t think of anything, Great hotel in a great location The staff were the nicest we ve ever encountered It was our 25th wedding Anniversary and on arrival to the room we were presented with Champagne and Macaroons The room was very cosy and fully equipped with the comfiest bed ever The area was very quiet but with the National Assembly on holidays that might change Just over the bridge is Place de la Concorde and down the boulevard is St Germain where there are so many restaurants to choose from Would definitely stay there again 
136959,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, The best Hotel great location and the staff was very nice and helpfull The room was large and beautifully decorated The bathroom confortable I highly recommend this Hotel

136962,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The draining of the bathtub was a bit too slow for the shower but it went faster when some water was accumulated giving the pressure I guess Our room had a very low ceiling I m about 176 cm and I could reach it if I raise my hands not a big deal though , We really like the comfy bed and bedding and we had good sleep The room was large and location good for the price considering it s Paris and the staff was very friendly and helpful The air conditioner worked well and it s in a quiet location that s close to most things we wanted to visit we walked almost everywhere 
136963,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, We didn t eat breakfast as it was extremely overpriced Used a small bistro nearby instead , Very quite surround rare in central Paris Perfectly clean Staff was friendly and helpful Great location

136965,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Would have liked to have had a gym , Small but elegant hotel in nice area Staff very helpful Rooms were small but laid out well to make the most of the room space Internet in room was excellent hi speed at no extra charge Good price 
136966,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Comfortable but small room Great view but top floor with low ceiling and narrow hallway Not many restaurants or bars right near by , A great hotel Beautiful property and lovely room warm welcoming and helpful staff Nice quiet location near museums etc and metro station Very convenient Has been nicely renovated and beautifully decorated Nice breakfast Free Wifi is a real bonus A terrific value 
136967,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, 1 Tiny room which was actually a converted corridor on the top floor 2 Ceiling in bathroom too low unable to shower comfortably 3 Breakfast was haphazard two girls were working but cutlery and food not replenished 4 Asked for change of room but told this would not be possible No explanation given 5 This was part of my wife s 50th birthday celebrations and I asked via Booking com that this might be acknowledged by the hotel Despite being told the hotel had acknowledged this on arrival given terrible room and not even a flower in the room 6 Sauna wasn t working for the duration of the stay despite being included in the overall cost No remuneration offered It may have been different outcome if we hadn t booked through Booking com and instead booked direct with the hotel I won t be using this site again unfortunately We may have just encountered the hotel on a bad day or four but in the context of expectations of the hotel it was a massive disappointment , Location was great In general staff were polite and helpful 
136968,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, 250 a night was not value for money for me Poor bar and breakfast for the money spent They only had two types of wine in the small bar and one bottle they didn t even have I was in France right , The rooms were spectacular and the staff friendly 
136969,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, On one or two occasions the shower could only produce luke warm water , Beds were extremely comfortable and the rooms were very well appointed The location was excellent allowing us to walk to the Louvre Musee d Orsay Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower 
136970,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, I would have preferred a room with a window facing the outdoors , The location is excellent The bathrooms are very upscale with very high quality fixtures and appointments 
136971,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, only 7 tables for breakfast if you come and all of them are beasy you have to wait long time not eaouafe stafe poor breakfast and poor service food was finished for a very short time not enoufe food , good location helpfull staff very clean room 
136972,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Like most older Paris hotels the room was quite small, Well placed professionally run small hotel Well equipped room and shower decent breakfast All over a good place for visiting the Grand Palais Mus e d Orsay and the Louvre 
136973,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The only problem we had with the hotel was that our bathtub had not been properly cleaned before we came in And they hadn t hoovered the room They did do so the next day though , The location and staff were absolutely fantastic All staff at the reception speak English and they were happy to comply with any wishes we had The hotel is in a great location Very near the centre but very quiet in the weekends 
136974,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Our room was never warm enough and we thought the price of breakfast was high , The location and staff were excellent The convenience of purchasing tickets at the hotel for main museums etc was a a great plus 
136975,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, For the first 24 hrs of our stay the hot water was broken Hotel staff were understanding of frustration and were very willing to assist guests with relocation if they chose We chose to stay because we loved the hotel and we are glad we did the water was fixed However we were a little disappointed that in consolation we were only given one free day of breakfast , Cool modern updates and facilities inside of a classic Parisian building While in a very quiet location you are in walking distance to all the big sites great restaraunts and the c train to get anywhere you can t walk As a young adventurer I am always happy to take the metro and trains but at times when my mother was not reception was very helpful ordering taxis and shuttles as needed Could not feel safer across the street from the National Assembly which was constantly staffed with guards 
136976,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, when i turned off the lights not the room contact the outlets would turn themselves off incredible low ceilings had claustrophobia issues the images fool you Room was small and twisted probably like the architect who designed the hotel room service food was a disaster quality and presentation really disgusting and a ripoff , location bed
136977,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, Extremely nice location Highly recommended for discovering Paris and for romantic stay Room is very cozy and bed very comfortable Will return to this hotel again Comparing to Paris offer this hotel is the best choice 
136978,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Our sixth floor room had a low ceiling , The quiet convenient location near the National Assembly The hotel is lovely comfortable and well run and the breakfast is fabulous Even in a quiet part of Paris there was a lot of wonderful dining within walking distance 
136979,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Like many hotels in Paris small spaces including life communal areas and the room itself Not a major issue though , Great spot in the centre of Paris Lovely decor clean and fresh Attentive and very pleasant staff 
136980,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Nothing it was one of the best stays we ever had , We had the executive room and it was great very spacious for Paris and extremely comfortable great bed and well decorated The location was great only 2 blocks from the metro and in a lovely neighbourhood walking distance from the eiffel tower and the rodin musee and still very well connected to places like Montmartre same metro line The staff were great we wanted to practice our rustic french and they were extremely patient with us when it would have been much easier for them to switch to english Breakfast was lovely too 
136981,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, Small but well appointed room Great comfortable bed Quite residential neighborhood Many restaurants yet short walk to shopping or subway Very helpful staff 
136982,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Location could be better Metro is reasonably close but is not one of the better more convenient lines to be near We more often walked farther to another line Very quiet neighborhood that was largely closed down in August Bed was two twins pushed together and was somewhat uncomfortable especially if we wanted to snuggle , Newly renovated property with powerful air conditioning Quiet roomy and super clean Easy access to our 4th floor room via elevator Rue Cler is an easy walk for good food choices and a market This hotel is a good choice for the traveler who wants American hotel comforts at a reasonable Paris price 
136983,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, Fantastic location all the major attractions are within walking distance but the hotel is in a quiet area Ample eating and drinking options available close by Room was very comfortable and had all the necessary ammenities 
136984,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The only thing I could note as it could put down the all over 4 star experience was the f aking ceiling above the shower But its nothing that would ruin a trip , It could not be better hotel was clean staff helpful beds to die for Shower and bathrobes really good 
136985,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Just be warned that when you book they pre authorise the price of the first nights stay on your card which isn t written anywhere obvious on booking com just meaning that money won t be available in your account for 10 working days , Very welcoming staff and very clean and stylish hotel it s in the perfect location within walking distance of all the main touristy attractions Eiffel Tower louvre etc We only needed to use a taxi train to get from the Eurostar to the hotel The hotel is also opposite a lovely patisserie and the area feels very safe Was very quiet at night and didn t have any problems 
136986,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, the bathroom we had on the 6th floor was just a tad too small for 2 people Didn t even know where to put a used towel , love the location Stayed here many many times Actually every time we have been in Paris since 2000 Its a quiet hotel and everything is easy to reach by foot Rooms are small but just right to my liking 
136987,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, When we came in to the hotel 16 08 15 the man didn t say even hello and was really inhospitable , Thanks a lot to the girl on reception she speaks russian that she changed the room because I absolutely couldn t sleep in the room 64
136988,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH,No Negative, Very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff Nice clean rooms with very comfortable beds Restaurants and cafes are a short walk away Can really recommend this hotel 
136989,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, The doors of the close closet swung open and hit the end of the bed Problem could be eliminated with slider doors on the closets Front desk staff was very porofessional friendly and helpful Breakfast was ver good Hotel was nicely decorated and clean , Bed was very comfortable and the pillows and comforter were fluffy and soft The bath towels were nice and warm thanks to the towel warmer The bath amenities were nice too 
136990,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, I didn t like that the evening before our departure I asked the concierge if it s possible to stay at the hotel till 3pm he answered me yes if there won t appear any new reservation In the morning another concierge was at the reception He told me that it s impossible to stay in the room till 3 pm for free n we shud pay 94euro for 3 hours crazy price I was so dissapointed This last event spoiled all impression I had my bday during our stay in this hotel We booked the room La Ravissante I don t know how looks like other rooms but our was rather small I have seen the breakfast it was rather poor but like everywhere in France The corridors on the floors were awful it was very difficult to pass them with the suitcase , I liked the present from the hotel the bottle of wine for my bday thanks a lot but there wasn t ice There was very good russian woman at the reception who tried to help us in any question Almost all concierges was very kind to the guests excepting one that was from Asia chinese maybe Room was small BUT it was possible to open two suitcases Not far from the hotel there are a lot of good cafes for breakfast I liked too much the interior of the hotel so nice funny n clean 
136991,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Our shower only had a shower curtain and no proper shower enclosure Room service not available 24 7 and very pricey however understandable as it is a rather small property We were unable to pay with a credit card at the desk and instead had to withdraw from a near by ATM , Prime location in a quiet area in the heart of Paris as it is very prestigiously located right behind the parliament close enough to walk most places Champs Elysees Eiffel Tower Galleries Lafayette Louvre Museum Tuilleries Garden etc or otherwise use the 2 3 metro stations very close by Staff were very friendly helpful and caring The room we got was very spacious with good wardrobe space and a huge bathroom My husband was very very impressed even though he is not generally a fan of boutique hotels Would definitely recommend 
136992,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, Shower rail and head were broken on arrival Cleaners should have reported it and been fixed before we needed the shower , Great location quiet street but very close to concorde and siene 
136993,H tel Bourgogne Montana by MH, No complaints We ve stayed there three times now , I love the location short walk to many shops on both the left and right banks and attractions yet it is quietly tucked away from the brash tourist areas This time we had a small child with us and staff were helpful Very helpful with reservations too
