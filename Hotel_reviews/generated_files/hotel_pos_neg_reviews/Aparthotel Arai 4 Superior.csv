282060,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The location in the Gothic Quarter was good in that it was close to everything however it was difficult to get to by car The main way into the area was blocked off for several of the days that we were staying there Also staying in the Gothic Quarter meant dealing with lots of crowds all of the time Next trip to Barcelona we would consider a different neighborhood for this reason , Hotel was clean staff was very friendly and helpful arranging our return to the airport Decor and details were attractive and very well done The only drawback to this hotel was the location although some would enjoy being right in the middle of things as it was an easy walk to the port 
282061,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, No extra services not even ice The worst though is that the noise comes through the windows and all night long you can hear the folks on the street getting drunk and partying Obscenities etc I didn t sleep at all and I m a heavy sleeper , Very clean beautiful hotel
282062,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nithing, Centrally located in the Gothic Quarter Close to major city sites and restaurants Allows you to get a real feel for the Catalonian culture The balcony overlooked a popular square that was thriving with life almost all day and night 
282063,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The room is right on a square with a restaurant directly below our room It was noisy all the time and you could hear the restaurant until all hours , Very helpful staff A spacious and modern room Great central location in the gothic quarter

282067,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, There was a noise at night when trying to sleep caused by the restr next door but it was corrected The staff did offer to change our room and did provided us with a free bottle of wine for our inconvenience , Perfect location and the staff was outstanding 
282068,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Wifi was unreliable Bedside tables were too small for my needs and not too much shelf space in bathroom to put anything A personal thing for me , Loved the decor and style of the hotel The room was spacious comfortable and beautifully designed and decorated All the staff were really friendly and helpful and a great asset to the hotel Loved the roof terrace and pool Hotel location is excellent walking distance to everything Would so come back here to stay again 
282069,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Small double bed the bathroom with glass door positioned right next to the bed did not offer privacy but not all rooms have the bathroom positioned like this ,No Positive
282070,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Its just in the centre just above the cafes wine open terraces Don t expect quiet night Barca was never clean and sweet city but nowadays she became a dirty and smelly a lot of rubish everywhere all corners smells all shop doors are full of graffiti It s a pity , The design is delighting Gotic walls with modern furniture looks fantastic 
282071,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We could not get the coffee maker to work Minor detail , Perfect location Staff was extremely polite and helpful nice decor Kitchen was great Great shower with rain head and hand held sprayer Grocery store a block down the street Good restaurants around the corner 
282072,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, One comment is that we stayed in the room 24 and that the next room guests had a balcony on the inside where they smoked and the smell was very strong in our room , We spend very nice time in the Hotel the person at the reception were very helpful and found a USB key that I forgot in my room I was very impressed by the level of service very professionnal associated with very friendly staff 
282073,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Shower did not have a full door and as a result the floor got puddles of water which we had to wipe up , Cool design Great staff Great location within the Gothic quarter

282075,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, No complaints at all, Great location great character exec room good size great bathroom very well soundproofed helpful and engaging staff nice view 
282076,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, This is honestly one of the best little hotels I ve ever stayed at It was right in the middle of the Gothic quarter with so many great places to eat within walking distance The staff was very helpful with suggestions of where to eat and what to do 
282077,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, I have should have booked an extra night , This hotel is stunning great location service awesome Staff went out there way to look after you The room was gorgeous with a huge cony bed 
282078,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, These are not things that would stop us from staying here again just comments for the hotel to consider mattress was a little too hard for my liking we stayed in a family room 5 of us and you want us to reuse towels to assist with saving the environment so then please put up more towel rails hooks in the bathrooms there is plenty of space so please use it wisely , location was brilliant central to Las Ramblas Metro stops and fantastic restaurants the hotel was clean tidy and quiet modern yet still historical staff were friendly and so helpful 24 hour reception so someone was always around to ask questions of 12pm checkout was excellent
282079,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We could have stayed longer a weekend just was not long enough to enjoy this beautiful city , Xabi and Juan were fantastic as was the evening attendant Carlos Xabi especially helped us each day with our plans and reservations and travel arrangements His service was invaluable to our brief stay On our last day we were able to leave our bags at the hotel while we went out for the afternoon then return to pick them up and meet our shuttle to the airport Our room was beautifully decorated perfect for 2 single people and the snacks were particularly tempting we could not resist a number of them The red wine was fantastic and worth every penny We will definitely be back Thank you 
282080,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, No bar or restaurant onsite despite this being shown as included in the facilities on the Booking Com website at the time we booked Bearing in mind the location this was not a major problem however it had been a deciding factor in our booking and therefore we were disappointed the bar was greatly missed on the very rainy evenings we were extremely unlucky to have rainy evenings though not our normal experience , Stunning building lots of space and great for eating drinking in for a change One of the best locations in our opinion in the city as easy access to the gothic quarter as well as the Marina shopping and amazing bars etc Staff were very helpful for example with booking tickets for the FC Barcelona game a must for everyone even non football fans just for the atmosphere We visit Barcelona at least once a year and this was one of the best places we have stayed for many reasons and would therefore highly recommend if you are looking for something slightly different to a normal hotel 
282081,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, As beautiful as the pictures promise very attentive and helpful staff great location and very important very good windows which keep the room nice and quiet in a very busy and noisy city center location 
282082,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Thought the pillows could have been better quality , Staff were excellent and very helpful We liked the location of the hotel and found it very convenient for most of what we wanted to do 
282083,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nothing, Everything fabulous We had family apartment very spacious modern comfortable Spa pool which we put to good use Would definitely stay here again 
282084,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We were sick , The staff was very helpful and friendly Location is absolutely perfect walking distance from everywhere Great restaurants located around the Hotel The pool on the terrace is a perfect little quiet getaway after a long city tour 
282085,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, It comes with its location but when we would like some fresh air and open the balcony doors there is always loud noises from below well into the night But it is the nature of La Rambla neighborhood so it cannot be helped Coffee was limited to 2 capsules per day No hand towels Toilet paper should be upgraded to finer quality , Location is excellent for exploring La Rambla There s something to explore around every corner Staffs are very attentive and friendly Beds are very comfortable The size of the refrigerator was very adequate 
282086,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, We loved this beautiful Hotel The friendliness the facilities cleanliness were all perfect Comfortable beds great rooftop pool gym and sauna Perfect location I would definately stay here again 
282087,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, A little pricey but we did have 3 rooms , 5 kids 3 rooms 2 nights Great room facilities with a fully stocked large mini bar Clean big bathrooms with excellent showers White company lotions and potions Great decor throughout Wish we had more time to chill in the hotel 
282088,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The automatic glass doors at the entrance are a little inconvenient They can only be opened by an electronic key or by the hotel staff at reception On the side wall it says not to knock on glass door but by the time people see the sign they usually have knocked already and the staff cannot see very well if someone is there to let them in until people actually knock So entrance can be a little tricky and delayed if you don t have your key on you , The atmosphere of the building the decor of the hotel and the room is great Sets it apart from the modern soulless rooms and the carbon copy chain hotels The bed was hard and really comfortable Very central Can walk to many places from La Rambla to the harbour and close to the metro stations Nice alley ways to explore all around the hotel Very helpful staff
282089,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Gorgeous and spacious room with kitchen conveniences Best shower in the world Great location in the Gothic area Staff went out of their way to be helpful 
282090,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, That we had to leave, The location was excellent Just a few minutes from La Rambla and a metro station The room was very spacious clean with very nice bathroom and walkin closet In addition to the above I want to say that the hotel staff was absolutely great Vera Borja Sergi and the rest which gave their recommendations to different activities and restaurants per our request They also assisted in making reservations and booking entrance tickets just so we could save time Thanks a lot guys for making this stay a wonderful vacation 
282091,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The hotel s right next to a plaza with many late night revelers so you ll probably catch some noise All to be expected in this location though Staff should mention the gym downstairs and the terrace pool upstairs on checkin , Staff generally very helpful Location excellent 
282092,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, 5 nights just wasn t long enough , Ideally centrally located in the Gothic Area yet only a 15 minute walk from The Port this Aparthotel has everything you could wish for Our room was expertly and tastefully decorated with a well equipped kitchen area The Reception staff were extremely efficient professional well mannered and couldn t do enough for us It was our pleasure to have stayed at ARAI and we shall return 
282093,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The aircon was a little loud one night but the staff fixed the problem immediately TV was all in Spanish but hey we were in Spain , The location was fantastic right in the heart of the beautiful Gothic quarter but nice and quiet however only a few minutes walk from the busy Las Ramblas The hotel was very clean which was very important to us having a young child The staff were excellent they couldn t do enough for us Andy went above and beyond 
282094,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Perhaps a small hotel bar would have been nice , The staff couldn t have been more helpful the kitchenette was very well stocked the rooms beautiful and characterful Wonderful home from home
282095,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Find nothing everything perfect , Great hotel with all comforts the super designe and the swimming pool on the roof all very clean and of couse the staff at the Reseption very Profisionell Better you can not make it hight gastronomy 
282096,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, I liked the room Very comfortable The terrace was an extra bonus with the view and jacuzzi Would have no hesitation staying again the only fault and it was a very small fault was no full length mirror on the wall to see how you looked going out of an evening , I w
282097,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Liked everything, Brilliant in every way Staff excellent no request too much trouble Best shower by far than in any other hotel I ve stayed in want one at home Decor good mix of old and new and location perfect for most sites Wouldn t hesitate to recommend and would stay again in a heartbeat
282098,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The location is surrounded by decayed old buildings which are slowly being gentrified Hard to avoid noise from cleaning trucks and revellers as noise funnels up Taxis don t come into the little streets unless booked so can be a problem Wifi drops out regularly , Interesting hotel in a very old part of town Staff were lovely and it was an easy walk to metro and main roads We bought fresh fruit and cheese at the famous market and had all the utensils in the room including a good size refrigerator 
282099,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, small ironing board is annoying for ironing shirts issues with airconditioning takes very long to cool down the room , Fantastic location interior design well maintained well stocked mini bar
282100,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Helpful friendly staff Good location to branch out and see the sites from Many restaurants and bars in this lively neighborhood Nicely appointed family room Quiet despite the din of noise outside 
282101,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, A little disappointed there was no hairdryer , Central location in Gothic area very helpful staff spoke excellent English Beautiful room decor modern bathroom windows opened wide for views across rooftops and over the square very effective double glazing kept noise from the streets to a minimum when sleeping Many places to eat and drink nearby Highly recommended 
282102,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Beds were a little hard, There s isn t much wrong with this hotel We travelled to 6 cities on this break and the next highest rating we gave was 7 8 Yes I m picky So if you want service comfort location and professional staff then I recommend here
282103,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Minimal surface area in rooms, The friendliest staff couldn t be more helpful fantastic rain waterfall shower Listed building so much character 
282104,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Location location location On top of that STUNNING hotel with sleek gothic interior a gem of a roof top terrace and pool and super helpful staff We loved every minute of our stay here 
282105,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Upon our arrival I wish I would have asked or wish they would have told us that they had a gym with a shower We only discovered this later Although our room wasn t ready as expected we arrived at 8am after a long flight it would have been WONDERFUL to take a shower in the gym before heading out to the city As it happened we both changed clothes in the small guest toilet room just off the lobby yet there is a nice sized gym and shower just one floor below Worth the money we paid around US 340 for one night and I d say here again This said you can find lots of great places in Barcelona for much less So if cost is a factor this may not be for you but there are great options all around , Gorgeous little boutique hotel just a couple blocks from all the action in La Rambla It has a high end feel and unique design Lots of attention to detail and it showed Our room had exposed stone walls very high ceilings and a big comfortable bed that helped to cure our jet leg after at 16 hour journey Great shower with fantastic water pressure A nice kitchenette with a well stocked bar and snacks and coffee machine We didn t use it because we were steps away from some of the best food the world has to offer but in a pinch it would be great Friendly staff we arrived in the early morning and our room was not ready as we expected Check in time was 3pm but they took our mobile number and called us at 1pm to let us know the room was ready early We only stayed for one night and would definitely stay again For what it s worth we are a gay couple in our 40 s we were treated very well and without discrimination 
282106,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The stay was too short , The friendly attitude and the helpfulness of the staff was simply the best you can ask for They helped with booking restraunts and visits for us with a smile and gave us extra coffee pods for the coffee maker when we ran out little things go a long way The bed and pillows were excellent and the shower was magnificent Our Fitbit showed that our resting heart rates went down considerably during the stay The room was spacious superbly clean and the cooking facilities were perfect Being at the centre of the Gothic quarter was the right decision for us We will recommend the hotel to anyone the staff will look after you 
282107,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Great staff Lovely little roof top deck and pool Great tapas place next door and cafe bar in the square at the back Within walking distance of many sights 
282108,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, The room was spacious and had a small kitchenette plus a terrace and a plunge pool which were great The staff were excellent very helpful and accommodating The location is a five minute walk from the cathedral in the Gothic quarter so this hotel is perfectly situated to explore this historic area 
282109,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The neighbourhood is clearly coming up and this is evident by the number of buildings being refurbished and cool boutiques etc However its somewhat colourful past is still evident in terms of drunks beggars lots of grafitti etc This may or may not bother you In some streets we didn t feel safe and it was easy to get lost in the Barrio Gotic , Great staff really helpful and friendly very comfortable room Great location near Placa Reil Really convenient to Port and Catedral Lots of bars and restaurants nearby
282110,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, There was a marginal sense of lack of privacy in the room as the windows did not appear to be reflective enough to keep viewers from peering into our room The room could also do well to have a few more usable surfaces to put stuff on , The room had wonderfully high ceilings There was sufficient lighting in the room The shower system was really impressive as were the toiletries consumables given Love the large screen TV and the cooking and eating utensils available 
282111,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Amazing location very cool design staff that were attentive professional and friendly Comfy bed and a well stocked kitchen plus the lovely surprise of a nice bottle of red The rooftop pool area is a great way to relax after a day s sightseeing Loved this place 
282112,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, I wouldn t want to stsy anywhere else in Barcelons , We stayed 6 nights in this beautiful apartment The sraff were very helpful with booking sights restaurant suggestions and getting around Barcelona We were so close to everything and it was great to be able to pop back fir a refreshimg dip in the roof top pool on a warm day 
282113,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, For the price the rooms should have been larger I know that Barcelona has small hotel rooms in older buildings but at this price I expected a little more , The staff location and ambiance are great 
282114,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Could have done with a few tea bags , The style of the decoration and the size of the rooms are excellent The staff are very friendly and helpful giving you ideas of what to do and where to go for transport etc Recommend restaurants 
282115,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Night times a little noisy if your room looks out over street but that is to be expected really given location , Location fabulous and service is second to none
282116,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, The room was amazing everything about it It was nice to open the window and look down on a busy plaza but when we wanted quiet we closed the window and it really blocked out the noise from the street Also we both enjoyed the helpful and very kind staff truly a joy 
282117,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, It is a little noisy We were on the first floor and the old town can be noisy on weekends , The overall design of the room was superb The staff is great and very helpful It is in a great location for a first visit to Barcelona In the old town close to museums and landmarks 
282118,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, The staff was amazing friendly and courteous They tried to help us find our luggage that was lost for 4 days The location is superb I will recommend the Arai to friends traveling to Barcelona in the future 
282119,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Everything was amazing , The staff who manned the 24hr reception who were very helpful giving information and printing out maps The location was right in the heart of gothic district close to la ramblas the metro the shops and just loads of restaurants and bars Perfect The hotel is beautiful well designed and super comfortable Rooms designed with a practical yet luxurious feel The shower was super trendy in our room and instantly hot every time The bathroom was well designed and provided a great little hairdryer and lovely toiletries The lighting in the bedroom subtle and inviting The kitchen area was well equipped and included a maxi bar if we wanted it The fridge is large and we filled it with our own breakfast from the nearby supermarket So much more to love too The hotel is in the heart of the city and some reviews have mentioned the noise outside The square at the back of the hotel was always busy with chatting and singing I found it fab and loved hearing the life outside If you want total quiet stay in the countryside Saying that the triple glazed Windows kept this at bay once closed 
282120,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nothing Suggest to add bluetooth speakers iphone docking station to the rooms to make it perfect , Beautifully decorated and attention to detail is outstanding Very friendly staff Situated in the middle of the action however very quiet 
282121,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Even though the designers were very intent on including building materials that would minimize noise from outside there s only so much that can be done Noise from the square below the apartment was still bothersome There is no insulation between the floors Noise from people walking and dropping things in the apartment above this one was loud Still this is a great apartment for the money and we will book this facility on our return to Barcelona , Location beautiful building spacious room all the amenities Staff was outstanding They were helpful very knowledgable about the area and anxious to ensure the comfort of their clients 
282122,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Booking a room that was not the room photographed in picture and being told that there is only one of that room in the hotel and that it was taken Our room was definately small and not worth almost 500 dollars per night Pool and top deck was awkward and small and was divided by plants to other top floor executive suites No privacy for them or myself The hotel rooms are small and the bed so close to the cupboard that you can hardly open the doors without hitting the bed , Location was great Right in the middle of everything Staff where wonderful after the initial shock of the room not being the same as I booked 
282123,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We was charged from the mini bar for items we did not have My debit card was used without my permission The bed squeaked on movement as it was on wheels The choice of free coffee was very poor , The Apartment was very clean and spacious The room had black out curtains with triple glazed Windows which allowed a good night sleep The kitchen was fully equipped 
282124,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Pillows were uncomfortable Bathrooms were dimly lit , Location was close to LOTS of points of interest and wealth of eating and shopping choices We were genuinely impressed by the soundproofing Staff was friendly 
282125,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, 1 The staff were incredible they assisted us with dinner reservations tour bookings and general admin 2 the room was clean and neat with an unbelievable shower Hansgrohe waterfall with massage just amazing after a long day out 3 the terrace was small but warm with afternoon sun for a short nap 4 the location was ideal walking distance to all the important places 
282126,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Not a complaint The sound of the local night life goes on well into the night at weekends , Located right in the heart of the Barri Gotic a stone s throw from much of what there is to see and do in Barcelona 
282127,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, No much of a view from our room but I guess this is just a matter of luck in many situation alike The pool isn t heated this makes it pretty much an useless facility in the winter season , Loved the room decor up cycled industrial with a luxury feel 
282128,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nothing to mention, Everything about this boutique hotel is amazing Outstanding rooms with attention to detail One of the very few hotels that i felt clean and i can actually even live there High ceiling rooms and spacious with proper wordrode There is a proper big fridge with a kitchenete Nothing is missing from the rooms they had thought everything Amazing shower with lots of options Staff matching the hotels beauty too very kind and happy naturaly Highly recomend it made my romantic long weekend unforgatable as we had to check out from another horrible hotel 
282129,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Loved it all , The staff were outstanding Every single one of them The rooms are beautiful and unique A great blend of old Spanish architecture with modern touches and amenities The location couldn t be better 
282130,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, The moment we walked into the hotel we were greeted by exceptionally kind and friendly staff They welcomed us gave us helpful advice of Barcelona and gave us a tour of the hotel and our room The room was a 5 star rating Clean fully stocked bathroom and utilities functioned well the view of the courtyard was beautiful the bed and linens were fresh and utmost standard of comfortability The hotel amenities including the rooftop deck and pool were excellent What a beautiful hotel Location was great within 5 minutes walking from the underground train I recommend this hotel to everyone 
282131,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nothing that we didn t like enough to make any real point of without sounding like typically miserable sods The Lack of a bar has been mentioned previously Pah lovely little bar 30 seconds accross the street No place to eat also raised Bah the street is littered with lovely little bakeries selling fresh local food in a morning Fantastic little authentic places to eat huddled in the surrounding streets The one next door is wonderful as is the little Tapas bar just on the street Perfect to kick back in with nice local food and a Rioja after a busty fun packed day around this amazing city , Everything Even before we arrived the staff were fantastic Quickly and efficiently returned a valuable item from our room that we had left behind Loved it The hotel is gorgeous the people helpful informative happy and obliging The feel about the hotel mirrors exactly the location Personally By far the best area of Barcelona to stay in Perfect location especially with a young child Would suggest a shuttle car cab from the airport as it can be hard to find 1st time Tucked well away from La Rambla quiet quaint and safe Also within ten minutes of the public transport points in Palca de Catalunya 10 mins to La Rambla 20 mins to the Harbour We will be back although I may avoid the bullying of a 9 yr old to try to roof top pool in February again Thank You to all Arai 
282132,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Nothing , This was our second trip to the hotel and we loved it just as much as the first The staff are amazingly kind and helpful the rooms fresh and modern and the location couldn t be bettered 
282133,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The hotel was perfect but there was occasionally noise from revelers outside at night , Very friendly staff great location beautiful room and the most amazing shower 
282134,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, The location is very convenient The hotel rooms and public areas are gorgeous The staff at the hotel especially Andy were incredibly helpful and informative The only disappointment for us was that we had only one night to stay there We plan to correct that problem in the future 
282135,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Not much we went out of season so it was fairly priced but I d love to return in the early summer but I think prices may get alittle steep , Hotel was stunning perfect location just away from the hustle bustle Rooms were comfy more than accommodating Loved the hotub on our terrace 
282136,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, That we only had 1 night to spend in the hotel , Rustic roomy and extremely well located in the gothic quarter Could not really find fault with anything The staff were very welcoming 
282137,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The room had a double size bed meaning 140cm width which I found a bit small for a hotel of this quality , The hotel is located in an old building fully renovated the rooms are well decorated with a nice mix of old and modern I particularly like the shower and the flat screen TV being for once at a good distance of the bed Location is great and staff helpful 
282138,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, A More comfortable place for guests to congregate ie fancier reception lobby would be nice and unfortunately the neighborhood businesses are not that upscale there is a grocery store nearby, Terrific location helpful staff
282139,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Nice design convenient location space for family great shower and wifi The Peruvian restaurant next door is very good Staff very friendly and helpful We had no problem with noise

282145,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, Loved everything about this place location staff and the room It is every bit as good as the pictures online Great area with lots of local restaurant options 
282146,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, Check in was a nightmare It took forever and they couldn t give me a specific time that the room would be ready I arrived very early in the morning around 8am and didn t expect the room to be ready Initially they told me it should be ready around 11am So I left my bag and went out and came back then but I kept on getting a similar response of come back later without them being able to tell me when This kept on until 5pm The official check out is 11am When I asked the supervisor why its taking so long to clean the room and I was given some line about this is policy understaffed this is not a hotel In the end the room wasn t that clean either and needed a good vacuuming ,No Positive
282147,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We discovered when we walked around town that we were visiting Barcelona during a week long festival with free musical performances and parades and other events every day I didn t realize it when we booked I was quite surprised that the staff never mentioned this when we checked in or subsequently to let us know of the events we might want to attend , Loved the location and our Executive room with two windows one overlooking the plaza behind the hotel Gorgeous renovation of an old building with real character The staff was polite very professional and helpful in recommending restaurants 
282148,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior,No Negative, This hotel was the best The cleanliness was perfect The room was so unique in appearance The staff were most helpful We loved everything about the Arai Barcelona
282149,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, A little too small for 4 adults even if two were our daughters in their 20 s Mattresses should be better Too hard for us all, great area beautifully decorated apt
282150,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, If you want to sleep before 2 30 at the weekend you may be challenged There is a lot of noise from outside but then again this is central Barcelona , Great location and lovely building The staff were very friendly and helped us with lots of touristy things 
282151,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, We slept on the side where there was a square So at night it was not really quiet as people were sitting on terraces people making music That was the only negative thing , Room was beautifull and the area was also very nice with lots of nice little shos and restaurants
282152,Aparthotel Arai 4 Superior, The wifi was extremely frustrating as it fell out constantly and would disappear all together at times Common problem we found in hotels in Europe but really not acceptable , We were very impressed by this hotel Wonderful staff easy location and great rooms
