431136,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The family room is very smal It s not a family room but a standard room with double bad and 2 floors bad The lader was very high and it was dangerous to climb and go down We were asking to do check out 1 hour later but the manager ask 15 got this hour It wa rude I don t recommend about this hotel , The location The stuf were friendly and helpful 
431137,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, In general it was not a good experience can not get parking for the car easily The closest parking was 4 minutes walk Smelly in the toilet The room was on the underground floor and inconvenient by passersby and cars,No Positive
431138,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, bathroom could have been cleaner we requested a room with a balcony but this was not honoured we were given a room at the top very warm at night and lucky there was a good aircon system in the room because you cant open the windows if i was booking again i would definitely want a room with a balcony , The Beds were amazing staff very friendly and helpful good location if you want to be away from the red light district quite at night no noise from trams etc quick walk to rembrandtplein right next to vondelpark easy enough access by public transport from airport it was myself and my partners birthdays around the time we travelled and they had balloons and a welcome note in the room upon arrival nice touch 
431139,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, It used to be an amazing hotel but it needs a refurb now It all looks pretty old and tired Rooms in the basement smell damp Rooms upstairs are very hot Pillows are low quality Carpets need replacing There s no body lotion in the room just body wash Receptionist was moody the guy at night was great though All in all not as it used to be , Good location
431140,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, When we arrived the toilet had a scrubber still in it and other odd indicators that maybe someone never completed their cleaning task , The bathroom was immense with a huge whirlpool and a separate dual shower stall The room was in the basement with windows showing literally foot traffic on a quiet street This was actually endearing The room and bed were also very large The staff were friendly 
431141,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Shouldn t complain because we had 2 showers and 1 bath but one of showers did not work Staff were very loud in the mornings moving things around outside our room and talking very loudly , Spacious rooms with a Nespresso machine Great location 
431142,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The furnishings are looking slightly tired but don t let that put you off staying here The executive rooms we had were larger than I expected , We stayed in Hotel Roemer for 5 nights recently The staff were great and sorted out any problems and requests that we had from moving us from room 16 after one night which was just above street level and neither I or my husband were happy with that to giving me some ice for my sore and tender heel The beds were very comfortable Plenty of hanging space and shelves Complimentary coffee tea was available Our second room no 21 faced the court yard gardens with a balcony which suited us much better This room had an iPod dock and our first room didn t unless I missed it We didn t have breakfast at the hotel as we went 5 mins away to a cafe called Bagels and Beans which was lovely There are a couple of small supermarkets near by and other shops north of the hotel on the street called Overtoom We went to a typical dutch restaurant nearby called Hap Hmm on a couple of nights which is nearby No reservations taken and only cash but we did see someone pay with a card and only open between 5 9 15pm Last food orders at 8 30pm Also can recommend Gollem s Proeflokaal just over 5 minutes walk away on Overtoom for a great selection of draught and bottle beers and food is available as well we had the hamburgers We got the bus 197 from the airport and bought return e tickets online We got off at Leidesplein and walked behind the Marriot hotel to Hotel Roemer which only took a few minutes 
431143,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Room keeping could be better ie coffee tea was not replenished bed wasn t changed in 3 nights The bathroom had a strange unpleasant smell like moss or humidity but it was clean The room in the basement right under the reception was loud lucky I sleep deep , The bed was confortable which was the main priority for me The bathroom was big and nice The room was of a good size and nicely decorated The staff was helpful attentive and just lovely Restaurant and sitting area with good d cor and ambiance Honesty bar to help yourself at anytime was great Great location 5 mins to Hard Rock Cafe around 10 mins to City Centre and main shops
431144,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, When the second room was ready the other two in our party checked in even though it wasn t the right room The executive room with whirlpool and sitting area turned out to be a family room with some bunk beds in the corner Very disappointing , Super nice woman at check in nice guy at check ou Only one room was ready so we took that one and off we went to explore Loved the location 
431145,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We asked for a cot for our baby but the cot we received had a hole in the side We found the cot pushed up against the side of an arm chair in order to cover the hole The mattress was not firm enough for a baby and very uneven The baby s head sunk into the mattress leaving her legs higher then her head being the heaviest part of her body The sheets were coming undone Sheets and mattress need to be firm for a baby or this can be potentially very dangerous Besides that the hotel was nice ,No Positive
431146,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, not applicable, This hotel has me coming back to it all over Great and friendly staff and the facilities so clean and space efficient The breakfast buffet included was awesome So happy we choose this hotel My friends all share the same comments We will stay here on our next visit

431148,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, My only disappointment with this hotel is that the internet speeds were terrible On several occasions when trying to view maps or websites to check where we were venturing out that day the internet was non existent A minor issue which I m sure could be easily addressed in what otherwise is an excellent hotel , The location of this hotel is perfect The Leidseplein Square is no more than a 5 minute walk away with a choice of Bars Restaurants and public transport that takes you further in to the heart of Amsterdam Museum square and Vondel park are 5 10 minutes walk and several canal tours are on your doorstep The street is upmarket and quiet and the hotel is clean modern and rooms are extremely spacious If you re visiting Amsterdam as a tourist you couldn t ask for more

431150,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, 1 Very weak WiFi signal almost no internet was accessible However thanks to the neighbouring hotel which has very good WiFi coverage with free access it really saved us 2 Bathroom was not very well ventilated so when jet bathtub was activated it was very hot in the room There is a small window in the niche of the bathtub but opening of the window is restricted 3 A bit far off the city center about 20 min of walking 4 too expensive, 1 Very good bed 2 Excellent bathroom spacious two types of shower jet bathtub very nice for relax 3 Clean room 4 Descent breakfast 5 very polite staff

431155,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We booked 3 nights in an executive room with a spa bath The room was large but below ground level so unable to look out of windows The spa bath didn t work For the 3rd night we were moved to another room with a bath that worked This room was described to us as a junior suite but the room was small and crowded and the bathroom tiny , Location good Beds comfortable 
431156,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The air in broke in my room and blasted 40C degree heat into the room during the night I woke up parched and feeling ill No windows in the room so i had to sleep with the door open didn t feel safe The guy that came to look at the dodgy air conditioning that night couldnt believe the heat coming out of it He said that he would arrange arrange a new room for the next morning But it couldn t be done until 12 We waited in the hotel until 12 only to find that the Staffa hasn t been notified and there was no room Which wasted a while morning in Amsterdam for us We did eventually get a room but there was no WiFi then In order to use the WiFi i had to go out into the middle of the street to use the WiFi for the other building Eventually sitting on a cold doorstep in the middle of the night to check into my flight I was exhausted in the end because of the terrible nights sleep i got the night before I asked for a discount even for the night where i hardly got a wink of sleep But the hotel refused All i got was two bottles of water to make up for how dehydrated i got on the night the air conditioning broke , Great location

431161,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I did not realize I would get a room in the sous terrain which does not matter But all day and all night long nearly there was noise from overhead Holderdebolder we hebben een koe op zolder Are you elderly enough to know that song Also all the controls were high made for very tall people Instructions for the bath would have helped ,No Positive
431162,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I thought the hotel was perhaps a touch on the expensive side for the facilities it offered , The hotel staff were extremely friendly The location was good in a nice quiet street but near enough to all the amenities and Vondelpark The bed was absolutely massive and comfortable The staff even sent on property we had left behind for which we are very grateful 
431163,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Bed was super comfy you ll definitely sleep like a baby and also the location is great you are litterally in the heart of Amsterdam s nightlife and you do not have to worry about the noise Pass my regards to you staff they were all friendly 
431164,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Nt much wardrobe space, Ecellent location and friendly staff who all spoke English Bedrooms were airy and robes were provided Well stocked honesty bar 
431165,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Cleanliness The place didn t seem clean at all A bit run down too , Whirlpool bath Staff were excellent They were nice professional and seem to take good care of guests Bonus points for good humor and great English skills Location was good for me but I went for a nearby conference 
431166,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Me and my girlfriend had a brilliant time and wouldnt change anything , The beds were very brilliant The bath was excellent and the coffee and tea options were excellent 
431167,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The room I was sleeping was below reception so you could hear footsteps especially when there is a big crowd coming in and out at night Otherwise there is no problem , The hotel location was great staff were friendly and always happy to help Room and bathroom was clean 
431168,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, While the whirlpool bathtub is awesome the shower head is in a bit of an awkward position which led to some contorting to not spill water all over the floor All in all not a big deal , Couldn t have been more happy with this hotel Staff was lovely location is excellent bed was super comfy Some rooms come with a spectacular courtyard facing balcony which is was not listed as an amenity on their booking com listing Honor bar and free printer in the lobby is a really nice touch 
431169,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, No gym and lighting within the room was a little bit dim , Great choice of food for breakfast clean rooms and staff were very polite friendly and accommodating Excellent location very close to museum transport restaurants and attractions 
431170,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Jacuzzi not working in executive room noisy in the morning plus all the smell from croissants in the room deposit required even for 1 night , good location not far away from the center
431171,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Smell from the kitchen in the room a big disadvantage The items included in the description of the room like slippers or iron needed to be requested , Location staff
431172,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The floor looked dirty there were hard water stains in the bathroom and the hotel appeared slightly run down, The staff was incredibly friendly and the location was perfect It was a very charming and quaint property 
431173,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Nothing to dislike about this property Suited our needs perfectly , Super location Close to everything but lovely quiet location Superb staff Comfy bed Fab shower 
431174,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, A little hard getting luggage up the steep stairs to the lift in the annex opposite the main hotel Nothing major but might be tough for someone with an infirmity , Great location and wonderfully helpful staff There was a massive power cut affecting the whole of Greater Amsterdam and the staff were there at the very early that I checked out in the morning to provide help advice book taxis and so on 
431175,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The cleaniness was not on point the floors and as we were on the ground floor next to the kitchen it smelled food which is quite expensive for Amsterdam , The room was big with a couch and a nespresso machine The bathroom was very nice as well Overall we were very satisfied with the room and amenities The staff was really welcoming and helpful They prepared a special dish for our young child The location is just perfect and quiet 
431176,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The room was quite dirty The fridge looked like it has never been cleaned before The bathtub had hair in it from the previous guests The walls were very dirty The hotel shampoo was in a big container with almost nothing in it We were surprised how dirty the room felt for being a 4 star hotel , Bed was comfy 
431177,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Payed for an executive room when we first arrived we got put into a tiny room on the 1st level looked nothing like the pictures and the bath was horrificly dirty they soon moved us without a problem , Once we got moved we loved our room staff were lovely Bath was amazing 
431178,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Size of the bathroom was creating small swimming pools each moring and low water pressure in the shower, Huge bed cosy room and nice breakfast buffet Personnel more friendly than in bigger chains 
431179,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We were in the new wing which is a new building across the street so even for breakfast we had to get jackets etc as it was cold and raining December , The position close to museums but also city center and a very nice hotel 
431180,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, 1 I didn t like the fact that they took a 150 deposit one week in advance witch was not stipulated in the booking com presentation 2 I didn t like the fact that the rooms from the photos are not acurate , Nothing
431181,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, It was outrageously expensive but we are most used to business hotels so maybe that s normal for boutique hotels If you can get it at 120 it would be a bargain Our room was next to the kitchen and breakfast area so there was some noise and heat from that The breakfast was not worth it go to the pancake restaurants a five minutes walk nearby to the east instead , The room was heated and we could control the temperature ourselves We visited during a cold spell so this was vital The bathroom was great with a nice tub It was spacey in front of the bed and there was good head space Our room came with a veranda that I can imagine is very cozy in summer when it doesn t rain The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood 
431182,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Many appliances in the room were not working this was extremely dissapointing The hotel took no responsibility when I let them know things in the room were broken I wouldn t stay in the same hotel ever again , Staff were friendly
431183,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Staff not particularly helpful Beds not set upas was booked with no mattress protectors on them and not very comfortable Breakfast not that great but fortunately we found a few good places to eat thanks to Ms Google , Great position Good for walking to the things we were interested in
431184,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, This is not a complaint take it as a room for improvement I booked rooms with spa bath but unfortunately hotel did not provide you with any bath supplies bath bomb bubble bath gel etc so its a shame I can t really enjoy the jet bath I had to go to lush to buy for bath Bomb , The check in was smooth with the help of friendly staff welcoming us I traveled with a group of 6 and we get great rooms with the comfiest bed ever You may borrow umbrella as Amsterdam known for beautiful city but worst weather so thats convenient for guest The hotel is right in the middle between museumplein and leidseplein in walking distance
431185,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, they were renovating the facade of the hotel with scaffolds all over with out notifying about it on the website, had a fantastic room not a standard hotel room
431186,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Not a lot not to like However the sink in the room couldn t be used for much looks good but not very practical Some people may find the steps an issue very narrow and steep but they need to remember they re booking into a traditional property , Good quality accommodation and staff on arrival and the first night when our boy s wanted choc brownies etc didn t eat at hotel were faultless We had a family room in the annex with bunk beds and our boy s liked that they had their own flat screen TV Nice area just away from the hustle and bustle Free Wifi so boy s happy again Honesty bar was a first but worked perfectly but if it is open until 12 don t tidy up at 11 30pm 
431187,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Our basement Junior Suite was directly below the restaurant and the noise of tables and chairs being moved in preparation for breakfast started before 7am so if you are a light sleeper this could be very annoying You can also hear every footstep of people moving around above the room For a suite the d cor furnishings and fittings were less than luxurious and the general feel was of a slightly dingy basement room The room was also missing the dining table and chairs and one of the armchairs shown in the website photos , All the staff were friendly and extremely helpful in giving advice about places to visit transport restaurants etc The hotel is in a quiet location only a few minutes walk from the Van Gogh and Rijks museums Leidseplein restaurants bars and tram stops and the Airport Express 197 bus stop Breakfast was good and the servers were all friendly and helpful The bed was very comfortable and the room was spacious but didn t live up to the Junior Suite label or the website photos see further comments In spite of the negative comments on the room we would stay here again based on the great staff and the excellent location 
431188,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Lovely pretty quiet street and v contemporary hotel Very friendly staff who were more than happy to accommodate our bikes The newly built rooms across the road are stunning Ubers are cheap so no bother to get around 
431189,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The cleaning of the room took place between 9am and 5pm we came back to our room after a long day exploring and at 3pm the room still hadn t been cleaned bit of a pain when we wanted to have a little rest before going back out in the evening The receptionist explained that they had until 5pm to clean the room and if we didn t want to be interrupted by the cleaner then we should put the do not disturb sign on the door and the room would not be cleaned that day Also no instructions on how to use the coffee machine I didn t ask the receptionist I m sure if I did they would have told me You must state the time of arrival when booking the hotel we got to the hotel around 1 30 our stated arrival time and our room wasnt ready this was fine as we knew we couldn t check in until 3 we came back to the hotel around 3pm and we still had to wait for our room they told us our room was ready the receptionist said they d given us an upgrade to one of our ground floor rooms when I asked if this was a basement room the receptionist said it was but it had a bath and it was a lovely room etc I said I didn t want that room as I read some reviews on trip advisor that the room wasn t great I explained I specifically booked a room in the annex because the rooms were supposed to be nicer they moved us to be fair to the receptionist this was done without hesitation so we finally got into our room about 4 o clock it was a long first day I will definitely return to Amsterdam but sadly I d try a different hotel , Gorgeous comfy bed lovely big bath towels and a shower head the size of a waterfall The staff were all smiles and very friendly Amsterdam was amazing 
431190,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The decor of the room was bland but the AMAZING backyard made up for that 100 Lucky us for getting the family room at the building across the street , The warmth and genuine kindness of the staff was like nothing I or my husband have ever experienced They go out of their way to help you in anything amazing 7 service Just 2 minutes walk on the same street no less to beautiful Vondelpark for a great picnic 10mins from Thai or Indian or Indonesian or Italian cuisine Seriously spoilt for choice Close to Stedelijk Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum just have good walking shoes on 
431191,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, They have decided to have what they called an honesty bar BUT in reality the staff hung over your shoulder watching you pour your drink making you feel extremely uncomfortable They may as well just serve you and save the embarassment Four euro fifty for a bottle of water in your room is excessive A complimentary bottle would be a nice touch , We were given an upgrade to a jacuzzi room which was lovely The location was great and it felt safe walking to and from at night The staff were polite and helpful overall and the coffee maker in the room was a nice touch Rooms were clean tidy and serviced daily and the large double bed was really comfortable We were lucky to have a balcony overlooking the gardens at the back which was lovely in the mornings We were in room 22 which was right next to the lift on the 1st floor Initially I was concerned about noise but this was not an issue Overall a great little hotel 
431192,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The room was very small but beautifully furnished, Bed was so comfy The staff were wonderful Amazing location couldn t have been better Lovely modern clean bathroom Stunning hotel exterior
431193,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Specifically chose this hotel and room as I was desperate for a bath after months of crappy hostel bathrooms and was incredibly disappointed when I tried to have a bath at 10pm to be told the plug in that room was broken and bath couldn t be used Received a refund for the difference from a non bath room but still annoying as I spent more money on this hotel compared to other hotels without bath options for that reason Staff were good to deal with but I still didn t get the bath I was really looking forward to Internet was also bad on the third floor , Booked this hotel after three months of group travelling in hostels and was seriously looking forward to solo comfort Massive bed super comfy big room with floor space for me to re pack really good location just a short walk to main shopping areas and trams 
431194,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The room was tiny Like 2 3 star hotels might have Most of the space was taken by the bed The bathroom room didn t stay open and did not close either as well as it was all bloated from the water More the ventilation system did not take all steam from the room so it was annoying The wardrobe was only enough for one person for 2 3 days not a week definitely I went downstairs and asked for a better hairdryer and did not receive any response later from the reception as I didn t ask for anything We also requested a late checkout and it was approved online and upon the check in However at 11 56 we got knock knock from the room service and was told to check out because it was 12 00 Reception apologised for that but it was quite annoying as we were still in bed after a late B Day night out Overall I saw more thoughtful and attentive staff for less money paid so it was disappointing , The location is great The bathroom had a jacuzzi type bath which was really nice Free coffee machines on the first level and in the room Overall it wasn t a bad experience 
431195,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, It has been giving me a room less than that have been booked and there was stalling them to convince me snapped another room outside the building in the building opposite the hotel and refused to show me the piece was another two and they said does not she How the piece and I have already paid for the Business room weth Jacuzzi to time constraints I have accepted them but were not chosen by the site, Not bad
431196,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Great location if you are visiting the museums and vondel park Easy access to Amsterdam tram lines Located in a quiet neighborhood Would stay here again 
431197,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Room 12 could be a little noisy due to being next to facilities service room Nothing to serious though, Staff were lovely and helpful rooms very comfortable and probably one of nicest hotel bathrooms I ve seen Good value you d probably pay double for similar in centre of London 
431198,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, The bed was incredibly soft as well as the shower Staff was super friendly and welcoming and the hotel is basically across Leidseplein and within walking distance of many restaurants and the nightlife scene in Amsterdam as well as close to the museum area and to the Heineken Experience 
431199,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The direction to the bus stop provided turned out wrong so I waited for the bus to the airport at the wrong side of the road Buses to the Schipol Airport stop not in front of Marriott Hotel but of Hotel NH Amsterdam Centre Some of the boxed amenities were empty and oddly got two big TVs in one room , Breakfast Convenient for museum and shopping goers yet quiet location

431201,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Information from hotel staff in regards to the use of public transportation could have been better We purchased a 24 hrs GVB railroad car ticket at the hotel however learned that we could not use it for the buses as diffirent company Information that would had been nice to know for first visitors to Amsterdam , Very comfortable beds nice and spacious room with god bathroom facilities Quiet and good indoor climate Breakfast was fantastic with appropriate selections and of high quality Location was very good and central Close to public transport in case needed Staff friendly and helpfull

431203,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Check out staff very slow time wasted on our last day, Good location and very comfortable accommodation Particularly comfy bed and pillows Close enough to centre but far enough away that it was quieter 
431204,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The room needed a makeover Badly worn carpet Decor and materials in bath as well as bedroom very stark industrial in feel , We were asked to check in at a sister hotel the Hotel Vondel around the corner because our room had flooded due to rain and wasn t ready The staff were lovely breakfast delicious location near museums and Vondel Park excellent 
431205,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The weather could have been better but this must not reflect on the lovely hotel , The hotel was in a good location and we enjoyed walking around central Amsterdam 
431206,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The receptionist tried to give us a smaller and noisier room than the one I had reserved then asked me to return later and she would give us a room on an upper floor but when I returned 4 hours later she offered a room on the ground floor The hotel is rated with 4 stars but the room is cleaned only in the morning the towels were not changed the carpet was quite dirty , The bed was comfortable and the location was nice The maid was very helpful with various requests 
431207,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Tourist brochures and information could have been more readily available visible , They moved us to a very good room after we complained twice about intrusive music coming from a neighbouring property attached to the building but not connected with the hotel

431218,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The main feature light was not working although to be fair it may just have been the bulb and we didn t report it We struggled with the coffee machine for the first couple of nights until we got used to it but that may just say more about us than the hotel , All of the staff we very personable and friendly Nothing was too much trouble The hotel is in a great location for the museums Vondelpark and there are some great bars and cafe bars across the road in Leidseplein Square

431222,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, It will be better if a shower will be completely closed , Location is very good museums park shop around 20 minutes to the center by feet The breakfast was very good Very helpful and friendly stuff My room was with balcony and garden view 
431223,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Incredibly noisy room in the basement No natural light Smelly bathroom and shower left unclean Kettle not working and just generally the room felt very tired Told the issue to reception who said thanks for letting us know No apologies and nothing to try to make up for it For the price I would go somewhere else , Location
431224,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Needs a mirror above desk as several of us to do make up and only bathroom mirror Mirror should be above vanity unit , Good Location good reception staff and more than Accomadating to book taxi s and restaurant and top up of teas and coffee for room
431225,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We went down for breakfasts for three consecutive mornings Thursday Fri and Saturday Each morning at approximately 10 00hrs so an hour before the breakfast service stopped yet each morning the hot food had not been replenished I saw only one sausage over the three days and on day three there was no eggs left The Staff from in the kitchen had come out but either chose not to replenish or forgot At 600 for the stay I would have expected better attention given to the breakfast , Room was spacious and spa bath was lovely Bed comfortable and room was quiet 
431226,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The wifi connection was rather slow The room was a little cold for our taste we tried setting the temperature higher but the temperature of the room didn t get better , The hotel staff is extra nice and willing to help We had a huge bed very comfortable The room was very clean and they kept it clean through our stay 
431227,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We couldn t figure out how to use the heating system In hindsight we should have just asked the staff to help us but having a warm room when we got back after a long evening out would have been nice , The staff were incredibly helpful and really went out of their way to make our stay special The hotel is on a quiet side road but still within easy reach of all the attractions 
431228,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Really cold bathroom You need to bring warm footwear and be prepared for a cold experience when showering despite showering in hot water , Good service by staff and the hotel itself is very nice and charming Close to Leidseplein but quick and easy to use the Tram to get closer to the city center 
431229,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Huge room with really comfy bed perhaps could have done with maybe a small table and a second easy chair , Excellent location near all the museums and restaurants but in a quieter more residential location away from all the lively parts Would definitely return 
431230,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Would have preferred a proper shower enclosure in the small bathroom rather than the trendy wet room design with its flooded floor and water sprayed WC lid etc but nothing you can t live with for a couple of nights , Stayed in the Annex across the road from the main hotel on the first floor up silent lift Location very quiet and peaceful Room and bed very comfortable 
431231,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The walls and floors were a little thin so you could hear other guests easily The whirl pool bath wasn t clean you could see glitter and bits of skin when you got it going , Staff were lovely Even sent back some earrings I d left in the room The room was very nice and the location was good Upgraded for free Good value for money The bed was super comfy 
431232,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Pr authorising my debit card days before our stay made one of my direct debits fail and I have two charges now I paid cash at the hotel I have been home a few days now and the money is still not back in my account Parking was 36 euros for a day and very steep steps up to building , The rooms were very nicely furnished and staff friendly lovely breakfast and as it was my husbands birthday we all were given a complimentary glass of bubbly with it 
431233,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Not much public area , It s a luxouriously furnished room than it is a hotel room but non the less it s just as comfortable very quiet convenient and great value
431234,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent location staff very friendly and made to feel right at home when we arrived and throughout our stay would recommend to anyone staying for a weekend in this great city 
431235,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Can t think of anything we didn t like, We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel The staff were incredibly helpful and helped to make our break memorable 
431236,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Was continuously a bit cold in the room even with heating turned up to full It was a cold weekend though Also no table and chair s in the room for the family to play games or eat food , Location especially for the museums which are walkable in 10 minutes and beds pillows excellent Staff very helpful and friendly 
431237,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Nice place and room Shower and toilet outside of the room to be taken in coconsideration, Very good place a few minutes ftom the center Breakfest is basic and the hungries can seat in a caffe in the center for complementary branch
431238,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The location was in a good spot 2 mins from leidsplein where I like to stay Only thing was due to the built up area the wasn t really a view that I can judge there was just looking into other people s Windows but I m happy it had a balcony regardless If you like views this wouldn t be a ideal hotel I didn t order food so I can t judge The mini fridge was full of options though , There was a Very nice guy as night staff he ordered me a pizza at 4am and was very helpful All staff went beyond to make our stay comfortable Wished me a happy birthday on the day Truely the best staff I ve come across all my nine trips to Amsterdam Would definitely go back again 
431239,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I did not like the way hotel Roemer took it upon them selves to over charge me by 300 euro and then think that it is ok for the money to be returned over a week later They have stolen money from me without my convent They have also taken money from my account for things from the mini bar that we did not take We were completely honest with everything and paid the 32 euro for the mini bar when we left This is a shame as we visit Amsterdam often and thought we had finally found a hotel that we were happy with However after this I will not be booking with hotel Roemer or booking com again and I will be warning potential customers of this on trip advisor and twitter, We loved the hotel The location was good room was good clean and the staff were nice and helpful
431240,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Nothing the hotel could do about it but we had extremely noisy neighbours in the adjacent room for 2 nights This was in the main hotel building and sound travels through the walls Also have to mention that although the room was clean many details had been missed by the cleaning staff We had a balcony where the previous occupants had left their empty lunch boxes on the table cleared on the following day The mini bar had not been restocked and there was a partly eaten chocolate bar in it This was sorted as soon as i reported it On our third day we had no towels when we returned in the evening Again sorted immediately , Well situated for museum visits Just a short walk away from the tram stop at Leidseplein The staff were all very friendly and helpful Breakfast was good Despite the didn t likes mentioned here we enjoyed our stay and would like to thank the staff for the warm welcome and their efforts when rectifying the omissions of the cleaning staff 
431241,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, There is no slipper in the room but you can request from lobby and they bring asap Shower jel and shampoo can be renewed each day Wi fi connection is poor, Hotel located close to Leidseplein takes 2 minutes to walk Also 5 minutes to walk Museumplein and Vondelpark It is a little bit far away from Dam Square but you can take a tram on Leidseplein or you can walk about 15 20 minutes Bed was really huge and comfortable Bathroom includes whirlpool and TV There is a catlle and also cofee machine in the room Staff were friendly and helpfull WHO speaks fluent English 
431242,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Our room was spacious but it was in the basement so there was a damp smell which was putting off However I am sure other rooms in the property do not have the same issue so ask for one that isn t in the basement , Location is brilliant Our room was nice and very spacious for 2 persons 
431243,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Double bed was actually two seperate beds Parking in the neighbourhood is crazily expensive okay not the hotel s fault for example nearby parking Byzanthium was 96 euro from 15 00h till 18 00h next day , Staff is very friendly and helpfull Located not to far from city centre Room was spacious and clean Nice bathroom with jacuzzi and shower 
431244,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Twin beds even if I asked for a king size bed They were very comfy though , The staff is incredibly smiling nice and helpful The hostel even offered us a welcome drink as it was my boyfriend s birthday which was a really nice surprise The room was really neat clean and well equiped We had a problem with the AC but the staff brought us an extra heater Great location quiet area awesome hostel Thank you 
431245,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Despite a great Italian shower the bathroom end up completely wer after one shower The room is clean but some exta attention to detail would be appreciated one hole in the linen some marks on the wall , Location is great Bed really comfortable
431246,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Just being in lower ground floor junior suite could hear staff overhead setting up the breakfast area in mornings wooden floors small thing but the room made up for it really, Location beside Vondelpark room size huge bathroom huge doors onto the garden the bed bathrobes the coffee all great for a lazy break in Amsterdam
431247,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I booked with breakfast I had to argue I had booked also had to ask for the booking com genius welcome tipple , Convenience trams museums restaurants 
431248,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We left our towels and towelling robes to be reused and they were not even hung up so we re still damp the following day Decor was very tired and paintwork scratched, The staff were very helpful 
431249,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Even for winter we found the bathroom was too overheated and nothing could be done about it so we opened the window to cool the room down which did the trick , Perfectly located between the museum quarter nine streets and the old town means everything is walking distance The room was luxuriously appointed with dining table and lounge chairs and feeling a little travel weary we even stayed and ordered room service one night The meal was as good as any of the other delightful cafes and bars Amsterdam has to offer And the staff were very helpful and charming All round the Hotel Roemer was a quiet relaxing and thoroughly pleasant place to stay in Amsterdam Would happily return there again on our next trip 
431250,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Difficult to find and narrow steps to go in to register only to have to go back out and across the road up some more narrow steps to get to the room, Room was clean and comfortable albeit compact 
431251,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Pleasant welcome and was upgraded to large room Hotel well situated for museums and in a nice neighbourhood easy to reach from the Central Station by tram 
431252,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Spa bath and mini bar were great huge beds and great location close to everything yet in a nicer part of Amsterdam Close to designer shops and in the opposite direction coffee shops restaurants and bars Definitely try out the seafood and meat club restaurant nearby 
431253,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Shower could maybe do with a curtain as the bathroom was pretty wet after showers, Breakfast was excellent great choice set us up for the day Nespresso machine in room a lovely touch Very close to museums Will definitely stay again 
431254,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The reception area looks like it was placed in the middle of the entrance corridor for lack of space somewhere else it looks finished and clean just an odd location, Modern hotel no frills but straight forward clean design and facilities
431255,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I was planning to go to the Roemer Hotel but I ve been in the De Hallen because of a technical problem in my room , The location of the hotel is awesome In a quiet and nice place just behind the beginning of the town center quartier The staff is also very nice and the hotel have this kinda modern design which I enjoyed a lot 
431256,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, I didn t like being in the basement where there were smells but not within the room thankfully It was too dark no view etc , I like being upgraded to a junior suite Bathroom facilities were great and bed very comfortable 
431257,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Noise of other guestroom doors opening access to main building in the evening confusing No ordinary tea available for breakfast and waiter very abrupt , Helpful reception staff Nice fittings in room 
431258,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Everything, Paid for executive room with whirlpool bath didn t work and couldn t be fixed no effort made by staff to do anything about it or compensate me Also thought I d walked into a building site hotel was in the process of being renovated wouldn t of booked if I d known room was situated next to storeroom so was constantly being woken up through the night Room was in basement so no view Windows wouldn t even open very disappointed wouldn t recommend it at all 
431259,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Absolutely nothing, I liked everything however the staff were outstanding and deserve a special mention They could not have made me feel more at home particularly the two girls at reception and the young lady who worked in the bar area I only wish I knew their names but I am sure their manager must be aware of how wonderful they are The room was by far the best I have stayed in in Amsterdam and I have visited many times The beds were huge and extremely comfortable and I am already planning a return visit Could not rate the place highly enough Thanks to all there 
431260,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We were accused of taking 6 drinks from the mini bar despite us only taking 2 This took place in full view of the hotel reception area They subsequently apologised for their mistake but it was very badly handled and I was not impressed Despite spending over 700 euros with them I would not have expected such an incorrect accusation to be our final conversation A shame as this impacted the overall stay , The room was very nice Good shower and lovely bath Bed was very comfortable The location is very good for the museums Room was clean and the hotel itself had lovely visual art 
431261,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We had a room right next to the kitchen and smoking porch outside so there was a lot of noise every morning when breakfast started 6am and in the evenings when people went outside to smoke chat , Location was great Very helpful and friendly staff 
431262,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, This was a second stay as had a great time earlier in the year However I was woken up at 8am by workmen and the spa bath didnt work which is one of the reasons for booking the room given it was a short stay this was disappointing , Location great and short walk from 197 bus stop that takes you to the airport The garden at the back was restful and the room had comfy large beds 
431263,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, nothing, Great staff especially Fiona The location was amazing 5 min walk to leidseplein Would come back next time to this hotel for sure p s you get free Nespresso coffee in your room 
431264,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, Fiona at reception gave us a map with locations that made for an amazing trip The room was excellent Location is excellent It is in the middle if you want tourist stuff but also if you want the local peoples feel of the city Go to da hallen Amazing food market I will definitely stay here again next time 
431265,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, There was no do not disturb sign for the door so we were disturbed several times by housekeeping , The lovely receptionist upgraded us to a suite where the bed was most comfortable 
431266,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, The shower was a bit of a challenge Huge shower head small space More lights above the bathroom mirror would be helpful The bedroom was smaller than expected , Location was great Very pleasant staff Small hotel relaxed atmosphere 
431267,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Air con noise from another room meant two nights of no sleep offered to resolve then seemingly forgot, Easy to get to close to transport network and local museums
431268,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam,No Negative, The room was big well decorated new and cozy The bathroom was wonderful the bed was huge and comfy and the staff was helpful The breakfast is quite expensive as any hotel in Amsterdam but was great and high quality The location was fantastic close enough to walk anywhere but in a quiet lovely street I don t have anything bad to say regarding this lovely hotel 
431269,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Wi fi didnt always work as you expect from a hotel like that , The attention was perfect specially Fiona s she helped us more then she had to really nice people The location is great too near a beautiful park and just a few minutes by walk to the center Best option is to rent bike for the days your staying theres a place to rent bikes just a block from the hotel So recomendable
431270,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Shower water runs into bathroom area Room layout was awkward No place to put suitcases and second TV was in unviewable position and kept turning on with other remote, The lady that checked us in and out was outstanding 
431271,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, 3 reasons of dissatisfaction suite is at 1 level no light lots of noise the worst wifi I have ever seen the bed was not good, Good situation near most important museums
431272,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Wishful thinking on our part that we might have been able to check in a bit early since we d had an overnight flight and arrived early in the a m but the room wasn t ready until the published check in time , Very much enjoyed the privacy of the street and of the annex 
431273,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Value for money is appoling to me this aint a boutique hotel its a rip off for the price u pay u expect a clean worn free room The staff need better customer service dont look down their nose at certain types of people were all human I work in this industry and was highly dissapointed , The hotel is in a great quiet location just off the busy Leidseplein 
431274,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Nothing, The staff was great really helpful and we were also upgraded to the junior suite The room was really nice the nespresso machine the bed and the bathroom and the position is handy basically Leidsplein 
431275,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, Our room although lovely was situated in the basement next to a staircase and store cupboard so was very very noisy as staff accessed the cupboard and stairs at all hours, Friendliness of staff very comfortable bed large room nespresso machine was a nice touch location of hotel was excellent with tram access close by very convenient for museums hotel decor was good

431278,Hotel Roemer Amsterdam, We asked to change rooms because we were in the basement and had requested on our reservation that we not be placed there We were moved next day to a room where the air conditioning was not working During the rest of our our stay they were unable to fix the air conditioner Fortunately the weather cooled the next day and we did nt need it The manager offered us an upgrade on our next visit to the hotel Felt the staff we interacted with were sympathic to our situation , Friendliness of staff They were very hospitable
