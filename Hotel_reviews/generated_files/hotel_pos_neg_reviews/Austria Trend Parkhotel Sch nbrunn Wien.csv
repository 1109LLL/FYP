342869,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The hotel is very large with many large groups so it can be a bit noisy although probably for this reason an excellent place to stay if traveling with lots of family At 19 euros the buffet breakfast was rather pricey but we appreciated the cafe with smaller less expensive options , The bed was very large and comfortable even though we were staying in the most basic room Would have loved to have had a coffee maker or hot water boiler in the room but very much appreciated the wine glasses and mini fridge 
342870,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, What I didn t like was of a personal preference I like a face cloth there were none The temperature could be a little cooler I prefer a cold room I also like a top sheet rather than a comforter I think you are a pet friendly hotel which is a problem for me as I am allergic to pets and sneezed the whole time I was in the room There is a no smoking policy for those who don t like the smell of cigarettes what about those of us who have health issues from pets I was hoping I could manage this as I was part of a group travelling for a family reunion but know from now on that I cannot put myself in this situation Again the hotel is lovely but this was why it didn t receive top marks from me , The gentleman at the desk through the night was so very helpful to us He is a blessing to your hotel The pillows are indeed very nice It is a clean and lovely hotel 
342871,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Room was to noise traffic through the window was to loud And room was connected with another room only with doors and I was wake from 6 am because some asian family Never more , Breakfast was very good 
342872,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The staff seemed to dissmiss us quickly wasn t very helpful with any of our questions , Beautiful hotel with exellent view Next to Sch nbrunn Palace and the zoo Relatively easy access to the city centre 
342873,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Grumpy lady at the check in Think she needs a vacation Asked if we could have an extra bed in the room and she sighed and said the rooms were too small even if we could easily have fitted four extra beds in the room , Large rooms
342874,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I had booked a comfort double room but on arrival the clerk at the desk gave us a smaller room on the 1st floor not a bad room all in all but with a very small bathroom not what I had booked I returned to the front desk and showed them photos of the room from my booking com account on my phone The new room I was given no extra charge of course was the one in the photo however the photos on the web site are masterfully taken In reality the room is spacious but if you pay attention to the details it s 3 stars at best All in all the rooms are quite OK but not as luxurious as the photos make you believe , Very close to the U bahn station great area Delicious breakfast coffee at the cafes nearby 
342875,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, For a 4 star hotel the parking is a disappointment since it is not included in the price What is more the hotel does not have its own parking spots Considering that it is located in the center of Vienna free street parking spots are very difficult to find The only option left is an underground parking near the hotel but it costs almost 30 EUR per day ,No Positive
342876,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Ordered taxivan via hotel to AirPort for 6 persons and 6 suitcases A small taxi arrived Staf of hotel not helpfull and rude So we had to take two taxi s without any compensation or apologies , Big room Good facilities
342877,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, As I wrote during our reservation I would appreciate quite room with a bath Unfurtunately there was a broken shower water everywhere and one non isolated door to the hall other rooms have two , Very nice hotel next to Sch nbrunn Palace Park Breakfast was really good Subway stop bars restaurants within grasp 
342878,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Was not greeted in a welcoming way it was as if we were an inconvenience One section looks modernised and new however if you were like us and on the other side of the hotel you would be quite disappointed , Good location if you wanted to go to the zoo Although you are a distance from the city centre there conveniently is a metro stop across the road 
342879,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The attitude of the personal when we came they cheated on us and provided the wrong room which was worse then we booked It was absolutely not the room we wanted The lady from reception didn t want to change the room without adding some money When we started to search for another hotel she accidentally found out that there was one vacant room for us Our room wasn t cleaned for two days despite the note on the door open for cleaning There was no dental kit shampoo and conditioner slippers and bathrobe the hotel with 4 stars should have it all The balcony was very dirty with spiders and dust but the view was pretty so we tried not to notice this disadvantage , The hotel is a real palace Wonderful hall and beautiful building The location is good a lot of shops and restaurants nearby and the subway station is very close to the hotel
342880,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I have no complaints, The hotel has been transfrormed since we stayed there about 20 years ago It is beautifully appointed The room we stayed in was very large The toilet was separate from the bathroom a distinct advantage The staff were polite and helpful Although the hotel is not centrally located it is very easy to travel to the centre by the nearby underground train service in just a few minutes The entrance to the grounds of Schonbrunn Palace is diametrically facing the hotel I would not stay anywhere else if I were to visit Vienna again 
342881,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The hotel manager checked us in and had this been a holiday inn I would say he is doing ok but for this hotel my expectation is to be treated nicely and with a smile I might put it as a bad day but again he helped us when we departed and same sour attitude Maybe it is cultural but less than I expect , Location is excellent and hotel appearance is very nice 
342882,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We were given an upgrade which was great and told that we would have a view of the garden When we saw the view we were looking against another building We were wondering what kind of view we would have gotten if we didn t get an upgrade The breakfast is not worth your money there are enough places to get a sit down breakfast or a breakfast to go in the area , The location is great it is a 5 minute walk to Palace Sch nbrunn and to the nearest metrostation The staff was very friendly and upon arriving we got free public transport tickets that other guests had left at the reception after leaving Also the two congi rges I saw were very kind and helpfull with any question I had The pillow I had was not enough for me to have a comfortable sleep after requesting an extra pillow it was brought to my room in no time 
342883,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Very expensive breakfast room view was just not great overall appearance of rooms were a bit worn , Very close to Schonbrunn palace Hiezling station walkable breakfast options very close 
342884,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Very comfortable beds we were 4 ladies in 2 adjacent ground floor rooms with A small terrace overlooking the Courtyard Gardens with Wasserbrunnen water Fountain loved sitting out in the evening enjoying a glass or two of Groovy That s what the English People call the Gr ner Vetliner Loved the ambiance in the Hotel Bar also very welcoming 
342885,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Tourist trap you believe you are going to sleep in a palaace and the hotel rooms are in an adjacent building making you feel like you are in dorms, Breakfast was good
342886,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, There was nothing not to like, This is a great hotel at a fair fee if you want to stay away from or don t need to be in the busy Vienna city centre yet it is only a couple of kilometers from the centre of Vienna which is not a large city by any standard The hotel is virtually next door to the Schoenbrunn palace but if you need night entertainment well I only strayed for one night and the Biergarten nearby served me perfectly 
342887,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location near both the tram and underground station making getting around so easy The hotel staff were so helpful and only too happy to help The room was large and very comfortable The bonus was the hotel is just yards away from the entrance to the wonderful gardens of the Schonbrunn palace 
342888,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, nothing , Great location for the Schonbrunn Palace and Gardens Hotel 50 m away from tram and underground terminus taking you straight into city centre Large room booked an executive room and well worth it 
342889,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, A very pleasant light airy hotel Friendly staff calm and very helpful The room was extremely comfy and the bathroom magnificent Breakfast was well presented with everything we could want and all very tasty Wifi excellent Altogether we had a very enjoyable stay 
342890,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No electric kettle for coffee in the room, Good location near train station and schonbrunn palace We just book 1 night so went by train to Vienna when arrived then go schonbrunn next morning Glad chosen this hotel instead for hotel in Vienna 
342891,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, In general hotel personnel especially some receptionists are helpful and they care some are very good but sometimes this is not the case For example housekeeping maid took the used water glasses in the morning and they were not replaced with the clean ones In the evening we called reception they immy switched to room service after a detailed explanation that we don t need tea just empty glasses they promised to bring ones but nothing followed Room cleaning quality very much depends on the house keeping maid who does the room cleaning at this very day , Advantages Very good location near Schoenbrunn Palace at the same time it takes only 10 15 minutes to get to Vienna city center by subway Quiet spatial trendy room good beds window is facing inner garden no transport noise tonight we had de luxe room category other room categories are also good Good breakfast
342892,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No telephone in our room mixed excuses given as to why no tea coffee facility in room, Excellent breakfast choices great location right next to Schonnbraun Palace gardens
342893,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, It s time to repair the rooms in the main building Standard rooms transferred to deluxe sucks Stop deceiving people The staff offered to pay extra for changing my deluxe room to a deluxe room in the main building The staff is polite but he does not care what the client is left with Several times I went to this hotel and I think it is time to change it I do not recommend it to anyone , It s time to repair the rooms in the main building Standard rooms transferred to deluxe sucks Stop deceiving people The staff offered to pay extra for changing my deluxe room to a deluxe room in the main building The staff is polite but he does not care what the client is left with Several times I went to this hotel and I think it is time to change it I do not recommend it to anyone 
342894,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast was bad and is definetly not worth the money , Location was good hotel is nice and clean Rooms are big and spacious Employees are really friendly and helpful We enjoyed our stay at this hotel 
342895,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, They only have the one Cafe restuarant the food is a little hit and miss But there are plenty of other eating places in the area , Luxurious I had to check the booking email to confirm I had the right place Wow This place is great We have stayed at a lot of hotels and I think this is one of the better stays we had The location is a little out of the centre of town but near the Schronbrunn Palace grounds My wife enjoyed walking around the nearby shops Easy to pop into Vienna city area from the mtero 
342896,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The bed turned out to be 2 singles made up separately and placed together Very odd but still comfortable The Nachos was just Corn Chips Salsa dip no sour cream no avocado That s my only real criticism , This is the place to go if you really want to impress your wife The ambience was wonderful The decor was very fitting with the Palace grounds being just across the road We could not have asked for a more perfect hotel Close to the Metro for easy access to anywhere in Vienna Great local cafe s restaurants and shopping 
342897,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Old style furnitures old mattresses not too comfortable room service not in the morning bathroom not so in line for a 4 star hotel hygiene products included , Metro station very close to the hotel and many restaurants in the neighborhood Kind staff huge rooms Classy bar and restaurant with good service good food and fair prices 
342898,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, There is nothing I dislike This is just a suggestion I suggest that an electric kettle should be provided in each room although we were provided with one when we made a request It is nice to have a cup of tea at night or an early morning cup of coffee right inside the comfort of your room , The room and toilet are very clean The bed is very comfortable as well All the amenities in the room are almost new and in good condition Also we want to thank the hotel management for upgrading our accommodation at no additional cost It really was a bonus and a blessing 
342899,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, This time it was not the best few out of our window the bathroom is still hahaha very tiny, I like the beautiful and traditional atmosphare of the hotel combined with modern standard in the rooms 
342900,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Attitude of bar staff whi shouted across room that we could not sit in seats we had chosen because they were reserved at 11pm We took our drinks to our room No drink making facilities in room Arrived on a Sunday eve having traveled 9 hours by train only to find Radio Wien had taken over the hotel and restaurant did not open until 9PM We went elsewhere , Comfy rooms Quiet space where we were located Breakfast the best 
342901,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No breakfast was served When we arrived we waited for a while for help with the luggage And a lady from reception came Though emancipation is good heavy luggage should not be carried by females I felt awful when she was doing that Parking is public and expensive Probably due to touristic place The rooms were modest and pretty small We had those in 4000 ies section There are different sections though , Close to Schonbrunn Metro is 5min walk This building was built as a guest palace for guests of the imperor Nice interior in the lobby 
342902,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Good Location It is very close to Schonbrunn palace and park very close to subway station just 1 2min clean room and nice staff if you enjoy jogging you must stay here also amazing breakfast 
342903,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Far away from city centre and other sightseeings However public transport underground train is easily accessible , Nice Hotel and Good location to see Sch nbrunn Palace Palm House Zoo and the Glory specially for those who are travelling with family kids 
342904,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Restaurant was not that great Weird seating and average food , Perfect place to stay Right next to the palace and its huge garden Metro station is near city centre is 15min away 
342905,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No tea kettle in the room Bathroom basin sink not working properly Floor carpet too old and spotty Floors make lot of squeaking noise Breakfast is too pricy Restaurant does not provide lot of options to eat , Room is quite spacious Location wise pretty good Friendly staffs Good bar 
342906,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The breakfast within the hotel was extremely expensive compared to other cities we have visited It was 19 Euro per person You can get breakfast for less than half price outside of the hotel , It is near to metro bus and trams It is crossed the street from Schonbrunn Palace and there are many shops and restaurants nearby We were happy with provided umbrellas in a rainy day 
342907,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Size of the bathroom is too too small The view from the room 3201 is ugly , Service in the restaurant was very good The Metro station is about 100 mts from the hotel and that is very nice to have Schonbrunn Park is crossing the street beautiful place to take a walk or to jog in the morning 
342908,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No milk with the tea coffee in room, Although it was in the city the rooms were very quiet Hotel bar was pleasantly lively in the evening Good place for a nightcap 
342909,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Beautiful view from the balcony luxury designed bar and restaurant Everything is so clean and well formed If you want to taste the atmosphere of Vienna in a short time stay here and enjoy Sch nbrunn palace for a day You can go to Carlsplatz by metro from Hietzing which is very close from the hotel and enjoy the city center for another day or the evening You can see everything you want of city center If you stay far from here you might get some pressure with planning your trip in time Fast WiFi connection in your room is just one of the extras 
342910,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The room for one person is very small The bed may not even be a twin it is that small The floor looked very dirty in that room Once I upgraded my room to a queen bed the accommodations were much better , The location alone makes it worth the money It s near the train station tons of stores and the park doesn t get much better than that The bar staff was always very nice and in case you don t speak good German most people speak English 
342911,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Can t tell nothing bad for the hotel , The hotel is very good designed The restaurant is one of the best in the area The lunch menu is fantastic The hotel is next to Shonbrun Palace and Shonbrun Zoo 
342912,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, 1 Even though I thoroughly booked with a mail a car to wait for me and my family at my arrival at Vienna hotel it did not appear The explanation I got later at the hotel reception desk was that the mail came late to them so they did not have time to organise it I send my mail with all the needed details the previous day so this explanation was not good for me It is another story when somebody paid attention to it if at all I had to find my own way to the hotel which was easy though I was in Vienna many times before I wanted it just because the kid was tired from the early get up and the flight which was her first not so much for my convenience eve though I was also traveling with a large suitcase and a folding trolley for the kid quite bulky as you can imagine Therefore I did not like the vain sorry about that to my complain at the reception 2 The restaurant is OK but I expected much much more Good that there are plenty of other restaurants around the hotel 3 At my check out I kindly asked my Lufthansa Miles More card to be verified accordingly since I actually did the hotel booking with it I was refused with the explanation that I have to check it with Lufthansa I kindly asked them to connect me with Lufthansa in order to do that at the spot I was refused with that as well Very very impolite I checked with Lufthansa M M in Sofia They were surprised but advised me to check with Booking com A lot of checking and still no result I still do not have my miles for the hotel booking in my card , This four stars hotel is situated conveniently at about three minutes walk from the public transport metro green line and busses It as just at one of the gates of Sch nbrunn park very close to the Sch nbrunn palace La Gloriette Vienna zoo the Palm house and the Cactus house A great place to be with your family when being in Vienna for leisure The breakfast is excellent My room was spacious with high ceiling and extra large bed The cable TV was fine WIFI perfect The mini bar well equipped The bathroom was clean and with a bad tab very convenient to rest in it after a long day This hotel has history behind It was originally the guest house of Franc Josef 
342913,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Very nice safe area and really great hotel Imperial Vienna is still living in this neighborhood Big rooms few steps to metro U4 line city Zoo and Schonbrunn palace park Free parking area around hotel as well as nice bars and restaurants Your metro ride to the city center is 15 minutes Perfect hotel for couples and family with small children 
342914,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Room a bit dated breakfast and cafe expensive compared to nearby places, Location and value for money was impressive We had breakfast elsewhere a lot cheaper though Room a little dated but massive clean and there was nothing missing 
342915,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Requested iron from receptionist however need to pick by myself which opposite the road , Spacious clean comfy bed clean and spacious bathroom English speaking receptionist overall the hotel give me very good service 
342916,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The room we booked was a standard double It was nothing like the photos old bad furniture stains on the carpet and had not properly been cleaned for a long time there was dust on surfaces and fittings However the worst was the bed As is not uncommon in Austria the double bed was two queen sized beds pushed together which was not a problem The issue was the mattresses we have never slept on softer and less comfortable mattresses anywhere no support at all just a hole to sink into The pillows were thin and offered no support either even with two together We had the most uncomfortable night s sleep ever and both woke up with back pain In the morning we complained and were offered the choice of a room upgrade at Euro 10 per night where we were assured that the beds would be better Alternatively they said we could move to another room of the same standard which might have different mattresses We were not prepared to pay extra for a better room a comfortable mattress should be a given for any room in a supposed 4 star hotel so looked at the alternative room offered While the mattresses appeared somewhat firmer the room was tired with stains on the floor and damaged furniture We therefore cancelled our further three nights and moved to a similarly priced hotel elsewhere which we were very happy with As we were leaving the concierge told us that we should have known what to expect if we booked a budget room presumably he meant a dirty tired room and an uncomfortable bed We have travelled a lot all over the world at reasonably priced hotels and have stayed at many hotels in Vienna This was without doubt the most disappointing overall hotel experience we have ever had What we expected to be a good value weekend in a lovely hotel turned out to be something very different Even a budget room Euro 90 per night in this case so hardly the cheapest should be clean and comfortable , Location 
342917,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The first night we were placed in the other part of the hotel which for the price we paid was not sufficient The employees however moved us to us the second day , One s we were switched to the main building we had less noise and a great view Really great and accessible location 
342918,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Excellent room very clean and with a great view The hotel is very close to the underground station therefore a good starting point for touring Vienna 
342919,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The staffs told my husband that we have to pay 20 Euros each for iron and water kettle if we wanted them But this is just small matter so nvm , I really like almost everything in this hotel The staffs were great the room was spacious and comfortable have mini balcony really close to the train station and schonbrunn palace the hotel has nice neighbourhood and views The wifi connection was so so in the room but so fast in the lobby So I can just casually rest at the lobby and use the wifi Not to mention the Austrian people that we ve met there are really nice and helpful Such a great experience we have there 
342920,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Great clean and spacious rooms in main building knowledgeable and kind staff great breakfast Schonbrunn castle in walking distance and direct city center access via tram just in front of the hotel Value for money 
342921,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The price of the breakfast The food served at the breakfast was good plenty of choice but we felt that the price was too high 19 euros each and certainly not worth such a high cost We therefore only had breakfast on the first morning and after that we ate at a local bakers cafe just along the street For this reason we give the hotel a score of 9 5 10 But don t let this put you off staying here , We loved this hotel An excellent location very close to the railway station which was only a 2 minute walk away Very handy for reaching the centre of the city in approx 10 minutes The surrounding area is very nice with some good restaurants and shops We particularly liked the Japanese restaurant which is just along the street from the hotel The hotel s restaurant serves beautiful food and we enjoyed a very relaxing evening there The hotel bar is also very good A super place to unwind and relax with very attentive staff and good music Our room was beautiful spotlessly clean and the bed was superb Everything about the bathroom was great and there was constant hot water The reception staff were all very helpful and friendly We would highly recommend this hotel and would certainly return Excellent value for money 
342922,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Only have 1 pillow for one person I would prefer at least 2 pillows Also the pillow stuff is thin maybe a bit more pillow stuff But that s just me , Everything is OK except for the pillow but thats just me 
342923,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Size of my room but really not a complaint as price I got it for was brill, Like the location and restaurants around the area Great bar Irish bar Great transport to the city beside the palace Great location and good hotel Brekkie is good but not 19euro pp Just to left or right is brekkie places
342924,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Parking is included with no prior reservation necessary however this means that there is a public parking garage next to the hotel where you can in fact park your car for 26 euros day This wasn t clear to me when I made the booking , Staff was lovely and helpful the room was beautiful clean and perfectly equipped Location is great too right by the park and close to public transport 
342925,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Excellent breakfast spacious room a lot of TV channels wi fi internet fast by metro ride to the city center modern interiors and music loudspeaker in the bathroom 
342926,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Cleaning team knocking on the door just after 9am is a bit too ambitious for a leisure weekend , Very decent large room closeby metro Hietzing 15 mins to centre and Schonbrunn palace Friendly staff and great price 
342927,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Nothing could be better rated 10 10, Room was palatial beautiful and elegant extremely clean modern yet full of character By far the best hotel room I have stayed in Absolutely fantastic
342928,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Nothing really everything was just perfect, First of all excellent customer service We had a larger room the bed was super comfy everything needed was in the room which was very clean and spacious Very close to Schloss Schonbrunn and the Zoo Tube station is right behind the corner 
342929,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, If they promise they don t change towels unless they are left on the floor they have to stick to it It insulted my ecological conscience to see them change them all the time Such hypocrisy Not easy to have a healthy breakfast because most items consisted either too much sugar salt or grease , Enough space in the breakfast room Nice fresh omelet Friendly staff 
342930,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I have no negatives with this hotel Central Vienna is a few S bahn stops away Not a problem , Overall one of the best hotels I have stayed at in terms of service room size and facilities and value for money
342931,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast on Sunday could have been longer especially after the ball Bed was a bit too hard cushions too soft All depends on preferences , Historic hotel next to Schoenbrunn palace and gardens with easy access to public transport amazing interior in the main hall ball room and bar Our room was in the new part cosy and very quiet We ve attended a ball at the hotel It was fabulous 
342932,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast sounded expensive at 20 Euros a head so we went to a local caf just around the corner , We got an upgrade so were particularly pleased with the room how big and how warm it was We went for the rainbow ball held at the same hotel and were impressed about how quiet it was in the room despite such a big event taking place just there All very convenient for us Also just in front of the park leading to the palace so great to have that to visit the following day 
342933,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The Duvet Cover for the bed were single ones we would have prefred a Double duvet cover the double mattress is split in 2 sometimes the bed will split too,No Positive
342934,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, 1 Looking at the hotel I had the impression that the hotel has seen better days in the past The room furtniture was a bit worn out the service was slow 2 Probably the shortcoming of every large hotel absence of any personal touch it seamed for me also that the hotel is used for mass tourist group just for 1 2 nights which of course does not make the hotel personnel to be more welcoming 3 The evening restaurant in the hotel is rather pricy and the food is not someting special There are hundreds of places in Vienna where you can eat really good Not recommended , 1 Location Our target was Schoenbrunn so from this point of view the choice of this hotel was just great as Schoenbrunn is located around the corner verbatim It is also very easy to go to the center of Vienna as the metro station is located very close to the hotel The area called Hitzing around the hotel ias also very nice to walk and very green I suppose in spring and summer as we stayed in January 2 We had the spacious room big enough for the family 3 Breakfast was good good choice of dishes 4 The hotel is located in the beatuful historical building 
342935,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We were dissapointed with the fact that they had another building attached to it and they placed us there instead of the main building which looks cooler and which is advertised here Curtains on the window were not so clean, Location and the Main Building of the hotel where stunning The rooms were super clean and comfortable 
342936,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The room was rather basic with old furniture and kind a 90 s design I expected it to be more historical a themed picture on the wall at least since the hotel promotes itself as the former guesthouse of the Habsburgs I would advise them to work a bit on this experience design I believe we were not the only once who chose this hotel based on this feature , The service was great Helpful staff prompt nice and gave helpful advice regarding parking They enabled us to check out super fast there was no need to wait in line 
342937,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast was good quality but rather hard work assembling it yourself Electronic room keys a bit unreliable especially if you didn t work out the card has to be inserted upside down , Friendly staff Good service Good food 
342938,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The rooms would benefit from tea and coffee making facilities , The position of the hotel was so close to the Schonbrunn Palace gardens and the Underground It was also very grand good value for money We had no problem finding places to eat nearby we travelled in to the city on two occasions once on New Years Eve it was so easy and the underground wasn t packed It was a wonderful place to be on New Year s Eve 
342939,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Just next to Schonbrunn palace but still only 15min metro away from city center Very convenient and very calm Service very good and very nice restaurant 
342940,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I think that for the this price we could get a better room We requested a queen size bed and got two single begs in both rooms we reserved On the other hand the location is very good and the staff was very friendly and professional ,No Positive
342941,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Cleaner doesnt change sheets even when you throw them on the ground as stated in the room For new years everything is to expensive God forbid you went with your car which would be an aditional 130 euros for five nights Breakfast is not included in the price with a wooping 20 euros per person each day Room meals were average ,No Positive
342942,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The heaters doesn t work good and make noise The refrigator is all of drink can t put nothing The bathroom we have 1 but it s separated in 2 the first time I see The bathroom door don t close For 150 is a random room we have seen everywhere we re expecting smthng better with that price bye see you vienna, Wifi and the building was very beautiful The room was big The zoo and shonbrunn park was 70 m near us 
342943,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Some rooms think almost all still have wooden flooring so you can hear almost every step also at the neighbors , Well run imposing classic hotel in a good location Friendly staff good equipment nice restaurant and bar makes the accommodation a pleasant experience 
342944,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Creeky floor but is the charm of a historic building , So close to Sch nbrunn the Tiergarten and other travel notables and the tram Very good breakfast to start your day 
342945,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The hotel had no spare pillows How does a hotel not have spare pillows When we were charged for the rooms on booking com we were overcharged We booked a double room a single room the double room was actually a twin the single room had a double bed with a single quilt strange The rooms need freshening up One girl on reception was very nice the rest were disinterested , The public areas in the hotel are very nice Breakfast was good 
342946,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, 19 euros for breakfast is scandalous and was the only downside to this fabulous hotel we didn t eat breakfast but did enjoy a superb evening meal in the restaurant for cheaper than eating outside seems crazy, Everything except the price for breakfast

342948,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We didn t have breakfast there but 19 each for breakfast seems absolutely ridiculous There s a few cafes a few minutes walk from the hotel McDonalds too if you re feeling adventurous, Great location 25 mins from the centre on the underground station less than 5 mins walk without central prices 
342949,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, For such a classy hotel some fitness facilities however small would be lovely It is possible to use Schoenbrunnn park for running however during the winter this option is not very handy , Absolutely love the classy hotel that is not so modernistic and copy paste as all others while still retaining all the comfort of a modern hotel Rooms are fantastic and breakfast is excellent

342960,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Having to leave , Everything We were looking for old world charm and we got it We upgraded to an executive room with a balcony overlooking the courtyard Great restaurants nearby and a 5 min walk to Schonbrunn Palace A must see along with a walk to the Gloriette to see stunning views of Vienna Subway 3 mins away so attractions downtown easily accessible in 15 mins 
342961,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast can be a little hectic with large tour groups there all at once, Executive room was very spacious clean and comfortable staff was very attentive and pleasant
342962,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I would have liked to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room The pillows were not the most comfortable , The location was good The Metro stop was just a short walk away and only a few stops into the old part of the city The Schonbrunn Zoo and palace are just over the road from the hotel which are worth a visit There are plenty of cafes and restaurants close by too 
342963,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Nothing but find it hard to relate to other people s harsh comments about this superb place , Extremely pleasant and helpful staff Clean room excellent housekeeping Will be booking for December next year Close to u Bahn station excellent all round hotel
342964,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, A bit out of the city centre but easy access via the underground line a short walk from the hotel , Excellent room with a comfortable large bed Good choice of food at breakfast Proximity to Schonbrunn palace zoo and gardens all superb 
342965,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The staff was as good as unhelpful on the contrary the manager was an extremely rude person who didn t understand the fact that he was working in the hospitality industry on asking for basic things like tea bags he created an issue and was borderline derogatory in his conduct I would definitely like to lodge a complaint with the hotel management to improve their staff , Can t think of anything in particular that I can say was exceptional 
342966,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Beautiful hotel with excellent beds pillows bathroom Really nice breakfast with lots of options Great location close to attractions and subway or bus stop Quiet sleep with garden courtyard 10 
342967,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The hotel is super close to the Schonbrunn Palace it is just a bit far out from the city centre to go back and forth throughout the day , Comfy room and bed clean room and when asked for additional pillows we received them within minutes Staff are friendly 
342968,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Bar facilities could have been better Tea coffee facilities would have been nice , The situation was perfect for visiting Vienna Breakfast was excellent

342970,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Room lacked any kind of charm empty walls more like a barracks no character Breakfast was a disaster scrambled eggs made with egg powder salt pepper holder filthy Hotel has seen better days , Had a good club sandwich and coffee in the Bistro Coffee shop
342971,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Laundry services are not available on Friday afternoon and week end and there was a limited number of iron sets so it was necessary to wait until one is free , We were travelling in a group of 3 friends Upon our request for an extra bed we have been offered a spacy family room with a little balkon to the inner garden 
342972,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Delayed check in Room not cleaned on day 2 , Good service from young male member of staff after we returned to room after a full day out to find that room hadn t been cleaned and there were no clean towels 
342973,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, I was slightly disappointed that there was not what I would call a proper menu in a dining room for the one evening that we eat in the hotel There may have been one for the bus tour , I would not have expected anything other than the best and the best is what we got 
342974,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The breakfast room was only opened for a half of its space in the morning many people eating breakfast at the same time but without enough space made it not feeling comfortable It was almost not possible to find a table with sufficient space for eating , Hotel location it can reached easily by public transport or car Breakfast with wide choice of food in good quality Nice bar area with nice staff Room size good bathroom clean and well equipped 
342975,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The cleaning lady left a dirty garbage bag on our desk and did not clean the room properly The room we booked was very small in comparison to an executive room we got during our previous stay , Helpful staff nice cafe next to the hotel subway not far away 
342976,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The bathroom is separated from the toilet No connected rooms are available They give us 2 rooms that are distant from the hotel entrance around 150 m which would be bothersome if you have a lot of luggage to drag the long way with your kids, The location The staff
342977,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Staff not very friendly looked s they didn t want to be there and evening meal service not good at all one meal missed off all together Terrible and although everyone had almost finished their meal only a coffee was offered as a gesture , The palace like environment
342978,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The toilet was far from the bathroom There was no small towel in the toilet near the sink it was very uncomfortable , Kettle tea coffee and meeting fruit plate in the room Perfect location just opposite Shonbrunn park Varied breakfast Balcony facing the quiet yard 
342979,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Wifi didn t work in my room I had to sit in the hallways of the hotel to use this , Breakfast was wonderful So many options and you could order omelettes 
342980,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The bed is very uncomfortable I have a back ache in the morning The pillow is only one which is very thin and uncomfortable Usually if the hotel is 4 star it includes at least 2 comfortable pillows and bed No complimentary tea or coffee in the room No small shampoo or soap in the bathroom The lady who clean the room just pass by and just put the toilet paper The room is not clean and tidy What is the idea of coming in and showing that you clean and actually is not cleaned and tidy , The staff are good The room is spacious 
342981,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We had problems with the first room we were given and it took 24 hours to resolve Not impressed with the response from reception customer facing staff The first room we were given had foul odour of damp and bathroom shower drain smelt very badly Upon reporting the smell the reception staff agreed to move us without question but the hotel was fully booked so we were told we had to wait 24 hours to be moved The reception staff were out of any other options solutions to the long wait other than suggesting a room spray which was frustrating More frustrating was that reception staff refused to come inspect the room despite our insistence Felt that the reception staff were not interested in understanding the problem or it s causes despite asking us to sit tight for 24 hours Once moved the second room was fine , Hotel is located in very pleasant suburb but with quick and easy access to city centre Schonbrunn has some sights as well Hotel located close to U4 and trams Room had its own outdoor seating area overlooking courtyard which was very pleasant We had problems with the first room but the second was ok Impressions were that the rooms were fairly standard hotel rooms but nothing too remarkable Rooms were very quiet Good fast wi fi Hotel ballroom was a good entertainment space and catering was good Some of the portering staff went out of their way to help find us an ironing board due to lack of pressing service over weekends 
342982,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, There were no facilities for Spa treatments and I think this would put the hotel at the top of any stars , The hotel was very luxurious and welcoming This has to be one of the best hotels i have stayed in The food was cooked to superb quality and staff were extremely accommodating

342985,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The first room lacked toilet paper in the second room the empty shampoo bottle was replaced only when asked twice and used tea cans were not taken away until we asked , We got another room that was darker so we could sleep better we were asked to pay only a modest extra price which was fair That the second room did not have a great view like the first had but a blind wall was actually better for us 
342986,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, U4 station closed for works so need to take shuttle bus Breakfast overpriced for what it is , We paid for an upgrade to the Executive room as wasn t too impressed with the Deluxe double well worth it difference in room quality is vast Having said that the Deluxe double was still good value 
342987,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Would have been nicer to have a greater selection of beers on tap there was only one Also dinner experience wasn t as wow factor as expected but at least the food was descent quality , We were in the corner room massive ceilings masses of space Great jump point into town using trams underground 
342988,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Called the hotel up front asking if they sell tickets to Schonbrunn palace The lady told me they sell them from front desk It turned out this was not true so I booked them online and had the hotel print our vouchers Our room in back of the hotel was a long walk , Good value for money Located facing Schonbrunn park and very close to subway station Our room in back of hotel was mostly very quiet and clean Had some good rest there 
342989,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Our room was more like a junior suite with balcony and very comfortable The hotel s location provides many options for shopping and dining and only a short trip by tram into the city

342997,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The staff at breakfast can t keep up with replenishing the food available The omelette chef disappeared for a long period and there was no way of signalling my presence while I was waiting for an omelette Extra pillow as standard , Breakfast choices were good The bar staff were great 
342998,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No air condition in the rooms given away through Booking com The staff at the Reception and at the Bar were both very unpolite and unprofessional Billing was a problem as well , Location is superb though 
342999,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The hotel has become way too large There are now five buildings and it was too long of a walk to the lobby After 2 weeks in cozy hotels around Austria this was cold and impersonal Also the traffic in front of the hotel was so heavy that the exhaust fumes kept us from sitting out on the terrace The hotel itself was clean and comfortable and the food was good , The hotel is neat and clean and close to the beautiful Sch nbrunn Palace The breakfast buffet was great 
343000,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We hated the long institutional looking corridors The garden which has huge potential was very disappointing Some interesting planting tables comfortable chairs umbrellas regular maintenance would create a very relaxing oasis This should also increase potential for additional sales of food drinks Location across the road from Schonbrunn close to ubahn was excellent , Reception staff were very friendly welcoming helpful Breakfast was good beds were very comfortable 
343001,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, no sparkling wine for breakfast as last time room price somewhat high, attentive staff spacious room with wooden floor nice common space possibility of outdoor breakfast

343006,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Attitude of reception staff who did not want to allow me to unload luggage from our car at the front of the hotel I did it anyway The porter was especially helpful When I attempted to get breakfast the service was poor We were ignored The staff chose to serve others who came in after us and then proceeded to clear the tables rather than take our order In the event we chose to go next door for breakfast where the service was excellent The reception staff were not very informative on our arrival choosing to tell us to read everything rather than talk to us about anything , Location close to Schunbrun Palace and park Luxury of hotel Porter assistance 
343007,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The one gentleman at the front desk initially who was a little dismissive His female colleagues were kind, They kindly moved us to a room closer to the lobby which was very helpful for my husband We appreciated it
343008,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, There were no tea of coffee making facilities in the room , Good location Clean and comfortable Excellent buffet breakfast We would use the hotel again on a future visit 
343009,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, our hotel room was juat right for us a little bit basic compared to the grand design of the hotel The only negative was that our bathroom was quite small , very beautiful grand hotel looks like a 5 hotel as soon as you walk in to the lobby it has a real wow factor staff were very friendly and attentive always happy to help

343014,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The bathroom was ridiculously small it was like walking into a cupboard There were no amenities just squeeze bottles of liquid soap in the shower and sink This doesn t seem appropriate for a four star hotel The toilet didn t look clean and there was hair in the drawer The bath was high and it was difficult to get in and out to have a shower We were expecting some luxury and got a basic room We waited 25 minutes to get a soft boiled egg made at breakfast and an omelette which wasn t even cooked properly We were very disappointed in this hotel as we were expecting some level of luxury due to the price we paid We didn t get this at all At checkout we weren t even farewelled or asked how our stay was ,No Positive

343021,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Guests please be aware that this hotel extends to private functions and on certain days of the year you cannot get access to the restaurant or bar No note in room to for warn guests , Martin in the Glorietta bar was a really welcoming and attentive bar person We would highly recommend the Della Lucia restaurant just a few doors away from the hotel 
343022,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Breakfast rather expensive Good to have option of cafe within hotel Generally couldn t fault anything though , Lovely hotel in pleasant out of city centre location 15 min by metro to central Vienna Felt v safe location with nice cafes close by Staff v helpful particularly on reception V comfortable room 
343023,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The aircon seemed to be on permanently but was quickly rectified It did seem like a business hotel with a large convention on I think the parking situation is a bit odd and could be better sorted out Not very clear labelling on where the parking drop off is I had to go in and ask at reception and I was still not told about the easiest way Even where the reception is is not clear , Great location for the zoo and Schonbrunn Good breakfast I booked an exec room and we got an upgrade to a bigger room which was lovely in the old part of the hotel

343027,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Would have liked tea coffee facilities in room Requested a pot of tea from room service which did not materialise Confused over beds single beds but pushed together with king size headboard so we would have preferred a king size quilt but not available so settled for extra single quilt , Stayed here for 6 days and travelled by train Reception on arrival at 9 30pm was very good including help from porter who was friendly and helpful Staff had good english and were very informative and helpful Breakfast is superb and well worth the money We requested extra pillows and extra quilt and got them the following day Problem with the safe was dealt with very quickly Quiet room as requested overlooking the hotel garden Excellent location with metro and Schonbrunn nearby and some good restaurants within walking distance including a beer hall Good for an evening concert at the orangery Schonbrunn 
343028,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, nothing, Very helpful staff good location I ve stayed 3 nights at this hotel and it was really convenient to visit the palace and Gloriette hill everyday The subway station is about 3 minutes away from hotel and you can reach the center in about 15 to 20 minutes Also there are plenty of good restraurants and shops nearby 
343029,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Hotel needs a bit of a face lift , Very convinient near the metro location Stayed just one night while in transit Perfect for my short stay Price definitely attractive Not a bargain but close

343034,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Not a thing , Staff were very friendly and helpful especially the bar man Room was beautiful and with the view of the garden would be amazing in summer 
343035,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, A room was dirty We found someone s t shirt there we booked a room for 2 night every morning between 9 10 am the hotel staff came to our room though we hanged a notice not to disturb On reception they couldn t explain that So never ever again to this place, Room size
343036,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, We here in the USA use hand wash clothes to wash our face use in bath shower etc The hotel would save money by placing hand wash clothes in bath rooms much cheaper to wash and clean than a long hand towel which was the only thing we had to use , All of the above
343037,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, A little bit closer to the centre would have been nice but you have an U bahn station close by, Everything Is a great hotel with incredible service and fantastic accomodations
343038,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien,No Negative, Nice small Hotel very European style the staff was amazing and helpful the room was big very clean and comfy Metro is very near and one of the Schoenbrun Palace entrances is jut 50 mts away Have nice cafes around to have breakfast if you not want to have it in the Hotel Wifi is free in the room 
343039,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Upon arrival the reception staff was very rude and unhelpful When we asked the man at the reception to check it he went through the usual procedure and then gave us the room keys and waved his hand towards the general direction of the room No explanation about the hotel no breakfast times no map of the city nothing Turns out he had given us the wrong room category and we had to go back and explain that we had booked the higher category He said no we hadn t even though I was holding the reservation confirmation right in front of him For some reason he thought we were lying He then referred us to his colleague without apologizing Luckily his colleague gave us the right room and was friendlier but no helpfulness over the hotel facilities or city information The price does not include breakfast which is also a little unpractical having to find places nearby , The hotel itself our room Executive Room and its history were incredible It was probably one of the nicest rooms I ve stayed in Very large clean and quiet rooms except for the church bell across the street which gave a nice atmosphere It is across the street and a ten minute walk through the gardens from Sch nbrunn Palace While it s very convenient for that it s about 15 20 minutes on the U Bahn from the city center I would go back to this hotel 
343040,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, No ramp for luggage in 4 hotel in Wien The tub didn t work the cleaning woman said that it s impossible to repair it s ok for the 2nights stay As the hotel is the old historical building consider you ll hear everything and everybody maybe it s just only in some parts of the hotel Anyway as we stayed just 2nights and we came Bach to the hotel just to sleep it was ok , The hotel s located next to the public transport and the zoopark Low price A very good breakfast with a huge variety of the excellent quality products and with the excellent service even if it s a bit overpriced 19 person I was with my 5yo child who was free of charge so I could consider the price of the breakfast as a 9 5 person In Any other bar in the city with the same quality quantity you ll pay much more They gave us the room earlier than the checking time The reseption staff one Spanish guy was very friendly and the girl who done a checkout on the 30th of dec was friendly Other guys at the desk were like a robot
343041,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The breakfast is very expensive and with the good alternatives close by the hotel does not encourage to have breakfast in the hotel, Very good location near to the underground station Room was good spacious and clean and sound proof 
343042,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, Dirty curtains but except this wonderful , It s like living in a Palace Executive room main building One of the best hotels I ve ever stayed High ceilings nice balcony view extremely spacious Design is amazing 
343043,Austria Trend Parkhotel Sch nbrunn Wien, The downside of the huge old style windows was that isolation is not good as expected so if you have a room facing Sch nbrunn you will hear everything that happens in the street like the tram the cars the Church which is close by etc which makes for a very early wakeup Also the isolation regarding temperature is not good standing next to the balcony with the doors closed you could still feel the breeze coming from under the door One other surprising aspect was the cleaning the cleaning ladies came did the cleaning but did not touch an empty bottle of Cola which was on the table for 3 days Also a blouse that was on a chair laid there for 3 days although it would have been a small effort to fold it and put it at least on the chair properly something you would expect from n hotel like this , Very nice hotel beautiful old style Viennese next door to Sch nbrunn and with a nice view of it from the window The room was nice high ceiling and huge windows nice big bed and furnished accordingly in the old Viennese style which fitted perfectly with the ambiance and the atmosphere Very close to subway with direct link to the center Karlsplatz Opera and easy also to find when coming going to the airport
