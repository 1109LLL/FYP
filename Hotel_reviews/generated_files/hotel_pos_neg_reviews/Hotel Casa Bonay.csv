332619,Hotel Casa Bonay, The interior of room was drab and uninteresting The lighting in the bathroom appalling It could be tweaked a little and be much more appealing , The bed the shower the fact that they always left fresh water The coffee shop restaurant and lounge area There s a delightful outdoor area on the roof for light meals and drinks The food in the restaurant and the roof is excellent 
332620,Hotel Casa Bonay, there for 10 days could have done with a bit of storage space limited bar food very expensive chiringito on roof lovely place but never a free seat closed sunday weds so be aware if you are there those nights last night up at 5 am for flight having had no sleep at all as they had filming in entrance huge lighting rig lots of noise especially when the crew were de rigging metal crates into a lorry , comfy bed nice bar lounge great shower
332621,Hotel Casa Bonay, There wasn t much space in the bathroom, The beds were amazing comfortable and the staff really helpful It was such a hip and trendy place we felt a bit old to be there but if I was 30 years younger I would move to Barcelona and never leave
332622,Hotel Casa Bonay, A few more toiletries would have been nice and my room looked straight into another room with no privacy, Very cool hotel with a hipster vibe Beautiful decor large working drinks space and the restaurants look great The room was really comfortable and clean and I loved my stay 
332623,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very small rooms with toilette and bath at the entrance This is a 3 hotel and not a 4 one And the price they charged was superb high compared to the quality of the hotel , staff was very friendly and helpful Roof tarrace was nice 
332624,Hotel Casa Bonay, The general facilities were not what I would expect from a hotel rated 4 stars , The breakfast was very tasty it had only fresh products I loved the fact that for breakfast they were serving specialty coffee from Satan s Corner The roof terrace is very nice and not busy The location is excellent it s located between 2 metro stops for different lines and within walking distance from Casa Batllo 
332625,Hotel Casa Bonay, First morning they have run out of eggs salmon cheese and multiple other items for breakfast by 11am breakfast is served till 12 This is not really acceptable for a four star property charging north of 200 for a night , Great place super friendly staff fluent in English Great location walking distance to most of the attractions and close to metro station Great restaurant nice roof terrace no swimming pool though 
332626,Hotel Casa Bonay, I had a 7 night stay and was put in a room where I had to keep the curtains closed all day as there was a walkway beside my window doors that let everyone see in as they walk past For a 7night stay this isn t fair And yes I raised it with staff on 3 different occasions to be told impossible to move rooms and just check each day or pay more for a better room how about you offer to let me know when an alternate room is available I m the guest customer not the source of all of your problems Problem was I had already paid a premium price for this hotel and was not happy to upgrade Also the housekeeping staff have no concept of noise Door slamming talking and excessive banging noises is not ok in a hotel like this And what type of hotel doesn t even have facial tissues in the bathroom Sorry to burst the bubble but I stay in hotels all around the world for work and at every point in my 7 days here I was constantly let down and disappointed at a stay that wasn t relaxing I gave the staff 3 chances to rectify and nothing happened not even my leaking toilet complaint for 3 days straight Sorry but the rooms are tiny and it s not as boutique as stated Just a lot of smoke and mirrors , The rooftop terrace is fantastic 
332627,Hotel Casa Bonay, Our room was extremely small and very badly designed function wise First if you hang your cloths on the hangers provided your clothes would drape over the kettle and wine glasses potential hazard Second there is no space to store 2 luggages and walk inside the room without hitting your leg on the sharp edge of the bed Third people on the corridor can look right into our room if we open the curtain there is no sheer curtain for privacy so we were forced to close the curtain and turn on the lights even daytime Fourth towel hanger is right by light switch by the entrance Gross Fifth there is no basic amenity provided such as shower cap or lotion In addition I didn t appreciate our hipster check in staff attitude He clearly informed us that your breakfast is not included in the room but you can have it We went to have breakfast and was hit with 38 Euro When questioned he said yes I told you can have it but I didn t tell you it was free In the end the other team member kindly took this off our bill , I like the location of the hotel Shopping area is within 10 15 mins walk of the hotel There are several very good restaurants nearby The restaurant bar at the hotel are very well designed and serve good food and drinks Nice rooftop bar 
332628,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The price was great and we loved the restaurants at the hotel The staff was very friendly and the rooms were modern and clean The air conditioner worked well Everything was perfect Thank you 
332629,Hotel Casa Bonay, Almost all the staff at the front desk were really excellent super sweet and helpful one lady was a little short with my questions, Loved the terrace in my room overlooking Gran Via and the private rooftop area
332630,Hotel Casa Bonay, Staff at the front desk weren t that helpful Room felt very generic for the cost Slowest elevator in the world , Good location close to shopping and interesting neighborhoods Roof deck and downstairs bar are both nice 
332631,Hotel Casa Bonay, Did not like the fact that there was no furniture apart from the bed and tiny bedside table in the room When we asked for a chair there was space enough for it we were told that the price we paid did not entitle us to a chair That s what a genius discount gets you here , The location is nice very close to a metro station and in a nice area of town 
332632,Hotel Casa Bonay, Parking options could have been better but not necessarily the fault of the hotel Had to park several blocks away for 60 overnight My rooms didn t come with breakfast I love breakfast , I loved the skyline view terrace I could have spent days up there I wished we d stayed longer and had a chance to try the onsite restaurants Satan s Coffee was great though Conveniently located for shopping and site seeing Booked two rooms Double Room was too cosy The Deluxe Double Room with city view was spacious and comfy Would book Deluxe Double again 
332633,Hotel Casa Bonay, Literally nothing , Perfect gem of a hotel Aesthetic like Ace Hotels but less pretentious more authentic and just better Great location room was super comfortable and staff was very helpful They even let me stash my rented bike in their storage room overnight Restaurant Libertine and coffee shop Satan s so good it was kinda hard to motivate myself to eat elsewhere Stay here You won t regret it 
332634,Hotel Casa Bonay, The price of the breakfast buffet Especially when its charged the same price for children , Everything The hotel is very newly made and its a design hotel Everything was so tastefull The personel was very helpfull the c ffee was the best in Barcelona so many choices in the breakfast buffet the bar in the entrance the rooftop bar We could spend the whole vacation without even going out if there was a pool 
332635,Hotel Casa Bonay, nothing, Book here if you appreciate quality service design styling good drinks and food Extra bonus the bed Staff speaks really good english Roof terrace is wonderful It s well situated too We love it all 
332636,Hotel Casa Bonay, The staff is horrible They were very rude most of the time They don t really care about the customers On my last day I asked for a cab to go to the airport The receptionist said she couldn t help me because there was customer on the line and told me to go outside and find one Even though I asked a few times She said she can t help me and completely ignored me afterwards , The hotel is very cool and hip The lobby and the restaurants are great 
332637,Hotel Casa Bonay, Satan s bar for breakfast only opens at 8 00 The rooftop bar is not an option for dinner as it seems to close early , Design and atmosphere are great overall Located in Central Barcelona with great restaurants nearby Second stay in this hotel Standard room was very quiet but lacking a view as it was facing the inside of the building Regular breakfast was great with Satan s bar being an option for those that are in a hurry after 8 00 AM 
332638,Hotel Casa Bonay, disappointing that the rooms and roof terrace are smaller than advertised depicted in wide angled photographs on Booking com in reality much smaller constricted, all great good vibe stylish communal feel
332639,Hotel Casa Bonay, The hotel is understaffed and so when we ordered some small plates at Libertine they took very long and we could tell it was not the fault of the staff there they were very apologetic it s more of an understaffing issue They were tasty despite their delay We were there for one night for my birthday and when we went up to the rooftop for drinks on the evening of our arrival we were told it was closed for a private event It was more than disappointing as we did not get to enjoy the rooftop at all while we were there The breakfast was another chaotic experience There were only 2 employees managing the breakfast bar one for the coffee and one for the food They both seemed frazzled running around We arrived more than an hour before it ended but the plate of pastries scrambled eggs and bacon dishes were empty When we enquired on when they would be refilled we were told the pastries would not be refilled but the eggs should be there in a few minutes I had been excited to try Satan corner s pastries so that was too bad It seemed like we weren t the only ones disappointed by the underwhelming breakfast Overall the breakfast was overpriced and not worth it I wish we had just gone somewhere else , Liked the ambiance of the hotel Very nicely decorated and staff was very friendly We were also able to check in early upon arrival 
332640,Hotel Casa Bonay, There was water in the room but it did not have a price so we thought it was no charge as some nice properties offer complimentary water if there is no price I am looking into this to see if this was an error or an accidental charge for something else The barista guy working coffee shop was unfriendly curt and not professional I was taken aback a little by this since the property is so nice and everybody else was so nice He was an angry hipster which has no place in the hospitality industry or a brand like this hotel , I loved the offering of restaurants lounge and rooftop choices There were little surprises throughout the property The room was well designed and mindful for the guest and I really enjoyed it 
332641,Hotel Casa Bonay, My only negative comment is there could have been more storage space for clothes etc , The beds and pillows were very comfortable The shower was awesome The location was perfect 
332642,Hotel Casa Bonay, Unfortunately cabs were on strike when we left But would have been helpful if they let us know before checkout We would have left earlier but they did give good directions to get the airport bus , The staff very friendly and helpful Husband had tooth problem while he did find a dentist they did offer an english speaking one as well Breakfast staff very helpful as well We would stay here again 
332643,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, We stayed here on the last day of our long Europe trip and it was definitely the perfect place to refresh and rejuvenate before the flight home Thanks Casa Bonay Love how good design and comfort comes together in your hotel 
332644,Hotel Casa Bonay, For the cost vs the value received I feel that there are better options This was a business trip with selected media and deliberately chose this hotel as it was ranked as one of the top boutique hotels in Barcelona however when you compared the average cost per night approx 300 per room w o breakfast and excl other charges I can t help but feel disappointed One of the rooms even got flooded with water after trying to take a shower The toiletries whilst nice were basic no hair conditioner nor body lotion was provided even after asking directly at reception The terrace which is supposed to be a nice area for guests to enjoy is closed during the week and there aren t any gym facilities Overall the rooms felt basic and to add to the disappointment there was a mistake and was charged incorrectly this was addressed when I arrived though Personally for the price paid I d rather stay somewhere else , The location is good I also liked the style of the hotel Nice dinning room area cool shop and coffee space Liked the branding and quality of some of the toiletries provided Also the staff is friendly and helpful Wifi is available at no extra charge 
332645,Hotel Casa Bonay, Wifi was not strong in the room the guys at reception are the soul of the hotel they should pay a little more attention on their recommendations and just have better energy the place deserves it The Chiringuito space at the rooftop looked great but it closed way to soon and would have liked to enjoy it a bit more but service closed at 7 00 pm The Housekeeping team where great and attentive , I had a good stay during my stay in Casa Bonay nice local design good comfortable rooms bar restaurant etc The location is great and I loved the design and spaces it is all thought through and you are able to feel this Great Duck dish at the asian Restaurant Thought the rooms would have a little more amenities as it is a 4 star property Enjoyed the morning coffee at Satan s the Chia Pudding was great as well as the Detox juices 
332646,Hotel Casa Bonay, nothing, great location about midway btwn sagrada and la rambla trendy hotel style with hipster lounge nice staff pretty room with comfortable beds and modern bathroom breakfast was really good all made with fresh and healthy products 
332647,Hotel Casa Bonay, I would have appreciated somewhat more info on the hotel upon arrival e g different restaurants rooftop bar and events , Very nicely decorated hotel that has a special vibe Friendly welcome and great service Offers different food alternatives Fast breakfast in Satan s bar with great music was very good Rooms are well appointed with mosaic tile floor It is located in a nice area close to shops and restaurants 
332648,Hotel Casa Bonay, We were on the second floor and the traffic was pretty loud if the window was open not the hotel s fault hell it s Barcelona you get acustomed to it after you are there a day , Very well situated in Barcelona Lovely little boutique hotel that has a wonderful feel to it Great design and comfortable Easy walking distance to all points of interest and restaurants The staff is excellent friendly helpful and always cheerful Great breakfast and outstanding coffee Very cool mix of people staying in the hotel On a personal note we returned home and I discovered that I could not find my iPod anywhere I contacted the hotel to inquire if the staff had found it after we left and sure enough they had it and would send it to me So great to see there are honest people in the world I can t say enough about how great our stay was at Casa Bonay We will definitely go back 
332649,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, This hotel is cosy full of character and originality with pride consideration and attention to detail in every element Great location right beside the metro with plenty within walking distance 
332650,Hotel Casa Bonay, Sharp corners on the raised bed have ankle scars for memories Eco friendly lighting not good for shaving or makeup, Staff were incredibly helpful mostly young and enthusiastic
332651,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, This is one of the best hotels I ve stayed in and I ve traveled around the world The people were amazing location perfect the atmosphere was just the right mix of hip and quirky Will definitely stay here again 
332652,Hotel Casa Bonay, Room floors tile and bathrooms weren t the cleanest there was hair and such when we first arrived Key cards started to stop working through our stay They promptly gave us new ones , Loved the design and look of Casa Bonay Beds were comfy and we had a great view Location was great We walked everywhere 
332653,Hotel Casa Bonay, The prices were high considering the hotel is basic and not luxury category hotel but I d stay there again, The moment you enter the door you feel transported to another world loved the vibe everyone that works there are helpful and chill and Seitan s coffee is on premise What more can you ask for Also LOCATION loved the area close to everything
332654,Hotel Casa Bonay, a small iron would be a big plus , We liked this hotel a lot The area around is just perfect for accessing the metro And the taxi prices from there to all the main places of interest are around 7 10 euros airport 30 euros And its very close to the big shopping street There are many nice restaurants around The reception staff speak very good english and are ready to help with all the questions u have There is a yoga matt in the room just in case u are up for some exercise we did not try breakfast as there are tons of options in the surroundings 
332655,Hotel Casa Bonay, The elevator needs to be a bit faster , The atmosphere is super nice since this hotel has really good design with trendy colors and plants Moreover it is located in city centre where you can go everywhere on foot 
332656,Hotel Casa Bonay, The bed was not very comfortable Price is a bit high for the services provided by the hotel , Staff was very welcoming and helpful The hotel is at a very good location The room was clean and big enough to accommodate 3 people 2 parents and a teenager Overall a recommended place to stay when traveling to Barcelona 
332657,Hotel Casa Bonay, For the price paid I expected a lot more nicer room professional staff that the rooftop cocktail bar would be open and that there would at least be some complementary coffee or tea in the room And not that we had to buy a bag of tea for 8 euros if we wanted tea in our room It did not help either 2 of staff at some point forgot to serve us our drinks in the lounge after asking 3 times Eventually we got our drinks for free but it still made us leave casa bonay not with the feeling of being a valued guest Should the price have not been so high I would ve had less of a problem with this I don t think we ll return , The building and location is good Libertine s living room style lounge is very comfortable 
332658,Hotel Casa Bonay, Short on coat hangers storage space No chair Kettle but no tea coffee etc Trendy tile floors felt grubby even when just cleaned Little natural light so dependent on artificial light with no bright dim facility , Bed comfy good size Staff friendly 
332659,Hotel Casa Bonay, Temperature was a little cool , Great location and fantastic coffee shop downstairs Good value for money spacious room good storage nice windows comfy bed 
332660,Hotel Casa Bonay, I was on the 3rd floor on the street side and it was a bit noisy sometimes Next time I would make sure to stay on the other side of the hotel , The interior of the hotel is amazing a mix of Scandinavian and mediterranean influences I especially loved the style of the bathroom and the huge shower cabine with rain shower head The staff were super nice Every day I asked for a tip for a new brunch place and every time it was amazing 
332661,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The service was excellent Rooms were comfortable The coffee shop at the property was very convenient especially if you re just after a light breakfast instead of their buffet breakfast Rooftop terrace was nice There was a bar serving good cocktails 
332662,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, I have nothing but love for Casa Bonay I visited with my mom for her birthday and the staff made our stay exceptional friendly warm and knowledgeable about Barcelona You will feel as though you are a local in this beautiful cozy hotel Can t wait to go back 
332663,Hotel Casa Bonay, Roof terrace bar not open And The Libertine closed early first night and closed for private events other nights Major shame as those were both key reasons for choosing Casa Bonay over other great hotels in the area Was told on arrival they must take full payment as a brand new policy that any charge over 500 must be paid in check in Not a problem but found it strange we were not notified of this ahead of time Blanket on bed a bit tatty Small room no chair Difficult as my husband had work to do and couldn t find a place to do it not even the bar lounge due to the private functions , Great Coffee Shop Mostly friendly staff 
332664,Hotel Casa Bonay, The Bar Diablo for breakfast was a waste of space with slow service and hard cakes but we should have gone to the Libertine anyway , The hotel design is interesting quirky and easy to like The Bar Libertine is brilliant for sitting for dining for ambience for breakfast young lively welcoming fun too 
332665,Hotel Casa Bonay, shame the rooftop bar wasn t open the breakfast was excellent but very pricey and the bar was dark which was a shame in such light airy hotel one of the reasons we booked was because we were arriving late sunday and wanted to eat in the hotel and not have to worry about going out to find a restaurant on our first night we didn t know till we got there that the restaurant was closed on sunday and monday , the light airy feel to the place the room was quiet and very comfortable ideal for more than a 1 night stay 
332666,Hotel Casa Bonay, The staff was extremely unfriendly super small rooms everything they wanted to have extra fees They wanted to charge the guests for already broken stuff I would NOT RECOMMEND the hotel to other guests ,No Positive
332667,Hotel Casa Bonay, There was nothing I disliked , Absolutely everything stayed for three nights at the end of March and loved the hotel the staff were so friendly and welcoming and the hotel was gorgeous couldn t recommend enough We have stayed in Barcelona a few times and this hotel was my definite favourite can t wait to return
332668,Hotel Casa Bonay, The P rooms don t have real external windows they are in a courtyard which means it is quiet at least but you can t open them for fresh air and they are not transparent So you kind of feel like you are in an enclosed box , Loved the building and the way they ve renovated it 
332669,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Our beds were really comfortable and our room had everything we could have needed Beautiful hotel in the perfect location Friendly staff and delicious food coffee fresh juices and natural wines We all loved Casa Bonay 
332670,Hotel Casa Bonay, Somewhere to put your luggage in the room, The restaurant and the very helpful staff at reception who managed despite adversity to post my passport to Madrid in 24 hours Eternally greatful to Daniel and Edu 
332671,Hotel Casa Bonay, When you arrive it is a little difficult to tell where to go to book in and the entrance is very unassuming Don t be disheartened Once in you will find very welcoming staff and a lovely individual hotel , Boutique and slightly quirky hotel yoga bag in our room Friendly and very helpful staff Breakfast was great with a good variety of fresh foods on the buffet and lovely local dishes to order alongside barista coffee Easy walking into the centre of the city and metro stops etc Would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others A perfect city getaway 
332672,Hotel Casa Bonay, Noisy doors closing limited soundproofing to adjoining rooms location useful but not amazing, Tremendously comfy bedding nice window view into a large courtyard great toiletries
332673,Hotel Casa Bonay, Not much space despite being superior room Paid a little extra Hardly anywhere to put clothes ok for just weekend but difficult for a whole week Husband would have liked some mainstream English language telly Suggest better clearer map and brief instructions for use of Underground would be helpful, Bed was excellent Staff very friendly and helpful Nice coffee bar for breakfast
332674,Hotel Casa Bonay, The hotel is at one of the biggest intersections in town and is located at one of the biggest avenues therefore the street facing rooms are extremely noisy despite the well implemented soundproofed windows The room was nicely designed but a bit basic especially compared to the other parts of the carefully designed hotel and furthermore it lacked basic amenities For example the floor has the nice original stone tiles which is authentic but a guest definitely needs slippers as the stone is cold all the time i was quite disappointed that we didnt get any There wasnt a chair neither in the room nor on the balcony the bathroom was a bit small and the tiles and the floor did seem a bit dirty It wasnt horrible but we expected a bit more attention in the rooms from this otherwise nicely designed place , We really liked the style and the design that has been carefully composed down to the last details from the original floor tiles to the locally designed textiles The staff was nice and helpful the breakfast was lovely with a great selection of various delicacies in the superstylish bar cafe lounge area Libertine We also tried some tapas at the bar which was similarly amazing Would recommend the place to design conscious young couples who like to chill out in a relaxed stylish environment 
332675,Hotel Casa Bonay, Fun hotel but no pictures or art work in rooms this is Barcelona right , Staff here are great have exactly the right approach to making it a good stay Location is excellent bar has nice vibe atmosphere plenty of choice in hotel of when and where to eat 
332676,Hotel Casa Bonay, Would have been nice to have some seating writing space in room but what was there very nice and modern great bed fresh cotton towels and sheets , Fantastic staff literally everyone one on the front desk fantastically helpful Did not have a room with a desk available so arrange for a patio table to be brought in to room And Libertine restaurant very understanding with mistimed conference call and when I went back in the evening food and service excellent 
332677,Hotel Casa Bonay, It was great and perfect except breakfast 18 euros breakfast even 9 years old children , It was great and perfect except breakfast 18 euros breakfast even 9 years old children 
332678,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing, Excellent hotel with perfect location and very polite and helpful staff everything you need is in the room tea coffee facilities tv bathroom amenities I did not take breakfast as there are a lot of good cafes nearby
332679,Hotel Casa Bonay, Wardrobe would have been good , Room lovely with lots of cute little touches Reception staff all very friendly and helpful Good location only a few minutes from the metro station 
332680,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, A fabulous hotel Fun unusual cool Staff great food and drink great Shower amazing and such a comfy bed Highly recommend if you want to stay somewhere different with character rather than a boring utilitarian chain 
332681,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing really , Great urban hip hotel recommended for all age groups and all kind of travellers leisure business Hotel staff were helpful and kind Absolute highlight was for us the rooftop garden and the hotel house bar 
332682,Hotel Casa Bonay, Price per room could be a little lower , Yeah Great Hotel Stuff is friendly and extremely help full Amazing patio bar restaurants with very good food drinks music and price Super location Beautiful comfortable beds clear room with small balcon super place to short meeting and before thank you and see you soon Karol 
332683,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very cold floors, Great location unusual design Our room was upgraded to one with large terrace and it felt like private house within the city centre Great personal 
332684,Hotel Casa Bonay, There is no coffee in the room from what I understand Maybe they are promoting their awesome coffee downstairs , Amazing value well I was there in winter so I don t know about their price in summer Great room room with patio would be amazing in summer Helpful Staff especially Danny who is the best at food and beverage guide Location close to metro and still quiet enough to sleep Facilities awesome bar and cafe downstairs highly recommend 
332685,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Everything was so fabulous It was a Zen like environment It was so quiet and peaceful My room was on a busy street and the windows where almost sound proof The staff was friendly and helpful I walked everywhere I went from this location It was in the middle of everything you would want to see in Barcelona 
332686,Hotel Casa Bonay, Liked everything , We stayed at Casa Bonay for two nights 7 9th of February as we were celebrating 1 year together me my gf There are no words to describe this place what should i mention So welcoming so friendly so laid back so well designed and so laid back The staff all offered us a bottle of Champagne as a gift for our special day with a lovely note Location wise is great as is next to Tetuan Metro station 30 seconds walk while you can access and spot in Barcelona simply by walking Great Roof terrace as well with stunning views Satan s cafe within the hotel was lovely as well as the very chilled lobby of Casa bonay Not over exaggerating at all That s the truth You guys made our trip Viva Catalu a Friendly regards Themistoklis Ella
332687,Hotel Casa Bonay, The drain of the shower room is not well designed That is to say you should carefully control the water volume when take shower , The hotel is very closed to Tetan station of metro line 2 It is also closed to the Chinese community where you can find good and cheap Chinese restraurants a big supermarket and everything you need 
332688,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing in my experience was bad I started my stay in a small but nevertheless perfect courtyard room then changed to a larger one once my partner joined People who like a little more space might opt for one of the larger type rooms , I loved the concept and care that was obviously put in this hotel The building is beautiful as is the character pure delightful mediterranean design of the rooms The beds were very comfortable as were the rain showers and I appreciated the well stocked minibar and tray of local sweets I loved the options to eat great food work and relax in either the coffee bar the bohemian lounge bar or restaurant All staff was helpful professional and enthusiast Location was very convenient too for a walk downtown to from the Aerobus local buses or underground and restaurants nearby Lovely Would definitely come here again Not your average 4 star hotel 
332689,Hotel Casa Bonay, Doors to toilet and bathroom can t be locked, Quiet location very helpful staff spacious room triple room with city view wheelchair friendly rooftop terrace offers great view short walk to Tetuan station about 15mins walk to Pla a Catalunya
332690,Hotel Casa Bonay, Complimentary products in mini bar way too pricey exaggerated prices there is a tea kettle but no teas they have to be purchased bed big and comfortable but blanket so thin also bed sheets just folded on general blanket which is used by everyone , Very hipster hotel friendly staff lovely interior designed with taste fantastic patio with shower outside for the summer the Libertine lounge and Satan s coffee nice places good location
332691,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The staff were helpful and friendly from the start The hotel was nicely located only a short walk to areas of interest It was nicely decorated and very comfortable a mixture of new and old features A cool selection of tempting treats from the mini bar The bus tours are a good way to see the city We crammed as much in as possible but still feel we would have plenty more to explore if we went back where we would be happy to stay at Casa Bonay again 
332692,Hotel Casa Bonay, The road in front of the hotel were busy until late at night and not really quiet Our room was on the 1st floor so maybe upper stories would be better , Nice atmosphere Great location Staffs were all kind and friendly 
332693,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The bed was comfortable the shower was great the location was excellent Walking distance from a lot of great things Staff was friendly and helpful It was obviously independently run and had a hip vibe 
332694,Hotel Casa Bonay, More UK TV channels Coffee in bedroom Few more coat hangers , Loved the atmosphere location staff and cleanliness of the hotel Breakfast was lovely and shower amazing The building is beautiful and room was peaceful plenty of towels and comfy beds 
332695,Hotel Casa Bonay, Need to have coffee in the room I don t always want to go downstairs to get it , The coffee in Satan s coffee shop is excellent Also the breakfast was great especially the fruit and omlette The bar staff were great the old fashioned was off menu but they accommodated is with no fuss 
332696,Hotel Casa Bonay, Elevators couldn t handle the people Little pricey as the rooms are not large , It s different to most hotels Great staff good English And the breakfast was not a buffet but you could just order what you want Nice lobby bar alive Fast Internet Netflix is provided 
332697,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very soft bed and pillows No mattress protector The coverlet was not clean No wastebasket in the toilet , Very helpfull and nice staff Cleaning is every day good service 
332698,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very limited equipment No wardrobes no where to have your clothes fine if you spend 1 or 2 nights No cream no slipper no cotton swab , The style the created atmosphere and the very friendly personnel 
332699,Hotel Casa Bonay, The hotel is sadly let down by bad housekeeping For example the hand soap was not replaced the floor towel for the bathroom was also not replaced a couple of times and no replacement bag in the bathroom bin one day The complimentary water also was not replaced after I drank it on the first night just an empty bottle left and the cups I used for tea were left at the mini bar dirty The safe also had problems on the last night I m 100 sure I had the code right although one of the guys at the reception came and sorted this out immediately but said there might have been some problem with the circuit The air con would just not get the temperature right and if I didn t open the window during the night the room could get stuffy and dusty Also the woollen bed cover had seen better days Finally I doubt the floor was ever mopped the same long hairs were on the floor throughout my stay As I said in my positive remarks Casa Bonay is a beautiful place and the staff are lovely but there is definitely a need to pay more attention on these details Once they re addressed Casa Bonay could go from being a good experience which it was to a terrific one , Beautiful design Great little cafe at the front Gorgeous building Very good location 15 minute walk from Placa Catalunya Enthusiastic amicable staff Very quiet room 
332700,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The bed was super comfy Having a hairdryer there was convenient and I enjoyed using the locally made shower gel and soap It was nice to have a decent quality TV in the room The staff were very pleasant and I would definitely consider staying again should I visit Barcelona 
332701,Hotel Casa Bonay, El Chiringuito rooftop terrace was closed It s only open seasonally , Room was spacious yet cozy Courtyard room was quiet despite the hotel being located on a busy street Great combination of cafe bar and restaurant on the ground floor Inspiring space 
332702,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing to complain Service in restaurant could be improved And guys at reception could be a little more vigilant , Concept and interior design are well thought through and appealing 
332703,Hotel Casa Bonay, No real negatives It is about 15 20 min walk to El Born one of my favorite neighborhoods The neighborhood immediately surrounding the hotel has a lot of great outlet shopping clothing shoes accessories The neighborhood is quiet at night if you want to be right in the thick of it you might want to stay somewhere else I really liked the fact that the room was quiet and it s a only a 15 min walk to a lot of nightlife , I absolutely loved my room It felt like a private retreat I had one of the rooms with a private terrace looking into the courtyards of the surrounding buildings I felt immersed in a Barcelona neighborhood The terrace and sitting room were a perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing and re energize for a night of tapas tasting a bar hopping Loved everything about my room including the yoga kit I felt completely comfortable staying there alone The hotel staff are really nice Also they have live music and DJs in the bar at night so be sure to plan to spend one night at the hotel 
332704,Hotel Casa Bonay, We preferred the poble sec area of Barcelona so if you want to explore this part of town it s not the place Other than that , Foliage in the entrance and courtyard was beautiful Love the idea of collaborating with local artists Hand painted signs The bed and covers pillows were amazing Staff in the bar and on the front desk very attentive Great spot to hang out in Barcelona and to visit sagrada familia Recommendations for eating and drinking spots were also excellent We stayed on Halloween and there was an ace party in the bar downstairs which was a great way to end our trip 
332705,Hotel Casa Bonay, No body cream conditioner or shower cap in the room No price lists for mini bar or menu for room service , Hip hotel Super lovely hipster staff Instagram friendly Great for teens If you like Ace Hotels you ll love it 
332706,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing really If you are looking for a boutique hotel in Barcelona with a good atmosphere I d recommend it , Modern hotel with cool vibe Nice room overlooking the street Friendly helpful staff We were there one night before a cruise 20 to cruise terminal 
332707,Hotel Casa Bonay, You have to keep windows closed as directly to Main Street saying that once closed no noise detectable , Convenient located modern little room that allows comfortable stay close to everything you want to explore for a short Barcelona trip
332708,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very expensive for the quality of the hotel Can t imagine how this would be a 4 stars hotel The entrance is very weird No taxi station and taxis are not easy to get there No shops around If you are in a business trip it is not at all a presentable hotel At night lot of noise from the street Bath room very small No place to put your clothes Didn t dare trying the restaurants in the hotel There is an electric kettle but no packets of tea or coffee or sugar offered , The guys at the reception were very nice Room is clean Bus station just in front of the hotel 
332709,Hotel Casa Bonay, Noise from the street at night from room facing the road Service food at breakfast and Rooftop restaurant was disappointing , Huge bed great pillows good shower Styling of the room was very cool Aircon worked well In room safe and mini bar Staff at check in were friendly Coffee bar downstairs was great 
332710,Hotel Casa Bonay, Glass wall to WC bathroom not liked in such a tiny room Nicely designed apart from this but better suited for single rather than double, Lovely finish and nice terrace in beautifully restored building
332711,Hotel Casa Bonay, Wifi was a bit patchy Only worked by the door in my room and in certain parts of the lobby area If they could squeeze in a pool on the roof it would be perfect , Extremely beautiful room Delicious mini bar treats Cool film selection very comfortable bed Friendly service great breakfast Not least important on site coffee shop serving coffee that rivals some of the best spots in Paris Loved it will definitely be back 
332712,Hotel Casa Bonay, I would have liked to eat my breakfast out in the roofterrace The brakfast room lounch was quite dark , Breakfast was delicious very good It was really worth of the price 
332713,Hotel Casa Bonay, The AC in our room was broken It only turned on once during our stay so we had to open the windows We were on the 4th floor so we got the full effect of the patrons on the rooftop bar Hard to tell paying patrons to silence their conversations when it s nice outside and they re enkoyjng themselves They were also painting or doing some work across from us so it reeked of paint thinner , Soft sheets same ones they sold in lobby The bar and the coffee shop downstairs made if convenient for a coffee on the go or a glass of wine while relaxing The staff was very friendly and accommodating 
332714,Hotel Casa Bonay, The window blinds do not allow a complete darkness in the room But thats obviously only a detail , Great design and warm hospitality by Daniel and the whole team This place deserves Boutique And the minibar offer ist the most creative seen so far in my travelling experience 
332715,Hotel Casa Bonay, As I said the hotel is very new and normal processes aren t very smooth yet The hotel is located next to a very noisy street and it s impossible to open the window or sleep without earplugs There was an incident one night we stayed here that came with whole police brigade and firemen 30 or more people in our hallway that made a lot of noise We called the reception and asked around but there was no explanation or apology given Pretty underwhelming The restaurant within the building has awful service and is overpriced , It seems like this place is pretty new and so is the decor and the general furniture We liked the design a lot especially in the lobby There s some good thinking and design guidelines there that make the hotel enjoyable The breakfast is menu style and quite nice 
332716,Hotel Casa Bonay, Wifi connections were difficult to establish for some devices My room opened onto a sunny glass roof stylish internal walkway but had only a frosted glass panel non openable facing the walkway So no natural air nor outside view No seating nor desk nor cupboard in the room but coffee bar substituted for the former Asked for a second blanket as reliance on air conditioning resulted in a temperature drop in the early hours , Stylish staff helpful well located 5 minutes cab from Placa Catalunya near two metro stops breakfast in large coffee bar with comfortable couches proper cappuccino and listenable music Spacious room walk in shower with good pressure Effective air conditioning Room I had was very quiet in fact silent at night Would ask for street facing room next time and risk some noise see above 
332717,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, omg you know what the front desk officer is so handsome and the facility in this hotel is so comphenient and supermarket shopping mall and wonderful chinese restaurant and charming bar is just nearby the efficiency it can offer is why I recomended it to you what is more the front dest handsome boys they are always so nice and so good in English which is very friendly to us Asian tourists 
332718,Hotel Casa Bonay, Breakfast was a bit of a weird menu , Great staff and really cool hotel in a lovely old building Excellent location within walking or riding distance to everything 
332719,Hotel Casa Bonay, The pictures at bookings shows balcony and outdoor shower that is only in the more expensive rooms that I didn t realize until checkin , Really comfortable bed Nice restaurants and good location as I don t like to stay in the worst tourist areas but liked that we could walk there 
332720,Hotel Casa Bonay, Free water wasn t replaced in the rooms whereas all the paid for mini bar items were, Amazing hotel really stylish with a lovely roof terrace A great find as it is still fairly new and so unique compared to other hotels in the city which have a business like feel Most importantly the bed and shower were incredible best I ve experienced in any hotel Wish I could have taken the pillows home 
332721,Hotel Casa Bonay, Rooms can be a bit tight Wish they had conditioner in the shower and lotion in the bathroom , Really comfortable beds and bedding Some staff seemed stand offish but I realized it s because they may not be proficient in English Other staff was very helpful and friendly ordering cabs and making reservations for us The two restaurants downstairs and the rooftop bar were really great and convenient Also loved Satans coffee shop for the daily coffee Their mini bar is stocked with thoughtful things and is pretty reasonable The location is more quiet and residential which was perfect It s about 10 15 mins walk or 3 4 euros 5 min cab to Sagrada Familia Casa Batllo and Casa Mila 
332722,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing, This hotel ticked every box for me It s located within walking distance from transport restaurants and shopping The staff particularly in reception were professional friendly and more than happy to offer their local knowledge to assist guests during their stay The building has been restored with a balance of old and modern fittings The room design and attention to detail is what makes this hotel stand out from the rest 
332723,Hotel Casa Bonay, Our room was on the P floor and had no window therefore no light and fresh air Additionally the subway was running just underneath the room which was a bit disturbing , The atmosphere of this hotel is great the staff is super nice the breakfast is not the usual boring hotel buffet breakfast 
332724,Hotel Casa Bonay, Use of terrace at any time would be good Very noisy for one of our rooms constant banging from building next door , Staff very obliging allowed use of room until flight later that day ordered taxis good advice on how to get around etc 
332725,Hotel Casa Bonay, They sometimes ran out of iron boards which was slightly inconvenient at times , Comfy beds excellent showers great coffee shop bar restaurant and roof top Very friendly and accommodating staff Spent two weeks in the hotel and have seen the triple room superior double small room with terrace and the patio room with private shower All are excellent but the small room with terrace and private patio are extra special 
332726,Hotel Casa Bonay, There s a little hassle with the air con that wouldn t turn on as the sensor wouldn t work properly but worked in the end Not overly happy but the breakfast wished I had more option , The hotel was nicely designed they pay attention to every details possible The staff was amazing and very helpful do seek advice for places to go The location was really close to the public transportation and some attractions are in walking distance The roof top bar is great Lunch pho at the restaurant is wonderful 
332727,Hotel Casa Bonay, The breakfast is incredibly poor No buffet and a cappuccino or an expresso is not included as well Avoid to pay for such thing an go out for breakfast , Very good Hotel very nice and helpful staff beautiful room very cosy and comfortable bed 
332728,Hotel Casa Bonay, I had a burger from the cafe downstairs which came raw but I wasn t offered a refund That said the sub businesses downstairs Libertine Satan s coffee Elephant Crocodile Monkey are top quality excellent places to eat and it s very handy having them on site , Really cool hotel great vibe well styled beautiful rooms truly lovely soap shampoo products comfortable beds and the outdoor showers are a great touch 
332729,Hotel Casa Bonay, Thing which we missed was chair in a room The night before we left did stop to work aircondition Cold water changed to hot one in the bathroom sometimes , Double room with street view is simple but spacious with quite wide bed and quite spacious bathroom Location is great for city exploration Main sights are in a walking distance Staff was friendly and helpful
332730,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing , We spent the better part of our honeymoon in Barcelona at Casa Bonay and loved staying there It s well located near the metro the bed was the most comfortable bed we stayed in in Europe and the overall design hip We loved the shower and visiting the roof top terrace along with the bar and coffee shop both located on the campus of the hotel The mini bar snacks were also really great and not too badly priced so we tried a few when we didn t feel like running to the mercat When we checked out we found out that it was only 5 months old and were so surprised Everything went so smoothly that we thought it had been around longer 
332731,Hotel Casa Bonay, Lack of privacy in rooms ending in 7 With natural light in you are very overlooked , Loved the tilings bathrooms bed TV location and downstairs cafe restaurant The tourist map was really good and individual 
332732,Hotel Casa Bonay, For us room size storage space was fine but quite minimal so maybe not for everyone Would be nice to get a complimentary bottle of water everyday but can be bought chilled around the corner for 50 cents so not a big issue , Great location airconditioning and ventilator nice shower requested and received early check inn style of the hotel and relaxed atmosphere friendly staff
332733,Hotel Casa Bonay, We stayed for two nights one at the beginning of our cruise and one at the end The first night we informed the staff that we would only need a room for 2 people on our return after the cruise We were told that we were all set After our second night stay we were billed the full amount for three people and were told that we should have changed our reservations through the agency in which we booked and that we had to pay the full amount This was NOT a great way to end our vacation being overcharged for our room because we were not informed about the policy , The location was fabulous as it was in the center of the city and the staff was extremely helpful 
332734,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Bed was really comfortable and the room was clean The location was convenient and just a short walk walking distance from most of ye main attractions The restaurant and bars connected to tbe hotel were vibrant 
332735,Hotel Casa Bonay, The breakfast menu wasn t so good and could have catered for the international crowd a little better however the food was of good quality Perhaps next time we stay we will head out for breakfast , The room were very comfortable mattress was great shower was powerful All the small details full size mirror great hair dryer good iron The feel and decor are a perfect match to the age of the building Great location a very special little hotel 
332736,Hotel Casa Bonay, Wifi didn t always work in common areas like the bar and cafe , Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful Rooms were great came with really comfortable beds and amazing showers Location made it easy to get around the city 
332737,Hotel Casa Bonay, Haven t stayed in too many hotels in Europe so I don t know if it was a good bang for our buck, The hotel had a cool vibe a little hip for us but I could see how people would enjoy it 
332738,Hotel Casa Bonay, Storage in room a little lacking Would have been nice to have place to stow luggage , Loved the hip vibe and location We had a room with terrace which gave us a nice bit of extra space Comfortable bed Hotel served as meet up place for larger group of friends the lounge was a huge hit Car rental and subway just a block away 
332739,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Personal treated us so kind and warm from the first day that we entered till the last day we checked out Hotel is so clean and deserves every single peny that they took from us Ideal for a families with a little child 
332740,Hotel Casa Bonay, The room lacked any hard surface to put things down as there was no dresser or shelf even in the bathroom not even a place to hang a towel It was part of the very sleek modern design which was beautiful but not so functional I wound up living out of my suitcase which is fine but even my toiletries Fix this and you have one great hotel , Location was outstanding and the hotel was lovely 
332741,Hotel Casa Bonay, I think English of receptionists and overall customer service can be improved , Nice place with atmosphere and style Ok location lots of historical buildings nearby 
332742,Hotel Casa Bonay, There were no tissues in the room , Visited for a four night stay The staff were so friendly genuine and passionate about the hotel The bed was very comfortable and the shower brilliant Our balcony room was comfortably sized with an interesting take on clothes storage which really worked The balcony was lovely for coffee in the morning The bar is elegant with friendly bar staff who really know how to make a cocktail There was a lovely informal terrace bar on the roof which was a great place for a night cap We will definitely be returning 
332743,Hotel Casa Bonay, The room had windows to a corridor so it was not possible to open it without being seen Teh room had a raw facility to place the hangers but it was loose and it did not look as if holding ten hangers with clothing so we opted not to use it much That was not convenient since that was the only place for hangers in the room We did not like the bathroom open concept either the toilet seat seems to be in what may have been a closet although it has a door and acceptable space It is separated from the room in which the shower and the sink are located and which has no door , Very welcoming and professional staff Very close to major historical squares and to the subway Nice rooms and hotel The shower space is perfect There is a rooftop in the hotel 
332744,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The local artisinal products were great Bedroom design was simple and refreshing Most importantly the bed was fantastic Extra comfy felt like I was sleeping at home 
332745,Hotel Casa Bonay, When check in the receptionist did not let me feel welcome without smile but when check out another receptionist was quite helpful and smile all the time The bin in the room is quite small , Good Location Simple and comfortable decorating style 
332746,Hotel Casa Bonay, Only 2 English channels One was the news a the other was odd A couple more for when your having breakfast or getting ready please, Everything location look of the hotel bar coffee shop staff friendly Clean and comfortable Normal full size hairdryer great shower and air con Choice of snacks and drinks inside the room
332747,Hotel Casa Bonay, The room didn t seem cleaned when we arrived we found a pair of old socks and some rubbish on the floor We didn t have a Do not disturb sign and one of the staff members walked on my boyfriend naked The toilet has a sliding door instead of a normal one which is not very romantic when you re traveling with your boyfriend Plus it lets all the funny smell go in the room The staff was not that friendly as most of the reviews on Booking com say The hotel is overpriced for what it offers , The idea of the hotel
332748,Hotel Casa Bonay, Everything was excellent , Helpful and pleasant staff and knowledgeable about local transport to attractions Spotlessly clean Brilliant location Good showers nice toiletries and hairdryer Modern decoration with unique and quirky features Good air conditioning Excellent restaurants within the courtyard Satan s cafe below with amazing breakfast coffee scones and cinnamon buns 
332749,Hotel Casa Bonay, Weak wifi reception but manageable Parking is expensive in the area I hated the coffee in the caf that was off the lobby too exotic spicy I just wanted a coffee and they didn t even have tea only some sort of spiced chai Too hip for me and my wife I guess, Nice boutique hotel nice bar restaurant and caf off the lobby good shower good location
332750,Hotel Casa Bonay, Breakfast included is 16 which is rather expensive A la carte is cheaper and better , Nice style and atmosphere friendly people A mistake on the invoice was fixed very quickly 
332751,Hotel Casa Bonay, When the roof terrace is in full swing I imagine it will be amazing but unfortunately the bar wasn t open for our stay , Casa Bonay is probably one of Barcelona s trendiest new hotels bringing together some of the greatest companies to produce a collaborative barcelon s masterpiece Libertine in partnership with Satan s Coffee Corner serves one of the most unique breakfasts I have had all accompanied with undoubtedly the best coffee in the city It exudes laid back Barcelona lifestyle with bespoke attention to detail 
332752,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, This is very modern hotel the actual room is a lot better than the picture Big room with comfortable beds and wifi is automatically connecting once you re in the hotel 
332753,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The interiors of the hotel room decoration and attention to small details makes it very unique Special highlight for me is the coffee shop with brew bar It s not the usual hotel Staff is very young and friendly 
332754,Hotel Casa Bonay, the smell and the blue carpet in the corridor overpriced breakfast in the restaurant we didn t try the cafe no luggage rack provided travel light if u choose it no side table or chairs in the room or bath room some might like it as it leaves more room though a metro station Tetuan is a few steps away it takes one stop to the Main Street Passeig de Gr cia and it could take a while to wait for the train grandma just too lazy to take metro , beautiful mosaic floor in the room the reason why I chose it in the first place street view from the room our room on 2F with a city view huge shower room comfort bed 24 hours grocery stores nearby the staff s service style is different but they definitely extended helping hands when we called for help 
332755,Hotel Casa Bonay, More luggage space required put some teaspoons out with the tea making faculties one breakfast time was high disorganised so we went out for breakfast instead , Liked the young staff who were mostly very enthusiastic 
332756,Hotel Casa Bonay, More choice at breakfast as the price is quite high could have also some simple options like just egg and toast Also need maybe more than one chef at the breakfast had to wait long although we really appreciated cooked on order idea, The staff is great genuinely friendly and helpful The rooms and common areas super clean and fresh Soundproof windows once you open the balcony doors it s very noisy as the hotel is located at busy road but the glazing literally blocks out all the noise Breakfast unusual but really good flavours super healthy
332757,Hotel Casa Bonay, On the last day we were woken up by incredibly loud drilling which was taking place in the building directly next door The hotel managers were aware and expected it to happen they were apologetic but a warning in advance would have been helpful , Amazing hotel friendly staff great food great price 
332758,Hotel Casa Bonay, Mini bar and drinks in the bar were too expensive , We booked a room with a terrace and loved sitting outside in the morning It was a very quiet and comfortable hotel Will definitely return 
332759,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, A great place near the heart of Barcelona Subway 5 minutos away walking Great room and shower Everybody was very helpful there Was perfect for our stay during Primavera Sound 
332760,Hotel Casa Bonay, I think there is not enough space for clothes if the stay is longer I was there only for two days and it was fine but if it was longer , The staff the overall style and the breakfast 
332761,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, All of the staff in the hotel bar and restaurants are welcoming and very professional Our room was great comfortable best bed on our 2 week holiday clean and loved the options in the minibar Location is just great and all BCN sights are easily accessible 
332762,Hotel Casa Bonay, I think the hotel is still quite new They have great plans for a rooftop area for yoga and other cool stuff but its still work in progress We could hear drilling works going on in the morning and this affected our sleep The hotel mentioned it was from their neighbour , This place screams hipster heaven The cafe serves great coffee not your typical Spanish coffee served almost everywhere else The rooms are pretty minimal much like a hipster cafe The staff are great too They speak really good english and are pretty helpful As this was our 2nd time back in Barcelona we didn t mind staying further away from the hustle and bustle of either La Rambla Placa Catalunya or Passeig de Gracia 
332763,Hotel Casa Bonay, Building works next door were very noisy especially early morning but I was out the door early most mornings so ok Would have been great to have some more food options at Satan coffee in the morning , Design details were beautiful bedding was extremely comfortable custom blankets were a beautiful finishing touch public areas were spot on room was bright and airy and amenities were great Location of hotel was easy accessible overall great hotel experience
332764,Hotel Casa Bonay, Everything was lovely Only gripe I have was them charging 8 for tea in the minibar Surely for the price of the room you should get a cup of tea coffee in your room included The kettle in the room was almost like a taunt Or perhaps consider giving a discount for hotel guests in the coffee shop downstairs Was otherwise very clean comfortable and well designed ,No Positive
332765,Hotel Casa Bonay, Unfortunately my friend forgot his computer and passport in the safe I called Bonay immediately on the train to Madrid two hours later They told me they will send a local currier and I will receive it the next morning It didn t arrive next morning I email them 2pm by that time I already missed my pre book ticket to Prado Museum and they THEN replied they didn t send out my things previous night it would be nice if you can tell me so I won t wasted a morning waiting in Madrid they had just send out my things 2pm and it should arrive more or less in 5 hours 7pm now it s 9pm in Madrid and I m still waiting for that computer and passport , It s a design hotel in a prime location that s near everything but not too touristy in the same time 
332766,Hotel Casa Bonay, Maybe a pair of slippers for the room in winter as the floor in the room is tiled and a bit cold , The Libertines bar is wonderful beaituful unique textile and wallpaper Breakfast is incredible 
332767,Hotel Casa Bonay, The hotel would benefit from some signage on the main street Had it not been for our taxi driver we may have been searching for the hotel for quite a while , The location was within walking distance to the Plaza Catalunya the main meeting place in Barcelona and the many restaurants of Las Ramblas 
332768,Hotel Casa Bonay, The hotel was pretty noisy Bring earplugs and you ll be fine Would have been nice to have a wider selection of breakfast in the caf downstairs , The hotel doesn t serve breakfast but has an own caf with high quality coffee and vegetarian food There is also a Vietnamese restaurant that seems to belong to the hotel nearby 
332769,Hotel Casa Bonay, Very noisy room We were on the 1st floor and could hear everything from the bar downstairs , Nice location a short walk away from Plaza Catalunya Room itself was comfortable nice living space 
332770,Hotel Casa Bonay, Not a great place for older people as it s quite noisy with the bar and restaurants underneath but still great place for young people , Very cool hotel in a great neighborhood for bars and restaurants Loved the simplicity of the hotel 
332771,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing, The ambiance and attentive staff were really great The place had a good vibe and although only 3m old it was working well and the mix of hotel coffee bar was relaxed and open The room was not the largest but sufficient and the yoga mat was appreciated The shower was lovely very roomy Everything was of a high standard and the breakfasts especially were a delight As a vegetarian I was spoilt 
332772,Hotel Casa Bonay, No provision of an iron and ironing board in the room, The location is brilliant with Placa Catalunya just 7 mins walk away and Tetuan metro 1 minute away The staff were fantastic and could not be more helpful The bar is superb as is the cafe both being incredibly stylish and chic Unfortunately did not get a chance to eat in the restaurant but looked very nice We loved the styling of the hotel with its modern retro feel Rooms were fantastically clean and you could tell there had been real thought put into what is important to a guest staying there Little details like the quality of hairdryer in the rooms standard of TV quality of products in the minibar and standard of bed and pillows All presented in a quirky stylish was the hotel oosed class 
332773,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Seriously comfy bed Great location most things walkable in 20 minutes Metro Station across the road Very helpful staff Clean room Brilliant shower 
332774,Hotel Casa Bonay, We were woken up each morning by the cleaner on the roof terrace and then construction from next door The hotel has focussed too much on the design and not enough on the practicalities there s not enough space to hang your clothes or for two suitcases , The beds were the most comfortable I ve ever slept on The shower was great too Great location 
332775,Hotel Casa Bonay, Little privacy as toilet was in a cupboard Could have been a cupboard for clothes in stead , Good bed Great location Nice staff Nice breakfast in the restaurant located near reception

332783,Hotel Casa Bonay, Not well signed so difficult to find initially Would be really useful to have a little information pack in the room with breakfast times menus phone number for reception etc You get told a lot on check in but it s hard to remember everything after a days travelling , Staff were really friendly and helpful The room was clean and comfortable and I really liked the interior design We stayed in a small double room with terrace which looked out the back of the hotel but it was nice and quiet and got lots of sun until late afternoon The safe worked and the fire alarm behaved itself The location was great You re within walking distance to La Segrada Familiar and Passeig de Gracia we hardly had to use the metro

332794,Hotel Casa Bonay, Maybe needs a bigger sign out of the front with the hotel name on it Although the taxis can find easily , The location is excellant for all site seeing and for buses and the train station The staff could not do more for you and the hotel is worth everyone one of its 4 stars It s great to see so many of the old features have been left and incorporated into the new The bed was so comfortable it was a joy to fall into after a hard days shopping and sightseein I loved the size of the shower and having 2 different shower heads was something that you don t find everywhere We stayed in room 304 The whole concept of having a fantastic restaurant real coffee shop a real teashop and a really relaxing bar all working together in one location is brilliant Elephant crocodile monkey is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a meal that is tasty completely different well cooked and beautifully presented The staff are so well informed about all the dishes and the fact that they use as many local produce and suppliers as possible is a big plus on my part Satans coffee is coffee as it should be full of flavor and lots of choice the homemade cakes etc are worth forgetting the diet it is worth paying the extra and having the breakfast The choice that you get is very good and completely different You can have hot or cold with good choice of each what more can I say Book it and see for yourself 
332795,Hotel Casa Bonay, Booking com had changed our booking from a room with a balcony to one without no notice and no amendment to cost though Would have changed booking had we known safe did not work staff said they fixed it while we were out but hadn t so just lady it no time for such hassle on a short break requested early arrival but room not ready until 3pm so had to hang around for almost 3 hours , Location was great
332796,Hotel Casa Bonay, Breakfast wasn t to our tastes think they are trying too hard in this area and just keep it simple , Comfy bed room cleaned every dat fresh towels etc Very trendy place to stay and good location Reception staff very helpful 
332797,Hotel Casa Bonay, There aren t any wardrobes or shelves in the room just a few hangers We couldn t unpack and had to leave all our clothes in the luggages folded We stayed there for 2 nights and the alarm of the hotel went off during the night many times 8 times between 3 4 am the fist night and twice around 5 am the second night When we called the front desk they said that everything was under control First day the cleaning lady entered the room without knocking the door while I was changing my clothes With a small scream she shot the door back Half an hour later I heard the same thing happening with the next door neighbour The bar was poor and either they didn t have some spirits or it took 10 minutes to find where they put the bottles The floors are stone tiles so don t forget to take slippers with you This was one of the wost 4 star hotel experiences , Good location clean room
332798,Hotel Casa Bonay, Minor things need open trash bucket beside bed and small face washcloths plus bar soap not pump liquids, Helpful English speaking staff wonderful Breakfast
332799,Hotel Casa Bonay, This hotel would have been perfect if there was a gym as well , Location can t be any better Great breakfast options against very fair pricing Quiet and nicely decorated rooms Look no further

332803,Hotel Casa Bonay, Still cleaning rooms well into afternoon and cleaning staff too evident even interrupting our siesta time Cool lounge and caf area expensive plenty of cheaper shops in neighbourhood No baths exist in hotel only showers Breakfast not included in upmarket price, Interesting lobby Convenient location for transport and architectural visits The best showers Renovated 1900s architectural details and tasteful decoration
332804,Hotel Casa Bonay, I have no complaints , Amazing hotel run by amazing people Thank you for a wonderful stay Everything from the staff the service the facilities the rooms and the location was just amazing BIG recommendations and I will definitely be back 
332805,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, What is special about Casa Bonay it is the special feeling you get from the first step you put in You feel like in an other epoch It is more than a great 4 hotel because it allows you to feel home at the same time The building itself is beautiful and recently renewed Rooms are clean comfortable with a minimal design decor and beautiful tiles floor I loved the bath necessaries with a very special graphic image If I have to find something to say it is about the roll curtains not always easy to manage and a missing chair especially if you spend more days in the room All the related place to eat drinks are great for the design colors atmosphere music Totally in love with the lobby where you can have a good drinks or glass of wine enjoying evening or afternoon Love the printed shirts corner near the reception The whole concept of Casa Bonay it is simply great Not last all the staff is young efficient always ready to help I would definitely recommend this place 
332806,Hotel Casa Bonay, The WiFi could have been better and construction is still going on in the hotel in spots , The room was gorgeous and the staff was really friendly and helpful
332807,Hotel Casa Bonay, Restaurant was expensive at 60eu a head but delicious , Contemporary and trendy Comfy bed and room fresh and clean Great shower Good choice of places to eat caf bar and restaurant all in the same building 
332808,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, We loved the style of the hotel the staff and the comfort The staff were very welcoming and attended to our every need Our room was lovely and quiet with a little balcony with a gorgeous view Would definitely stay again 
332809,Hotel Casa Bonay, Unfortunately the breakfast was a bit of a disaster It took absolutely ages and when it came it was disappointing considering the price The quality of ingredients were clearly good but it was over priced , The rooms were lovely clean airy great tiles massive shower cubicle and the bed was super super comfy 
332810,Hotel Casa Bonay, Late night room service and an ironing board in the rooms would have been great , The general vibe wifi cleanliness the location and service of staff were second to none Sagrada Familia Casa Battlo and La Rambla were all within 20 min walk 
332811,Hotel Casa Bonay, The elevator was broken in our last day , The bed was very comfortable staff was very helpful and nice Everything was great I would recommed this hotel highly 
332812,Hotel Casa Bonay, price could be cheaper better view from balcony I was expecting to feel more deluxe difference , helpful staff excellent location very clean room super wifi 
332813,Hotel Casa Bonay, Personally I prefer individual toiletries to the large containers of shampoo and body wash providers It had separate toilet and bathroom and I prefer combined but some will prefer separate Air extractor in toilet didn t see to be active , Different style of healthy breakfast were a real treat For once we stayed at a coffee with excellent coffee Indeed as good coffee as the best coffee shops because they had one as part of the hotel It was also a top juice shop The restaurant was also innovative both in a top quality Vietnamese offering during the day and an innovative fusion offering in the evening It was top class food at a reasonable price Bedroom was not ostentatious but comfortable We had a very small lounge through sliding doors from the bedroom The bed was very comfortable Brilliantly sited for the Sagrada Familia in one direction and La Pedera in another Also right next to Metro for longer journeys Wifi excellent and there was a safe provided Also a kettle for cups of tea No shortage of other excellent restaurants of every type and price within minutes 
332814,Hotel Casa Bonay, An earlier check in time would be very helpful With the ceramic flooring in hallways and rooms it gets to be quite noisy throughout the night as tourists are coming and going Earplugs helped Seeing the image of the hotel online we were able to find it however there is no visible name plate outside to help identify the entrance Complementary tea or coffee would be a nice touch seeing that a kettle is provided in the room , Staff was welcoming and helpful The location is central close to the airport shuttle stop metro and city landmarks Room was very clean and although it was facing the boulevard window soundproofing cut off most vehicular noise Nice minimalist decor 
332815,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The staff were excellent Friendly and helpful to someone with no Spanish apart from hello and thank you Room clean bed comfortable and shower superb Room was also quiet and warm Also loved the soap and shampoo 
332816,Hotel Casa Bonay, Our room was small and the window looked in a corridor So it was really dark , The hotel is in a good spot The metro is just 2 minutes away The lobby is quite stylish Breakfast was interesting You could choose between 3 options One of which was bread with goate cheese salmon red whine seriously and some onion jam I must say I tried it but didn t like it Even though they were so friendly and made us a plate with things we could eat So lovely Our room was small and the window looked in a corridor So it was really dark But everything was very clean und comfy 
332817,Hotel Casa Bonay, Room had a rail for hanging clothes rather than a wardrobe Was no problem for me but I was there on my own and only for a few days , I stayed as a solo female traveller and I found the hotel really matched my needs There are 2 excellent restarants sharing the same building space which meant that I did not have to worry about walking back to the hotel alone late at night Staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel has lots of style and personality definitely for guests who do not want to stay in a faceless hotel Shower superb and bed very comfortable 
332818,Hotel Casa Bonay, There are better options nearer to the attractions and better cost to Does not feel like a 4star hotel but since its new it is clean , Location not that great from attractions Beach and Gaudi not are more than 2kms away Even La Rambas is walkable but lil far New hotel so though rooms are clean no carpet in the rooms which makes them cold at night Bang on the road but well insulated windows make sure no sound come in 
332819,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Everything i would expect from a great hotel comfy bed friendly staff stylish interior great location good wifi And of course stunning bar restaurant downstairs 
332820,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, Thoughtfully designed rooms and public spaces very comfortable enthusiastic staff great location It is a brand new hotel and there is still some ongoing construction of some rooms but rooms were perfectly soundproofed and not interruption at all from any of that Very cool place to stay in a great city with many good choices 
332821,Hotel Casa Bonay, Nothing, A very stylish hotel with lots of great touches in the communal areas and the room The breakfast was also first class and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful 
332822,Hotel Casa Bonay, Parties in the lobby until 3am rooms seem soundproof but you can still hear a lot of noise Room comfort is a bit poor for the price no storage space no bathroom intimacy Cleaning services could be improved mini bar never got replenished in 4 days some dirty sheets were left in the room Shampoo is very harsh and there is no confitioner, Decoration ambiance is very hip nice great lobby bar Location is central Loved the patio for the superior rooms on the P floor
332823,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, The beautifully restored old building contrasted with a modern Barcelona aesthetic the restaurants cafes and bars connected to the hotel offering convenient eating and drinking options the hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times 
332824,Hotel Casa Bonay, There was no way to regulate the fan in our room so it was either high speed or keeping it switched off Also other than the bed we had no other sitting space not sure if this is how most European hotels work , The location the hotel is situated in a lovely part of the city and is well connected and close to most places we wanted to visit The breakfasts were fabulous and the staff is very friendly 
332825,Hotel Casa Bonay, I know Barcelona cafes are cheap but it is always nice to be able to make a coffee in one s hotel room No normal tea or any sort of coffee here and despite the advertising pics the kettle is just to make minibar drinks which honestly are an extortionate price The in hotel culinary facilities are also quite pricey more affordable but still very high quality options are within a stone s throw of the building i e right next door , Clean hotel friendly front of house staff and excellent bed Very strong wifi nice terrace all in a lovely part of town within easy walking distance of the city centre Sagrada Familia and the beach I would happily return at the right price I love this area Eixample 
332826,Hotel Casa Bonay, We had problems with our plugs which didn t work properly and there wasn t much storage in the room , Great very friendly staff The Libertine bar is beautiful and the food is so unusual and delicious Really unusual and great value

332828,Hotel Casa Bonay, There could be more vegetarian vegan options at the restaurant , Super comfortable beds and the perfect shower I didn t want to get out of it The coffee shop attached has the most delicious owner sourced coffee There wasn t much I didn t like 
332829,Hotel Casa Bonay, We thought the small double room was too small 13 sqm its good only for those who wish to use the room for nothing but sleeping , the hotel is in a very good location staff is very helpful and friendly the room is minimal in its content but exactly what you need to relax Bed and pillows SUPERB 
332830,Hotel Casa Bonay, As such the hotel is still brand new so some corners and edges are still being refined and the occasional construction worker is seen in the elevator But despite this the service and ambience are already 5 Make sure to clarify the breakfast price in advance some of the breakfast options hold an extra fee even if your room rate has breakfast included , Loved our weekend getaway in this superbly designed boutique hotel The staff was super friendly and warm and shared excellent recommendations for restaurants super insights on where locals go The highlight of our stay was the breakfast excellent a la carte choice of delightful local and international dishes and some much appreciated healthy options besides beautiful buttery croissants Very sweet personal touch with candles for a birthday breakfast 
332831,Hotel Casa Bonay, Breakfast service was a little confusing and slow Coffee is a priority in the morning Staff although helpful lack some knowledge of the area which would have been helpful on arrival , We had a beautiful room with a really comfortable bed great shower good mini bar and even a yoga mat Staff were very friendly and the hotel is a great location walking distance to main areas tube and a great beer bar is just 3mins walk away 
332832,Hotel Casa Bonay,No Negative, We loved our stay in Casa Bonay from the first Minute All the staff we met were exceptionally friendly our room was beautiful with a view over Barcelona roofs and the sun shining onto our bed in the morning The Hotel bar is incredibly classy with an amazing choice of beers and very comfortable Sofas They even have their own brand of Soap and Shampoos which smell delicious the hair dryer was very powerful It is only a couple of meters from the Metro and in Walking distance from the beach the centre and the Gaudi house I would come back anytime 
332833,Hotel Casa Bonay, There is no sign for Casa Bonay outside the building , I like staff specifically mr Danial Location center quiet Very clean and comfortable bed Nice coffee shop High speed Internet
332834,Hotel Casa Bonay, The pillows are Spanish bolster style which are not comfortable if you are used to big square pilllows , We loved this hotel A brand new conversion of a 19th century building it combines beautiful old features such as tiled floors and high ceilings with the very best in modern design The rooms are simple and uncluttered which combined with a restful colour scheme of dark blue and ecru and the serenity of a central tiled courtyard creates an oasis of calm in the centre of Barcelona We particularly enjoyed relaxing in the comfortable little seating area in our room lounging on our patio and observing the hipsters of Barcelona in the cocktail bar The young staff are very friendly and helpful even contacting us to say we had left a hairbrush behind in our room Highly recommended we hope to return
