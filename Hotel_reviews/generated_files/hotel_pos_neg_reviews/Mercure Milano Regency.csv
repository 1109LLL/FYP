475384,Mercure Milano Regency, I liked everything and it was only 1 2 hour from the center of the city so was really good for everything wasn t anything I didn t like , I only had 1 breakfast but my son had4 and he enjoyed the breakfast every morning The bed was very comfortable and though the trams ran till late when the window was shut you could still go to sleep quite easily and they didn t wake you when they started up at 5 in the morning It was easy traveling into the city by bus tram or train Very quick and interesting traveling all different ways 
475385,Mercure Milano Regency, Dark rooms not enough light next to the bed Not much space in the rooms not enough plugs around to charge pc and phone Very bad breakfast got a rotten boiled egg which suggests that food is cooked and stored away for a while The shuttle service is very expensive The fitness center has 4 broken machinery and mismatching dumb bells, The staff is friendly the bed is comfortable the bathrooms are great and the area is quiet The restaurant in front is great called Sa Mesa
