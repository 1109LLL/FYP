127037,Park Grand Paddington Court, I should have checked and there was porter service but would have appreciated an elevator rather than carrying a large case up two flights of stairs Our room was very comfortable but very small and the bed was built into a corner which made getting in and out a bit of a challenge , Very good location good value for money
127038,Park Grand Paddington Court, We were shown a new room that was a vast improvement and had clearly just been refurbished The first problem with the room was that there was no fire escape which was made worse by the fact that we discovered on returning to the room that there was no window either , The staff did try to help when the first room they showed us was in the basement with a jammed window and a door handle that came off in your hand

127045,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our first room was a cramped basement room for over 200 night The staff quickly moved us the next morning when we asked for a change calling it an upgrade Upon arrival late at night we found it hard to understand the accents of the desk clerks Some staff were very new and not yet very knowledgeable , Short walk to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express London Underground Kensington Gardens Plenty of services in the neighborhood restaurants markets haircuts Great sleeping comfortable bed and pillows dark room quiet Fresh hot and cold breakfast with ample choices and good service Responsive staff

127052,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room too small to turn in TV would not switch off Lighting so fidgety it took 5 min to sort out each time Staff member could not locate my bags in storage facility and I had to go down and find them myself which took 20 mins and made me late for meeting that had to be cancelled Although fixtures and fittings OK there is a cheapness about the hotel one half eaten complementary biscuit was left in room no new ones provided , Only the location 
127053,Park Grand Paddington Court, We had breakfast one day and didn t like the food very much Restaurant and bar area are very basic Price was too high more of a 3 star rather then 4 Closest tube station was 15 mins walk away Not ideal with luggage, Location is very close to Hyde park which was perfect for us because attending British summertime The room was newly refurbished and nice modern and clean but small

127056,Park Grand Paddington Court, The hotel had overbooked some rooms Thankfully ours had been reserved Many people were complaining as they were left with no room The rooms were small and the air con was freezing as we didn t know how to switch off , Location was excellent we were within walking distance of Hyde Park which is why I chose the hotel 
127057,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room size Customer Service and all above , When we arrived to check in we were told our booking had been cancelled no one notified us of this prior to our stay we had just travelled for 9 hours to get there the situation did get resolved eventually but the reception staff were unhelpful unfriendly and very unsympathetic even though we hadn t done anything wrong except turn up for our confirmed reservation I even rang a couple of days prior to arrival to confirm out reservation and yet it was still cancelled without our knowledge They said our credit card had been declined when they tried to authorise it which was utter rubbish our credit card is fine in fact we used it to pay when we were eventually ALLOWED to check in We were then allocated the smallest room know to man there literally was not enough room to turn around even though we had booked a deluxe room if that was deluxe I would hate to see a standard room We were so weary from travelling and so relieved that at least we had somewhere to sleep that night that we said nothing and went about our trip Its fair to say we will not be staying at this hotel again or booking through booking com as I simply don t trust the process 
127058,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room too small like pigeon hall with no space for one piece of luggage one trainee reception staff have no clue in checking inn and out no lifts in the building, Clean and newly refurbished

127063,Park Grand Paddington Court, Beware tiny rooms Booked Deluxe Double but was initially given a compact double where you couldn t even walk around one side of the bed After complaining and having to show my booking com confirmation they upgraded to a slightly bigger room but under no circumstances wouldl I describe it as a deluxe ,No Positive
127064,Park Grand Paddington Court, Improve entrance, entrance doesn t look that good but rooms are cool and service is good and serious for a reasonable price and good location near Paddington
127065,Park Grand Paddington Court, The waiting times to check in and out due to inexperienced trainee staff one of which completely ignored my wishes and in doing so overcharged me for our room It certainly put a dampener on our weekend to start off with being overcharged by 160 , One particular member of staff Alice was really helpful in sorting out a problem I had with the hotel to do with the payment of the room She really saved this trip for us Also the rooms were really modern and stylish 
127066,Park Grand Paddington Court, Everything was fantastic, From the minute we got there to the minute we left we received 1st class service Brilliant staff brilliant accomodation facilities location We will definetely be back Fatima was just the best upgraded our room to the club room as it was our wedding anniversary room decorated and cake left in our room

127071,Park Grand Paddington Court, Check in was a nightmare queuing out the door in a hot reception area complaints people asking to see the manager reception under pressure but no apologies for delays You need photo ID to check in too which takes extra time , Room was compact but perfect for one night
127072,Park Grand Paddington Court, We had deluxe room Really quite tight to manoeuvre in but as we really were only needing it to sleep and shower in it was fine Others had compact double very compact Really not much room for the proverbial cat to be honest , Most importantly food at breakfast was hot Lovely bacon not too fatty Beds really comfy we slept very well
127073,Park Grand Paddington Court, The front desk was rude and seemed to think of you as an inconvenience when asking questions or to book a taxi in advance Upon check in there was confusion on what rooom we were being put into and the front desk scolded one another We had a toilet that was running in our room that took quite awhile for maintenance to fix as well as a window we could not close that took maintenance 4 hours to come help The windows were left open by the maids The maids woke us up each morning wanting to clean , The breakfadt staff and doormen were very polite and hwlpful The maids did a nice job but were banhing on the door at around 8 30 each morning to clean If breakfast doesnt end until 1030 then cleaning should not start until then 
127074,Park Grand Paddington Court, Would be nice to have shelves in the closet for jeans and t shirts , Great location of the hotel About 5 7 minutes walk from Paddington There are also tube and bus station just in 10 min walk from the hotel Stuff was very polite and helpful They were happy to help with any request Room is 100 like on the photos and there is quite enough space for one person I have single deluxe room Bed was very comfortable there were a complimentary water fruits and tea coffe in the room Everything was clean and fresh Breakfast is a little bit expencive but it s tasty with traditional choice of English breakfast food eggs bacon fruits meat fish croissants and etc I really like staying here and would highly recommend this hotel for staying in London 
127075,Park Grand Paddington Court, Wish there were more counter space at the sink in the bathroom but bathroom is limited Also the mini refrigerator really need to calibrate those to stay cold It kept our food at room temperature The room itself was colder than the refrigerator We could have left our food out and the A C on , My room was very nice roomy could walk around with ease Happy that we could control the thermostat Very Quiet Slept very well The bed and the pillows were great Plenty of lighting options And two windows Nice decor and very clean It was a little bit of a walk for those of us who are used to driving everywhere but the access to the tube was very easy very direct There are also some nice restaurants in the area a Chinese restaurant right around the corner and Bizarro Italian restaurant up the same street about a block 
127076,Park Grand Paddington Court, We ve stayed at this hotel several times and the size of the room varies booked a deluxe double but in reviewing the website were clearly given a compact double which didn t even have room to open one suitcase except on the bed much less two However when we questioned the booking based on past experience we were moved to a larger space , Very friendly and helpful staff

127079,Park Grand Paddington Court, Aircon didn t work properly I booked a delux double room was told i was upgraded to club room which was across the road the room was so small there was hardly room for 2 suitcases Also difficult to get out of one side of the bed because of lack of space between bed and wall , location was close to Paddington Hesthrow express 
127080,Park Grand Paddington Court, Padington is pretty far from Piccadilly Circus and the main attractions so if you don t like having to ride the tube it does not suit Other than that it was a nice stay, Small comfortable room not too far from padington station bike rental directly outside 
127081,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room was much much smaller than expected even considering we were small sized Kept bumping around the corners and each other , Very clean very professional staff bed was decent 
127082,Park Grand Paddington Court, Without exaggeration I didn t think a hotel could ever create a room smaller than a cruise ship but the rooms are incredibly small A double bed is smaller than a US Full size and there is only room to walk up to the bed on one side Although the finishes are new and luxurious I ve had more room to move about when tent camping Only one small stool to sit on and no place for suitcases We were tripping into each other during our entire stay The bathrooms were modern and recently remodeled with high end finishes but so small that actually hard to use both the toilet and the shower Also the drains did not work properly in both rooms we had so sinks and shower filled up during use Our first room was on the Third floor which is actually 4 flights up with NO Elevator The staff was very accommodating to give us a room accessible by elevator on the second day This was the most expensive hotel of our European vacation far exceeding Madrid Barcelona and Ireland in price It s a very old building which has been re done as a hotel The location was pretty good and London hotels are very expensive Just be aware of the pros and cons before booking READ other reviews and when they say SMALL rooms know that they are tiny , The staff was helpful and courteous We asked to change rooms after the first sleepless night and they were very accommodating The front dest and bell staff were all very helpful with the room and finding local directions etc The location is good being about 4 blocks away from the Italian Gardens section of Hyde Park It s a good hike to the Marble Arch 
127083,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rooms 7 8 are to be avoided regular auto closing of the adjacent corridor door through the night was very annoying especially at 04 30 why are these people not asleep , Very handy for Paddington very comfortable and excellent breakfast buffet 
127084,Park Grand Paddington Court, Bed was a little bit small my husband is tall and the room was tiny , The service is just wow Very nice personnel very helpful We were with the baby and they really made our stay nice 
127085,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room was billed as a deluxe twin room picture alongside description looked fine that was not what we got This room should have been a single beds were head to head zero room to walk or open suitcase it really was disgraceful When asked about the description hotel staff said that deluxe means the same as standard are you kidding 400 00 for 2 nites felt as though we were taken advantage of we explained that this was misrepresentation they offered us a 15 per cent discount we said that we would rather write and warn people unless they change the description then they told us it was what booking com wrote not the hotel s description Well where did booking com get the room description They did offer to change our room after we had figured out how to place things in the room we were too tired after traveling all day to do that for just another nite I would never book with them again EVER ,No Positive

127089,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The facilities within the room made it even more welcoming for example the microwave fridge and tele made evenings even better Also the breakfast in the morning was lovely and there was a variety of food to choose from 
127090,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was tiny The double bed was only just big enough for 2 adults The room was not what was shown on the pictures Be warned there are 3 other hotels with the same name all within 5 minutes of each other so not knowing the area was very difficult to find the right one , The room was clean with air conditioning and the staff were friendly 
127091,Park Grand Paddington Court, Like most hotels in London if the room was bigger it would have been appreciated , I like a hotel which is quiet and central to all amenities which this hotel is 
127092,Park Grand Paddington Court, Wasn t able to check in until half 10 at night due to the room not being ready before 2 did ring to ask for early check in but option wasn t available and arrangements to watch a show that lasted until 10 from 2 The room was a little on the small side and the bed would ve benefited from being a little bit bigger , The service from staff was great Welcome drink on arrival help with luggage The chance to leave bags at the hotel due to room not being ready was helpful 
127093,Park Grand Paddington Court, Was invisible and anonymous at check out with a robot staff more interested in getting me my paperwork and on to whatever Not a smile a word whether I enjoyed my stay needed a taxi What a major disappointment and a sour way to end an otherwise pleasant stay and good staff It made me reconsider returning next visit this fall and next spring Truly needs staff training , Updated electronic room access with an input panel meeting all digital needs every staff member acknowledged you each time drinks delivered with a napkin arranged as a flower shower mat arranged as a fancy bow small attention to detail Breakfast offering was well done 
127094,Park Grand Paddington Court, What was called Deluxe Single Room ended up being the smallest 1 by 1 meter room I have every experienced in my life Adding the bonus on top of that the room was also right next to the toilets Really deluxe experience I must say , Very good and central location

127098,Park Grand Paddington Court, When I checked in my room I found the bottle water was already opened by somebody and the trash bin was already filled with trash It means the room was not cleaned after previous guest checked out , The location was good just a few minutes walk from Paddington station 
127099,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The English breakfast is delicious It s in a great location short walk to Hyde Park bus and subway stations as well as restaurants and souvenirs shops The hotel even offers a complementary phone that you can use to make local and international calls from and you can use the Google Maps app for directions It was very useful 
127100,Park Grand Paddington Court, I would have possibly tried the restaurant if there was a menu option for children there may well have been an option if I had asked but looking at the menu in our guest book I didn t get the impression there was something for children, I enjoyed the whole experience of the visit from arriving the staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was beautiful and was better than I had imagined It had everything we needed and more It was a compact room and was indeed compact but it was perfect for 2 of us Every member of staff I came across throughout the stay always made an effort to say hello and asked if we needed anything The hotel was spotless and couldn t find any fault what so ever

127103,Park Grand Paddington Court, The double bed Mattress was fine but the size was a little uncomfortable , The room was very comfortable although very small barely enough room to open two suitcases Given that it is in London we didn t expect much larger The quality of the facilities in the room were exceptional Very new and very up to date We were impressed

127109,Park Grand Paddington Court, I was in a twin room as I had a guest staying on my second night the room was cramped no room to put anything the wallpaper was coming away from the wall and the bathroom ceiling could do with a lick of paint ,No Positive
127110,Park Grand Paddington Court, It was like faulty towers checking in after we were bumped from other property A lot of agency staff who do not know what they are doing, Alissa in the breakfast restaurant was fantastic Took ownership of our unhappy experiences and did her best to make our stay a positive experience 
127111,Park Grand Paddington Court, Staff spoke broken Englishwhixh caused confusion but were very polite We could ve stayed for the same period for 70 less by booking on the day which would have included breakfast which we went without as a result When we asked reception staff to match the up to date offer on booking com they refused, Very clean and well presented
127112,Park Grand Paddington Court, The images of the rooms on the internet did not match with reality I paid 145 for a tiny room in the basement which had an unpleasant smell masked by air freshener or cleaning agent When I expressed my disappointment I was later handed a letter of apology and four pieces of fruit by way of compensation This was wholly inadequate As a frequent visitor to London I shall never stay in your hotel again and will not recommend it either ,No Positive
127113,Park Grand Paddington Court, I didn t find anything about this hotel that I didn t like It s even got electronic do not disturbed a door bell and a bell for maid service , I always choose a hotel in the Paddington area and will definitely stay in this hotel on my return trips
127114,Park Grand Paddington Court, On arrival I was allocated a basement room which I did not like OK for a night or two but not for a 24 day stay After three nights I requested a move and was quickly accommodated in a top floor room with a view and wonderful daylight My delight at this move completely overshadowed any disappointment I may had at the beginning and I can only compliment the reception staff for their fantastic response and understanding , Excellent location pleasant and extremely obliging staff comfortable and clean room with tea and coffee making facility and ample supplies of tea coffee and milk replenished on a daily basis good food in the breakfast room and from the bar menu As a distinct plus a number of staff went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating all of which added to a sense of warm welcome I had a club room larger than the average room containing a small fridge and microwave both of which were great for the occasional self catering Altogether a happy and memorable stay 
127115,Park Grand Paddington Court, Although the room was beautifully furnished it was in the basement so I will request a different room location in future , I liked the room size and furnishing I liked that it was an easy stroll to Hyde Park I liked that the front office and Concierge staff were so happy and helpful 
127116,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bedroom could have ben a liitle bigger , From the moment we crossed the threshold the staff couldn t do enough to make our stay as good as it could be 
127117,Park Grand Paddington Court, Front dest clerks didn t all seem to know what they were doing They could not make our reservation I had to do it myself thru bookings com , Breakfast was great Close to station

127119,Park Grand Paddington Court, I booked a deluxe room and i have been given room number 118 It was not even standard room it was like a store in the building Second day i complain about it and then they gave a deluxe room , Rooms and toilet were clean and nice A bit small that was good room compare to others in London Breakfast was good Hotel location is good close to paddington train station The Italian lady at the recaption was very helpful and nice

127121,Park Grand Paddington Court, I knew I had booked a compact double but thought that referred to the room not the bed itself The bed was tiny and my husband and I ended up sleeping top to tail in order to have enough room The room was so tiny that the bed was up against the wall window meaning you have to climb over one another to get in and out There was a loose mattress topper and sheet on the bed so as you turned over it all bunched up and the bed appeared to be on a slope or the mattress was worn Basically very uncomfortable The curtains were set into the window at the top but we re longer than the window so hung at an angle This sounds like a picky criticism but when the bed is right up against this window it means that the early morning light shines right in your eyes as you try to sleep And just a really little thing that doesn t really matter but just seems wrong biscuits fruit and water in the room on the first day only Why I paid the same amount each night , Perfect location very easy walk from Paddington The hotel was clean nice toiletries Air conditioning was vital and much appreciated 
127122,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Hotel Staff was very nice The staff at reception even made a courtesy call to my room to check if everything was fine or if need anything The room though the size was relatively small guess that is the same in most of the London hotels was very nicely done The interiors were just perfect 
127123,Park Grand Paddington Court, there are some noise from the cleaning staff also my room was close to the staff room and I can hear the door opining and closing all day also I ask for extending my staying for few more hours than the checking time they accept for two hours only and they charge me 20 pounds for each its much higher than the usual rate since other hotels charge 20 for four hours such as a very close and nice hotel near by called Mercure hyde park hotel also there is a staff lady at the reception I really hate her attitude she was really rude I am not sure about her name either Marlien or Daniel , the room was nice in size and decoration also they upgrade the room for me and provide me with some Complimentary such as water wine fruit and flowers
127124,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Great staff Always helpful Room clean well appointed and bed comfortable Very close to Paddington rail station and walking distance to hyde park Good choice of resturants nearby I would certainly choose to stay here again 
127125,Park Grand Paddington Court, Very small rooms to reach my room I needed to climb up and down totally 5 floors I never get used to the fact that in London you get double price for every desired level of comfort e g get 50 of comfort available for you budget in every other European city, Perfect location for those travelers who reach the London from Heatrow airport by express just 8 min walking distance from Paddington station 10 min from tube station and 5 min from Hyde park my favorite place in London 
127126,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room is small but it s typical for London We never took breakfast in the hotel a because nice places with good English or whichever breakfast are in walking distance and at a more reasonable price b the place for breakfasts and a bar and a part of a hallway all in one had bad ventilation and always was full of smells It was neither good for the guests passing by to the elevators nor for the guests having breakfast , Convenient location pretty clean and welcoming staff Paddington station is in around 10 minutes walk close to the Hyde park 2 tube stations from Notting Hill Gate which can be reached by feet as well if you like to walk 
127127,Park Grand Paddington Court, Full size bed was tucked up at the window tight maneuvering Nice clean room though , Very convenient to train and easy to walk to parks Room is a little small but great location 
127128,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was VERY small It was difficult to move around , The staff was very nice and helping and there were several minor little treats that made our stay more comfortable The bathroom and shower had a quite decent size 
127129,Park Grand Paddington Court, Loved everything about the location hotel staff We were booked into Irwin apartments in Notting hill but fled the next morning after an extremely disappointing stay Paddington was booked we were lucky to get such s beautiful hotel on short notice Staff were kind attentive to us as I was traumatised by the previous accomodation that I had booked through booking com , Professional welcoming staff Facility extremely clean welcoming staff always attentivel 
127130,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room is small There is no drinking water There is no soundproofing There is no slipper the view room price, The staff treated was very nice cell phone
127131,Park Grand Paddington Court, I was disappointed with the size of the room given that it was supposed to be a deluxe double room Luckily we were only staying overnight I wouldn t have liked to have been staying for longer with such limited space We also thought there was a restaurant at the Hotel It was pouring with rain and we didn t really want to venture out The receptionist recommended a good Italian restaurant within walking distance but she did not encourage us to eat at the Hotel Bar , Hotel room was clean and comfortable 
127132,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was a little smaller than I m used to No makeup mirror in bathroom , The hotel is within a reasonable walking distance from both the Paddington train tube stations Everyone there were helpful wonderful I would definitely stay there again 
127133,Park Grand Paddington Court, Breakfast was not good Do not pay the 12 for breakfast It is so not worth it And Very poor The room was super tiny for the price that we paid for it was definitively not worth it Value for money was not good The bed was along side 3 walls no space to move around had to jump in and out of bed and try not to wake up my husband as I was trying to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night Just know that everything was so compact in that room Even the bathroom if you re doing anything you re grazing the walls so very very uncomfortable Location was ok walking distance from paddigton station which was the only good thing about this hotel Also the staff at the reception were so rude Unfriendly and not accommodating at all Which you wouldn t expect this from a 4star hotel I don t know if the receptionist was having a bad day but we have never been checked in with such unfriendliness Also it does not mention that the the rooms are in another building just annoying than anything else I will definitively not be coming back here Only if you find an amazing deal You should book here and not expect anything nice But if you can t find a better deal at this hotel my advise book somewhere else , wifi was working
127134,Park Grand Paddington Court, my room was small but this is because the price was low so no complaint at all It was big enough for the one night but for two nights would have been difficult No shelf in shower room , nice poached eggs at breakfast Comfortable stay Plenty of power sockets in room Easy to get to by bus and tube Price
127135,Park Grand Paddington Court, I cannot rate the hotel only the room allocated which was across the street in a building being renovated and in a quasi basement There was a loose 3 pin euro electric socket a sash window that would only open with difficulty then fall down the shower assembly coming away from the wall an unsafe desk chair inner door so badly hung it could never close etc etc More 2 than 4 , The location Close to Paddington main line and underground stations Plenty of cafe s and restaurants in the area 
127136,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Great hotel with very nice and helpful people We had a upgrade from our room at the checkin The room was very good Nice beds great badroom and everything was clean 
127137,Park Grand Paddington Court, I did find the room temperature was cold im always cold and found the heating wasn t working Only in the bathroom , Park Grand is an awesome hotel The staff are super helpful and welcoming The location is amazing as well A short walk to Kensington Park also very close to the underground which will get you to wherever you need to get in London We had a lovely stay The rooms are cosy and perfect as a base My favourite feature of the room was definitely the heated floor in the bathroom The room is also very clean We will definitely book at the Park Grand again on our next trip to London 
127138,Park Grand Paddington Court, Lots of construction noise Very loud rowdy guest shouting screaming till at least 2 45 am The rooms where we were put outside hotel didn t feel safe , Excellent friendly staff
127139,Park Grand Paddington Court, We paid 108 for one night which was listed as half price We certainly wouldn t have paid full price for the room we had Hard pillows Bar only serves bottled beer which was redicuously expensive even by London standards , Clean and tidy Nice bathroom Ok for one night Close to Paddington station which was why we chose it 
127140,Park Grand Paddington Court, Just the bathrooms were very small , I would like to mention the staff were very friendly and very helpful The rooms were very clean indeed the shower facilities were excellent and very clean
127141,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing everything was excellent , The staff was great really welcoming and couldn t do enough for you the rooms were so clean and welcoming Would definitely stay here again on my next visit to London Highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
127142,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was one of the smallest we have ever stayed in really not enough room for 2 small suitcases , A short walk from Paddington Station pleasant older hotel Heated floor in bathroom was a nice bonus Nice to have a mini fridge in the room 
127143,Park Grand Paddington Court, Wifi was not working properly and no mobile signal in the building Beds particularly the pillows were extremely uncomfortable The property was being refurbished at the time and the work extremely noisy started at 8am every day Not a relaxing or pleasant experience,No Positive
127144,Park Grand Paddington Court, The rooms are so small it s insulting and not a fair trade to the amount I spent on them The add on booking com was very misleading and unfair to my perspective , Nice staff
127145,Park Grand Paddington Court, Lots of puzzling stairs very very narrow hallways just like in a small plane economy class cabin I almost tripped at one landing due to loose carpet Horrible mattress which was pretty sunk already and gave me a back pain afterwards Flying insects in the room , Location close to public transport and shops 
127146,Park Grand Paddington Court, The rooms are noisy they have ancient windows that have not been refurbished they do not seal and have single glazing It s a pretty glaring oversight and really ruins an otherwise positive experience ,No Positive

127148,Park Grand Paddington Court, Tiny room quite a few stairs despite the lift , Excellent breakfast Helpful staff comfortable bed Quiet area with ready access to Hyde Park and easy walk to Paddington station
127149,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was always a strange smell in the hallway that emanated into the room The room itself was tiny and the bathroom was so small it was difficult to even move around , The breakfast was fantastic and all the staff members were very helpful 
127150,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, We would definitely stay here again the staff were brilliant The hotel is clean and very well kept The breakfast was good too and really set us up for the day ahead 
127151,Park Grand Paddington Court, The size of the room almost ruined our vacation No space for two people to pass by one another not to mention the luggage basically there was no space to open it properly The bed was sticked to the window therefore there was no possibility to get out of the bed on both sides No room view if we were to open it or look outside we would have seen nothing but walls , The location of the hotel is very good close to Hyde Park and to Paddington underground station aprox 10 min walk The hotel is clean and the stuff is friendly 
127152,Park Grand Paddington Court, It was a shame the bar wouldn t serve a nightcap for the men in our group at10 50pm when we returned to the hotel , Nice comfortable room clean with a good breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful 
127153,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our room was small but it was comfortable and clean We would have liked turn down service in the evening but we didn t know we had to request it , The staff are very attentive kind and helpful 
127154,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was a small chair that was in the way when getting into the far side of the bed The room was so small there was nowhere else to put it To get into the shower you have to squeeze in between the toilet and the otherwise very nice shower stall very awkward and possibly problematic for anyone with mobility issues , The room was very nicely designed and furnished though small Above average bed towels toiletries TV Extraordinary connections for smartphone and PC the best I ve ever seen in a hotel room Electrical outlets for UK US and French plugs I ve never seen that before We were upgraded to a club room so I don t know if all rooms have these Very helpful friendly staff The lobby and public spaces were very good Outstanding location an easy walk to Paddington Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park pubs restaurants etc Good pleasant neighborhood

127156,Park Grand Paddington Court, The reception staff were fine for check in but could not answer some basic questions regarding the area the hotel was located in , Although small for US standards the rooms were very clean and comfortable The hotel is well located for a London visit 
127157,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Clean and convenient and comfortable Extra points for having European style sockets for computers and phones There was a problem with the electricity in the room and I got a different one instantly the staff was helpful and excellent 
127158,Park Grand Paddington Court, The water of my toilet kept running after flushing but it was fixed quite quickly after the maintenance person came to take a look , It was clean and got everything you need I had a single room and it was probably the smallest hotel room I ve ever stayed in but it didn t bother me 
127159,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The hotel was in a great location and had been recently refurbished Plus point every room comes with an android smartphone you can carry around london for the duration of your stay Staff were very courteous and always willing to help 
127160,Park Grand Paddington Court, At first I was accomodated in a ground floor room in the main building I reminded them that during reservation I requested a non ground floor it seems that they don t receive the requests made at booking com I was reallocated to a different building across the street on a high floor no elevators the add says that the hotel has elevators At least the staff carried my luggage to and from the room This building looks a lot inferior than the main one uglier interior no hall no front desk then safety perception decreased not good arriving late night at a building with no front desk at least key card required to enter no elevator It is far unfair that we pay the same price to stay in such inferior building The room is very small but I must say that it seems to be normal in London The bathroom had almost no space The space between the shower box and the sink is too narrow can barely fit a person with arms down Quite a chalenge to brush the teeth or comb your hair The shower drain was partially plugged so after 3 min of shower I had to turn it off before the shower box overboard and flood the bathroom floor Had to live with it for 2 days before they sent someone to fix it Narrow space between the bed and the walls on both sides , Gentle and caring staff and front desk Very good location in a nice and quiet street lots of restaurants near hyde park and as they say a stone throw distance to Paddington train station Lounge with computer and printer available for guests is quite handy to print your tickets and vouchers Fridge kettle and microwave available in the room Inspite of the problems reported we had nice sleep 
127161,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rooms in London are small check the square meterage in the description to avoid surprises , The staff reception desk is very client oriented available friendly efficient We had a newly renovated room with all commodoties and then some Euro plug USB charger plug Android phone with free internet and local calls window with view on quiet street elevator access fridge micro wace etc Location is great 5 10 minutes walk to Paddington station or Hyde park Note that Lancaster gate Underground station is closed until July 2017 meaning the nearest Underground is at Paddington station We had scooters trotinettes with us at all times so any transport was faster than walking
127162,Park Grand Paddington Court, The over welling smell of air fragrance of roses used in the room The 400am wake up to the sound of pigeons nesting in the air vent above the room which didn t stop all morning ontop of the sound of a generator running alnight preventing me from opening the window for some relief of the smell of cheap rose fragrance , Neighborhood
127163,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, We were welcomed by very polite staff travelled from Birmingham so we kind of arrived early and they happily held our bags until we could check in and sorted out all the paper work so when we came back we could just advance to our room Pleasant stay then the next day we accidentally left 2 jackets in the wardrobe but we was already back in Birmingham when we realised we phoned the hotel and they shipped them to us the next day
127164,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The cleanliness of the room was second to none spot on Nice view of the London street too We also had complimentary towel swans and rose petals left on the bed and a dessert left in our room whilst we were out which was a nice touch The staff were top notch too very friendly and helpful Would definitely stay again in the future

127166,Park Grand Paddington Court, The size of the room but will know better next time , Friendly and welcoming staff with accommodation although a little small was clean and comfortable For future reference i feel breakfast should be all inclusive given the room tariff That aside me and my partner would be happy to return and would highly recommend

127171,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rude manager Booked a junior suite and was given a room with 2 beds one double and one single despite my booking was for one person Please be careful the club room is really very small and the junior suite you see on the website is NOT representative as they showed me tiny rooms in the basement and they still call them junior seuits with very small seating area I decided to take the club room instead of the junior suits they showed me as they re smelly in the basement very cold floor which was tiled and not carpeted as you see on the website Even the club room is small with single chair squeezed in the corner Sadly the staff could not see the problem at that time It s not worth it as there are better and cheaper room in the hotels around it which I tried before with more appreciation , Rude manager Booked a junior suite and was given a room with 2 beds one double and one single despite my booking was for one person Please be careful the club room is really very small and the junior suite you see on the website is NOT representative as they showed me tiny rooms in the basement and they still call them junior seuits with very small seating area I decided to take the club room instead of the junior suits they showed me as they re smelly in the basement very cold floor which was tiled and not carpeted as you see on the website Even the club room is small with single chair squeezed in the corner Sadly the staff could not see the problem at that time It s not worth it as there are better and cheaper room in the hotels around it which I tried before with more appreciation

127174,Park Grand Paddington Court, I found out that the word SUITE means something different in the UK vs USA The room was TINY suitable for only a single occupant This was especially true do us arriving in the UK from a two week cruise with to very large suitcases in tow Also never received itemized receipts for charges to the room ,No Positive
127175,Park Grand Paddington Court, The Room was totally cramped the light of the fire alarm as disturbing my sleep despite the comfortable bed The free wifi was asking for too many personal questions which I did then not use It is not acceptable to ask such questions on a free and therefore unprotected wifi I suggest another system for the Hotel Besides I was glad not to have had much luggage this Hotel is not suitable for people who cannot carry luggage along the maze of stairs also since the room and bathroom had been newly done why was there carpet in the room that is so outdated and not hygienic why was there zero space in the bathroom the sink looks nice but is quite an nuisance for space , The location as I had to be close to Hyde Park 
127176,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was too small for a 4 day stay Everything else was perfect , I would have given this Hotel 5 stars if the rooms had been a little larger Everything except the room size was very nice It is very clean and the staff is super

127179,Park Grand Paddington Court, Parking at the property is very poor with all local parking for residents with permits there were active traffic wardens in the area and a number of cars with tickets so I wouldn t dream of chancing it local multi story car parks were available but for a high price at 24 26 per 24 hours as we were staying for 3 night this would have been expensive but we decided to park around 20 miles away from the hotel in a nice area with free on street parking and got the underground to the hotel the car was very safe , Location was very near the Paddington underground matter of minutes walk direct to any part of London room was small but more than suitable for our stay clean and tidy with rainfall shower and under floor bathroom heating there was a nice large TV on the wall and a mobile which had access to free internet that you could take anywhere in London this was really handy so you can save on your own data

127191,Park Grand Paddington Court, 1 Rooms are too small for the price Eg The compact double room is too small for 2 people 2 Some rooms are not directly accessible by lift It s difficult for travellers with heavy luggages , Location It s very near to Paddington Station and Underground 
127192,Park Grand Paddington Court, When I arrived they said there was a maintenance problem with one of the 2 rooms I had booked and they were going to move me to another hotel I had already had 3 bookings fail that week having paid in advance for each and awaiting refunds I was also supposed to have paid no deposit but they had taken pre authorisation for the first night despite not having a room for me I m normally a pushover but in this instance I just insisted that they give us 2 rooms on their property and if they had a shortage then they would just have to upgrade us which they did I wish they d offered that to begin with , They had smartphones in each room with free data that you could take with you when you left the hotel It had Google Maps and a Guide to London pre installed

127199,Park Grand Paddington Court, When checking in there were 2 separate guests complaining about something while the staff seemed to handle it well it was a bit concerning we also witnessed another disagreement the following day We had a slight problem checking in as they request the same credit card used for booking which we no longer had so we had to be recharged and refunded which caused some issues with exchange rates However this was corrected by the staff , We really enjoyed our stay here the staff were all very lovely The beds were super comfortable and they had black out shades which made sleeping in very easy Having the different outlets was very useful and they even had a cell phone you could use We opted for a larger room and the space was fine but it could have been a bit bigger I would be curious how large the regular rooms are The location is great 5 minute walk from Paddington Station in a lovely little neighbourhood

127208,Park Grand Paddington Court, Although I requested a room with a view on arrival we were allocated a tiny room with no window We requested another room and were given a second room with a window facing a brick wall After speaking to the Manager we were eventually moved to a Club room and had a comfortable stay However I found the attitude of Alice appalling She questioned why we were moving rooms and pulled a face She then muttered something to her colleague Very unprofessional , Good location Clean room Fatima at reception very friendly and helpful Nice breakfast 
127209,Park Grand Paddington Court, Absolutely nothing , After hearing it was my partners birthday when we came back in the evening they had laid out a slice of cake a few balloons and a cake made out of towels on our bed and a written letter Was a very lovely surprise for her as it topped off our brilliant day in london 
127210,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Lovely Single room Which in London is very unusual Had everything you could need as a single business traveler and as usual nothing is too much trouble for the staff
127211,Park Grand Paddington Court, It was a bit noisy at night , The hotel was in a good location with easy access The staff was polite and helpful My colleagues have enjoyed their stay as well Would recommend 
127212,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The hotel was close to Paddington station so it was easy to get to London on the Heathrow Express Close to Hyde Park A wonderful park to walk through 
127213,Park Grand Paddington Court, The size of the room was very very small The small double bed took almost all the room space In the kitchenette cupboard there could have been a nespresso machine instead of the instant coffee , the overall furnishings bathroom fittings etc were modern There was also a very spacious fridge and a kettle and whole kitchenette cupboard 
127214,Park Grand Paddington Court, We ordered room service of a chicken burger and nachos They arrived cold but on very hot plates The nachos came virtually glued to the plate and were hard and unpleasant the sauces with it curdled in their little jugs We did eat it because we were hungry but mentioned that they might like to review that service the next morning at checkout To their credit the hotel didn t charge us for the food and apologised ,No Positive
127215,Park Grand Paddington Court, Deluxe single room was a bit small to be rated as deluxe , Everything else was great great staff and customer service Room was clean and tidy Bed was comfy Location was sentral to everything with Paddington station and Lanchester station a few minutes away Totally recommend this hotel Would stay here again 
127216,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Staff were very friendly at reception as were the door men Carried my bags to my room and gave me whatever info I needed I stayed in a single room which was compact but very clean and had everything I needed to make my stay comfortable Would definitely stay here again if I come back to London in the future great location 5 minute walk to the nearest train station in Paddington for Heathrow express or catch the central line to oxford st from Queensway station thank you 
127217,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing i like in this hotel , The room its very very small i cant found any more of area in the room to put my lugguge also the hotel doesnt have the elevator i was in 4th stair its too hard to get there every time 
127218,Park Grand Paddington Court, There are stairs everywhere so good luck getting your bags to your room by yourself Luckily they have a helpful staff to assist , Super comfy beds heated bathroom floor microwave mini fridge and a free smartphone to use while we were there 
127219,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room 501 was on the ground floor unfortunately you could hear everything from outside Windows need replacing Bed was too soft for my liking cleaners had a bad habit of banging the hoovers against the corridors so you won t need an alarm to wake you up in the morning, though the room was only 13m2 it was well designed in terms of layout
127220,Park Grand Paddington Court, We got a room in the basement and the heating system was not working well it was a bit chilly , Very good location near Paddington and Bayswater with a lot of restaurants nearby 
127221,Park Grand Paddington Court, Felt kind of shoved in the basement Breakfast room layout is ridiculous very busy in there to make matters worse , Close to Kensington Gardens very clean lovely bed and black out curtains 
127222,Park Grand Paddington Court, I, Hotel location is very good walking distance to Hyde Park Kensingnton Palace and Porto Bello near to Paddington Station with lots of pubs restaurants and souvenir shops near by Hotel is nice and clean with polite kind and helpful staff 
127223,Park Grand Paddington Court, Only very minor points to make I asked for a pint of water at breakfast as with most hotels only very small glasses were laid out and I don t drink tea and coffee only water so I always request this but there seemed to be some confusion over what I was asking for and eventually I was just given a slightly taller glass empty Also a deposit charge is taken on check in but when booking breakfast it couldn t just be added on to the room but the credit card was asked for again an unnecessary process The bar shuts at 11pm which is a bit too early for hotel guests , Good sized room club room with good sized bathroom too Right next to elevator which was excellent as I needed to avoid stairs as have knee injuries there are a few stairs by reception to get up to the lifts but there was always a member of staff on hand to lift my luggage those few steps for me Breakfast very good and good value Location good easy to hail a cab and close to shops bars 
127224,Park Grand Paddington Court, One of the buildings hasn t lift and this info wasn t mentioned in the website So I had to upgrade my room and change the building, Staff Location Cleanliness

127226,Park Grand Paddington Court, The layout of the rooms in the hotel was odd We had to walk up a short flight of steps to get to the elevator take the elevator to the 2nd floor then walk down a lengthy staircase to get to our room This is not a hotel for those who can t deal with stairs Next time I will ask for a room on the same floor as the elevator , We were very pleased with this hotel The location 4 blocks from Paddington 3 blocks from Hyde Park was ideal The staff was extremely pleasant and accommodating Our room though small was quiet comfortable and tastefully decorated Loved having a small fridge and coffee tea making supplies Would most definitely stay here again

127228,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing, Great staff great location and the room was perfect 100 booking again when we visit London in the future Only a short walk from the station and the tube so made traveling a lot easier 
127229,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bathroom design is extremely unreasonable The basin area is less than 1 meter wide and I could barely brush my teeth comfortably since my elbow would hit on the walls btw I am only 1 65m in size 2 so just imagine how it would feel for guys There is no where to put your toilette in either basin area or in shower The dust bin in bathroom is hard to open and in fact I didn t manage to open it Besides the hotel rooms are in the opposite building to where the lobby is located and there is no lift so you will need to climb up to 4 floors via a super narrow staircase , The location is good less than 10 min from Paddington train station 
127230,Park Grand Paddington Court, Noisey room because of front door slamming builders outside of window also But during the night it was quiet just couldn t sleep on Friday afternoon after traveling Bed in our room could do with being replaced dipped into middle , Super clean they also went out the way to put real rose petals in the room for our special trip Friendly staff happy to help Tea coffee station was put together well Definitely recommend 
127231,Park Grand Paddington Court, We stayed at room 405 which is the topmost room it has no window so the room can get airless and stuffy even though there is a air conditioning , Good location it is close to Paddington station and a that provides good travelling options on the underground The staff was very helpful and nice Breakfast buffet provided good options and was overall good The bed was soft and large The hotel provides good amenities

127240,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bed was way too small the room was located on the 1 floor so it was incredibly hot you can hear everything in the room above you footsteps nasty sounds the lights weren t functioning correctly some didn t even function at all you have very little space between the wardrobe and the wall as well as between the bed and the wall on one side the halls have a horrible smell can t really say nice things about the staff because I only saw them while checking in aswell as while checking out and we basically didn t talk much ,No Positive

127249,Park Grand Paddington Court, Poor service got the bill wrong bar closed early breakfast service cramped and poor selection Cleaner asked for daughters room to be vacated 1 5 hours early , Not a lot
127250,Park Grand Paddington Court, When I check out they told me I have to pay the telephone bill of 45 that I didn t use but claimed me by useing during 03 30 I was sleeping and it was innocence At last they didn t ask me to pay after 10 mins to verify , Convinence of location
127251,Park Grand Paddington Court, The mattress could do with being replaced it was not that comfortable , The staff were so friendly best service I have received in the UK The room was so clean and had all the things you needed The shower was perfect loved it clean bright and spacious 
127252,Park Grand Paddington Court, No room in bathroom to put toiletries nor convenient hooks for towels Very strong over perfumed room not sure if it was air spray or on bedding but inescapable Bar area not very comfortable or welcoming , Comfortable bed Very quiet room 
127253,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our bed was two beds out together so was very annoying as you rolled into the middle , Location was great close to both Paddington and Queensway since Lancaster Gate station is currently closed Staff very friendly and helpful I would return 
127254,Park Grand Paddington Court, Minuscule room and bed only fit for tiny people Hair dryer not working Kept stopping after twenty seconds No space to put a wash bag in bathroom Bed under the window so it was draughty in the night, Staff friendliness

127264,Park Grand Paddington Court, The staff on the front desk were not quite rude but officious The first 2 ladies were laughing I assume at a private joke the entire time I checked in which made me feel uncomfortable Then when I came back a bit drunk in the evening the chap on the desk tried to charge me for the room again I had to empty my purse and produce a visa receipt to prove I had paid It was rather humiliating and over the top , It was incredibly good value fairly smart hotel and right on Hyde park for 100 a night Also there is a bar and they give free newspapers and water in the room 
127265,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, All the staff was very friendly and helpful clean room and in my case I got upgraded Breakfast was pricey I ate there one morning and they did offer an excellent selection however there are a lot of restaurants very close to the Hotel that offer breakfast for 1 2 the price I ate out the next morning Thank you for a nice stay

127270,Park Grand Paddington Court, Changed my booking at last minute from twin beds to a double which was highly inconvenient as I was travelling with a child Rooms very noisy no soundproofing so was woken up at 5am by people above moving around , Good location walking distance to station Good sized bedroom 
127271,Park Grand Paddington Court, Bed was a bit short for me only just 6 long across the width of the narrow room and I m almost that tall so it was a bit tight , I liked the location friendly and helpful staff and the affordability of the hotel Also liked that there was a lift 
127272,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was very small Had everything we needed though , The position was wonderful lovely walks to the park and palace Lovely houses in the area 
127273,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room is small Even though there are elevators my room is only accessible via stairs , The room is clean and modern Location is convenient Good value in London 
127274,Park Grand Paddington Court, I booked room that should be in the upper floors however they gave me in the basement I can t sleep very will because the noise on th roof, The bed was very comfortable
127275,Park Grand Paddington Court, Confusion when booking in as told initially that breakfast was included On speaking with reception the following day I was told breakfast was not included and I had only booked in for one night instead of two On challenging this I asked them to look again they then confirmed I had booked for two nights but I was not entitled to breakfast On checking out I noticed I had been charged for two breakfasts even though I had been told I was not entitled to breakfast and I had not taken breakfast Spoke with two reception staff and they said my card would be credited and new invoice with the breakfast costs removed would be emailed to my personal email as yet two days later no email with new invoice received Bit disappointing as hotel it self is good , Accommodation was very good standard and will definitely stay here frequently 
127276,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The staff were very helpful and upgraded me to a suite without being asked very welcome as I had had a long trip The room was clean and quiet Excellent shower to wake up in the morning too

127279,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing It was perfect , Staff decorated our room prior to arrival as a surprise for my other half on our anniversary they also supplied us with a bottle of champagne Excellent service highly recommended 
127280,Park Grand Paddington Court, The only downfall was the breakfast had to wait a very long time to wait to be seated , Very nice building loved the shower and the staff couldn t of done anything more Ordered room service and the food was delicious The bed was so comfortable and the location was so close to city centre so can even walk on foot 
127281,Park Grand Paddington Court, The basement sigle room was very small and several times I heard a mouse running around in the ceiling space above me , The staff were friendly and helpful The small but good restaurant offered very tasty Indian food 
127282,Park Grand Paddington Court, The main negative about the hotel is the size of the rooms I booked a Deluxe Double but you could not walk around the bed it was that small If you want more space you will have to go for the cub rooms or the suites Also think the breakfast could be included considering the price of the rooms , The hotel staff are very welcoming and friendly The staff on the front desk are always available and willing to help The rooms are small but are comfortable and very clean The bathrooms are excellent with a large spacious shower which is rare in London hotels The hotel also provides very fluffy bathrobes and slippers which is a nice touch along with a complimentary plate of fruit The rooms are true to the photos displayed on the website so you wont be in for any surprises but do bare in mind the rooms are not that large but are adequate for a few nights in London The hotel is near Paddington underground and Lancaster Gate underground Both stations are about 5 minute walk from the hotel but just know that the Lancaster Gate station is currently closed till mid summer The area is quiet so you will not have any trouble sleeping You are in walking distance to many restaurants offering many different cuisines Also Hyde park is a 5 minute walk away and Oxford street can be reached by foot in about 20 minutes One last benefit is that the hotel will store you luggage for you if your arrive early before check in and also store your luggage after check out if you are not leaving till later 
127283,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room was quite cramped and lounge facilities disappointing Didn t have the breakfast so unable to comment , Refurbished to a very high standard particularly the bathroom and bedding Staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly 
127284,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room has a bright green light shining from ceiling makes room bright at night also door in corridor that guests use to get to their rooms very noisy from our room, Staff very friendly and helpful
127285,Park Grand Paddington Court, Wifi could be better Deluxe room was quite small had to walk sideways to get to other side of the bed , Staff were great and very friendly and helpful 
127286,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room despite being a Deluxe Double was small But all hotels in this area suffer with cramped rooms I was traveling alone so there was no issue but if I had been sharing the room things would have been very cosy, The location is great The room I had 002 although on the ground floor was quiet Everything was clean
127287,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was quite small but for travelling alone and the great location it was not an issue at all , I was travelling alone and felt so comfortable at this hotel from the minute I walked in the door The staff are incredibly friendly I even got to check in hours early

127295,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room was quite small check out which should have been easy as I d pre paid was painful and took far too long , Good wifi easy to access charge sockets very clean good selection of pillows 
127296,Park Grand Paddington Court, Although we booked the deluxe double the room was very small The large office chair in the room was unnecessary and took up a lot of space A little noisy especially as there was a bin collection at 6am on a Sunday morning and we could hear guest in the adjoining room coughing during the night , Location was good Only a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station Room was clean and staff were friendly 
127297,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was some problem with the light system of the room it didn t work very well and also with the sink it swallow very slowly The bathroom was a little bit smaller that it should be for a 2 people room , I really like the location of the hotel close to Paddington station with a lot of underground and bus stops The room was very comfortable and the hotel staff was very kind 
127298,Park Grand Paddington Court, We booked a double deluxe room and we got a basement suite in the building across the street Room didn t match with the photos from reservation There were not even carpets in the room just cold floor We were spending most of the time outside and we went there just to sleep so It was ok but I really expected more from a 4 accommodation, Free coffee and tea in the room Good location close to Paddington station 
127299,Park Grand Paddington Court, Space is a premium I would prefer some more space in a hotel room I was a solo Traveller I wonder what size were double rooms for two people , I liked the cleanliness of the property and the friendliness of the staff It was a very welcome environment from Which to explore London
127300,Park Grand Paddington Court, The description size of the room was over exaggerated For a deluxe double it was extremely small For the price and the description I would ve expected a bit more space , The breakfast as a whole was extremely good 
127301,Park Grand Paddington Court, The noise from the door outside my room I was in 324 The public area door needs cushioning as it is very loud when it closes , Well the staff in general were very accommodating and well trained Alice and Adrian deserve some sort of recognition as they are so willing to help I just got off a flight from Miami to Torronto then Torronto to London after working 6 5 months on a cruise ship They were 2 people who were genuinely helpful towards me and it was so nice to be looked after rather then looking after other people 
127302,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room 120 the room itself was excellent but there was a generator directly outside the window which was very noisy the reception area moved our room immediately, The staff were excellent and the accommodation very good
127303,Park Grand Paddington Court, Breakfast could be better in order to reach top level Although when we asked omelette they satisfied our request imediately , all members of the staff especially Alice was very kind and helpful The location was perfect at a very quiet neighborhood Very clean and warm room we ll be back soon Thank you all We apreciate what they did for us earlier check in and a bit later chek out 
127304,Park Grand Paddington Court, Receptionist on arrival rude insisted we pay with same card as booked with but we did not carry this card Also rooms terribly small approx 7 ft by 10 ft Bed was 3 4 size and not a double , Iocation
127305,Park Grand Paddington Court, It would have been nice if breakfast was included in the booking price for the room I found the cost of that separately too expensive and opted to eat 5 mins up the road at a lovely restaurant where breakfast was half the cost of the hotel breakfast, Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was immaculately clean Shower was amazing Choice of 2 shower heads a power shower or rain shower Really nicely decorated rooms and perfect for our needs Great hotel and would highly recommend
127306,Park Grand Paddington Court, Breakfast room was in the basement of the hotel and was little warm , The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good value on the c 11 deal The room had a little kitchen area with a microwave kettle and fridge which is good if your in london for longer than usual stay Smart phone provided In the room for your use while out and about this would be really good if your an oversees customer 
127307,Park Grand Paddington Court, very very small rooms i had upgrade my room to club room and it was also small, location 5 minutes walk from Paddington station friendly staff free wifi fitness club new bathroom value for money
127308,Park Grand Paddington Court, Lack of communication Asked if restaurant was told no then found out there was one one 2 days before trip ended Room was no room to swing a cat , Wasnt even in hotel was across the road

127310,Park Grand Paddington Court, We found that every morning we were being awoken by doors closing and that the housekeepers were very noisy We understand they have a job to do but would of appreciated not hearing thier conversations and them going about their daily routine quite as much My boyfriend was ill during the trip and was finding it hard to sleep as it was without the crashing and banging quite early in the mornings , Hotel was very easy to find and in a great location literally 5 mins from Hyde Park Room was very clean and for a compact double had enough room to move about fridge was also an extra bonus as meant we could chill our water before heading out 
127311,Park Grand Paddington Court, The desk was a compromise as quite small and difficult for doing work I really didn t like the Handy smartphone that was in the room the screen constantly changed drawing attention to itself and I could see no simple way of turning it off this also made it difficult to get to sleep as it was putting off a lot of light in a small room I didn t like the idea of a device with cameras on it being in the room My room was also on the third floor with only stair access thank goodness for the porter helping carry my bag to the room , The rooms although compact in size were well laid out and very comfortable Shower was powerful 
127312,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, I loved the smartphone available for free as part of your room which can help with directions restaurant tips must see places and events aswell as being linked to the hotel So handy 
127313,Park Grand Paddington Court, Bed was slightly soft There was a buzzing sound from the electrics generator in the room It wasn t very loud but still annoying in terms of trying to fall asleep , Clean very modern and new room Location 
127314,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our first room had poor soundproofing Creaking floor boards every time people moved above We could even hear them unzip their suitcase As we were only staying for 1night it wasn t a major issue but management kindly offered us a top floor room with complimentary bottle of wine , Helpful staff good location just unfortunate there was a tube strike Breakfast good
127315,Park Grand Paddington Court, The rooms are tiny but it didn t bother too much Especially if you spend most of your time outside of the hotel , Hotel staff is very nice and friendly Rooms are new and clean Easy access to all attractions 
127316,Park Grand Paddington Court, A strange layout so many bedrooms are located up stairs without direct lift access, A quiet and reasonably sized room Bed was very comfy Clean Close to Hyde Park if you want to go for a walk or a run
127317,Park Grand Paddington Court, Shower cubicle a little narrow but shower itself was good , Helpful staff who gave me a room on the ground floor as I was using crutches Good facilities in the room Good location and great price No comment on breakfast Room only rate taken 
127318,Park Grand Paddington Court, I wished to have s bathtub , Clean staff was very helpful Quiet Extra tip Location near Paddington Station Heathrow Express There was a metro strike on my departure date heavy traffic jam everywhere I was totally correct in being in the walkable area to the station no difficulties at all 
127319,Park Grand Paddington Court, Random music playing at 7am House keeping rang doorbell at 7am Staff member at the counter didn t seem to care about these issues , Location
127320,Park Grand Paddington Court, Typical thin walled budget hotel with a shiny veneer You could easily hear the room next to you or activity in the hallway But it s a NICE shiny veneer nice room nice bathroom very comfy , staff gladly accommodated an early check in Location was good 
127321,Park Grand Paddington Court, We didn t have a view it looked out into another corridor and more rooms of the hotel however was t expecting much of a view and had the curtains closed most of the time we were in the room so it was a problem, I loved the suit we got Brought my boyfriend down for his birthday and paid upon arrival 254 for 2 nights in a club room the shower was amazing with a rainfall option from the roof and just normal shower option the bed was exceptionally comfortable was two singles together however didn t realise this until we were packing to come home wouldn t have known thought it was a queen size Adjustable lights and tv with loads of channels even had a smart phone in the room if you couldn t get a network which helped you round London that you take with you It was brilliant oh and there was a safe too which was handy for passports etc 
127322,Park Grand Paddington Court, The heating was very confusing The room didn t get warmer no matter how high you turned the dial I called reception and they said they d operate it from there before putting the phone down so I couldn t ask why I can t do it myself That aside a chilly couple of evenings were solved by the warm duvet , The room was absolutely stunning It was mine and my partners anniversary and the staff had definitely pulled out all the stops for us It was clean with lovely facilities 
127323,Park Grand Paddington Court, Expensive cost for breakfast so chose to have this elsewhere , Close enough to walk to station more difficult with my luggage Quick and easy check in with room ready on arrival which was close to the check in time Ability to store luggage on the day I was leaving and staff member ensured that a bag with expensive camera lenses in it was put in a safe place for the day 
127324,Park Grand Paddington Court, The 1st room we were given was very small so we changed room to a slightly bigger one to find that come night time the window in the room was that thin the room was very drafty plus the air conditioning units were outside our window so that kept is up aswell as having to juggle with the heating to keep the room warm So we didn t sleep very well when we booked the room one of the offers were pay when we arrived but the hotel took money from my account before we arrived and then I had to pay for the room when we got there so full price for the room aswell as them taking the 90 so rather than paying the 270 which is what I thought we were paying I ended up paying 360 which I m still not happy about plus I still haven t had the 90 refunded yet , The location of the hotel is good and seemed very clean Loved exploring London great city 
127325,Park Grand Paddington Court, Budget rooms are small cold and in the basement It takes some time for the room to heat up , Good reasonably priced food Very clean room Good communication system on the door for cleaning staff Staff responded to requests with a friendly and helpful disposition

127327,Park Grand Paddington Court, I didn t feel secure at the room but nothing happened the room was so noisy from the street because it located in the second floor Also the breakfast room was to small and very crowded, The location was good as well as the staff very friendly the suits is big enough for couples 
127328,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our tiny penthouse suite was in fact a very small windowless room up a cold set of stairs Its lack of window was never mentioned Our son s room was a closet beside the elevator Fortunately we did not have any baggage or we would not have fit in the rooms Our double bed was about the size of a 3 4 bed with sheets to match they did not cover two people Don t book here There are other hotel rooms in London with windows , Good location 
127329,Park Grand Paddington Court, The heating and a c was a little confusing to use , Beds were brilliant The staff were super friendly and it s very convenient to be between two tubes stations just a short walk away Loved our stay here 
127330,Park Grand Paddington Court, The rooms were small and cramped but they were spotless It was okay for a 1 night stay but I can understand people finding it too small after a weekend break etc , Really clean room helpful staff Great location to central London with Paddington underground station being a 5 10 min walk and Hyde Park a 10 min walk The room comes with a Mobile Phone that you can take with you on your trip around London Unlimited data calls text messages for your use I thought this was a really lovely touch and is great for those travelling overseas to visit London 
127331,Park Grand Paddington Court, room size ventilation and heating staff behaviour specifically when a room was shown to me in the second building across the street which stinked literally like a waste container and there were no apologies later for this massive failure luckily they happened to change my room thanks to availability However they could have charged 122 per night without breakfast in case of no availability , The location otherwise a pricey hotel that did not live up to any of my expectations
127332,Park Grand Paddington Court, Next time please inform me prior to moving me from room to room that the new one will be in the basement I mentioned this to staff and they took it graceiously on board , Fantastic staff and world class service 
127333,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was too small even I upgraded to double delux as I did not like the room located at the basement 1 level The lounge was not confortable I stayed at a hotel in Birmingham and Liverpool found the room were much larger and price were much lower perhaps they are not in London , The hotel staff were friendly and warm welcome
127334,Park Grand Paddington Court, Not much to like unfortunately Dirty and claustrophobic room for 2 people with suitcases and carry on there was no room for our luggage hairs found in bed powerpoint hanging from wall filthy carpets tiny double beds loud rooms Service of the rooms were generally poor on the first day there was 1 4 toilet roll and was not replenished during our 3 night stay, Modern bathroom Good tv in room
127335,Park Grand Paddington Court, When we arrived we was given our room which was the smallest double room I ve ever seen there was a draft coming from the window and for 342 I thought was outrageous After I complained we was moved to what was suppose to be a bigger room but wasn t bigger by much and it was the same again a draft from the window ,No Positive

127343,Park Grand Paddington Court, N a, Rooms were miles bigger than I initially thought they would be Under a 10 minute walk to Lancaster Gate tube station and only one stop to Marble Arch to winter wonderland It made getting about very easy The tube station is opposite kensingtons gardens which is a lovely place to visit for a nice walk The bed in the room was massive and they put on a glorious display for a birthday treat anniversary
127344,Park Grand Paddington Court, Advised early arrival promised priority checkin unable to checkin even after checkin time until pressured to do so What s the point in asking time of arrival Last day was advised of cheaper breakfast offer if booked night before was not told this at checkin bit late the day you are checking out Booked junior suite got club room not sure if there is a difference , Good location staff exceptional room spotless linen and towels looked new Overall satisfied had room 544 club room 
127345,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rooms are extremely small and noises from other rooms are only muffled a little which got very obvious by the active couple residing next to us , Breakfast was good and personnel was very responsive The room itself was clean and we very much appreciated the free to use mobile device 
127346,Park Grand Paddington Court, Just thought room was little small, Great location Less than a 5 min walk to tube station Clean rooms Bed massive and comfy Was upgraded to a club room although room was rather small But great just for our one night stay would definitely stay again 
127347,Park Grand Paddington Court, A bit of a twisted path to get to our room , Beautiful big room very modern and clean Hot tiled bathroom floor great pressure in the shower aesthetically pleasing design Free tea coffee cookies fridge huge TV V tu nice travel cot for babies available upon request 
127348,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room is small but acceptable for a couple staying for a few days However the floor layout is a bit weird that we can only access to our room to only one lift but not the other one while the staff hasn t given us any direction during check in Moreover we were or noticed that the room is without window which make the ventilation not very good , Great location Super convenient to travel from Heathrow to city centre Comfortable bed with clean bedding
127349,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room is not clean A lot of dusts everywhere The room service is very poor No cleaning is conducted during my stay Only organizing the stuffs and clothes The room and hotel environment were not comfortable The receptionists are not outgoing The water and free bar items were never replaced , The location of this hotel is good It is 8 10 min walking to Paddington Station The room s size is acceptable The bathroom s design and space is nice The TV and channels were entertaining The internet speed was good Moreover I shopped online and I received all items at the hotel s reception 
127350,Park Grand Paddington Court, They have many buildings near the main one My room was in building no 3 which hasn t a left its was difficult to carry out the bags upstairs Also the air conditioning was really stupid since the cold and heat were working at the same time which I have never seen like that Lastly the bed sheet was smelly and unclear , Nothing particularly
127351,Park Grand Paddington Court, Hotel portrayed to be 4 and luxurious upon arrival staff very rude and wanting dates of birth for what reason long wait to book in Room was supposed to be upgraded to luxurious it was one of the smallest rooms if have ever stayed in only 3 4 bed and up against a window This was the worst hotel I have ever booked in London I thought I would pay a bit more rather than staying in a premier in next time I will be back in the Premier Inn,No Positive
127352,Park Grand Paddington Court, For me personally nothing , The use of a mobile phone supplied in your room which you can take with you when you re going around London was brilliant I never got lost using the map app and I could research things to do etc 
127353,Park Grand Paddington Court, Would have liked my coffee etc to be replaced on my second day there this was maybe an oversight , The staff were all extremely helpful The room was clean comfortable and quiet Underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bonus Plenty of towels toiletries etc Breakfast was not included which was good because it kept the cost down and encouraged you to get out early for a full day s sight seeing 
127354,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, I would highly recommend that everyone and anyone stays here The staff are all lovely and the rooms provide every comfort that you need from a hotel Can t wait to stay here again

127360,Park Grand Paddington Court, nothing, Room was very nice it has a fridge which is not advertised on booking com There is even a smart phone within the room that you can use with free internet on to use as a map whilst you are out you can take it out of the hotel heated floors in the bathroom and a choice of a shower head or over head shower rainfall 
127361,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was really small so you could hardly move around the bed The bed was not so comfortable but nothing that we couldn t handle , Great location and clean facilities Quiet neighborhood The room came with free smartphone for unlimited data and calls 
127362,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Excellent staff who are incredibly helpful and accommodating We had an issue at check in but Richard was brilliant and not only solved our problem but added complementary breakfast He was also amazing again in helping us locate earplugs and was also pleasant and polite at check out The location is also so easy from paddington station is a straight shot of a maximum five minute walk Would stay here again 
127363,Park Grand Paddington Court, No hot water for morning shower very small room having stayed here twice before the facilities in the room were poor decoration was scruffy and tired and tv had obviously been replaced by a smaller model but holes in wall not repaired very disappointed No genius benefits as on past occasions,No Positive
127364,Park Grand Paddington Court, Smallest room I have ever encountered we were in the building across the street our room had stairs leading down to it which was a nightmare for getting our bags in Seriously couldn t swing a cat in our room bathroom was a joke my hubby is 6 4 he struggled to fit in the teeny shower Staff were unhelpful unfriendly would not recommend this place , Nothing
127365,Park Grand Paddington Court, Reasonable to the train station but further from key attractions although I new this beforehand , Clean nice place nice people Great pub down the street 
127366,Park Grand Paddington Court, the breakfast area to small people bumping in to each other no turning space people queuing out side the door waiting great deal of time for a space to come free , the location was good
127367,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was very small and due to the lay out bed up against window was quite claustrophobic as the person sleeping on the window side had to climb over the other to get out The carpet in the hall and room was visibly dirty The access to the room was terrible aside from getting the lift to the correct floor we had to walk along several hallways and open doors with suitcases this was very awkward The bathroom and location were good apart from this I would not stay there again For the price it was very disappointing , Location was good 
127368,Park Grand Paddington Court, Couldn t think of anything that I didn t like really , Everything was perfect The hotel is a Victorian terrace charming and beautiful The room and the hotel in general have very good and modern facilities The staff is extremely helpful and resourceful I didn t try the breakfast although I had the free upgrade which included breakfast but the food looked delicious The Location is impeccable very near Paddington station and Lancester Gate station which is great to get into the Centre Besides it is very near Hyde Park Kensington Gardens perfect for a walk when the sun is out which I did when I was there 
127369,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, The hotel area is very convenient to reach the main tourist attractions and also there is Paddington Metro station n even the local buses around to go any places Also if sightseeing booking is through Big bus tours there s bus stop to board the bus next to the Paddington station The room was small but the beds were very soft n comfortable with all required facilities provided 
127370,Park Grand Paddington Court, A cheaper breakfast , Beds were Comfortable staff were so helpful and polite Really cool phone feature in the room and a nice TV Would recommend to anyone staying in Paddington
127371,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was a bit small but that was fine The one thing I couldn t stand was the lack of noise insulation My room was right next to the door separating the lift lobby and the main corridor and I could hear that banging shut the entire night Even if I had requested a room further away I would still have heard the room doors opening and closing the walls were that thin , Comfortable bed Friendly staff who were super helpful in facilitating an extra early check in Nice strong shower
127372,Park Grand Paddington Court, The single room is probably too small better to opt for the double room at least for some more room however that comes with a price The other problem with the property is the difficulty to locate a room as its spread around the staircases , The location is good walking distance from the Paddington Station For obvious reasons all amenities are within reach The rooms are clean and the breakfast has plenty of options The free phone with unlimited calling and data for your stay is a big plus 
127373,Park Grand Paddington Court, We stayed in a deluxe double room but these are still small rooms , Really good location within a 10 minute walk to Winter Wonderland and Oxford Street The bathroom was brill with a big power shower and the bed was lovely and comfy 
127374,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was so small The bed was at best a large single bed Would not call it a double bed Not much room for a couple Bathroom was tiny no room in the shower and certainly not enough room to dry yourself The room was also small not much room for 2 people to move around There was a loud annoying noise coming from outside the room which might have been some air conditioning units but when we called to complain about this the noise stopped but then started again 10 minutes later and continued on and off throughout the night Not sure why there was a window in the room when all there was to look at was the peoples room opposite and some brick walls , Location was OK 
127375,Park Grand Paddington Court, The hotel should provid literature on the water pressure so guests are aware, Liked that we where out of the way in a separate area to the hotel Room was very cosy Loved that we had a handy phone that helped us google all locations trains etc
127376,Park Grand Paddington Court, The shower a little tighny and the switch of the bathroom was out of the room as a consequance that once you light on a big risk of waking up your room mate , The size of the room and the location in London
127377,Park Grand Paddington Court, I spent 3 days in a single deluxe The room was extremely small and the little window was locked Perfect if you want to try the experience of being in prison Upon arrival I asked if the room they had given me was really a deluxe and I have confirmed that it was They offered me to see other rooms but they told me they were the same size Other guests complained The answer was that in London the rooms were that size It is absolutely not true To avoid ,No Positive

127379,Park Grand Paddington Court, Despite of hotel in good location nice comfy bed and interior I m expecting more selection tea and not just English Breakfast in room Although other speciality tea can be requested from room service The instant coffee is not good offer Other hotel down the road next to Paddington Station offer nice filter coffee or coffee maker in room , Nice comfy bed flat screen tv and underfloor heating in bathroom very nice indeed 
127380,Park Grand Paddington Court, The original room did not have any Windows but when we mentioned this it was changed imediately, Excellant breakfast good range fresh and hot Bed very comfortable room warm and shower powerful and hot

127382,Park Grand Paddington Court, Staffs at the receptions may need a little bit more smiles Some rooms are not directly accessible through the elevator needs stairs But the hotel provided excellent help with our luggages , Comfortable beds good location Love the complementary smart phone with unlimited data and calls Hotel and the rooms are very clean The hotel is quick to respond to our needs problem One of our room has a faulty heater the hotel quickly sent a portable heater They gladly provided two more heaters when requested for more since one is still too cold for us Got to change room the next day 
127383,Park Grand Paddington Court, The draft coming from the window in the bedroom was bad even with the heating on I found sleeping on the window side of the bed very cold the bar seats weren t very comfortable and it lacked atmosphere even though it was decorated lovely We definitely would have stayed longer and spent more if we had been a little more comfortable, We liked being close to Hyde park for the Christmas market and that there was a tube station a short walk away The hotel lovely it was very clean and modern the staff were very nice the underfloor heating in the bathroom was a nice touch 
127384,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bed was tiny the pillows were not comfortable and the rooms were not deluxe as advertised We had hair in the bed that was before we got into it The air con was either gale force winds or non existent , The staff were friendly The finishes in the bathroom were great Good location for Heathrow trains and getting around central London and the high streets
127385,Park Grand Paddington Court, I got room in the basement across the facilities rooms Loud from inside and outside small room maybe 10m2 with small bed advertise as double bed comfort room 175 pounds per night with breakfast was just simple rip off Staff bearly speak english I know that turists are not appreciated as bussiness class people but if you are in London you are expecting at least good english from the employees , Nothing much for price of 175 pounds per night 
127386,Park Grand Paddington Court, First room at the other building was a disappoinment and so far away than the picture you see via booking com Luckily hotel was available and we could get a new room at main building Reception was helpful for this topic Air condition didn t work properly too cold or too hot , Rooms are so clean and room size is enough than what we had seen as a first option Location is good 5 mins to paddington station 
127387,Park Grand Paddington Court, The mattress was slightly too hard , The hotel was great value for money and is in a very convenient location All of the staff were very friendly as well 
127388,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Excellent service from staff Put an extra special touch to my girlfriend and I second anniversary Location is perfect 5 mins from tube and quiet at night 20 mins from Hyde park winter wonderland which i would 100 recommend too 
127389,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bathrooms have extractor fans which are very noisy and other guests seemed to leave theirs on for hours so I could not sleep , Hotel is within walking distance of Paddington station and close to a lovely Italian restaurant Room was compact but nicely decorated with a modern bathroom 
127390,Park Grand Paddington Court, Black hair rather long in my bed several I do not appreciate the window at the end of the wagon yes wagon it exactly how I would describe the room Jam packed with wardrobe two beds and a narrow footpath At the time of booking the pictures were not very conclusive but I went along with my experience from another Park Grand across the street which was unfortunately fully booked Poor restaurant menu OK breakfast , Very hard to put my finger on something 
127391,Park Grand Paddington Court, Had a generator or air con unit right outside my window and it kept going on and off all night So hardly slept Not good , Clean tidy lovely rooms and great value
127392,Park Grand Paddington Court, The Bright fire exit light in the room kept us awake oh and the bathroom is for little people , The Location was perfect and a great breakfast pleasant room furnishings 
127393,Park Grand Paddington Court, People weren t quiet in the hotel when walking through the corridors but that is not something that the hotel can control , When we arrived the staff dealt with people as quickly as possible and showed you to your room which was nice because the hotel was rather big We also had a fridge and a microwave in our room which is handy to put a pint of milk in to chill The beds were nice and comfy and the shower was amazing It was basically a home from home The check in and out times were good as it meant you could relax in the morning without being forced out the door I would definitely stay here again Such a nice experience We were a bit sceptical after the reviews but I am so glad we ignored them now 
127394,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing I didn t like, The staff were excellent nothing was too much We were able to leave our luggage there after checking out so we able to do more things around London Definitely stay there again 
127395,Park Grand Paddington Court, No real wardrobe in the room , We particularly liked Roney the receptionist Our room had nothing in common to the photos we saw whilst making the booking As if we made the reservation to a different hotel It was very small very old fashion not refurbished and we would not fit in the bathroom whilst the bed was tiny Roney however did everything possible to give us another room and since the hotel was fully booked he made arrangements to move to another Park Grand hotel up the same road Park Grand London Paddington He even arranged for a complimentary breakfast for all days of our stay which really set off for all the disappointment Thank you Roney p s Basically my ratings go for the Park Grand London Paddington hotel 
127396,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing, Very friendly and welcoming staff on to willing to help Great hot chocolate Location very central to everything from tourist attractions to just a walk through Hyde Park Would definately stay again 
127397,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing , Lovely hotel with very accommodating staff and exceptionally clean rooms We were upgraded on arrival which is always a very pleasant surprise 
127398,Park Grand Paddington Court, It would have been nice if some comfy Armchairs were available in a Lounge so that we could have sat and read We felt the dining chairs in Lounge did not allow us to relax , Food always delicious hotel nice and warm staff very helpful
127399,Park Grand Paddington Court, Our credit card was charged initially and then again on arrival The card was declined on arrival causing some embarrassment and to add insult to injury the blocked out transaction was not released causing further embarrassment a few days later In addition they gave two members of our party the same room which was particularly pleasant for the couple who were woken unexpectedly at 1am , Very nice room 
127400,Park Grand Paddington Court, The hotel is being renovated so there is some construction The bed was too soft and the street noise can be heard There was no elevator to my room floor not sure if there was one at all to the other floors , Value for money Coffee and tea facilities and big modern room 
127401,Park Grand Paddington Court, Check in was a little slow as there was a queue as it was busy I don t like the fact that if you register for their loyalty scheme you only get points if you book directly with them and not through Booking com, It s location is great And the rooms are very comfortable I had a Club Room that was reasonable in size clean and well appointed 
127402,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, When we arrived we got a room that we found very small and not so good The staff was very friendly and gave us an other room that met our expectations We appreciated that very much 
127403,Park Grand Paddington Court, evening dining limited to bar area food just ok ate there one of our 3 nights stay very little space in room to get by between wall and end of bed, comfy bed good selection at breakfast friendly staff 
127404,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, I loved the room decoration and amenities I was amazed by the free mobile phone they provided me free calls and 3G data throughout London The staff was very helpful and polite Strategic location near Paddington metro station 
127405,Park Grand Paddington Court, Relatively small room but a minor negative in perspective, Great location with close transport links comfortable and well presented room helpful friendly staff
127406,Park Grand Paddington Court, Did not like that 1st room offered was not in hotel but over the road Also was in a basement with a queen size bed Double De Lux booked 4 rooms later room was excellent Manger could not do enough but reception staff mocked our complaint , 4th room offered clean and quiet
127407,Park Grand Paddington Court, Starting with the lady I spoke to in reservations who pretty much didn t care if we stayed or didn t She was very rude and put me right off reception was basically made up of all trainees who were particularly friendly at all robotic and did not make me feel welcome at all Breakfast again was a let down Room was alright but for 160 I felt I should have shopped around more for a hotel which is able to deliver better service Lucky for us it was only the one night we stayed so it didn t ruin our time in London but I would not recommend or stay again myself , The concierge who brought our bags each day was lovely 
127408,Park Grand Paddington Court, Had trouble with the wifi and the hotel staff struggled to get it working , The bed was roomy and comfortable and the room felt quite spacious Excellent rainforest style shower added a feeling of luxury 
127409,Park Grand Paddington Court, Wifi can drop out stairs are a problem with suitcases but staff happy to help, Location is excellent close to station and lots of places to eat bearby
127410,Park Grand Paddington Court,No Negative, Perfect location near paddington and Lancaster gate station varieties of resturants and cafes even receptionist were so friendly and kind a girl called Corina at the reception gave me a club reward card when I left very clean room and toilet towels are changed every day I really recommend this hotel for every one wants to stay in the center of London and big thank for the whole staff over there
127411,Park Grand Paddington Court, It would have been nice to have been in the main hotel for the convenience as this is why I booked it in the first place I was given a tiny room in the basement facing the main road The room was ok for a couple of nights as I was out all day but I had to eat my dinner on the bed as it was so small I was a little disappointed as this was supposed to be a double deluxe room The prices should be lower to reflect the lack of space Also 15 for breakfast is extortionate , Bed was very comfortable and no noise from other rooms It was nice to have a microwave There was also a free phone that you could take out and make calls from but I didn t use it 
127412,Park Grand Paddington Court, Ground floor room on street next to entrance to annex across the road was very noisy Mattress was totally shot with a crater in it very uncomfortable and impossible to sleep on Room rather small for double and decor tired and scruffy , Location was fairly good for shopping and museums etc 
127413,Park Grand Paddington Court, The status lights of the fire system in the ceiling and the electronic do not disturb system are so bright that one can see around the room at night not enough to read by but very disturbing I had to use a sleep mask The room temperature seemed difficult to lower and ventilation rates seemed poor through the built in ducting The sash window could be opened but had restraints limiting it to a few inches A very thick duvet meant that I was too hot to sleep comfortably The compact rooms are too small to fit in not a chair there is merely a stool for the desk , The staff work very hard to keep the place immaculate It is a quiet place and close to Paddington main line rail and tube stations Bayswater is walkable for restaurants shopping and nightlife The free wifi had a strong signal and was very fast

127477,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was some bad smell coming from the rooms passage Some noise from upper floors at night probably this was because of some kids playing in their room , The hotel offers all its guests a mobile handy phone with unlimited domestic calls within UK and five Int l destination US Canada India KSA and UAE free mobile date This is very useful Staff is very helpful 
127478,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bar was quiet and often unattended Wfi signal was not brilliant, The bed and shower were very good also included tea and coffee The staff were very efficient and the breakfast in the morning was very good value for money and whilst it was very busy due to the Party in the Park tables were cleared very quickly 
127479,Park Grand Paddington Court, For a 5 star hotel we were very disappointed in the layout of the sleeping room We were there for a week but there was no room for the second suitcase No chest of drawers the space instead was taken up with a useless bar fridge Also a nice but useless leather bench at the end of the bed could have had some drawers or shelves but was really just in the way I think the management should re think the room layout , superbly built hotel with all the first class amenities Quiet except for the screaming couple near our room He would get back at midnight and they would have a row Great location near Selfridges Bathroom elegant Nice bar downstairs

127485,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was a slight problem with the check in But the manager of the hotel took care of it for us , Really close to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express 
127486,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was so small we couldn t open 2 suitcases at the same time If you put the suitcase on the luggage rack you couldn t open the closet door or get to the desk The bathroom was tiny No counter space to put toiletry bag I had to put it in the sink The pillows were hard and flat and the bed very small , Convenient location friendly staff updated room
127487,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room that we had for our first two nights was completely inadequate Rm 405 The stairs are dangerous and i fell carrying our big suitcase There are no windows and no effective air conditioning If this was the only room available i would never stay here again , Breakfast was excellent The room we had for our second stay Rm 132 was very acceptable
127488,Park Grand Paddington Court, There were steps towards the room You could ask staff for help to move the luggages but it was still a bit annoying , Facilities in room were great The floor of bathroom was warm The room was spacious The air in the room was fresh

127491,Park Grand Paddington Court, The bed was too hard After a long day sightseeing it would be nice to fall into a softer more comfortable bed , The property was exactly as described The king club room was large for a hotel in the UK It was comparable in size to most US hotels And the rain shower head was a welcome surprise 
127492,Park Grand Paddington Court, Really not a lot maybe a better bar menu for people who don t do biryani , We thought the property was very central to Oxford street etc and the Royal parks all within reasonable walking distance

127494,Park Grand Paddington Court, The restaurant staff were a bit grumpy and abrupt restaurant too small and cramp, Location was good nice rooms reception staff very friendly and helpful
127495,Park Grand Paddington Court, There was a mix up when it came to checking us in to our room so the process took over an hour It was eventually dealt with but at no point were we offered much of an apology or a drink at the bar while they sorted out the mess which was disappointing The shower door in our room didn t close properly wither but it didn t affect the quality of the stay overall , The hotel was nice enough and in a good location 
127496,Park Grand Paddington Court, I needed to make some changes to my booking prior to arrival and although my booking allowed it staff I emailed and spoke to by phone were very unhelpful , Comfortable and we ll located

127500,Park Grand Paddington Court, The pictures on the booking com is totally misleading The room is very old way too small only fit a double bed n nothing else I bet u in if u are 200lbs u cannot fit in the bedroom , Only location nothing else we like

127502,Park Grand Paddington Court, We did not like the small room And the floor of the room was very skew We had to sleep the other way around in the bed which was also only a 3 4 bed very tight That was a bit frustrating to have no space in that room , We liked the location And that we had a fridge and coffee maker in the room Two little supermarkets across the street which was very convenient And good Restaurants close by 
127503,Park Grand Paddington Court, The room was a little small however perfect as a base , We had a free smart phone in our room that we could take out and use in the city that also allowed us to make free calls and was pre loaded with maps and other usefull applications 
127504,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room was far too small this said it served its purpose Electricity kept going off on the sockets This happened 3 times in the space of 24 hours While the staff where relatively quick in sorting this out is was an inconvenience On the second morning our stock of light snacks was not replenished , Friendly and helpful staff Fantastic location Clean and tidy facilities 
127505,Park Grand Paddington Court, The green light on the ceiling that lit up the room too much during the night , Ground floor room spacious lovely and clean the staff were so helpful The location was perfect Would definitely stay here again

127508,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rooms were very small so with 2 large suitcases put on the floor there wasn t much room to walk around but it didn t really matter entirely for a short night stay , Hotel was very nice and modern Staff were very friendly and helpful A handy phone was provided which we were able to take out with us to use Internet maps phone calls and texts which was a great bonus Buffet breakfast was had a good variety 5 10 minute walk to the Paddington station so it was very convenient 
127509,Park Grand Paddington Court, Room size on the small side so it was compact but saying that it was a lovely room very well appointed , Very comfortable very clean with everything you need in a hotel room Helpfull polite friendly staff Good location Good price Would definitely recommend would book again 
127510,Park Grand Paddington Court, It was a further walk to the train underground than I thought , The Staff were very friendly and offered assistance when ever they could The room came equipped with an adapter for US electrical plug ins That was a nice feature 
127511,Park Grand Paddington Court, Getting to the room was like navigating a maze If I had had heavy luggage or a lot of it it would have been difficult to manage all the fire doors The valet helped me on the way in and I probably could have called for help on the way out but I just dealt with it myself , The room was very very quiet clean and stylish The staff were great generous attentive and unpretentious Location is good too 
127512,Park Grand Paddington Court, Although I am a frequent customer of the Hotel for over two years I am denied the chance to change my dates although I have offered to pay additional charges on the new rates for the new dates if they were higher Just because I made a mistake and choose during reservation non cancelable option I was not given the chance to correct my reservation dates even though I called both Booking com and the Hotel with in an hour time and even telling me that it would be possible if I call them when my new dates are fixed So for this reservation The Hotel charged me for the two nights that I did not stay This is not a big sum but in Principle shows how both BOOKING COM and the HOTEL considers its customers A simple considerate approach would not have hurt them and they could have been better off by charging me a bit more but instead they choose to be an un Customer Friendly hotel and acted with zero empty It is a shame that a Hotel I enjoyed staying does this to a loyal customer ,No Positive
127513,Park Grand Paddington Court, Rooms were a bit small only about 9 clearance between bottom of beds and wall to walk past , Staff very helpful dealt with noisy neighbours promptly
127514,Park Grand Paddington Court, rooms were too small you can not have a space for 2 suitcases even and the price was too high compared to room size even after upgrading to a suite , I liked the location and staff only

127713,Park Grand Paddington Court, My stay at this hotel was a nightmare I checked in at 9 00 PM and was taken to a room in which there was hair on the duvet sheets and pillows on each of the two single beds I politely complained to the staff at the front desk and was taken to another room Unfortunately there was hair all over that bed as well I then complained once more and was given a so called suite in the annex across the street This room was dingy and there was a lot of noise coming from an adjacent room but the sheets were at least clean and I was able to fall asleep with ear plugs , Nothing

127762,Park Grand Paddington Court, The hotel gave us a room not in the main building Also the room wasn t in a real floor it was between two floors in the middle of the stairs What makes it worse the size of the room We reserved a bigger room to get more comfort and it turns out that the hotel calculate the room entrance with the room size and that particular space is useless There were almost no space surrounding the bed It was so tiny room We were deceived , Good location Friendly staff

127764,Park Grand Paddington Court, I didn t like the fact I paid for a double room but I just got two twin beds put together but it didn t cause that much of a hassle just something to moan about Also as a newly refurbished building it was lovely but in the room the lighting was appalling they need extra lights as it is so dark Also by our room door was a door onto a roof but a lower level one as we were basically on the lower ground floor this was simply padlocked but was open like an inch so it didn t make us feel too safe and secure at night As well with the windows these obviously haven t been refurbished as they are so old and not secure also they are full with steam and dew in the morning and get the floor soaked , The hotel was easy to find and only a 3 minute walk from the Lancaster Gate tube station Only taking 4 minutes by tube to get you to Oxford Street Bond Street and 6 minutes away from Westfield Shopping Cerntre by tube so it really does have a good location 3 minutes walk over to Hyde Park near the lake side which is nice The customer service was great too they offered any help with whatever we needed and also made it that little bit extra special in the room with an upgrade too as it was my birthday very lucky Amazing value for money is the best thing for two nights is basically the price of one in a night so great hotel Couldn t really fault it for the price

127781,Park Grand Paddington Court, I didnt like the lay out of the room it was very small with two single beds one at each side One bed had a flat screen tv at the side of it and a large mirror at other side hidden by side of bed So you wouldnt be comfortable watching tv lying in bed And the other bed was situated so far away you wouldnt see tv at all Not comfortable if you want to relax in bed Also when i booked hotel i requested a late leaving time while i was there i mentioned this again at front desk But unfortunately i was met with a call with a member of staff huffing and puffing as i explained my email request and mentioning at desk That doesn t make me feel relaxed and i don t find that very professional to behave like that to a paying customer especially when i was down in London for important interviews , the room was clean and tidy

127790,Park Grand Paddington Court, We had specifically ordered a room with two single beds a Deluxe room This was important to us mostly because we needed separate duvets because we can t sleep sharing a double duvet At arrival the staff said that our room had been upgraded and I said that was OK as long as the new room had two single beds They said yes no worries When we got to the room we immediately reacted to it having a double bed with a double duvet We told the porter that we didn t want this room unless we could get another duvet He then went and fetched one extra for us , The hotel porter that helped carry our suitcases and showed us the room was very nice and very helpful He even did a great extra help for us to find us an extra duvet This pretty much saved our stay see next comment The breakfast was good

127806,Park Grand Paddington Court, The picture of the room I booked didn t match the one we were put in We were in the club room which was right next to the maintenance or cleaners room and we could hear everything Banging of doors hoovering chatter For someone that s a light sleeper this wasn t helpful I did ask to see the other rooms which the staff were kind enough to show us They were much more newer but the staff made it out that I would be getting a downgrade The bathroom was tiny Not much room to manoeuvre in Also I ve been to another of Park Grand s chain in Earl s Court which was much better so I m comparing to that one , The location was perfect really easy to get to central London from there and Hyde park was just around the corner

127809,Park Grand Paddington Court, Nothing at all , This hotel is a real gem and for zone 1 in London utterly astonishing for the price I was greeted by smiling and very welcoming staff and upgraded on check in The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable with the bonus of an empty fridge The bar was a pleasant place to relax The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Paddington station and is in a quiet location for the area with plenty of local shops and restaurants within seconds I didn t eat breakfast there so I can t comment on that I suspect though given the excellent standard of the hotel that I would have been more than satisfied It was an absolute pleasure to stay there

127845,Park Grand Paddington Court, we booked a double bedroom We actually got a smaller than double bed and a single bed in the room which we then had to push together so we could both comfortable fit The heating wasn t working so we were cold throughout the night Which left us both very tired the next day We paid for breakfast the following morning and couldn t believe how disappointing it was Poor selection very poor quality Some of the hot food was cold the scrambled egg was runny Bacon was barley cooked and more fat than bacon plus it tasted of tomato I m guessing they were cooked on the same griddle but it worries me about any vegetarians that may have gone for the tomatoes So what started a brilliant stay turned into a night mare by the time it came to leaving we were just glad to get out If it hadn t been for the great staff and cleanliness I would have seen the manager , The staff were attentive and hotel was very nice and clean and offered lots of great facilities We were showed to our room and given all the information needed and each time we entered or left the hotel we were acknowledge It was very friendly and nice The staff are brilliant

127855,Park Grand Paddington Court, We chose the compact room and it was VERY compact Great for a single person but a bit crowded with two people I d get the bigger room next time Nice and quiet area although we were constantly on the train to get to the city as we were just there for sightseeing so I d stay closer to Soho City Oxford Circus area next time , The service was very good Everyone was helpful and nice All of the amenities in the hotel were new clean and modern

127860,Park Grand Paddington Court, Smoke alarms went off in my room in the middle of the night triggered by smokers in another room Check in time of 20 minutes was monstrously inefficient When lobby is full of arriving guests receptionists need a shorter version of their check in script such as not being so concerned to take deposits off unwilling guests , Mainly the location Staff were pleasant but in need of better management
