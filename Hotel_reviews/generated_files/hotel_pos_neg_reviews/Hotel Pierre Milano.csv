472697,Hotel Pierre Milano, On arrival there was a very friendly gentleman who assisted with our baggage and parking but unfortunately not when we checked out and were in a hurry for the airport , Excellent location walking distance to Duomo and to the very lively Navigli neighbourhood The rooms are comfortable and updated breakfast is excellent and the staff was courteous if perhaps a little stiff The hotel itself is not very large and has no spa or fitness facilities which I would have expected of a 5star but it had everything that you require and the accommodations are more than adequate I would recommend and I would definitely return 
472698,Hotel Pierre Milano, Air condition did not work Staff not helpful Looked angry when I tolded them twice that it was 28 Degrees in our room After a while the let us change room No apologies they wanted to go back to their computers quickly ,No Positive
472699,Hotel Pierre Milano, I didn t like the facilities as well the time for the clean of the room they told us you leave the room beforc four O clock otherwise tomorrow will be clean the room also the items in the bathroom not cmpleated as other hotel beside why no water in the room for drink if that so why they have to charg us, I like the stuff especially Max who help us a lot
472700,Hotel Pierre Milano, I had few issues but the hotel was good at solutions deals, Although it is in the middle of the city it was really quite Always had the lift waiting for me strange but nice The style matches the city Convenient to go around 
472701,Hotel Pierre Milano, this hotel is not 5 stars hotel it is probably 2 or 3 starts max I already talked to Booking to change the hotel s rating as it is really misleading the people who used to stay in 5 or 4 stars hotels , location is good Staff are very respective
472702,Hotel Pierre Milano, Breakfast poor for a 5 hotel Bacon was very soft and eggs just a large blob Juice was obviously from a packet We felt it could have been more exciting, Room very quiet and comfortable
472703,Hotel Pierre Milano, Some but not all of the reception staff are surly and unpleasant Check in and check out were unpleasant experiences I can t imagine anyone caring less about their guests , Decor of the room was lovely The location is amazing 
472704,Hotel Pierre Milano, The hotel is in a major construction zone and therefore very noisy Street is very torn up so getting there is tricky via taxi Rooms were very small even by european standards We probably should have asked to be moved but we were OK to stay where we were , Staff was friendly and very helpful 
472705,Hotel Pierre Milano, Room stuffy Pillows hard No face washer or conditioner for hair I thought it was expensive for a five star hotel and also didn t realise it was so far from the international airport, Breakfast was nice
472706,Hotel Pierre Milano, Staff were not helpful almost to the point of being rude Rooms are much smaller than advertised I don t see how they are considered 5 stars more like 3 stars Very disappointed ,No Positive
472707,Hotel Pierre Milano, It s an older hotel room furniture was outdated but it was clean and well maintained , The vehicle parking and the location it is just outside of the city center so you can easily access the hotel by car 
472708,Hotel Pierre Milano,No Negative, Great view of the water and convenient waterfront location Near a variety of restaurants and the old city Friendly helpful staff excellent breakfast 
472709,Hotel Pierre Milano, Beds and the sleeping couch were not comfortable we all ended up having back pains The hotel is far away from being 5 it s 4 at the very highest The decorations are a bit old and outdated throughout the hotel Breakfast was very elementary not even close to the one we ve had in another 4 hotel in Milan We ve ordered wine from the bar downstairs and the maid has left the empty glasses in our room for days, Great location not far away from the main landmarks within walking distance Close to Navigli district with its restaurants and bars Friendly and helpful staff
472710,Hotel Pierre Milano, This hotel is 3 star at a push 4 Really expensive no facilities forget swimming pool or gym and the staff at the reception desk during check in was not very friendly They didn t even offer to bring our luggage to our room we had to carry it upstairs ourselves there is no lift between 4th and 5th floor ,No Positive
472711,Hotel Pierre Milano, The rates everywhere were jacked up for design week in Milan It s a nice hotel but we wound up paying about 3x the normal rate to stay here For the normal price I d definitely stay here again at the inflated price most likely not , It s an old hotel but our room was clean beds were comfortable and the bathroom was modern with an incredible shower Breakfast was included with our stay and it was probably the best breakfast we had during our whole trip offerings included cereal fresh pastries eggs bacon and fruit The hotel is located in a less touristy area with plenty of great places to eat English speakers will need to know some Italian to get by and we were still within a 15 min walking distance to the Duomo Easily accessible by public transportation just a short walk to the metro 
472712,Hotel Pierre Milano, The bar at the reception was always closed no atmosphere But the hotel is beautiful the staff very nice and helpful I enjoyed my stay at this hotel ,No Positive
472713,Hotel Pierre Milano, there to improve the enthusiasm on the part of some staff reception when prompted some service take special attention to some cobwebs The rest was nice to be there with our doogs , We liked the hotel location the friendliness of the maids were staying in the junior suite which contained a large balcony for the comfort of our dogs nice breakfast Its nice and classic HOtel but not a 5 star HOtel 
472714,Hotel Pierre Milano, I genuinely regret to say I was disappointed with my stay The room was very small ok you may say but the walls must be paper thin as I could hear the person next door snoring and in the morning talking on his phone just not acceptable for a so called 5 star hotel It is not ,No Positive

472716,Hotel Pierre Milano, The wi fi wasn t very good in my room and the bed was a bit hard , Great location Duomo Teatro alla Scala and Santa Maria are in walking distance Minutes from Via Torino and other venues for shopping The staff was very friendly and the room very clean quiet and warm The decoration was lovely and the price was very good The breakfast is served until 11 which is good for non early birds 
472717,Hotel Pierre Milano, Air conditioning did not work but fortunately could open a window WiFi terrible Front desk staff particularly females rather cool attitude , Great location near to all the sights Walking distance to numerous local restaurants and coffee shops and taxi rank Large very comfortable bed Spacious clean room Rooms at the back are quiet Breakfast excellent 
472718,Hotel Pierre Milano, It seems that staff has been brought from 1 star hotel very rude and un friendly attitude Internet speed was very low , Very well designed cozy and clean 
472719,Hotel Pierre Milano, I believe this is a 4 star hotel not 5 based on its amenities There was no hot water pot or coffee available in the room There was no free drinking water there was no 24 hour room service I wanted coffee at 6 am i was told to wait until breakfast starts at 7 Breakfast was included but I was told that I could only have what was served not order eggs as I wanted them cooked There was only 1 waiter setting up and serving coffee It was strange to say the least , The location of the hotel is great a few minutes walk to the center and all the shopping 
472720,Hotel Pierre Milano, Awful experience terrible service and definitely rooms not worth the money Below average breakfast and the staff were just horrible Room wasn t ready and the staff are not even respectful forget about nice We had the junior suit and wasn t happy with anything at all I can t believe how this is a 5 star hotel , Location that s it

472724,Hotel Pierre Milano,No Negative, I thought the room was beautifully decorated gold textured fabric covered walls spotlessly clean and fairly large by European standards I thought the helpfulness of staff particularly Viviana who was able to lend me an adaptor for my electrical devices and arrange a snack for me while I waited a very short while for my room preparation since I had arrived exceptionally early and Nicolas was outstanding

472726,Hotel Pierre Milano, Stayed for 4 days and on my third day morning I had a tour at 7 am and wanted to check on breakfast before I left and the guy at the reception was very rude and didn t allow me to go down stairs to check although it was just 10 minutes to 7 , Location
