121261,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es,No Negative, The breakfast was very tasty I appreciated the fact that it was very complete and rich pastries fresh orange juice coffee tea etc There is one for everyone s taste The rooms were well equipped with free wifi access and air conditioning The staff was kind and available whenever you have a request or you need advice to taste a new restaurant in the area 
121262,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es,No Negative, I really enjoyed my stay at Holiday Inn Paris Elys es It was unique The location of the hotel was just perfect in the heart of Paris which was a real asset since I wanted to visit the city I also have to highlight the cleanliness of the hotel and the smell when you enter in the hotel the smell of orange blossom was so nice Thanks to the staff you all were available kind and professional 
121263,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, Our room did not have view at all Everything what we could see was a wall of other building For such price view could be better or room with no view could be cheaper Also room was quite small , Staff was really polite and helpful Hotel is in the really good location metro station is just around the corner and it is easy to go to the main locations 
121264,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, My colleagues were sad because there were no crepes on the last day there s not loads of choice for breakfast which makes 18 a bit much , Nice hotel clean modern We liked the location shops and restaurants within walking distance 
121265,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, Washbowl choking fixed only later next day after claims to 3 people staff not trying to resolve this and other minor issues quickly Ceiling in bath very low wardrobe located strangely and inconveniently Elevator needs fixing , Good location supported by Metro station in a walking distance
121266,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, Wifi was too slow and there was a dent in one of the single beds The lift was dodgy Also the breakfast was limited not as continental as expected because there was no baked beans or hash browns which is a shame, The bed and facilities in the bedroom
121267,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es,No Negative, Location is excellent metro station is 2 minutes walk and very close to attractions by metro Staff was super nice and helpful also as we were traveling with a child gave us a bigger room which was very understanding 
121268,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, I dont think there is anything wrong with it U get what u paid for , The location is perfect Not too far from eiffel tower n value for money The staff is very helpful 
121269,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, This is a ghost house During my 2 days visit I could see very few people only The corridors of the hotel is too narrow It was filled with black waste bags and used bed linen I am wondering how they got four stars I never expected this from a Holiday Inn hotel I have shifted to another hotel after 2 days horrible stay , Nothing
121270,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, Remote control of the TV was not working wifi and 3G was not reachable at the room I have to stand by the door or at the lobby Room was very small and they didn t updated my room using my Platinum Elite membership of IHG , Location of the hotel is wonderful 
121271,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, The housekeeping staff were not consistent When we arrived we didn t have conditioner or body lotion The second day we did but they didn t restock the tea coffee or milk The third day we got two bath shower gel but no conditioner and also no milk But we did get tea and coffee The key thing this hotel could improve is a check list for housekeeping so everyday the room is made up identically and consistently , The location was fantastic the staff were helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable Would stay here again 
121272,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, The only negative point with this hotel is the rooms size where it is small but in general I would recommend this hotel and I will come again In the future , The hotel location is excellent about 7 min from champs elysees Very clean and modern The main positive point of this hotel is the staff they are doing everything to make you happy 
121273,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, It s not value for money The breakfast spread and restaurant menu is very basic Service staff need to be more courteous Overall it cannot be called a Holiday Inn hotel,No Positive
121274,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, I think the hotel needs some small maintenance such as new iron and making some fixtures secure but these details really are small The rooms are small but big enough for what you need I wouldn t ask the hotel for a taxi back to the airport as you will receive a really nice car but will be more expensive then a meter taxi who have a fixed airport faire but if you would rather have a really nice private car then it s the best price you will get due to the special deal the hotel have with Uber, The Staff where fantastic they couldn t do more for me I have a disability and the hotel made sure I was catered for I had great contact before my stay and received great recommendations and even made reservations for restaurants and taxi through the hotel without ever feeling I was asking too much They really define great customer service I would go as far as saying some of the best customer service I have received it was great Location is great it really is a great base for traveling a really good metro station with good links is a minute away at the most 
121275,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, Location very far from champs its about 15 mins walking housekeeping is extremely bad i used one Spon on the next day after the cleaning of the room it was in the same place and it was dirty and they r not filling the toilet stuff if u ise it no more WiFi is very week breakfast is very bad the staff was only one per duty at night In my 1st night i asked for slippers the receptionist told me to come down to get it ur self because he is alone then when i went down he tolded me im sorry its out of stock , Nothing really
121276,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, At first the hotel was a bit far off from the attractions But when you are familiar with the route and the transport i e trains and bas route it s very easy to reach Paris main attractions , Clean and comfortable hotel Friendly and helpful staff If you like to walk the hotel is within walking distance 1 3km from Arc de Triomphe Champs Elysees Eiffel Tower etc 
121277,Holiday Inn Paris Elys es, When i drew the curtains there was a big white stain on it which didn t look too appealing, The staff were very welcoming helpful and friendly The hotel is in a perfect location walking distance from the station and other attractions and not too far from the main train station Gar du Nord The decor in the main lobby is also stunning
