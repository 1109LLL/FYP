495982,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Decor tired staff on the whole not particularly friendly no English channels on tv hence not particularly child friendly wifi not working properly , Bar and gardens to te rear central loacation
495983,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Not much Only thing was that check in was a little slow but not a deal breaker , The location was fantastic Very central and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do A supermarket about 40m down the road which was handy for bits and pieces We loved the bar downstairs great for people watching at night time If you get there around 7pm grab a drink and then you can partake in the small buffet as well Cold meats salads cheeses pasta dish pizza slices bread and vegetable sticks Perfect if you don t want a huge meal Just stay nibble have a couple of drinks watch the people and enjoy the music Rooms were very clean and if a reasonable size Staff very friendly and nothing was a bother Definitely stay there again 
495984,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Checked in a room at 7pm that was not clean items from previous guests were inside bad not made and bathroom not clean Big fanction with loud music under our window , Staff were helpfull
495985,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Everything is in the room were old The room were noisy and the window was broken I felt like staying in the my grand mom home , The bad was very comfy The room were big Breakfast was very satisfying Personnel were very friendly Lobby restaurant garden were very nice Location was good 
495986,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Needs a refurbish as it s a splendid historical building but various piecemeal decorators have had a go at it, Service is very good especially the concierge Close to shopping and 15mins walk from the Duomo 
495987,Sheraton Diana Majestic, The pictures are not even close to reality The hotel was dirty Dirt on all the walls in the rooms dirt in the corners of the bathrooms It is like a 2 star hotel inside and nothing like the pictures Additionally you are posting fake pictures of the rooms The double rooms you show are nice and clean and big with the furniture on the end of the bed The real rooms you can barely walk around the bed that s how small it is You have to squeeze between the bed and the place for your luggage The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting and looks like its falling Apart even the silicone finishing in the bathrooms are giving up on life brown turning black on lots of places such as bathtub sink around the edges of the room itself It s honestly the biggest disappointment I ve had in any hotel so far And apparently the pictures they show online as a double room the staff tells you on arrival is actually wrong pictures and it s a junior suite Well done when people pay for something that is fake advertisement We had to change the hotel cos there was no way you can have a kid there as it s not clean at all Shame Good thing is location that might save you some times, Location only Hotel is not even close to 4 star
495988,Sheraton Diana Majestic, I checked in to the hotel at 730pm There was an event in the bar Its was like arriving at businessman s rave my room was on the 4th floor and i still heard the noise Not good for a bussiness traveler , room service was quite nice 
495989,Sheraton Diana Majestic, room far too hot breakfast far too expensive and nowhere to have a drink in the evening unless you wanted to join the noisy night club, staff helpful and location
495990,Sheraton Diana Majestic, small room air cond not working very hot mosquitos Old bathroom shower not working so well old furnitures the nice bar was closed due to an event loud music all night not a nice experience and not worth the money ,No Positive
495991,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Not much to dislike here Just sorry our trip was only a few days , The location was excellent the staff on reception were very helpful and happy to help our room was very comfortable with a nice view overlooking the gardens cocktails were good too certainly recommend 
495992,Sheraton Diana Majestic, The room is quite old fashioned big contrast from the lobby , The hotel staff and bar were amazing The room is of good size although not what we would expect from Sheraton Yet I assume in Italy this is of good quality The location is quite central a 10mins walk to central and duomo cathedral or a 5 mins subway 
495993,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Nothing, Staff were really helpful with recommendations for restaurants and how to get around Milan Good location short walk to main shopping area and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and the Duomo
495994,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Fitness center is closed for fashion photoshooting but during check in they said renovation i stayed for one night but the room was really small compare the price that i have been charged should have stay in westin palace next time definitely and lastly they told me they will inform about the gym usage but nobody informed till I checked out , Location the doormen is outstanding very helpfull the service at breakfast is great
495995,Sheraton Diana Majestic,No Negative, The H Club bar where you can have aperitifs with the beautiful people in the early evening and a long leisurely breakfast overlooking their stunning and leafy courtyard the morning after
495996,Sheraton Diana Majestic, It was warm in the room and we were told they couldn t turn on the air conditioning system as it wasn t turned on for the season It was April so some days it was cold and they needed the heating on and some days it was warm then they couldn t turn on the air conditioning beacuse they had to choose air conditioning or heating This resulted in 25 degrees in the room and problems sleeping They solved it with a fan but the fan was very loud when it was turn on ,No Positive
495997,Sheraton Diana Majestic,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and helpful I booked this hotel as a gift for my parents anniversary and the staff made it a very special experience for them I was delighted 
495998,Sheraton Diana Majestic, The hotel is in a very old building and the rooms haven t been updated in a while so you may have to look past it It is a bit no frills but very clean , The staff is EXCELLENT They are welcoming extremely helpful and friendly This place feels like home The location is a few minutes walk to the Milano Centrale train station so you can get anywhere Great restaurants nearby plenty of shopping and gelato I couldn t say more good things about the staff they were just great

496001,Sheraton Diana Majestic, Noise from the street very loud on Friday night believe it was people leaving the hotel bar I did overhear during check out that they are going to start sound proofing this summer Had to pay 80 euros for a rollaway bed for 8 year old breakfast not included , Location 5 minutes to metro tram stop Nice shops restaurants close by Less than 10 minutes by taxi to Milano Centrale station Very spacious room bathroom 
496002,Sheraton Diana Majestic, The AC was not working as the heating system was on something very strange but was told that it is because of city regulations looks like Milan has strange regulations if it is true , Staff is excellent and takes care of you more than expected location right in the heart of the city hotel is old but Sheraton class Breakfast is limited but good enough as per our expectations Parking is no stress as the congergie employees take care of it completely and makes sure you are completely relaxed Hotel Service is the best in class We will surely stay again in this hotel during our next visit
