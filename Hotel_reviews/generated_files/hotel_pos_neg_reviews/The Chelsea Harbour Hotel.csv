299346,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Soul less another corporate lobby no ambience whatsoever Felt like an office block at weekend However if you see your room more as an apartment then it s fine , We chose the hotel based on location as we wanted to source items from the showrooms in the design centre next door Room was good value for London given the separate sitting area etc Handy for King s Road restaurants etc Ritorno 5 mins by taxi very good modern Italian 
299347,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, As always a very nice experience at this hotel Staff are great food excellent A very relaxing hotel but very close to the busy streets of London if you want to explore 
299348,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Breakfast included would have been nice Apart from that no faults at all , A beautiful hotel with excellent facilities Unfortunately it s a little far out taxi to Sloane Square about 10 and there s not much to do in an evening Staff were extremely helpful and polite and we were thrilled to be given a complimentary upgrade to marina view suite 
299349,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The TV and menu system was so slow it was actually painful The gym was more of a token gesture and not up to scratch To get to the gym you have to use a crappy service elevator at the far end of the hotel which made a poor experience even worse On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a room with a view but this came at extra cost To be honest they weren t busy and outside our window was a building site as such I think they really should have given us a complimentary upgrade as it wouldn t have cost them anything Besides the room they were going to upgrade us to was exactly the same as the room we stayed in it was just overlooking the water instead of a building site The hotel is quite a way out of town and taxis are around GBP 20 35 to get to central London depending on traffic , Each room is a suite at this hotel I stayed here before quite a few years ago when it was the Conrad Hilton Nothing has changed in the rooms decor wise which is no bad thing as the rooms are perfectly laid out All fixtures and fittings are of high quality great water pressure for the showers Some nice restaurants on the Fulham Road within easy walking distance 
299350,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Prices were very expensive this time although I booked months in advance , Clean modern comfortable roomy lovely roomy suite shower and bath and bidet very clean and comfortable food and drink very good if a little expensive Thames path good for my mprning run or walk if feeling lazy Staff first class 
299351,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, Excellent hotel really good rooms and the staff on reception were very friendly and efficient The only down side is we did not have enough time to enjoy all the facilities 
299352,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, At times the staff took your order but would come with something else But I did not complain about that As they appear busy, How clean the hotel was and locality overall really nice hotel
299353,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Reception staff seemed a bit frosty Doesn t help that they were all EAL Afternoon tea took an hour to arrive Bread was stale pretty poor afternoon tea What was that tea blend Vile Pretty poor hotel really expect the hair salon , I walked into the hairdressing salon and they put my hair up straight away Not just excellent service but the guys were absolutely lovely could of talked to them all day An absolute asset to the hotel And my hair was amazing 
299354,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, I was disappointed with my room for the price paid I have stayed a number of times before and always felt I had had good value for money and paid for a river view this time which was more expensive but the rooms were smaller and the view was no better than ones on lower floors, This is a lovely hotel very clean comfortable and welcoming
299355,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Parking charges as a wedding party we recommended the Chelsea harbour and at least ten other people booked in As it was out honeymoon it would have been a lovely jesture to have waived the 2 nights charges, We booked this for our honeymoon night and my partner stayed the night before He thoroughly enjoyed his stay pre wedding I would have liked to have stayed longer to enjoy all the facilities
299356,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Breakfast was okay but had to request more juice glasses and the toast took forever to arrive even after 2 requests Also a rubber strip on the floor near the breakfast table was causing people to trip health and safety issue , The size of our twin room was amazing The view was fantastic overlooking the marina The concierge was so helpful and friendly A big thank you My friend and I would definitely use this hotel again and would recommend 
299357,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, Great hotel Lovely views and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony overlooking the harbour We also enjoyed drinking cocktails outside with a view of the harbour A lovely stay 
299358,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Very noisey due to building site directly outside our window so don t expect the views that you see on line Have had better room a few snagging points at a travel Inn , Foyer is lovely but suite wasn t anything special 
299359,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The air conditioning I have stayed probably 5 times in the last 8 months first time I insisted on moving rooms now I don t bother asking as no room I have been in for the past 5 times has working aircon On top of that you cannot open the windows A tip for visitors is to shell out the extra for a Marina View with a balcony or any room with a balcony then at lest you will be able to open the doors , Its a cracking hotel all suites great value Been staying there for years when I am in town unlikely to stay anywhere else in London Perfect if you have a youngster who can sleep in the other room of the suite ask for a pull out bed You won t find these sized rooms for this price anywhere else in London 
299360,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Staff in restaurant were very slow and not very attentive Pool area wasn t as nice as it looked from pictures quite tired and chilly , Lovely view over the harbour from the restaurant and patio heaters to keep you warm Suite was very big and really nice Hotel was in a great location tucked away but central 
299361,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, We stayed here for our wedding night was a lovely hotel check in staff were great My husband left his wedding ring at the hotel in our room by the coffee machine He phoned the hotel and they were adamant they didn t find it He continuously rang them was put on hold for half hour at a time kept advising they didn t find the ring when my husband said he was going to take things further they said they will ring him back Surprise surprise we got a call back to say the ring had been found in the bed linen The bed and the coffee machine were in 2 seperate rooms and the ring didn t go anywhere near the bedroom so for it to be found in the bed linen is quite strange in the waste bin yes more understandable One of the cleaners had come across a beautiful expensive wedding ring and thought theyd pocket it when the hotel manager realised we weren t gonna leave it they found the ring miraculously ,No Positive
299362,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Service in the restaurant was slow I ordered a rose process and was given a flat pink drink which was swapped for pink champagne when I complained ,No Positive

299364,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Poor staff in Resturant and Bar utterly disgraceful they all need to be given a lesson in how to work in the catering business OMG very poor service diabolical,No Positive
299365,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The service in the bar and restaurant could have been much better We were kept waiting for a long time before our drinks order was taken and then the drinks never came The hotel is in a lovely location but a little far out from the city centre and from the mainline train stations , The Marina View Suite was excellent with a lovely view of the boats from the balcony and the comfortable sitting room The room was very quiet The reception staff and concierge and doormen were very friendly and helpful It was nice to walk around the Marina and then along the river There is a good pub close by and a little walk to the overland train station Imperial Wharf to get into the city centre and also a little shop which is very convenient 
299366,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Notning, The area is amazing lovely to walk around The view from the room and having the balcony was a must The staff could not have done more to ensure we had everything we needed wanted 
299367,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Nothing at all, Large airy suite with balcony overlooking the harbour and River Thames beyond Lovely riverside walks Visiting Chelsea Flower show a perfect location for the venue 
299368,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Service in the bar and restaurant lacked any management direction so despite being really friendly and trying to be helpful didn t really know what they were doing shame , Very quite location great for London embankment attractions
299369,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Breakfast options and layout could be better We were charged VAT on the Breakfast Buffet charge of 17 50 each Why All other charges included VAT Breakfast staff would benefit from some further training Also 2 50 for a KitKat in the mini Bar what s that about , Excellent room facilities Great safe location Front of house staff excellent 
299370,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, The Hotel is conveniently situated and overlooks Chelsea Harbour Has a very nice restaurant and balcony Staff were very efficient and helpful I would highly recommend a visit
299371,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, N A, Loved the room very spacious comfortable and quiet Balcony gave a lovely spot to have a morning cuppa Staff very helpful especially Paul the concierge as we were expecting some tickets and he delivered them to us personally Amazing to see the Chelsea team leaving for the match an added bonus we weren t expecting Food also excellent along with the service 
299372,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Room very dated and they definitely need to do quality control on cleaning Carpet was very very tired Spot marks on Bathroom floor that a good mop would have cleaned The General cleanliness and the state of the carpet were definitely not 5 Star Sunday morning was like a circus in the bar breakfast reception area with football fans I am sure a lot of these were non residents in the hotel but seemed to have taken over these areas When checking out the girl never asked how our stay was if we had enjoyed it if everything was ok just have we used mini bar and that was it Won t let me upload more photos, Hotel was in a nice location had a marina view suite which was very nice Reasonably spacious suite Bed and pillows were comfortable 
299373,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Finding a used condom in my wardrobe paying 47 for breakfast being made like we shouldn t really be there because we got a cheap deal via booking com the list goes on , Location
299374,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, They charged 40 for parking my car although I have a disabled badge and they never told me this when I arrived they just said park over there They also charge 48 for a Z Bed for my 4 year old Grand daughter thats a rip off when the room was already 300 they credited the 48 after a row On the booking com page for the hotel it says children under five stay free But have since written to say that they only stay free when in the same bed I am sure Booking com bookings get given the worst rooms The Hotel is also quite tired in places there was a hole in a wall the ceiling in the shower was grubby and the decoration was tired for a five star 300 a night room They also used to give a bowl of fruit in the rooms which I see has now stopped the Hotel is not as good as it was I m afraid I have stayed there many times now and have seen it deteriorate , The size of the rooms and the beds are comfy
299375,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Wifi was not working at the property It was on and off I was told engineer is at the hotel trying to solve the issue but it has been two days without proper wifi I booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary I was expecting special treatment maybe an upgrade as I had told booking com beforehand But we were offered an upgrade with the price of 40 Spa facility was poor I was not expecting the steam and sauna room to be seperate for men n women We spent the day apart at the spa with men s steam room not working properly Only pool was shared and I found the water to be very deep for us , Room was big and bathroom and toliet were large and clean I was allowed to extend checkout by one hour free of charge 
299376,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, seperate saunas and steam rooms for men and woman obviously to appease a certain religious group and dirty mirrors round the pool area, Nice rooms and bar area
299377,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, slightly pricey but it s a hotel in Chelsea what do you expect , massive room well appointed clean and comfortable the big stand out was the staff positive bubbly attentive without being in your face perfect experience well done team 
299378,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The Spa could have been better i expected more from a 5 hotel a very basic pool with a couple jets but no jacuzzi and separate steam and sauna for males and females , The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodated to my needs My wife and I were celebrating our 4th wedding anniversary and we were provided with a cake in our room and also complementary drinks and desert with our dinner on site restaurant Chelsea Riverside Brasserie We were also provided with a room upgrade to the harbour suite for a small fee but was certainly worth it 
299379,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Problem caused by my inexperience of finding our names on arrival at reception meant an awkward wait of 20 minutes with further 20 mins as room wasn t ready However staff apologetic and subsequently very helpful , Location was brilliant for use of river bus to get in and out of C London and to avoid traffic noise Lovely views from room Spa treatment greatly appreciated by my wife Really good jazz club 606 on Lots Road only a 5 minute walk away 
299380,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The location is an issue which may explain why prices here are much lower than other similar properties in more tourist visited locations The Imperial Wharf Overground station is about four blocks away from the hotel which is fine but connecting to an Underground line other than the District line takes some effort We found the best way to Earl s Court was by bus , Service was extraordinarily friendly and competent We walked along the Thames on the footpath which was lovely

299397,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, I didn t like the way the staff was looking down on me and my partner as if we weren t suppose to say that It was clearly because we were young and black and didnt dress the way everyone else did I remember asking someone where the pool was and they were looking at us funny asking us if we were even staying at the property well obviously if I am asking were the pool is and he then went on to say yes the pool is open to residents only It just wasn t a nice experience checking in or out Sort it out we are in 2017 black people are allowed in these sort of places honey , I really liked the room and the sauna and swimming pool

299449,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The standard of service in the bar and restaurant was very poor at this visit Two rounds of drinks were spilt over myself and my guests and the situation was handled poorly The most appalling issue was that a guest was allowed to bring her large dog into the dining area of the bar no problem with that but was then allowed to produce a large bowl and proceeded to mix and prepare the dogs food standing at the dining table for two minutes and then to feed the dog next to the table This was in full view of all in the bar my guests fellow diners and the Bar and Restaurant staff , The Hotel quality and location are very good I use this Hotel often and have always received good service I ve now been invited twice to comment on my last visit but no response has been forthcoming 
299450,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, Staff was exceptionally friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us They made perfect suggestions to enhance our stay Will definitely be back

299452,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, If I was being really picky sometimes you have to wait a while for bar service but that really is being ultra picky, Everything it s a lovely hotel with great staff it s a bit out of the way for central London but good for any south of the river events Lovely staff very relaxed clean and comfortable wouldn t hesitate to go back
299453,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, just the mixed up of bills weve been billed of another rooms orders but was been resplved immediately , lovely atmosphere and very clean waiters and receptionist were very accomodating will do everything to please cuatomers we feel valued and appreciated

299458,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, We booked the River View room because it was supposed to have river views We got views of construction sites instead The hotel needs to remove the untruths from it s site Staff need more training ,No Positive
299459,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, but more recently some cuts seem to be creeping in I used yo get a bowl of fruit in the room and now I do not and some rooms are getting a little tired Also you feel screwed over for breakfast at 24 each crazy price, The staff are always helpful the room spacious which is the main reason I book there 
299460,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, booked a marina view room but mostly our view was of the restaurant roof with the weeds Had an evening meal where waiter bought us drinks that we didn t ask for thought they may have been complimentary but no they went on the bill Really don t think room was worth the price , beds very comfy most of staff were nice we were given a glass of champagne and some chocs as it was our anniversary thought we would save some till next day but cleaners took them away when they cleaned the room 
299461,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Nothing that would deflect from my overall impression , Excellent location within easy walking distance to Chelsea Flower Show and the Kings Road area Pleasant staff very willing to offer assistance Happy to extend bar facilities for a late drink Fabulous rooms suite offering great value for money Would definitely use venue again 
299462,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, 1 The shower has a fixed head and temperature too fiddly to adjust Would have appreciated an adjustable shower head 2 Not enough tea bags in the room 3 TV in bed room difficult to operate , Friendly and helpful staff responsiveness to our enquiries and and requests Appreciated the complimentary water in the room Breakfast was perfect

299464,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, We were two couples who arrived for breakfast and having sat there for half an hour quickly concluded the chaos that was coming out of the kitchen Tea coffee were being delivered to the wrong tables and the orders placed from the menu were either not met or took an unacceptable amount of time to come to the table The waiter took a long time to come to our table and take our order Fortunately we were not in a rush but this was not a pleasant experience The restaurant wasn t that busy which didn t actually explain things I don t normally respond to these sort of views but if I could score for the breakfast separately I would give 2 10 The food was good but the whole experience of just sitting there was an absolute shambles and overlooked the quality of the food when it eventually arrived , Location was very convenient for the Chelsea Flower Show Just a short taxi ride away The hotel has its own car park also I booked a marina view room which was a lovely room with a bathroom toilet and a separate toilet It wasn t exactly a marina view since the first floor room overlooked the large roof top expanse of the roof below which was a little disappointing but then we were only there for a night 
299465,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Marina view largely blocked by flat roof Dresser draw refused to stay closed Also found unwanted piece of plastic in our dinner eaten in Brasserie , Great location and very spacious accomodation Communal areas also spacious and well sited

299467,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The air conditioning wasn t up to much which meant it was a warm night and with the tube station over the road and Battersea heliport just over the river leaving the windows open wasn t really an option Also my dinner took a long time to arrive and was VERY well cooked when it turned up , For the price and in near Chelsea the room was huge Separate toilet shower and bath double sink and big separate living room with balcony it was very comfortable 
299468,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, they don t have enough staff 8 try s for reception or room service via phone no turndown service for three nights although we requested Reception very disorganised so a long check out generally understaffed, I love the location the rooms are big and light great balcony food very good Water coffee and tea in the room all great Fabulous doorman great help with taxis etc

299470,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, Location is nice enough but a bit far away from everything else The tube is actually the overland train so its a bit awkward However a nice neighborhood a well Great if you are interested in Interior design as the Interior show rooms are close in fact you are in the middle of them , The actual Hotel is quite lovely although the interiors are beginning to show some wear an tear However the actual accommodation is very nice and spacious For London most unusual The views of the bay view suites are delightful and so unlike London I enjoyed staying there and will return

299475,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel,No Negative, The room service and quality of food served was delicious beautifully presented and very good The rooms were spacious comfortable and quiet An outstanding hotel the only drawback is the location Great for shopping on the Kings road but we needed transport for the main attractions 
299476,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, The fact that it was a huge taxi ride into the city , Lovely older hotel placed by Chelsea Hsrbour A lovely spot for stylish yachts and boats right in London A good and well appointed facility however somewhat off the beaten track even the tube is overland A good hotel nevertheless if you don t mind being far away from central London Ideal if you are an Interior Designer or interested in design as its placed right in the heart of the design district An enjoyable stay nevertheless 
299477,The Chelsea Harbour Hotel, My 4th stay and it feels like it s gone downhill over the years The bed no longer has throws and the room was starting to look tired Armchairs with worn arms No nightly turn down service , The bed is very comfy The room was clean and fresh
