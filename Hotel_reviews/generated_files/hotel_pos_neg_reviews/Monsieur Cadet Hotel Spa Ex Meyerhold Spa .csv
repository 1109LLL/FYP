176935,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa ,No Negative, Hammam was great The street right outside the hotel has very good restaurants and patios Hotel bar is great as well Room was large for Paris clean and very well maintained Staff is super friendly Really recommend it 
176936,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , There was no glass around the shower hence it is very easy to make half of the bathroom wet Not very convenient Otherwise all was OK Breakfast is average and seems a bit expensive , Very spacious room for Paris Overall liked the place a lot Good location walking distance from Louvre and Tuilleries garden 
176937,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa ,No Negative, Room was very big with lots of wardrobe space and the beds were very big and comfy Staff spoke good English which was very helpful Outside table area was very nice to sit out in the evening and have a few drinks Spa was very relaxing Everything which I read about the hotel was correct and accurate
176938,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Nothing to complain , The room was bigger than expected above average room size in Paris Very well decorated and clean Things are nicely arranged and convenient The location is ideal near subway station and restaurants yet quiet enough at night with very efficient soundproof windows Staff are great politely friendly and helpful The free access to hammam aka sauna is a bonus as well 
176939,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Nothing , Comfortable and good sized room excellent position to explore the city also thanks to easy access to public transport The private use of the steam room was a plus Hotel staff very kind and helpful 
176940,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , If you need parking book in advance and remind the staff about it some days before arrival We booked the parking 1 month before arrival but the day before arrival we received the letter that no parking was available That disappointed us a lot but the personnel was helpful and friendly and resolved the problem they booked it in the nearby hotel , The location is very good 10 minutes walk to Louvre or Montmartre close to metro Spacious bathroom for Paris good bed I like the hotel 
176941,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Room was a little smaller than expected and there was a lot of noise easily heard from the street and the room directly across from us Staff could have been a little more friendly , Small hotel with easy access to metro and many shops nearby It is not located right next to any major sights but all sights were easily accessible by a short metro ride and walk 
176942,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , The cost of extras was high even by Paris standards gin and tonic 11E and even more expensive out of the mini bar Breakfast was good but at 19E I d be inclined to use one of the many good restaurants and boulangeries locally , The room was quirky fun and big by Paris standards great en suite with decent complimentary toiletries Didn t get the chance to use the spa on this trip but popped in to have a look will definitely make the time to use the facility on the next visit The staff were super friendly and accommodating when I needed to use the restaurant as a make shift meeting location and place to work from for the afternoon Oh and I when I left some of my possessions behind I got a swift email letting me know and they were held so I could collect them later the same day all round great service 
176943,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , The wifi is so so we didn t have wifi and TV for 2 days out of the 4 nights stay Didn t have the different sizes of towels we got the 1st day 3rd day we had to call for 2nd set of towels, I liked the neighborhood convenient n wth local residents feel safe 
176944,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Breakfast place is way too small with tiny tables that doesn t allow a couple to eat in comfort one lady is falling apart and can t serve all in busy time while fill in missing items that also run out of stock few time They also missing real coffee machine with espresso and cappuccino that one will expect for such high price and 4 star hotel lactose free milk or soy milk is also basic need in 4 star hotel, Good location nice and welcome hotel friendly staff good breakfast
176945,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa ,No Negative, Lovely bed very comfortable with very nice soft linen Bathroom also very clean and new The hotel was also close to the Metro for the convenience of travelling around Paris 
176946,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Wi fi, Staff very helpful rooms are big great view location has all you need close to metros and coffee restaurants and I am for sure staying there again 
176947,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Hotel was under construction Loud drilling started quite early and ran late , Great neighbourhood and close to metro grocery store restaurants 
176948,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Not sure that a very nice steam room on its own really counts as a spa hotel but still well worth the money a fantastic hotel in a great location genuinely lovely staff who looked after us so well , Staff were incredible went out of their way to help and were so attentive and kind
176949,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , It would have been nice to have been told when we booked that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment and that the Spa the bar and the restaurant were all unavailable, The staff were wonderful
176950,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , The total refurbishment of foyer breakfast area and spa The foyer was a building site We were given glasses of champagne on arrival and free breakfast in our room but this was small compensation I think we should have been informed of refurbishment before our arrival Estimated price for 3 nights was wrong by 50 , Bed very comfortable 
176951,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa ,No Negative, The rooms have space and are well equipped bathroom shower for a good price and this is Paris The staff was hyper attentive with the baby and the location is great We got an upgrade to an extreme quiet room to the inner court
176952,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , The hotel was under refurbishment but this was not mentioned anywhere at the time of booking As a result there was no steam bath marked clearly in bold as a selling point at time of booking and there was no restaurant There were also no keys available for the hotel rooms this meant every time you left your room and wanted to get back in you had to go to reception and have someone open your room for you I gave the opportunity to the hotel to respond before writing this review and their only comment was had you used the spa you would have been offered 10 discount for the inconvenience and well you were given a free breakfast At 190 per night NOT GOOD ENOUGH ,No Positive
176953,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , However the hotel should hand advertised that they had jobs going on and the spa facilities were to be closed because of this very disappointed as the only reason I booked was to use the spa and also not being able to have our own room key door was not good as we couldn t be out for long or felt a bit not free really, Everything was perfect at the hotel
176954,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Everything was just OK Didn t have the wow factor Felt it could have once been a great little place to stay 5 10 years ago maybe, Breakfast was excellent

176957,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , I requested a bath at the time of the booking and did get one and an upgrade as well Unfortunately the hot water was not hot at all same for the shower I mentioned it and checked later early afternoon and it seemed to be better but in the evening and the next morning the water was cold again It did spoil things a little bit as it was quite cold but I got over it , The staff was extremely nice and friendly I would come back just for them The breakfast room service was more than enough the room was big I had a massage which was really really good I felt so relaxed afterwards 
176958,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Hammam was closed for 2 days we were there but got in on the 3rd day issues with the tv however only used this at night , We didn t go for the breakfast option however the room was amazing We had the 5th floor room looking to the courtyard was very quiet We left a note for the cleaning staff for more coffee and tea which they gave us with a smiley face on the note nice touch Room was cleaned everyday and was really clean Had an amazing time Area around here is second to none with great food Bakery at the top of the road is unreal Cadet metro station is 2 minute walk which is great for connecting to other lines The metro is easy to navigate Wi Fi was adequate and got it in the room 
176959,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Nothing to report, Very nice facilities with very comfortable mattress Coffee provided inthe room Wifi access in the lobby and room Excellent breakfast Staff very helpful with outstanding behavior Hotel s position in a key point close to Mont Marte 15 min walk and to the Opera 10 min walk We enjoy also a very relaxed and professional massage Easy access from airport with direct connection with Roissybus 11 person We were to couples and we enjoy our stay 
176960,Monsieur Cadet Hotel Spa Ex Meyerhold Spa , Only issue is the card machine didn t work when I had to pay for room service etc, Staff were friendly and amazing even at times when the language barrier was a problem I received an upgrade on my room which was a nice surprise and unexpected Rooms very clean Overall a great experience
