456433,W Amsterdam, The property is very dingy the floor lobby is very dark and shady we had 4 rooms including one suite and none faced outside so there was limited external light it was facing the internal atrium The rooms were very small and in the endeavour to make it contemporary and modern some basics and warmth were missing the only highlight would be location they have a nice bar on the top floor but overall for the price wouldn t recommend ,No Positive
456434,W Amsterdam, if I m honest nothing would go back tomorrow, Absolutely blew me and my missus away Funky Futuristic the spa is out of this world must check it out if you stay there Location wise couldn t ask to be in better place everything is really close by Staff were great more than happy to help it is a little on pricey side but you pay for what you get and this place is on another level would highly recommend it 
456435,W Amsterdam, Nothing we can think of other than the prices of the room service and bar but we simply chose not to use this service , Comfortable Rooms with excellent mattress and choice of pillows Superior Smart Electrical systems for air con heating lighting blind control Designer walk in shower was nice Good wardrobe drawer space with fixed safe Large selection of room service items TV was excellently installed to pull out for perfect bed viewing I would aspire for my own bedroom to look like this one day Don t expect great views though your in the city surrounded by buildings so unless your at the 6th floor bar overlooking the city your likely to be looking at another building from your room not a problem for us as we were out 90 of the time 
456436,W Amsterdam, The size of the room its bit small and we did not have a good view so we were disappointed because we cant see anything and open the window furthermore at night it was noisy from the loby music , I like the decoration the stuff were friendly and helpful the location is perfect the bed is comfortable the radio mation that we can connected with blutooth is a very nice idea 
456437,W Amsterdam, Staff can be a little friendlier The concierge and lobby staff were too rushed and serious and so paled in comparison to the spa and retail staff who were clearly warm welcoming and inquisitive as to guest needs and daily activities which is always a nice touch and should just come natural , Location is in the heart of the city The hotel itself is split into two buildings bank where the gymnasium and living room and retail space are and exchange where the suites and rooftop F B outlet are The spa was one of the nicest I ve seen that close in the heart of any city and the onyxed marble look with dim lights really helped supressed any wounded knots I had traveling from the rest of my Eurotrip As a W fan this is my favorite one I ve been to so far I won t go into details as many can be subjective but when you put in place all the elements it was close to an exceptional experience 
456438,W Amsterdam, The 5th floor rooms were noisy you could hear the music from the restaurant chairs scraping on the floor and then breakfast set up I expected sound insulation Disappointing , Great views in the restaurant and breakfast was brilliant 
456439,W Amsterdam, It s just a detail but the cleaning staff knocked at the door even with the do not disturb sign , The room was really comfy amazing bed good shower and loved the automated lights inside the room The location is amazing and the food from the restaurant inside is super good 
456440,W Amsterdam,No Negative, The W Amsterdam is great excellent location right in the center with beautiful facilities rooftop pool very modern and well equipped gym nice bar on the roof of the building etc I stayed in a two level suite which was very well appointed with a projector and sound system 
456441,W Amsterdam, My grandmother passed away in the USA shortly after we arrived The hotel staff was not helpful in assisting us retain a refund We pAid for two rooms and the staff just advised us to calll a phone number that was of no help I would appreciate a hotel stafff fixing the situation, Spa
456442,W Amsterdam, someone opened the door while I was kissing my partner a bit awkward while we had loud music on but I guess mistakes happen And we had to call the front desk to clean our room they forgot, The gym the spa facilities comfort of the room
456443,W Amsterdam, Didn t go to breakfast as it was expensive 39 euros and had lat minute booked so very expensive room rate around 340 a night seemed a bit steep for the standard especially no breakfast included , Really ultra modern room and quite a young vibe we were in the old telephone exchange interesting and original decor spa was good 
456444,W Amsterdam, The breakfast buffet was not great not much of a variety although ordering a set breakfast of the menu had a variety of options Shower gels in the room were not replaced everyday so unfortunately we ran out on the first day Rooftop pool could have been cleaner , W Amasterdam Hotel live up to the 5 standard of luxury We had the perfect weekend because of the hotel Mr Porter restaurant on the 6th floor in exchange building was amazing the food was of high standard and the cocktails were excellent The spa in the bank building was again amazing very relaxing and the facilities were excellent The best hotel and restaurant in Amsterdam by far 
456445,W Amsterdam, The pool looks a little bigger in the pictures , Really hip hotel in the heart of Amsterdam The pool is really nice and the lounge area is spectacular The room I stayed in was great for my partner and I Great for romantic weekend getaways 
456446,W Amsterdam,No Negative, Amazing hotel with fantastic staff We will definitely be back They provided so many extras for my partners birthday Cake baloons and champagne It was such a surprise and the room was fabulous 
456447,W Amsterdam, Some can argue the small size of the room but I think its great compared to others in Amsterdam Nothing to dislike about it really except that it would be the best if the location was different to have better room views , I stayed for 4 beautiful nights at the W Amsterdam I loved everything about it the staff room design the lounge facilities the clean room Wi Fi service everything was just great The staff were awesome both the ladies the gents Special thanks to the housekeeper for a superb service I would certainly come back to this property again and would recommend it to friends as well Thank you W Amsterdam for your great hospitality and making my trip to Amsterdam such a memorable one 
456448,W Amsterdam, The staff is very rude and untrained Very poor and unfriendly service The towels are very small The breakfast is very poor All these for 650 per night , The location is great The interior design is beautiful and the building is impressive The Duchess restaurant is very impressive with great food and reasonable prices 
456449,W Amsterdam, Not the W experience I was hoping for The hotel has a very minimalistic design without the usual creative touches that one would expect The place ends up looking like a barren factory than a fancy hotel The room I stayed in overlooked the empty courtyard and it was difficult to have any privacy without completely closing the shutters The room while modern did not have a good vibe or the usual bells and whistles one would find at a 5 star hotel Also whenever someone closed a door outside you could hear the banging and the noise inside the room It was difficult to get a good sleep in the morning , Central location
456450,W Amsterdam, I wish the hotel had at least contacted me to warm me that that our room wasn t going to be ready and that that we would be transferred to another hotel for the night That was very disappointing ,No Positive
456451,W Amsterdam, For such a fancy room was very strong sewage smell time to time coming from shower room , Extra coffee music sound bar interior Very comfortable bed Was amazing we found birthday cake when return form city sightseeing 
456452,W Amsterdam, it was hard to find someone from the staff that speaks Dutch It would be helpful in term of translation and getting around, I loved the rooms design I was super impressed with the toiletry products they offered face wash really good quality Staff is super nice
456453,W Amsterdam, Our room was next door to the elevator so we were subject to some passing noise as guests were coming in and out , Super soft bed and really nice modern room Plenty of wardrobe space also Within walking distance to everything and the hotel sat on top of a local supermarket which was pretty ideal 
456454,W Amsterdam, Rooms were cleaned well however the tidying should be much better I expect leaving a messy room and coming back later seeing it tidy and the clothes folded that was not the case, Friendliness and professionalism of staff funkiness of hotel rooms
456455,W Amsterdam,No Negative, W Amsterdam has a wonderful location perfect smiling stuff and they are very helpful they gave us a really really good room we had a royal palace amsterdam reviews on our bed hopefully and we defently stay there again
456456,W Amsterdam, smelt damp at best lifts were a disaster communication was worse Staff tried but if they needed to refer to anyone else staff or external don t expect it to happen ,No Positive
456457,W Amsterdam, The least practical hotel we ve ever stayed in For example the shower is located in the room next to the bed not in a bathroom so it was impossible for someone to sleep while the other one takes a shower Even the light switch of the shower and room is the same Takes forever to use the elevators a lot of people coming in to the 6th floor combined with 2 slow elevators caused a super long waiting time whenever we wanted to go up to the room not a huge deal but for such an expansive hotel this shouldn t be an issue , Great location and service
456458,W Amsterdam, Towels didn t seem fresh to me and lots of damaged things in the room should be replaced , Amazing Lounge and restaurant on top floor with exceptional sight The Suite is alright but nothing exceptional 
456459,W Amsterdam, The bed was a medium comfort and I was on the third floor but I could hear the lounge music from the six floor , The Staff are very helpful and polite they are amazing they have a delicious restaurant on the roof Mr Potter Restaurant the interior design of the hotel is beautiful its a new style for hotels and everything is around you just a five minutes walk also they have movies u can order and there food is delicious great experience for people who love to stay and relax and the end of the day 
456460,W Amsterdam, It felt pretentious and out of place in amsterdam The interior design is fabulous every part of it deserves a post on instagram but who want to live in a post modern gallery All the w hotels are like this and I understand it when thay opened in dubai but in Amsterdam I don t know i kept wanting to tell all the staff and the building it self to chiilll dude Ooo and you when u check in they block a deposit they actually blocked the price of on room plus taxes plus 100 time 3 i think i payed 1 300 for 3 nights they blocked 1 700 Wich they gave back immediately i am a frequent traveler but that seemed strange , The restaurants and the loung
456461,W Amsterdam, The smell in the corridors is unpleasant , The terrace on the 6th floor allows you to see a sunset with a view The spa was excellent including the bar that was near to the spa In the evening there is a restaurant and a bar on the 6th floor where guests from all over the area arrive not necessarily guests of the hotel Excellent bar 
456462,W Amsterdam,No Negative, Excellent location comfortable convenient relaxed and pristine environment Prestige fine dining Anniversary visit bubbles and chocolates on arrival greatly appreciated 
456463,W Amsterdam, The sauna heat was low , The design is just so cool you can just stay at this hotel for 5 days straight The staff was very professional and intelligent 
456464,W Amsterdam, The cleanliness of the rooms were appalling moved rooms twice Fresh blood on our blinds and other substances in our next room Gross , The bar was fab and bed was comfy 
456465,W Amsterdam, Spent the weekend at the W for a birthday and was our first visit to Amsterdam Notified the hotel before arrival that it was a very special occasion and got the most basic customer service The room was like a hostel I ve never stayed in such a small confined space It took around 45 minutes to check us in and had to keep repeating ourselves I paid 400 per night without breakfast and it s the biggest waste of money I ve ever spent Hotel said that they would take a payment instead of preauthorisation as it would go back to my bank faster only to find out that I didn t get as much back as I paid I called to complain and was told a manager would contact me this was a week ago and I still haven t been contacted Always been a very loyal Starwood member but this has completely put me off using them in future Do not stay here it s not worth the money ,No Positive
456466,W Amsterdam, There was a laser printer at the business center next to my room that was producing a funky smell Engineering couldn t do anything about it though I forgot to use my 10 discount X Bank coin but that s on me , Literally everything The design of the Hotel the Staff the Restaurants the Shopping the Spa the Guest treatment Cleanliness of rooms were all the best you could expect anywhere Plus for such a big Hotel there was lots of privacy amazing layout that facilitated this Just getting to your room is exciting in itself as fun surprises and design touches stand out at you The rooms were absolutely amazingly designed and tailored for the refined taste in life kind of people Room sizes are just right and lots of emphasis on natural lights was put into the architecture Oh and they got Marshal speakers and top notch entertainment fashion magazines and packed Bar Coffee machines real coffee machines in every room Loved the lowered hangout lobby where Art and Fashion is also on display for sale like a mini Art Gallery 
456467,W Amsterdam, While checking out ask for the bill there otherwise they can overcharge you when you see e invoice in your e mail box , Design was good as always Outdoor pool is a big must 
456468,W Amsterdam,No Negative, The hotel is one of the best I ve ever stayed at From upon arrival the staff were very warm welcoming to visiting the facilities in the gym restaurant bar When ever needed anything everyone was very helpful Can t wait to revisit this hotel 
456469,W Amsterdam, Always a queue for the lift A very poorly lit path to room part of the design however worst of all is that you need to watch your step as there are 4 steps along the way Shower is open plan very uncomfortable due to small room size toilet has no window or ventilation and is dark reception is on the 6th floor , the duchess restaurant and the lounge bar upstairs are second to none in amsterdam
456470,W Amsterdam, I expected more than what we got for the money I paid Our room was tiny and view wasn t great Found staff quite rude at times too , Location was great 
456471,W Amsterdam, Disabled dirty bathroom wish had of never accepted upgrade spa area not clean tidy no clean glasses rude check in just trying to force upgrades on breakfast room all at extra cost, Comfy bed
456472,W Amsterdam, Nothing everything was great , The location was fantastic and close to everything Also the staff was very nice and helpful and the room I stayed in was so modern with really cool technology the shower was fantastic 
456473,W Amsterdam, I was there on a Sunday but the music just kept banging until midnight usually I like a good party but not when I have an important meeting the next day and the music is so close to my room , Great location great view great design
456474,W Amsterdam, Service in bar restaurant poor Asked for a quiet room and had one near the bar which was very loud in the evening , Super comfy bed Great location Concierge were brilliant
456475,W Amsterdam, the sink and toilet in our room could of been cleaner , but overall the room was nice comfortable the staff were very friendly and the hotel location was in a excellent location 
456476,W Amsterdam, Only thing I can say was that we had drinks in the bar one night and we paid 44 euros As we come from London we re so used to asking for a single double shot because it s always measured this is clearly not the case in Amsterdam Asked for double JD s and coke and the guy almost filled the entire glass with JD when I told him that s too much he replied you asked for double I can t throw it away so if your from London be careful when ordering drinks at the bar lol, Amazing hotel and amazing location Super clean and the staff we re amazing We also had dinner at Mr Porter which is in the hotel and it was beyond excellent Would recommend this hotel over and over again
456477,W Amsterdam, But we did experience really poor service in Mr Porter and W Lounge very slow and staff not paying attention to guests even Know we were in House guests , We enjoyed the rooms and also the location was fantastic and front office staff were amazing Breakfast staff in Mr Porter were very good and friendly Manager in W lounge was great and helped us with our frustrations of wait time 
456478,W Amsterdam, We were promised a text when our room was ready we walked the length and breadth of Amsterdam expecting a text we finally returned to the hotel at 4pm to be advised the room was ready but that we should have gone across the road That was fine but when we asked about our luggage no one knew anything Whilst this was happening to us other guests were being handed glasses of champagne on check in Luckily when we got to our room the bags were there The next day I enquired at the concierge desk in the side of the hotel we were staying in and was directed across the road Then yesterday we arrived back from a day of sightseeing to a room that hadn t been serviced Also despite having the air con turned down to its lowest temperature we found the room quite stuffy at night , Good central location Good breakfast AWESOME power shower 
456479,W Amsterdam, There was a small of rubbish in the hall way on first floor all the time as we walked to our room The smell was quite off putting , I thought the size of the rooms was amazing 
456480,W Amsterdam, Only down side was we stayed for 3 days and our room was cleaned once Also the spa facilities was ok but not the best, Hotel was lovely staff was very helpful the restaurant in the hotel was one of the best would deffinetly stay here again
456481,W Amsterdam, No parking area really a big problem if you go by your car you need to pay a fortune for parking , Nicely designed hotel at a good location Amazing view from the roof and also a nice bar there Staff is really great 
456482,W Amsterdam, Room design and faced issues with room heating room cleaning time etc which were solved after a discussion with the staff but they should never happened in first place , Location Concept Staff
456483,W Amsterdam, Took over 90 minutes to check in due to staff refusing to check me in due not allowing me to use any other card to check in other than which I booked the room under Additionally on the day of check out staff came into my room and wanted to check everything before I checked out Really rude and having stayed at W Hotels around the world I expected a kinder service ,No Positive
456484,W Amsterdam, Water in the different small plunge pools in the Spa could do with being cleaner dead skin floating around which was pretty off putting , Lovely room overlooking the city Bed was huge and really comfortable Spa was really relaxing and there was a good selection of food for breakfast and a large selection of juices 
456485,W Amsterdam, Could never get the room warm stepping out of the shower into the room was like walking outside in the freezing air, The spa was fantastic also the staff were very helpful
456486,W Amsterdam, A surprise 300 deposit on arrival plus city tax this should certainly be made very clear for future customers, The location and friendliness of the staff
456487,W Amsterdam, Worst experience ever They took the money twice on my account once with maestro and once with mastercard and don t consider it while my bank confirmed it Worst service ever They don t carr about their customers Don t go there,No Positive
456488,W Amsterdam, I liked everything about this hotel there were one or two little niggles but nothing worth nit picking about , The attention to detail all around the hotel is incredible I stayed in the exchange building and was not disappointed The rooms were large bright and modern and you could not ask for a better location a stones throw from Dam square but tucked away behind the royal palace away from the noise and crowds 
456489,W Amsterdam, We had mice in our room we paid over 600 for a weekend in the W When we approached this subject they advised they would be unable to do anything because this was booked through booking com Never again, Area was good
456490,W Amsterdam, We booked a room with a photo of a bath but no bath was in our room We complained are were upgraded to an even better room than the one we booked with a bath Very very pleased , Very professional 
456491,W Amsterdam,No Negative, I was so pleased with everything at this hotel The staff were all so friendly and helpful and was so chuffed with our room Also after telling the staff it was my partners 30th birthday being greeted in our room by a cake and note from them really was lovely
456492,W Amsterdam, Not much to say a bit disappointed they were no party for the guests from the hotel when we arrived everything was already sold out No other alternatives The lift can be annoying sometimes we had to wait over 5 minutes for the lift to come seems only one was working not a complaint but some hotel guests were complaining , Staff very helpful was a strong smell of cigarette in our room on the first day they quickly fixed the situation and put in a different better room Mister Porter restaurant food was delicious better than Gaucho in London The spa is nice and very relaxing after a long day walking around the city The swimming pool is definitely a plus big thank you to Cecilia at the SPA she was very welcoming always checked if we didn t need anything Thank you for your time and help I have been very impressed with the quality of the service client from Amsterdam W hotel one of the best I have seen so far from a W hotel and I did quite a few I will definitely come back 
456493,W Amsterdam, Booked my room via Booking com Pictures showed a bath tub in the room checked with reception turns out the hotel has very limited rooms with a bath Only booked the room because it was pictured with a bath tub , Mr Porter Bar fantastic for views of the city 
456494,W Amsterdam, Super location super hotel but service is very very poor from forgetting to clean our room to having no turn down service Pity since the hotel itself is amazing,No Positive
456495,W Amsterdam, The hold on my credit card of the same amount that I paid in check out I paid 2600euro on checkout and still they hold the same amount on my card and the lady tell me it can take up to 30 days It s a huge problem they are suppose to get back to me in 48hrs ,No Positive
456496,W Amsterdam, There was a nye party guest didn t get first invites paid 1800 Euro to stay for 3 nights and couldn t even go to the hotel bar on New Year s Eve stayed in the W hotel in Miami the staff were so much better very kind made me wanna stay in the W again after Amsterdam and there staff not so much, The bed was great room was nice location was near everything
456497,W Amsterdam, Whatever Whenever services Too slow to get in contact especially by whatsapp I gave up on trying to use that service Water leaking from the shower to the room floor The material should be reviewed , Breakfast included very generous and filling Staff very nice and eager to help Comfortable bed
456498,W Amsterdam, The indoor pool could have been heated as it was a little too cold to enjoy , The beds were amazing and very comfy The staff were so friendly and would help you any way they can 
456499,W Amsterdam, The room didn t have any view few windows were really high it was pretty tiny the TV channels and movies selection was mediocre and we didn t appreciate waking up twice to a screaming alarm once at 3AM that turned out to be false alarm, perfect location in the middle of the centrum behind the palace walking distance from everywhere attractions restaurants shopping supermarket coffeeshops etc Cool hotel great design smart gadgets intense shower excellent food at The Duchess restaurant Loved the Marshal speaker in the room superb sound 
456500,W Amsterdam, First room was dirty got changed but didn t like the sink facility being next to bed lot nicer hotels than this very pretentious staff in reception and the roof bar did not feel welcome at all I won t be back sadly, The location
456501,W Amsterdam, The bar is far too clubby and the lift is a nightmare while the bar is open The gym and spa is in a separate building to the hotel The room doesn t have a warm feel no carpet and lack of space for storage , The hotel is very trendy and great location 
456502,W Amsterdam, Rooms are way too hip Meaning they are not It feels like someone overtried to be cool I had a room facing inner building that had no view and was dark The room just feels cold and un authentic Normally i enjoy spending time in my room This time I didnt I ve been in much better rooms Shower is ok , Good location Very nice spa Nice restaurant upstairs and nice lounge next to it I would recommend booking a room in the bank building facing the canal 
456503,W Amsterdam, Check in time was an hour late Spa pool cold and steam room smelly Service slow at times Mirrors poor in room , Loved the food and cocktails Location great Bed comfy Cool decor
456504,W Amsterdam, Really disappointing stay We had a Wonderful Bank with canal view We had to crawl up the couch to see the canal The rooms at W Bank on the fourth floor are a rip off Overall the room felt like living in a cave Real dark low ceilings When we asked for another room we were told that this is not possible overbooked Staff was overall really friendly but due to lack of personnel everything did take very long check in 30 minutes luggage got lost waited two hours So not a wonderul stay for our honeymoon at W Definetely below average Starwood hotel standard been in Starwood hotels in Croatia and Barcelona ,No Positive
456505,W Amsterdam, The staff is confused most of the time you don t really get a good answer for anything related to hotel facilities or even tips around the hotel People who visit the bar are treated better than guests who are staying at the hotel and want to geab a drink I didn t understand the 2 hotels concept the spa was on one side the duchess and we were staying in the exchange what the difference also a W should have a Bliss spa it is a landmark , The W is a hotel chain that I love i could feel I was in a W even in Amsterdam The rooms are really nice and the bed is so cozy Early check in was a major plus 
456506,W Amsterdam,No Negative, The staff here could not be more helpful From the moment we arrived we were treated really well Both rooms were upgraded for free which was a lovely touch as some of our guests were new to amsterdam and had never stayed in a W Hotel before We found the drinks prices really reasonable in the bar and the staff seemed to make the effort to remember what drinks we liked to order They also would make an effort to use our names when we arrived left daily The rooms are really beautiful and the design of this hotel is lovely When I go back to Amsterdam I will 100 be staying here again This is also the best location is the perfect spot as it is near everything you need to get to 
456507,W Amsterdam, More guidance around the noise in the area Hotel is very loud and not for those who want to sleep well , Best hotel in the area great location and superb staff Shame about the nightclub Stay in the bank side Nothing to moan about 
456508,W Amsterdam, Tow building poor cleaning reciption and concierge not pick up the phone week lighting inside rooms sim rooms have very very small window and it was in the top of ceiling which give u uncomfortable feeling , Location little bit w more new than other hotels
456509,W Amsterdam, Leftover food from room service has been put outside by guests in front of their doors at the corridor Staff did not manage to clean it up for ages , Excellent by all means great service awesome sky bar
456510,W Amsterdam, Showers were a little impractical no hooks And sink was pretty much in the bedroom , The spa was incredible as was the food at the Mr Porter restaurant Amazing atmosphere too 
456511,W Amsterdam, The only complaint I have are the slow elevators , The rooms were perfect clean modern and fully equipped The location was unbeatable The staff was so helpful and friendly The spa is the best thing in this Hotel It is free entrance and it is so incredible The food was also delicious 
456512,W Amsterdam, The pressure in the shower could be better , The bed was comfortable The lounge on the 6th floor was very lively at nights The location is fabulous just a 2 minutes walk to the Dam Square The concierge was of great help We got very good restaurant recommendations from them 
456513,W Amsterdam, There was nothing at all that I did not like, The best hotel I have ever stayed in The room s are luxurious and spacious The staff are extremely helpful and thoughtful The property is located right in the middle of Amsterdam few minutes walk from Dam Square It s hard to put it into words other than to say that it is at the very top for a hotel experience 
456514,W Amsterdam, the spa was closed for a party the free wifi crawled so had to pay for real wifi having used express checkout I m still waiting for the bill, comfortable room helpful staff
456515,W Amsterdam, If you book your room from Booking com and choose to pay at the hotel this is VERY important carefully read Entrance to the hotel at the reception we said our names and the reception guy checked his computer and said us to pay MORE than our booking com price We said it s not good why we need to pay more than book price He said he can t do anything this is the price After we showed the Booking com reservation document he looked 3 5 min after said Ok pay the reservation document says If you don t want to be surprised at the entrance don t forget to show your booking reservation document , Stayed there 2 nights and liked our room Hotel is in the heart of Amsterdam Great location 
456516,W Amsterdam, Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong Don t have one good word left for the reception staff either It s too much to put down here and it s completely ruined our weekend Which is an understatement For the money you spend on this hotel you can do much better in Amsterdam ,No Positive
456517,W Amsterdam, nothing to dislike, location of the hotel the controls in each room interior design and architecture of the new building it was a bank the staff are great friendly and efficient 
456518,W Amsterdam, Very poor staff The briefcase had disappeared during the cleaning of the room Eight times we called them and someone tried to take action and finally returned to our room within one day a fact a bottle of champagne The cleaning is outrageous used started toilet paper do not give a handkerchief do not spend a minibar Incredible The rooftop bar is very noise during 2AM Impersonal there is no master , Location The room modern 
456519,W Amsterdam, Dirty room dust around bed dirty carpet and destroyed floor Shower head with very poor water pressure , Very comfortable bed good blackout solution mini bar Location is excellent which have downside with noise level at night 
456520,W Amsterdam, Nothing, The bar great atmosphere great DJ and even better cocktails the Art Deco design is amazing and the rooms were very impressive with touch sensitive controls and a spacious simplistic design 
456521,W Amsterdam, When i arrived the room was dirty A towel hanger and the shower were broken I told the reception They stayed broken all my stay I ordered a fruit platter I specified no melon Of course they brought melon In the breakfast i order fried eggs well done They were not Smily and hype staff for sure But in fact they dont listen and perhaps dont care For the price you pay this hotel it is not acceptable , Good location Breakfast is tasty
456522,W Amsterdam, Sheets should be changed during three nights, Location just back of grand palace and dam squire everybody smiling terrace pool was great unfortunality i saw it when i was checking out 
456523,W Amsterdam, Staff was really bad took almost 1h to check in concierge couldn t give me information about Amsterdam bar security very unfriendly Generally venue is great staff is not worth the price paid, Nice venue restaurant
456524,W Amsterdam, We checked into the W for five nights On arrival I saw a stain on the top sheet won t say what it looked like Yuk to their credit it took maybe all if five minutes to send someone to the room and change the bedding Day two we returned from our first outing at about 16 00 to find that our room had been passed over by housekeeping I phoned and was told that they weren t sure they could send someone because they very busy Someone did eventually turn up telling us it was her last call of the day They usually work in pairs but she was alone She did not vacuum the carpet or clean the stucco floor and the sheets were not changed even though I d left the card requesting it Basically she just made up the bed changed the towels and took out the garbage Later I went to reception to complain and was told politely that it s highly unlikely our room had been passed over as they work until six Really So my call was unnecessary I don t think so They sent someone else later to ask if everything was OK Full points for that but 5 10 for the actual cleaning Day four they hadn t provided any fresh towels I had to phone to request them They sent someone straight away but for a five star hotel in a major European capital I don t think it s good enough , Very cool decor and terrific location on Dam square Nice comfy bed and great shower v very friendly and helpful staff 
456525,W Amsterdam, Enxious room like a prison We hare like in the frabric and verry hard to acces in the room many level , Litery is pretty good same for the equipement of the room verry good tv and cleameless of the room 
456526,W Amsterdam, Strange smell in the 5th floor hallway, Friendly staff particularly the bar staff at the duchess restaurant Vitaly and crew were especially hospitable and mixed up some great cocktails
456527,W Amsterdam, Worst hotel of Amsterdam first of all they gave me room 7 30 in the evening I have checked in yesterday and my air condition is not working since then Yet they are not able to fix it and are not shifting me to another room They are asking more money for different room Very poor service ,No Positive
456528,W Amsterdam, The flooring in the rooms and the coating on the sinks were poor quality and flaking off , Modern and quirky Great hotel bar with excellent bar staff Food was very very good Breakfast crazy expensive never ate it at the hotel 
456529,W Amsterdam, Front desk staff is untrained and not up to W standards First room assigned was dirty cleaning clothe found by the sink then the second room assigned was occupied The management was slow to solve the issues encountered As a recovery we received 100 euros credit but one of our dinners was double posted at checkout when noticed we didn t receive any apology and it was handled like if it was normal Besides even tough we had prepaid our room and gave cash guarantee for our incidentals they took a pre authorisation without advising us and again no apologies for the inconvenience They were unable to cancel the preauthorisation on the spot the FD agent kept saying that it will be done automatically which is not true Overall a succession of frustrations due to lack of professionalism We will definitely come back to Amsterdam to Mr Porter s but we will not stay in the hotel We hope that our comment will help the FD team to improve their operations , Hotel is well located Mr Porter s restaurant is a nice place to have a drink or dinner
456530,W Amsterdam, Weird bathroom set up sink was outside in the room Lights for the toilet and the cupboard were on sensirs which was annoying I don t like the light on in the toilet if I get up to go in the middle of the night Some staff were not very helpful Not enough milk only green tea and the milk and coffee were not refilled for the whole four days I was there Staff left items like luggage trolleys in the hallway all the time staff took me in one lift to go to my room which I used all the time but a few days later was abruptly told that was for staff and yours is over there , Bed was very comfy room looked amazing loved the touch pad for the lights and blinds Some staff were really helpful and pleasant Felt very secure due to staff always being on the door 
456531,W Amsterdam, This is a very busy luxury hotel in a prime location Can t imagine that there s Only 2 staff at the reception serving all types of customers requests , Staff Location style
456532,W Amsterdam, The guest rooms we saw are bizarre and badly thought out Toilet is claustrophobic with a very heavy door and no lock Mirrored walls are bothersome Closet doors when open prevent access to shower Sink is part of bedroom right behind headboard of bed , Staff and whatever whenever feature for service 
456533,W Amsterdam, The rooms are super modern but gadgets make it a little functional to sleep comfortably in if you are sensitive to light Take an eye mask along , The customer service is truly outstanding decor brilliant and food amazing breakfast is heaven and great terraces over a central Amsterdam location plus small touches throughout everywhere make this hotel quite unique very definitely not just another hotel A fun stay 
456534,W Amsterdam, The hotel was advertised with a gym It doesn t have one yet The hotel is advertised with a swimming pool Its not open yet The fan in the shower runs all night so the room was noisy the door didn t close properly so water leaked over the floor I moved my taxi back by 15 minutes and was then charged the waiting time My room really wasn t very large Someone came to have a look at the fan next morning I said I would be out of the room by 10 00 and yet he arrived whilst I was still getting ready at 8 00am , nice restaurant but only found it for breakfast in the morning 
456535,W Amsterdam, the room service was ridiculously slow and this hotel needs more elevators took me 5 min to get up to my room especially on a weekend, It was a great hotel Staff are accommodating and the rooms are funky and comfy 
456536,W Amsterdam, A number of rooms in the exchange building look into an atrium but with no difference in the rate The wonderful rooms are quite small no freestanding desk The hotel may still be experiencing teething problems as its been open less than a year but took service takes along time and service is not joined up I ordered some water to the room which was forgotten 4 times taking eventually 5 hours to arrive in the middle of the night , W Lounge upstairs is a good place for a drink gets quite busy at night but a good crowd
456537,W Amsterdam, The hotel which has reacently opened is still experiencing some new opening issues, Excellent urban chic 5 Hotel in centre of Amsterdam Great Roof top views over the centre of the City Steak Restaurant on 6th floor served the best Steaks we have eaten in a Long time Friendly professional staff service
456538,W Amsterdam, Late at light you could hear music from the restaurant in your room , Location rooms design bluetooth speakers in the room build in audio system and cinema projector various Bliss amenities Shower for two 
456539,W Amsterdam, Totally amateurish service in bar and Mr Porter Sat down for dinner about 1 hour late Service chaotic Waiters seemed more concerned by their looks than looking after the customers, Reception staff
456540,W Amsterdam, Very over priced we had a disabled bathroom in our room was not told about the 70euro a night valet parking charges until check out They tried to charge us 1200 euros to attend the New Year s Eve party after talking they dropped it to 400 euros but was still over priced considering we was paying 550 euros a night to stay here , Location was very good 
456541,W Amsterdam, Staff were too smily face over the top still in start up inexperienced mode Overpriced breakfast is 35 EUROS person Difficult to find behind Albert Hein Don t expect a decent view from your room There s no proper desk in the rooms they re too cool for that So if you re going to do any work then you do it next to the bathroom sink next to a mirror with a light you can t turn off God is in the details , Very comfortable beds cool rooms that together with the black out curtains and location is about the only good thing going for this hotel 
456542,W Amsterdam, Upon arrival the hotel restaurants were fully booked perhaps you could try roomservice Hotel elevators crowded and occupied by non hotel guests Roomservice could not get our breakfast order right in 3 attempts Staff seemed unexperienced very friendly but too informal in stead of pro active and courteous perhaps we re just getting old The hotel feels like design hotel meets youth hostel , Great location great interior great potential if problems are adressed properly
456543,W Amsterdam, The service is inconsistent and needs serious improving Sometimes simple things like replenishing bathroom amenities weren t done , Amazing stylish hotel right in the heart of Amsterdam The staff is 200 welcoming and you instantly feel like home The lounge on the 6th floor has some great views and parties
