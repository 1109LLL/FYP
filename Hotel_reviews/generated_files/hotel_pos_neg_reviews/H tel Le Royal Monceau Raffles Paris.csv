163632,H tel Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris, Nothing to say i am picky but in this hotel it was so great that nothing negative came up , I liked everything I have worked in customer service hospitality for the past 15 years and I can tell you the service was fantastic All Staff was absolutely welcoming and genuine helpful when needed The hotel size is just perfect and doesn t make you feel like it s a standard chain of hotels but more a personalized service The decoration and attention to details in every part of the hotel is just fantastic there is always a tiny piece of art that is catching your eye The little courtyard is very cute and even though our room had the garden view we thought we d miss the street view it was just so relaxing with the sound of the water in the courtyard We loved the swimming pool fabulous And we had breakfast included which was an absolute great choice especially since there are some patisseries made by the famous Pierre Herme The location of the the hotel is just great and coming from the UAE where as a woman i am used to safety and not being bothered when alone the streets around are safe and clean you can go shopping with no issue Just always keep an eye on your handbag like in every big european city

163639,H tel Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris, The hotel is the most poor my managed hotel I ve ever seen in my life it was shocking how little communication they have with each other not only between each department but also in the same department as well First off all the hotel cancelled my reservation without any prior notice she was rude and when she finally got put in her place she magically found my reservation I also had booked spa appointments and when I came to cancel one the late at the spa made it out to seem like she was doing me a favor by allowing to cancel my own reservation even though I was paying full price for the cancellation She continually kept calling my room even though I had told her I was sleeping repeatedly but she kept trying to make me come down from my room so I can sign the bill of my cancelled appointment as if it could wait All hype and no substance , The design was really nice and the food is average
