213145,Renaissance Paris Le Parc Trocadero Hotel, Better guidance to the room and proper facilities for the room keys First time I went to the wrong building second time my room key didn t work so I had to ask the reception to walk with me and to open the door with their key Perhaps my bad luck , I wish I can remember my room number it was excellent It was located in an adjusted building facing the court yard I received it as a courtesy upgrade from the hotel because they had a messed up booking information from booking com in the hotel system my booking was one day ahead from my actual arrival I had a stressful flight the plain landed after the second attempt and on the way from the airport our taxi nearly missed the car crash at the tunnel so when I arrived to the hotel I was pretty much grumpy The reception staff was very patient during the messed check in multiplied by my emotions for which I am extremely greatful
