377332,Boutiquehotel Das Tyrol, The noise from outside the property at night meant it was difficult to get a good nights sleep especially bad on Friday and Saturday nights The breakfasts at 20Euro each was too expensive a very adequate breakfast was bought at a local bakery with tables for 5Euro each , The hotel location was very central and in easy walking distance of the main attractions The hotel was also close to a U Bahn station which was convenient

377334,Boutiquehotel Das Tyrol,No Negative, We had a wonderful stay in Hotel das Tyrol mind you the entrance is not on the Mariahilferstrasse 15 but just before the corner in the small side street called Konigs Klostergasse The very high ratings for this hotel are very deserved indeed It really is a very nice hotel with wonderful art inside at every floor The double room was great with a view over the roofs at the back of the hotel on the 4th floor I guess all rooms are very nice but I would probably favour those at the back 15 25 35 45 55 or 65 Breakfast was very good and besides all kinds of things you can order a hot breakfast too It s location is very central close to the main musea the opera house and a bit further the Belvedere The staff are just exemplary they did their utmost in advising us were we might find some of the very nice porcelain art displayed all over the hotel We also took the opportunity to relax in the sauna steam room downstairs which we had to ourselves see the really beautiful and perfectly kept sea aquarium We will most certainly be back as two nights the most of three days is really to short to visit Vienna Thanks to all the wonderful staff

377338,Boutiquehotel Das Tyrol, The pillows were far too squishy and had trouble with the temperature of the room the duvets were so thick and made us feel so hot all night On check in we totally misheard the receptionist and thought breakfast was included was charged an absolute fortune at the end of the stay although some days we only came to the breakfast room for a glass of juice I think we had too higher expectations for the hotel from all the amazing reviews we read online it didn t quite blow us away and we found it to be totally fine but totally average , Hotel was spotless our bedroom and bathroom was incredibly clean Loved the little spa you could book all to yourselves Room amenities were good Hotel was in a very central location Very christmassy feel to the hotel over the holiday period
