49001,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, The hotel is expensive and does not include breakfast The toiletries weren t great who wants to use combination shampoo body wash and the shower only had a half door for some reason so the bathroom got very wet after every shower , The hotel was clean simple and well located We liked that we could walk to many sites 
49002,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, My room was never made up after the first night even though I hung the sign on my door , The location was the selling point Nice comfortable rooms too 
49003,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast was ridiculously expensive so we opted to go outside the hotel No maps provided for those of us who didn t know where we were going , The location was great and it was a quite boutique hotel Rooms were larger than some other Parisian hotels I have stayed in many Bed was huge and the facilities were as advertised Great value for money
49004,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, I was away for a weekend with my daughter and the room had a mezzanine floor with a separate bed so even though we booked a regular double room she could sleep in the extra bed and had some space to herself and I had the double bed for me 
49005,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, There was nothing about this hotel that deserved its price In my mind it was more a 3 star than a 4 star hotel The toiletries included was a shower cap and a bar of soap Not luxury , A great location Clean rooms
49006,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Musty elevator but that was negligible issue , Excellent quiet location within the 5th Arr with easy walk to various Metro stations and Notre Dame and the bike rental just outside the hotel 
49007,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Location was the best Bed was sooo comfortable Breakfast was delicious and the staff were so helpful I didn t want to leave We had 10 days of pure bliss Walked to most major sites 
49008,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Climbing over the side of a deep bath tub to take a shower was a throwback to the dark ages The room small for a 4 hotel could do with renovation , The room was quiet I slept like a log The hotel felt safe the staff friendly the location utterly fantastic I d stay here again and recommend it to people who are not fussy about decor 
49009,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Only the price reminds of a 4 stars hotel nothing else Tiny room just a bit larger than the bed Dirty glasses and cups with lipstick marks we had to take them back to reception to have them replaced the reaction of the staff was a bit annoyed like why would we bother for such a small issue Dirty carpet very dusty Very poor lighting certainly to save the planet or the power bill Staff generally OK some very nice and proactive some a bit arrogant and totally unhelpful Worn out towels almost see through with ripped edges Shower over the bath tub spraying the whole bathroom No ventilation in the bathroom Scarce supplies we ve stayed two days there was no shampoo we had only a bit of shower gel on the bottom of a container dispenser also marked as shampoo but unusable because of burning the eyes very badly only one milk portion for two guests a tissue box with only one tissue in it we had to go back to reception to ask for a new box Nothing like you would expect from a 4 star hotel e g bath coats slippers etc The remote control was very dirty and sticky lucky that we did not need to use it because the TV did not work anyway due to poor antenna or bad link to the antenna we complained they did NOTHING they only offered a drink at the bar as compensation when we checked out no thanks and no we will not return I m not sure how they got that high average score maybe was just our experience well below average , Location was great with quick and easy access to central Paris and Metro 
49010,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, There are no English channels on the TV , We took a while to find this property as it is at the back of la Sarbonne place but once found it was actually in a perfect quiet location It is a five minute walk from the River Seine and Notre Dame which was perfect to start a bus tour of Paris It is also a two minute walk from Les jardin de Luxembourg which is a beautiful building and a lovely area to sit and relax Sadly we didn t have time for the catacombs but this is also a 8 minute walk It is a great base to go back to It has everything you need and there are plenty of restaurants nearby for dinner The staff were amazing and really helpful and the bed was comfortable and the rooms are quiet I would definitely stay here again 
49011,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, The staffs in the receptions are amazingly Very friendly and always willing to helps All can communicates in English The location is unbeatable Close to all essential tourists areas shopping metro and supermarkets

49013,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was a little on the small side but this is Paris The shower situated over the bath splashes all over the floor requiring extra towels to mop up , The location to the Latin Quarter is very good This is our favourite area of Paris with easy walking to river Notre Dame river and transport 
49014,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, We did not eat the breakfast here we thought it was over priced We found a small coffee shop nearby for a lot less money , Location was very convenient to the Metro 2 stops within 5 blocks Staff spoke very good English and were helpful in every way Having a lift was a plus for us 
49015,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Nothing, The position is fantastic Very central close to trains and probably 5 10 min walk to Notre Dame Heaps of restaurants close by to choose from and breakfast was really good Staff very friendly and helpful Really great value for money 
49016,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, The room was very small and we were not able to adjust the temperature The room was clean but was not vacuumed every day , The property is in walking distance of many Paris attractions staff was helpful and friendly 
49017,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, The beds were uncomfortable We requested a double room and got two twin beds put together with double duvet The middle of the bed was impossible to sleep on , The buffet breakfast was excellent The breakfast lady was super friendly lovely lady Receptionists spoke english and were very helpful 
49018,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Room very tiny and too warm but with window open it was OK Toilet leaked slightly around the bottom Breakfast room way too hot for comfort Shower tub quite slippery could be dangerous , Breakfast was free for us because of our age and we thought quite adequate Room and bath small but clean and bed quite comfortable

49022,Hotel Mercure La Sorbonne Saint Germain des Pr s, Bathrooms are a bit old with the bathtub being a bit chipped in some places Smallish bathroom where if you run the shower a bit strongly the water splashes out everywhere even flowing to the main room , Very good location near the Notre Dame and La Sorbonne metro We got a very good deal for the 2 days that we spent there Very nice staff and value for money rooms
