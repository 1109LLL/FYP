157276,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The lady in the reception when we arrived was not very helpful nor was she service minded but all of the other staff members we dealt with were amazing , Loved our room it was clean and modern with a cute French vibe It is a nice sized hotel and we even stayed in one night because we just loved our room and view so much 
157277,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Only a small point but room was a fraction tight for space but I only paid for a standard room , It was a great location close two 2 metro stops on a quiet street Staff were very friendly and this was an ideal location to explore Paris for a number of days The room was well equipped very comfortable very clean and the bathroom was very nice 
157278,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The hotel charged my Credit Card twice first when I made the booking and a second time after the stay even though it said that there won t be any charges before arrival Also the sink was broken so the water could nt run off we told the receptionist but no one came to fix it , We got a complimentary upgrade and except for the broken sink the room was awesome The rain shower was perfect and the bed was super comfortable The staff was very friendly Breakfast was also good and had everything you wanted

157281,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The room was in a great location it was only a short walk to the city centre and to moulin rouge giving us the opportunity to see both at a night time for dinner 
157282,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Batheoom was down a very narrow flight of stairs Tea Coffee wasn t replaced each day Mini bar wasn t replenished Power sockets and bath plug system not working mentioned to the hotel not interested in helping Very poor for this type of hotel We were in room 3 a suite and next to an outdoor atrium This area seems to have been made a public smoking area No natural light or any view at all in this room , Room was very comfortable Great location 
157283,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Just a small recommendation if I may The day we left we asked at the reception for a taxi to the airport The fee we payed however was 20 more than for a tipical parisian taxi Maybe it is not a big difference but it leaves you with a bitter taste It wasn t a taxi and it didn t have a meter Probably the hotel management could consider some other correct taxi service , Extremely pleased with this hotel choice Cosy very clean new room equipped with everything needed Very quiet area this for us was a very big plus Shops and some restaurants nearby more of them in the Clichy area a short walking distance Very good quality price ratio I would highly recommend 
157284,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Our room was tiny Shower seemed not always clean traces of mold on the gray wall on closer inspection Yellow spot on one of the pillows which was seen only afterwards , A very good location in Paris We had a very comfortable bed A nice bathroom for shower and free coffee in our room 
157285,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The receptionist offered us a free upgrade to a Superior Room when we arrived The superior room was not very big so I assume Standard rooms are a little bit tight

157287,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, It was a wonderful experience with BW premier kapital opera hotel It is really easy to get to the public transportation including metro stations and bus stations Also the room we stayed was really clean and elegant and also comfortable The service from the crew is really nice and helpful We really enjoyed staying there in Paris Thanks 
157288,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The breakfast buffet looked more appetizing than it turned out to be On the day we ate there nothing was fresh , The front desk was extremely helpful helping us to navigate French internet sites giving good instructions how to get around on the metro The free bottled water and coffee in the room were nice amenities which upgraded our stay 
157289,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Great hotel and convenient location in Paris Far enough for peace quiet and close enough for a nice walk to main Paris attractions Rooms very clean very friendly staff Pet friendly Even got a free room upgrade Will definitely book again for next stay in Paris 
157290,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, There is nothing I could complain about , The hotel was lovely and very comfortable we stayed for 3 nights It was in an excellent location next to 3 metro stops so made travel very straightforward We were very kindly upgraded to a superior room when we arrived which was a lovely surprise I left behind my iPad and the hotel made a huge effort to communicate with me regarding this and posted this out to me promptly and made sure it arrived safely a service I am so grateful for I would defintlg recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a great stay in Paris 
157291,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The hotel room we had was a slightly dark room , Good safe location easy walk to the train station with a supermarket close by as well Easy walk to moulin rouge We had the suite and the bathroom was absolutely amazing 
157292,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, I have no complaints , From the moment we arrived the staff were extremely friendly and helpful The room was quiet with a very comfortable bed and the air conditioning easy to control and responsive The location was excellent with easy access to the Metro and the centre of Paris Overall it was a lovely hotel and I would recommend it

157294,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Nothing is negative about this hotel , Staff are really friendly and professional Check in experience was the best and the room was so clean and cosy Great location great service I would strongly recommend this hotel to other travellers travelling to Paris 
157295,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, We got there after 8 30 pm and the bar wasn t open I m not sure if this was an exception or not but we would have loved to relax in the bar It looked nice , In the 8th Arrondisement We were able to walk from the Gare St Lazare train station to the hotel about 15 minute walk The hotel is on is very tranquil street with mainly beautiful residential buildings from the 19th century We found about 10 restaurants a boulangerie and a couple of grocery stores within a 2 minute walk I get the impression this is a quieter section of town but restaurants were buzzing with activity Hotel staff was super helpful and friendly The beds and pillows were comfortable The rooms are normal size by Paris standards which means small but super quiet Left too early in the morning to get breakfast but the minibar was free 
157296,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, No ironing facilities in room had to pay for ironing pressing of clothing , Bed was large and comfy soft drinks and snacks were complimentary from the mini bar Nespresso machine in room shower was excellent 
157297,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Kept getting woken up through out the night with noise could hear toilets being flushed through the day and night Damaged time in the bathroom We made a complaint about the noise on the Friday was told by a staff member that the Manager would get back to us which never happened Since we arrived home from our trip the staff have called us liars saying no complaints were made etc Between the Hotel and Booking com our issues complaints are still not resolved If you are looking for a hassle free holiday I wouldn t recommend staying here , The cleanliness of the hotel was great 
157298,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room must have backed onto the kitchen or other staff area so it was a little noisy at times , We received an upgrade on our stay to a little room off a courtyard The room was fab the shower was absolutely massive The staff were very welcoming we received excellent service throughout our stay 
157299,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was too small It looks much better in pictures but in reality it s hard to walk there alone but even talking about 2 people Our shower door was broken and when I told that on reception I was told to just put a towel on the floor Definitely not something that a 4 star hotel should say Also once we were going on a walk and wanted to take a cup of tea with us but on that moment there was no hot water the receptionist saw that we were struggling with the hot water machine and she didn t even offer to help In the rooms not always tea coffee and water were renewed , The interior in the hotel and in the rooms were nice The neighborhood as well The bed was comfortable and we appreciate the coffee machine Love that on the reception you could get a tee or coffee 
157300,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The wall of the room is not very soundproofed sometimes we can hear people walking in the corridor But this didn t disturb us at all as most time especially in the evening it was very quite , the neighbourhood of the hotel is very quite and safe We walked to Opera Louvre Museum Le Musee D Orsay only took us around 20 mins The bakeries nearby provide very good bread and hot chocolate so we didn t choose the breakfast in the hotel The room was really nice clean and comfortable Our windows faced the courtyard The shower gel shampoo conditions and body lotion are with very good quality We booked a standard room Luckily when we checked in the room was not ready so that we got upgraded to the superior room without any extra fee We really appreciated the staff on this 
157301,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Nothing, Has a great location easy to access almost everywhere 3 different metro stations closeby Hotel is possibly a new one Rooms are decorated well super clean and modern Staff is very polite and helpful Beeakfast was very rich but we preferred to go outside because there were also very nice small restaurants starbucks etc nearby in walking distancd
157302,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Very nice but small room like most of Paris reasonably priced hotels Staff were very friendly and helpful Good safe location near metro and restaurants bars away from over crowded tourist areas 
157303,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Fantastic hotel Very clean and spacious bathroom high quality cosmetics very comfortable bed wonderful and big breakfast great and nice staff coffee machine in room Absolutely one of the best hotels I ve ever seen 
157304,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, On 2 occasions we had to wait downstairs while they cleaned our room Coincidently 50AUS had gone missing during our stay from a wallet that never left the apartment A staff member had brought the wallet to us upon check out and said she found it in the room we would have addressed it if we had noticed prior to arriving at airport , I liked the comfort of the bed and the rainfall feeling of the shower 
157305,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, There was construction going on outside the hotel This cant be helped unfortunately Our room was very small compared to others we saw when other guests were coming and going There was only a handful of english channels 5 6 No gym which was a let down seeing as it was a really nice hotel it would have been a great addition , The hotel was very close to 2 metro stations Its very modern and clean in reception Easy check in and the female receptionist was so nice and easy to talk too I asked if there was a bath in the room she said no a shower but what an amazing shower it was 2 different shower heads working at the same time The bed and pillows were sooooo comfortable i didnt want to get up out of bed Decor was on point very modern and very warm feeling in the room There was a mini bar in the room we did not use however we did have a coffee machine and free bottle of water everyday which was nice Free wifi and they looked after our bags upon check out whilst we walked the streets of paris on our last day 
157306,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Breakfast was just okay nothing interesting but fine if you don t have anywhere else to eat , Amazing bed very quiet pretty design and interior 
157307,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Hotel is very nice extremely clean and we were made to feel really welcome by the staff It is easy to get to with a metro station within 200m Little or no traffic on the street which is good for sleeping at night 
157308,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, just a little things one night lamp next to the bed was not working then we came in the room we found only one bathrobe and it took some time to make work our nespresso machine But the staff was very friendly helped us with every question in 5 min and even gave us an adapter for EU socket cause we forgot ours , Hotel was nice and quiet I could really get the home feeling here Then we just came our room was upgraded to better one I guess they had few rooms left The room was clean and tidy bed very comfy where also was nespresso coffee machine and our mini bar was for free But The best part was bathroom and shower shower just amazing spacious with shower head from ceiling pressure like waterfall and water hot as hell just the way I like it We also enjoy the quality of nuxe bath products Certainly the room was tiny like everywhere else in Paris but with very good layout and furnishing so two people could easily move around at the same time with no problem And the temperature in the room was pleasant I could easily operate it by thermostat By the way our room had that big french style window to the inner yard so we could open it for fresh air to come and didn t get much noise from outside and still feel very privately in our room 
157309,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Air conditioning was advertised but it was not switched on I asked about it it was out of season but we were there early April and it was quite warm , The coffee machine in the bedroom and at the check in area was very good
157310,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The breakfast was terrible the bread and bagels where so stale you could break a window with them you literally couldn t cut the bagels with a knife Waist of money , The room and bathroom where lovely
157311,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, A good walk to main attractions but the metro is at the top of road but always busy , Staff very helpful large lovely room bathroom that was cleaned every day 
157312,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, I asked for a special request to surprises my girlfriend with a cocktail and some fruit for when we arrive and then on check out I got charged 30 euros for a bowl of grapes and a cocktail everywhere else I have stayed they do this complimentary if you make a special request The area around the hotel can be quite scary at night with groups of men hanging around It was intimidating when I went out in the evening with my girlfriend because they would say things to us in french as we walked past and then laugh The area around the hotel is full of sex shops and escorts Try to avoid this area and stay closer to the centre of Paris near the Champs Elysees The room service is overpriced and there are not many good places to eat surrounding the hotel , The check in was quick and the hotel is clean and the bed is very comfy house keeping was done every day which was good 
157313,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, A little noisy with drilling next door but it had stopped between 5pm 11am and on Sunday , Big bathroom comfy bed great location to Rome metro station 
157314,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, We had some very noisy people beside us during the night but when we contacted reception they sorted it out and we were upgraded to a different room the next day , Beautiful hotel with excellent staff We had a wonderful stay and roils highly recommend It is right beside a metro station which is very handy but some people may want to be closer to the centre We liked the fact it was located in a quiet area and found it easy to travel to the sights we wanted to see 
157315,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was smaller than we expected and there was no view what so ever Not a lot of sunlight could come in And 2 times the power went off and it was off for several hours , The bed was very Big and comfortable and the bathroom was nice The location is on a quite street in a good neighboorhood
157316,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, the cold but we managed, Staff were so friendly and helpful walking distance to most places and coffee shops quiet road so no noises when asleep our bathroom in the suite was a dream
157317,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, They said they upgraded our room but it s still very small the room doesn t even have enough space to place two open suitcases the room is only good for one person to stay They didn t clean the carpet there are cookies on it and they forgot to give us towels and water bottles When we call the front desk they were not helpful they ask us to write a memo to their hotel manager or write it online and this is exactly what I m doing right now , The neighborhood seem pretty safe
157318,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was a quite small , Everything was great and the stuff was really helpful and friendly The bathroom was fairly large and the mattress was very comfortable 
157319,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Because we were on the top floor our angular shaped roof close to the windows caused a bit of discomfort when trying to open close them The desk and tea station were also positioned in this area so it made eating and preparing tea coffee a bit challenging The wifi could ve been a bit better Certain apps like my South African banking app wouldn t connect None of these issues were horrible though and I would still stay in this exact room again , The location was excellent Two minutes walk from Rome metro stop and a Carrefour grocery store for supplies The Art Deco design of the room really adds a sense of sophisticated style which in turn adds to the comfort The bar fridge was an added convenient The bathroom was incredible fitted with a modern shower and replinished Nuxe bathing products The staff were very helpful and accommodating and absolutely made our stay more comfortable This hotel is incredible value for money and I would definitely return to this hotel 
157320,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room is just a bit to small for 2 person but then again the bed was big and comfi , Great service kind staff helpfull clean hotel modern will come back 
157321,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, No parking or agreement with parkings in the area cleaning service start early it can be unconfortable Even if i really appreciate the hotel not ready to pay the official price , Very good service staff friendly quiet place and close to facilities Very nice hotel 
157322,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Noise from hallway backyard Bathroom was insanely cold the tiles on the floor was very very cold We had to have the shower running to heat up the bathroom We think the windows where poorly isolated and the cold from outside had a free pass inside The staff where not helpful with finding another room for us , Nice bed and shower was really nice
157323,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Breakfast too poor for this price And hairdryer in the room doesn t work , Everything was perfect Very nice people on the reception They always try to do best for you Room and bad comfortable I liked very much to stay in this hotel 
157324,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Complained about a broken light as it wasn t possible to turn it off without taking the card out to turn all the lights off Complaint was ignored the first day so complained again we were given the option to change rooms but told it would be fixed the next day so decided not to move however it wasn t fixed A small complaint and sometimes things go wrong but it is how they are dealt with that counts disappointing , Room and hotel were very clean The room was small but comfortable The night staff were pleasant and friendly especially Dennis 
157325,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Coffee machine was broken We asked at the reception to check it and they said they would fix it but when we came back to our room in the evening it was still broken We also had an empty box of napkins in the bathroom It was a little inconvenient We got a room for handicap people though none of us are handicap Hence we had a very inconvenient shower because it was designed specifically for handicap people Moreover the closet didn t close and hence it was hard to get the lights off which were inside the closet The design of closet was very inconvenient because safe was just in the middle of it so we couldn t fit our jackets inside , Everything was clean and nice
157326,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Breakfast is too expensive , This location was in a quieter area so we had to metro to get to everywhere but there were 3 stops surrounding us within 300m so it was easy to get anywhere we needed This property was a great place for the money 
157327,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was very small I could not really move in it , The bed was extremely comfortable there was a choice of pillows of various sizes and the bedding was silky 
157328,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Breakfast Poor service and quality No breakfast tea staff did not understand the word latte and all items in the cooked breakfast were cold Surprised we were not offered any compensation when we reported this at checkout, bed was very comfortable room was quiet even with open window
157329,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The brakfast buffet wasn t the best I had but also not to bad Still worth the money , Room was super romantic with the slant roof and the bed was amazing The location is also great the Sacre Coeur is just a 15 minute walk away and the Galary Lafayette also about 15 minutes 
157330,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The location could be better There is not much to do around You always need the metro The overall decoration was very modern and you don t feel like you are not staying in France Definitely not for Paris lovers , The early check in possibilty Changing of the sheets every day and the coffee machine in the room 
157331,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was a bit small crowded but was still great and the architecture of Paris doesn t really lend itself to large spaces , Location was great and the hotel was clean They have cookies and fresh coffee in the lobby at all times Comfortable beds and very clean stylish bathrooms 
157332,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Parking in the vicinity is a nightmare and you eventually need to leave your car in a paid car park close by There is not even a place in front of the hotel reserved to stop your car and drop off your bags , Nice small inmate hotel
157333,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, A Great Location Very Nice and bright Room with a view over a beautiful street with old houses Very Helpful Staff Two different Supermarkets on the end of tre street 3 metro Stations in the neighborhood The Hotel is small but a really good 4 star Hotel We really recommend this Hotel 
157334,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, they could supply more info for good places to eat and see in the area, staff were great helped us so much with a last minute booking because the place we booked was rated a 9 5 but was absolutly terrible i would definatly come back to best western
157335,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, In the morning we could hear a fair bit of noise from other residents but this was at a reasonable hour so not to bad, Our second visit and a different room but got an upgrade very comfortable and nice layout Staff are most helpful and friendly Bed was nice and comfortable The shower was great 
157336,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room size a little small but ok The toilet seemed to be quite high and a little uncomfortable for those who are shorter, Staff were very helpful and we checked in early thinking we would go out for breakfast but they were able to give us a room straight away which began our holiday so it was very much appreciated 
157337,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The bed was really comfy and wide excellent for those couples that need to starfish whilst they sleep The d cor of the room was elegant and modern There was also a hot water dispenser with little biscuits at concierge Perfect for a quick pick me up tea 
157338,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The sound prove was terrible I could hear all the neighbors showering or flashing sound I was light sleeper so first night was not a good night at all , The room was very clean Location is excellent convenient to metro bus cafe supermaket bars and bakery 
157339,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, I haven t found a parking near the hotel but that s not an issue as there is a parking lot 5min walk from the hotel , The Hotel is really nice and the staff are well organized and helpful 
157340,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room very small hardly place to put your suitcase , Good location close to Rome metro station Very Friendly and helpful guy from Mauritius at the reception Good breakfast 
157341,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Hotel sign was tiny Our cab driver had to call the hotel to find out where exactly the hotel was on the street Our room A C wasn t working properly Advised the front desk about the issue but nothing was done about it Had to open windows to let the cool air in The manager advised us that the whole building s AC system was set to Winter mode heating only therefore the room temperature could not be adjusted She then told us to switch the controls off and leave the windows open Although the hotel manager at that time was very apologetic and was very informative about the issue the front were quite disappointing that they gave us false hope that it will be fixed , Great location very close to Metro station Rome Comfortable average size room Staff were friendly Convenience store is close by 
157342,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, There wasn t anything that we didn t like about this property , The best thing about this property was the wonderful staff Iuliana set the standard high and her team including Aud Darwin Da Costa and Deborah followed through with great personalized attention The location was great near lots of restaurants and walking distance to the Moulin Rouge and other sites 
157343,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, To give something to improve The cleaning staff took a lot one day to clean the room but it is also true that I entered the room during the day disrupting service, I booked the hotel through booking com I reviewed earlier opinions in trypadvisor it was all true to reality The staff attentive special petitions can make it possibles pleasant struggled to explain in Spanish or apologized and spoke English if you do not know french All people in Paris very nice The hotel is located in a strategic area Near the bulevar Clichy which will gives you to the Moulin Rouge 10 15min walking and Sacred Heart Bas lica Europe underground 100mts from hotel with connections to the Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elys es 15 minutes the rooms really clean 10 out of 10 I chose a king size bed extra comfortable extra great I said goodbye to my wife at night before sleeping with smoke signals In reception you have tea rea every day posting internet wifi quality in hotel a computer with printer breakfast rea did not stay but smells very well every morning hotel really quiet You have bycicles shuttle of Paris at 50mts from the hotel if you loves to meet Paris by bike The hotel was the best I have been in recent travels in Europe I have done I will come back again sure 
157344,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, I n in Paris 3x per month and have stayed in many places I paid extra for the upgraded room for five night stay but it room 101 was very tight You could barely get around it with the small desk in front Not 19 sq m no way My brother staying at same hotel for only one night paid less and got upgraded to a suite from basic Seems most people get upgraded anyway so save your money when booking Big confusion when ordering a taxi to airport which came late and could not take credit card and could not be billed to room Led to unneeded airport stress Breakfast at EUR19 is expensive , Excellent Bed Great location friendly staff 
157345,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Expensive, The hotel staff were very friendly the room was really clean and comfortable Excellent bed and shower Nice area close to metro station Not too far to walk to attractions

157350,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Location is a little away from the main sites but didn t bother me all too much in the end , The room was well appointed comfortable and stylish Staff were friendly and very helpful 
157351,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Cleaners would just knock on door and come in before we could answer One time I wasn t dressed properly and that could of been extremely embarrassing they should only come in if the sign on the door is on to say we want cleaning Breakfast staff don t speak that great English and can be quite snappy at times maybe just the ones that were on that day for 19 you can get MUCH better else where But nice pastries , Comfy bed and good cleaning service everyday of rooms

157366,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room is a bit small but it s common in Paris , We were very glad that we got free upgrade to deluxe room The bed was super comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful Close to metro A lot of nice restaurants nearby A very convenient location 
157367,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Bathroom bedroom proportions somewhat off bathroom too big for bedroom area Big issue toilet sat too high from the ground needs to be brought down about 3 4 inches or so , The staff were incredible Very helpful with everything
157368,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Nothing, Location is excellent for the metro travelling round Paris The staff were helpful friendly nothing was too much trouble Our room was clean well presented Good continental breakfast too 
157369,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Nice hotel very friendly staff The rooms were magnificent Quiet room Very good location for visiting Paris just a 10 min walk to the shopping streets or touristic areas You have a secure parking building Europe Rome Batignolles around the corner at 500m for 30 euro day Allot of nice restaurants in walking distance 
157370,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Staff were lovely and very helpful with directions The rooms are a bit small but very modern and have extremely comfortable beds This is a convenient location in Paris and felt very safe walking around at night Highly recommended 
157371,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, soundproofing between rooms could be better but nevertheless it may be called satisfactory , We booked a standard double room but immediately with our arrival we got an upgrade to a big room of approximately 20 square meters The staff was very friendly and helpful especially Juliana Michaela Dwane and Roma Location was excellent not far from the centre Monmartre and Arch 20 to 30 min by foot and close to two metro stations Breakfast was excellent with very wide range of products We booked it included for half a price and it s very rare in Paris The hotel is highly recommended 
157372,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Bad All the furnishings were well above the usual standard but being such a small room may be a little over crowded with the bed side lamps Plus the fridge stock is about 5x retail price which is a shame Ugly Parking outside hotel is practically impossible There is a multi storey car park 200 mtrs away for approx 30 per day, Good Great staff with friendly personalities through out Excellent location Excellent condition We were traveling around europe and this was the only hotel we used that had English tv 
157373,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The area is not the best but we encountered no problems at night though we made sure not to be out too late Also the room was a bit tight in space but we didn t really mind , The shower was amazing We also very much enjoyed the complementary coffee and tea The staff was friendly and helpful The room was clean and tidy 
157374,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Didn t like the nespresso there were no instructions on how to use it We did eventually figure it out but the coffee was like tarmac not very pleasant needed about 3 coffee whiteners each but there were only 2 left out Also no hot water for tea bags very disappointing The breakfast room breakfast was a bit disappointing very limited choice especially for 4 hotel no museli first morning very poor fruit salad and the hot food not great This spoilt what would have been a fantastic stay , The hotel has been very well refurbished The room we had was very well furnished and the bathroom was fabulous Brilliant shower and very nice toiletries 
157375,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room very cozy some might find it small , Newly renovated and in a very nice area Walking distance to Liege and Rome metro stations Good restaurants nearby 
157376,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Typical Paris sized room like in any other hotel, Central location Friendly and cooperative staff Good wifi speed We will surely recommend it to others for stay
157377,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, too small room really small wardrobe, It is in a great location very quite street and near to the Rome metro the room was clean in the room there is a good coffee machine 
157378,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The rooms are very small The breakfast was too expensive for the value , Everything was ok The staff was nice and the area is nice as well rather close to all things that need to be seen in a Paris trip The facilities are new 
157379,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Its in a perfect location in the 8th arr just a 2 minute walk to Rome metro station and a 5 7 minute metro journey to Champs Elysees The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean with good house keeping service I highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Paris 
157380,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Choice of restaurants limited as compared with other locales in Paris , For Paris a spacious room at a reasonable price Good bargain in Out of tourist mainstream 
157381,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, top for value for money considering the price in Paris I can see a big investment on the facility of the hotel Bed Shower sanitary products coffee machine in room all with brand The staff were also very friendly and nice always ready to help 
157382,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, There is street parking and a parking garage on the corner which is 30 euro a day The breakfast is overpriced , The location was close to public transportation restaurants and shops The bed was extremely comfortable and although the bathroom was large the room itself was cramped The staff is extremely friendly and helpful 
157383,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the Nespresso machine in the morning We enjoyed discovering the area in particular Les Batignolles where we had not been before The location gave easy access to transport link also 
157384,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, Great 4 Star Hotel with very nice rooms we have got an upgrade to a higher room cathegory we did not test the breakfirst Paris has so many nice cafes that it is not important to have breakfirst at the hotel Daily water bottle at the room would be nice for a 4 star hotel but there is a city supermarket next door
157385,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, I loved everything about it Nothing to dislike Just one tiny thing is that you can hear doors closing and people who walk heavily in the corridor , The staff was outstanding They accommodated my needs even when I was not feeling well The receptionists from checking in and checking out were completely outstanding even had a free upgrade room upon check in and brilliant shower with great hot water important to me Glad they understood my English as I don t speak French Keep up the good work and do not lose that special touch you give your guests 
157386,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The room was a bit small but this is typical for Paris hotels , Amazing bed and bathroom Perfect service and stuff The location is close to the city center 10 minutes 
157387,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, No hook for the outwear , Great location friendly and helpful stuff cozy and comfortable rooms Good wi fi free Rooms are tiny but this is normal for Paris 
157388,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Breakfast is a bit poor mainly patisseries no vegetables, Staff is friendly Location is very convenient close to 3 different metro station and to variety of restaurants
157389,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, It could get a little noisy when people are waking up opening and closing doors early mornings Sound proof rooms would have been extra perfect , we got a free upgrade to a lovely room with a nice sized bath room Staff are really nice and helpful too perfect location I defintally would recommend this hotel me and my husband really enjoyed our stay 
157390,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Telethon signal was bad in z room and there was some noise in z evening like slapping doors heavily , Staff was v nice and helpful location was excellent and close to restaurants cafes and super market and metro station 
157391,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, No major thing Rooms are little bit small if you like bigger rooms , Rooms are clean and tidy Big comfy bed good bathroom Much much better than I expected Price is good for paris There is metro at close distance 
157392,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Quite some internal noise due to plasterboard walls , We received a lovely upgrade Staff are extremely pleasant and helpful Location is great Close enough to the action and quiet enough for a peaceful night 
157393,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room was a bit small but I assume there are bigger rooms for the right price , Clean and spotless New furniture Incredible staff and services Amazing Will be coming back for sure 
157394,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Nothing Everything was great , Everything about our stay was great We got far more than we expected for the price The room was beautiful and very well equipped with good size TV great selection of tv channels very fast wifi very good heating system good quality towels and bath robes as well as a very comfy bed The cleaning staff were amazing we left our room looking very messy most days and came back to it looking like we just checked in every day Perfect location near leige metro station There is also a pattisserie on the corner of the street that has the most amazing croissants and sandwiches All round very nice quality good value for money hotel 
157395,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The hotel is newly renovated and well equipped The rainshower is great Breakfast although a little expensive is good Good location in a quiet street 
157396,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, hotel was near rome metro station but rome metro station is far from tourist spot must have transfer the metro line and takes 20 minutes by metro , clean comfortable i booked superior room but they give me a chance for free room upgrade to deluxe room
157397,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The variation in prices is silly For a standard room we paid an average of 100 euro night we heard another guests bill was 80 euro and the advertised price was 409 euro Prices for breakfast room service and drinks were much too high we went elsewhere patisserie in little square at the end of the street turn left from reception is very good Standard room is quite crowded so you may prefer a larger size but small is typical for Paris Some noise issues with other guests , Location excellent near both Rome Lignes metro so we were able to get everywhere easily plus close to a couple of supermarkets bakeries etc Huge and very comfortable bed Lovely Parisian street view f you get a front facing room Modern classy decor Nespresso machine Nuxe toiletries Large rainfall shower Good impression straight away from Romain who checked us in and was very welcoming helpful 
157398,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, None , Friendly staff free and reliable wi fi in room and common areas nespresso machine safe in room to store valuables AMAZING shower rain shower head was pure bliss central location less than 5 minutes walk to nearest Metro station 
157399,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The hotel is wonderful Champs elysee is about 20 mins away by foot The staff was great the rooms were small but the bed and pillows are comfy The shower in the superior room was amazing 
157400,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, The hotel is too loudy You can hear neighboors having sex people talking in the passage as if they were literally inside your room Very disappointing on this aspect I was woken up several times in the night Not acceptable for a 4 stars Serious issue to be considered by the owners It is a pity because the street is very calm bur noise comes from inside , The room is perfect Staff at reception very good 
157401,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Very noisy The staff made a party during our stay There was very loud music till 1 00 am Besides we could hear every sound in rooms around There was a room service but we couldnt order coffee , Very nice and clean room Comfortable bed Good location 
157402,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, I stayed in the hotel for three days The breakfast and the staff especially receprionists Tiffan Romain were very nice The hotel was really clear 
157403,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, It did not have good soundproof walls for sure for a 4 star hotel Too much noise First night I could hear people having sex at night Then next day fire alarm was on so loud The last night there was a party going on what staffs refer to as opening of hotel celebration in the lobby Had an early plane to catch the next day but it was loud until midnight Shouldn t the staffs have noticed the guests about this event Althought the facilities were nice it was quite loud overall during our stay , Deluxe room had coffee machine and the bathroom was pretty nice too 
157404,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, This is an excellent boutique hotel Just opened after refurbishment it is extremely clean and decorated in good taste with modern elements We particularly liked the bathroom details floor mosaic walk in shower matte glass walls Nuxe toiletries The bed was very comfortable and the Nespresso machine in the room perfect for a morning coffee And finally the staff is just excellent and very friendly We ll certainly be back 
157405,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, It does not justify giving less than a 10 but breakfast is overpriced I would recommend 7 euros for pastries and coffee instead of 19 for a buffet or to keep it at 19 but with more service and choice such as a chef making omelettes and crepes , Bed was perfect staff was friendly helpful and with a problem solving attitude food was tasty everything brand new and clean excellent amenities offer 
157406,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra,No Negative, The staff couldn t of been more helpful both during the stay and before via email If we go back to Paris we would stay here nothing put us off Definitely recommended

157408,Best Western Premier Kapital Op ra, Room service took a little while to deliver the dinner probably because of Christmans holiday pick housekeeping was not replacing all items daily but anyway were very gentle when asked , The staff were incredibly kind and helpful the hotel is very well located 2km away from Sacre Claire everything in the hotel was brand new which is rare in Paris as the hotel had oppened 3 weeks back and the food room service also very good I would definstely recommend the hotel
