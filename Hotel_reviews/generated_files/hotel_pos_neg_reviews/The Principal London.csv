3839,The Principal London, 1 The hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized 2 It was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience 3 The in room breakfast was not on time I was almost late on the morning 4 Very old decorations not clean enough 5 It was definitely not worth for the price , The location is great just near Russel Sq Station

3843,The Principal London, Double room was small and in need of a freshen up Also woken up a 5am when a noisy generator fired up outside our room this may have something to do with all the building work that is going on at the hotel but when you have had a late night that s the last thing you want , Great looking hotel both inside and out

3846,The Principal London, Nothing at all , Awesome historic building conveniently located next to the underground Staff specifically Miles was incredibly friendly and made our stay an experience 
3847,The Principal London, I have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years The rooms are getting tired and worn The front desk staff are indifferent I tried to break a 50 note at front desk so I could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants Major exterior renos going on outside hotel I hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well I think it is time that I try another hotel , The location of the hotel is amazing You are easy walking distance to all of the London attractions and to the city The old doorman has been here for years a Welcoming face for sure

3849,The Principal London, Light outside of the door shines through spy hole and the door frame Unable to turn it off crazy I am a returning client make more of your existing client base , Door staff excellent reception staff excellent I asked for a quiet room and that was what I was given astonishing most London hotels would have ignored my request 
3850,The Principal London, Had to go to local shop for fresh milk as not available from housekeeping staff One awful sandwich in the bar Shame really as other food very good , Beautiful building great location and really helpful staff 
3851,The Principal London, The first room we were allocated had a musty smell to it but we were efficiently moved across to another room with no bother at all Some areas need updating but this was already underway in some parts of the hotel Shower was very noisy , Plenty of choice for breakfast with very nice tea and coffee full English and continental available with fresh croissants and pastries also Location was perfect as it was very close to tube station but also within walking distance of the major shops and attractions and opposite Russell Square Gardens Staff were very pleasant and helpful 
3852,The Principal London, I had requested a quiet room Given room on the 6th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot Blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on Requested room change Given Room on 2nd floor Windows blocked out no daylight Extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between 5am until 11pm Worst sleep ever Old noisy air conditioning system also Hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this When booking I booked for 3 nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as I had made the booking through Booking com ,No Positive
3853,The Principal London, The bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed Both my husband I had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us , The hotel was clean and the room was well knitted out shower brilliant The staff were lovely 
3854,The Principal London, see adjacent box , Breakfast was not fresh Potatoes the standard fried triangles were stale and over fried Pastries were not fresh and gave off a stale taste I m comparing the Russell Hotel breakfast buffet to that at the Euston Hilton Hotel at Upper Woburn which was excellent 
3855,The Principal London, , Fabulous service Gorgeous old world charm Modem spacious room Loved having such a helpful doorman Every day after a busy day of sightseeing how wonderful to be greeted by cold water infused with fresh fruit at the reception counter 
3856,The Principal London, The room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the Victorian style we liked Work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times , We generally loved this hotel We d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in Bloomsbury before So we thought we d try staying there The location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from Heathrow was do able The hotel s Victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the Titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room The staff was very helpful 
3857,The Principal London,No Negative, The Hotel Russell is a rare survivor of a bygone era Few hotels today can match the historical opulence of the Russell Hotel It is worth a visit if only to have a drink at the bar 
3858,The Principal London, Room and hotel generally were a little dark Pillow was lumpy Decor and furniture a little tired , Location perfect and delightful area not too busy Lovely park opposite Nice restaurants and bars in the area Character of hotel is beautiful with lovely marble and tiled features Staff polite and helpful Our room was large with nice bathroom Would definitely stay there again 
3859,The Principal London, Seems like room would be very hot in summer Air conditioning did not cool room very much when I used it but not a real issue in June , This is a large classic hotel Interior by the man who did the decorating of the Titanic Located very close to the tube makes it great for getting around Room much larger than most in London Right across street from park Near British Museum 
3860,The Principal London, The rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings , Great central location and a monument to Victorian grandeur on the architecture of the hotel 
3861,The Principal London, The hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance The sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel The television was very small and dated , The staff were particularly friendly and helpful It was our 25th wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in We were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and 2 delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day This was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit 
3862,The Principal London, N A, Staff were really friendly and they catered to all our needs Everything was very clean our requests were all fulfilled which made this an extra special stay for a birthday I couldn t fault a single thing 
3863,The Principal London, We had a small claustrophobic room next to the noisy road with a questionable air con system and the shower did not work An engineer failed to repair it and after several cold showers we were moved to a new quieter and better room the next day and were compensated for the inconvenience , Great location for what we needed Beautiful exterior and lobby and bar area
3864,The Principal London,No Negative, Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan 
3865,The Principal London, Shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken , Very clean and comfortable good location Breakfast was very good fresh food 
3866,The Principal London, We chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing Interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money The Windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment , The location was good and it is easy to get to the main attractions in London from there 
3867,The Principal London, After checking out I left my luggage at the concierge However when I returned I had to wait or over 20 minutes before I got my items as the concierge was elsewhere This resulted in me nearly missing my train , Good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos Take note not all rooms have the old grand baths 
3868,The Principal London, Hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses The tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it Breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid I d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge , Great location friendly staff lovely room although a bit on the small side for a twin room Very lovely building with real character gorgeous stair case and chandelier 
3869,The Principal London, There was no water in the room and we had to pay 10 for two bottles from the bar , The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and made our stay work like clockwork Likewise the building works had no negative impact on our stay The hotel is well located for both Euston and St Pancras station and of course the British Museum 
3870,The Principal London, We couldn t shower bath the cold tap fell off bathroom very cramped would be better off with just a shower in there Breakfast was awful dried up bacon mushrooms eggs weren t any better Drinks very expensive We did complain and were given a refund, Beds were comfortable room was adequate for our needs
3871,The Principal London, The air conditioning was pretty useless and didn t cool down the room as it was located on the floor and not on the ceiling and it was very warm in the room , Beautiful hotel and in a good location for the eurostar room was a good size located on the top floor overlooking the park staff were friendly and helpful
3872,The Principal London, They charge a fortune for breakfast use the caf s surrounding the park instead Cheaper and nicer For working not very good comfort The desk and chair in the room is very uncomfortable to sit and work with , Comfortable bed and great location Friendly staff 
3873,The Principal London, Rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning , The hotel was designed by the person who designed the Titanic and the downstairs and architecture was incredibly grand The rooms and bathrooms were pretty small Bernard the concierge was excellent 
3874,The Principal London, Breakfast was horribly overpriced We were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed ,No Positive
3875,The Principal London, The fire drill that takes place every Monday at 1 00 pm After a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off , The building is beautiful and the staff were helpful and friendly Euston Station is a 10 minute walk away and Oxford St shopping close by 
3876,The Principal London, nothing really, Rooms small compared to previous stays but comfortable with plenty of amenities We did move one room as there was no door chain and air conditioner very noisy Staff are incredibly helpful and pleasant Concierge had the doorman walk our luggage to the Underground And a restaurant designed by the designer of the Titanic 
3877,The Principal London,No Negative, I highly recommend this hotel Excellent value for money in central London The architecture and the decor is remarkable My room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows And the bed was very comfortable In addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the Hotel Manager And it was great to see the Receptionist Cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism 
3878,The Principal London,No Negative, An incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room And Cohen the Receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite Excellent hotel 
3879,The Principal London, The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it I woke up with back pains as well We ended up switching hotels because of it There was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer Other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that Personally that didn t really bother me , The hotel is clean The staff is very friendly The room was relatively big so I had space to move around The staff is super friendly and the Location is perfect The tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus For example you might think that being close to Kings Cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right Switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location It s also located in front of Russel Square Park which is very nice 
3880,The Principal London, Not unique to The Russell but I dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of 12 5 and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill ,No Positive
3881,The Principal London, Rooms very tired and badly in need of refurbishment Air conditioning did not work Bathroom very small Lifts very small , Reception staff were very helpful Breakfast was good 
3882,The Principal London, The shower didn t work properly The bathroom was tiny and it wasn t easy to get out of the shower A shower cap would have come in useful , The location
3883,The Principal London, I loved this place They are renovating some of the hotel and so it will be even nicer , The location from St Pancras was perfect We walked from the station to the hotel in less than 10 minutes Great access to the Tube 
3884,The Principal London, Hotel is very tired We had a twin bedded room which faced an interior courtyard Windows very dirty outside Tiles in the bathroom needed grouting Room service extremely limited , Good location

3886,The Principal London, The shower leaked under the door into the bedroom and the bathroom floor was also very slippery The bedroom was far too hot and couldn t be cooled down , Excellent breakfast Comfortable room Wonderful wide staircase 
3887,The Principal London,No Negative, The bedroom suite was luxurious quiet and comfortable and the bathroom with it s twin sinks and sit down shower was absolutely wonderful I couldn t fault it and I am extremely fussy

3889,The Principal London,No Negative, Always excellent reception staff who try hard to offer quiet rooms I always feel welcome and that s why I return It s very good value for the quality
3890,The Principal London, Some of us found the frequent sirens of ambulances heading for the nearby Great Ormond Street Hospital disturbing in the nighttime , It is a beautiful old hotel a bit worn down but with distinct charm 
3891,The Principal London, No shower cap shower gel or conditioner Insufficient milk and coffee Air conditioning so noisy that it was unusable Fridge not working Food in restaurant very average quality Drinks very expensive Threadbare carpet on stairs ,No Positive
3892,The Principal London, Friendly concierges were helpful but weren t actually familiar with many of the sites or transports inquired after They went online to find out , Excellent desk and concierge service gracious and friendly and provided good service Location is right at the Picadilly tube line and easy walking to the Circle line I took the Picadilly tube to Heathrow and avoided traffic to get there I rolled my suitcase around the corner took the lift to the platform and didn t have to move again until reaching Heathrow ok one short stairway That s convenient 
3893,The Principal London, Nothing It was a lovely but small room in London with a good view But had everything we needed Would definitely stay again , Perfect location for our morning spent at the British Museum 
3894,The Principal London, Building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase , Great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets Concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel Grandiose decor inside 
3895,The Principal London, More choice for room service both food and drink to suit todays traveller More TV film choices as currently limited , The staff were excellent professional and friendly We received an unexpected free upgrade and champagne and cake for our celebration Just wonderful 
3896,The Principal London, The Hotel Russell is one of our favourite London hotels but our room this visit was quite small and there was no view at all from the window BUT it was very good value we booked quite late and it was a busy weekend , Breakfast is excellent and the staff are superb 
3897,The Principal London, Got a room over the hallway from major refurbishment that woke us up in the morning Got the room changed with very little fuss , Location is superb Underground next door Classy hotel 
3898,The Principal London, the pillow too big for me therefore my nights were uncomfotable i was obliged to use the red decorative cushion , the bed was comfortable the concierge was pleasant and very helpful l 
3899,The Principal London, It s a tired old building We had problems with plumbing A C didn t work elevator is so tiny two people plus luggage fill it up Windows didn t open There is no business center to print airline tickets Overall it was expensive and there are other choices nearby at the same or lower cost , Staff very friendly and helpful Super location close to three Underground stops Shopping and restaurants very conveniently nearby Lobby is beautiful like hotels of this vintage Breakfast room and food were excellent and staff very attentive to our whims 
3900,The Principal London,No Negative, Clean comfortable room The staff were helpful and friendly The hotel is in a fantastic location I couldn t have asked for more I just wish I had been staying longer 
3901,The Principal London, We spend 5 nights in three different rooms We were moved twice due to very very poor Quality rooms This is a lovely looking hotel from the street with marvellous staff and a great position but a hotel that is well over due for a complete makeover I would suggest for the price to stay at the Russell you could do MUCH better elsewhere, The staff we very helpful
3902,The Principal London,No Negative, Old Edwardian charm and location The dining room and other public spaces were done by the interior designer of the RMS TITANIC and the dining room is an almost exact copy 
3903,The Principal London, The room 427 was not up to the standards of a 2016 4 star hotel Mattress too hard Not enough wardrobe space noisy Bathroom would have been ok in 1975 , The location and the friendliness of the staff
3904,The Principal London, Air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on Saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed Also the bathroom was VERY compact Quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror , The staff were lovely and helpful and the reception area looked impressive on arrival Throughout the hotel the decor classy The room was lovely and quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable Good location with easy reach to train station tube and restaurants 
3905,The Principal London, I m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot The sink in the bathroom was very small Being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and I was awakened early It was very hot in London this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times I was also unhappy that I d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when I returned on Sunday evening that money had disappeared I know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken Another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either , The Staff were excellent the Bloody Mary s in the bar were perfect and the location was ideal 
3906,The Principal London, I wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast Is it separated by race or rank of room we are Japanese I hope not This is the first hotel which the staves designated our table And the tables we were shown were not so comfortable Besides I would like to request to improve the breakfast And about our room honestly I regreted not asking to change another room I wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if I paid extra fee because it was my mother s last 3 days of staying in London , Some of staves talked to us in Japanese so we felt welcome 
3907,The Principal London, Needs a bit of TLC but overall a very nice hotel Noisy aircon generators outside the room View was actually of them but it is London and we paid around 169 for just bed no breakfast which in London is reasonable , Great position for us from St Pancras and also for the theatres restaurants etc Lovely lighting and staircase in the foyer
3908,The Principal London, The room was tatty and well worn with gaps in the fitting of the windows and a really very poor standard of maintenance , The location and the grandeur of the stairway
3909,The Principal London, The room I booked was for my partners birthday surprise and was nice but a little small The package I booked was rose petals and bottle of bubbles on arrival which was lovely The one on the website was a lot larger or an excellent camera shoot Luckily I don t get up in the night but if I had of the space between the wall and the bed would of been interesting as very tight , Really liked the hotel and location 
3910,The Principal London,No Negative, A lovely magnificent old building and well kept hotel in the heart of London Great staff great room a good bed and a nice breakfast I will return

3912,The Principal London, The rooms on the 5th floor are very small and unless your 5ft 9 you ll have to squat to get underneath the shower head , Great location and reception area
3913,The Principal London, Small small room First room air did not work However they did change our room the next day, The staff especially Bernard at the concierge The hotel is old and GORGEOUS 
3914,The Principal London, Happy with everything, The staff went out of their way to accommodate us during a difficult period of health which without our anniversary break would not have been able to go ahead And the little anniversary suprise made it even more special
3915,The Principal London, More shelf room needed in the bathroom was my only critism , Lovely comfy sleep Staff brilliant and more than helpful Beautiful bar Stunning building and interesting Titanic connection Very reasonably priced meals 
3916,The Principal London, Room sheets could ve been cleaner , Service was excellent from the start great location and central to everything The underground is around the corner Breakfast was good with a variety to choose from comfortable beds and nice view from room 
3917,The Principal London, Nothing , Continental breakfast was fantastic And the staff went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and problem free Train station was round the corner and a small shopping centre too Me and my new fianc e had an amazing stay and we will go back 
3918,The Principal London, Building work during the day but this can t be helped , Cafe in Russell Square park just over the road serving breakfast at a fraction of the price and in a nice setting 
3919,The Principal London, 2nd floor noise from street level but I can deal with that Bed is uncomfortable Old spring Not a good night sleep as a result Shower pressure was not great Overall the particular room we had could be the exception , Needs updating but quirky Room was decent size The bar was alright cosy and we didn t have any problems getting seats 
3920,The Principal London, there was nothing i did not like, I was really impressed with my room it was light and airy I felt welcomed at all times i loved being able to curl up in the bar with a book I felt very comfortable and safe as a sinlge woman 
3921,The Principal London, Drilling started VERY early in the daytime for the ongoing refurbishment, All staff were extremely polite friendly and welcoming Russell Square Underground station just around the corner Pleasant park with fountain and cafe right across the road 
3922,The Principal London, I was advised that the restaurant was closed on Sundays which was a pity as the friend I was meeting and I would have liked to eat there The only thing missing was a bathrobe I d have enjoyed a bathrobe subsequent hotels during my trip all had them but the hotels themselves weren t as good , I booked a room only deal so didn t use the restaurant for breakfast However otherwise I loved my room it was clean comfortable and atmospheric The staff were polite and helpful Altogether a lovely old hotel Please keep it that way 
3923,The Principal London, How to get cold water in the bathroom is and remains a mystery Breakfast variety of fruits and kinds of breads is limited , Room and bathroom very nice and decent size
3924,The Principal London, Horrible mattresses sprung chairs pathetic bathroom supplies staff were grumpy and poorly trained Interiors are depressing , Good location w tube busses and British museum Concierge staff were excellent 
3925,The Principal London, The value rating vs money that you get cannot be acceptable for a 4star hotel We were given a room for a single that the adjective tiny does not represent how small it was transformed to get a couple In a 4 star hotel that is far from acceptable After complaining twice since the first time they got us another tiny room we finally got the expected room The images of the hotel s rooms are far from being the real deal A disappointing experience , The location
3926,The Principal London, Never got washcloths , Proximity to the tube Beautiful exterior and architecture Very friendly staff Nice big bathroom in our room Good neighborhood for dining 
3927,The Principal London, 2nd bed in our double accommodation was a sleeper sofa and the mattress was sheer torture , Breakfast was fab Bernard concierge took very good care of us 
3928,The Principal London,No Negative, The staff are very pleasant and accommodating and the location is great overlooking the Square It has a wonderful old time feel without being antiquated 
3929,The Principal London, Check in was terrible we arrived about 6 pm and it took us 2 5 hours to get the room , It s very beautiful building Location is also not bad Stuff was trying their best but the check in was so badly organized that it s hard to get reed of the biter taste 
3930,The Principal London, Quite some noise came from machinery in the courtyard through closed windows even at night , The Building is appropriately glamorous for a hotel in London s centre The staff was very nice and helpful The breakfast was delicious and offered the whole variety of a full monty 
3931,The Principal London,No Negative, Breakfast was excellent location perfect to get anywhere in London Beds were a little hard as were the pillows and the towel rack was very difficult to put towel back as I am short and it was tucked up in bathroom niche
3932,The Principal London, Room service menu is a little limited Having said that there are numerous eateries on your doorstep Parking not on site but close by , Location is great Has a very pleasing ambience and a cosy feel to the hotel Staff were welcoming and very helpful 
3933,The Principal London, Bar prices a bit steep but did sort of expect it being such a classy hotel, The staff really looked after us and especially made a fuss of our mum who s 80th birthday celebration was the reason for our visit Thank you
3934,The Principal London, Not enough towel hooks for two people Nowhere to place tooth brush and toiletries near sink , Staff were all very attentive and polite Special thanks to bar staff for treating us so well 
3935,The Principal London, The building is old and the decor shabby What you see on the booking site isn t the room you get Our room was small carpet worn Windows filthy and a tiny bath with a tiny TV , Location is good and Close by to a tube station
3936,The Principal London, Could have done without a visit from a man to check the blinds once we d checked in The roman blind didn t work very well Room was slightly smaller than one would expect for the money and a little tired , All the common areas the bar and the staff were all excellent 
3937,The Principal London, Room rather hot airless Window with obscured glass into internal courtyard didn t open aircon not very effective Only one set of shampoo soap etc , Great staff Wonderful historic hotel in a perfect location Comfortable room 
3938,The Principal London, Epensive unless you get a special fare, Magnificient hotel Fantastic location Beautiful architecture Nice bar Great English breakfast in a gorgeous stylish room
3939,The Principal London, Bathroom a little small 628 but they are updating rooms Shower did not work properly Kept going hot and cold It may have had something to do with the workmen next door But we managed , Very Comfortable room Staff very good and excellent location Always stay here 
3940,The Principal London, The biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of English and this was hugely frustrating Not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too It was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and I do think the language barrier plays a big part in this For this reason alone I sadly will not be coming back , Location is great and nice and central Stayed in single rooms and they were okay comfortable and quiet Bar was nice and cocktails were lovely 
3941,The Principal London, The rooms are in the process of being refurbished but there were holes in the carpet in my room , Breakfast was wonderful Can t beat the location 
3942,The Principal London, The prices in the bar were very high The dinner menu was mainly just pub food The long walk to the bedroom from the elevator , The bedroom was small but nicely furnished and well appointed The bar was very comfortable and the service was excellent
3943,The Principal London, Very small bathroom a larger person would not be able to get to the sink given the proximity to the shower screen on the bath , Super comfy bed and fantastic location 
3944,The Principal London, The room on level 3 was above air conditioning units so sleep was not do great as we had to have the window open because it was very hot in the room We was moved to this room after we refused the other room on level 2 because the windows did not open, Not far from Covent Garden and the hotel looks amazing from the outside
3945,The Principal London, It was all good Our family room which I booked was unavailable so the manager gave us two separate rooms and complimentary breakfast Customer service was first class, The staff were brilliant 
3946,The Principal London, the room was quite small and the windows not insulated so outside noise and cold air were factors, staff were very friendly and helpful the bed was very comfy and everything very clean 
3947,The Principal London, On arrival the doorman asked if I could get out my wheelchair and climb the stairs as the lift would take too long for him to set up , Big comfy room and the reception staff were excellent
3948,The Principal London, View of an inside courtyard Room virtually furthest from entrance good exercise For the price and given the lead time booking I expected a view of London breakfast way below par for a hotel of this stature Book in took all of 15 minutes as staff struggled to find us a room despite a 4 month lead time, Lovely bed well fitted out with ensuite 
3949,The Principal London, We would return to the room after a day out on the city and housekeeping would not have cleaned our room yet at 5 00 in the afternoon and we d have to leave for 30 minute once housekeeping finally came by , Location is great 
3950,The Principal London, My husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took 200 out of my account without permission 4 conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it They made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in London is a barrister and was appalled when we told him , Liked the room very cosy comfy bed
3951,The Principal London, My room was cancelled a few days before and I was given a room with a poor view but what made it worse was the fact the windows were dreadfully dirty and it was only the second floor made the room grubby Also the step into the bath was extremely high , I liked the jester of complimentary fruit and magazines in the room 
3952,The Principal London, Check in was frustrating our room had been allocated to someone else which we found out when we tried to access the room Rooms were generally small and not clean to the standard expected for a 4 hotel In general I felt we paid more than we should have for what we got , Location for London centre was good 
3953,The Principal London, Bedroom needed redecorating poor storage facilities Bath very small Noise from workmen along corridor Early morning deliveries below window, Bed comfortable Safe hair drier and iron in room
3954,The Principal London, Unfortunately I got a room next to the kitchen extractor fan which was VERY noisy Room 247 by the way The first night it stopped at 11 p m so that was all right but the second night it did not so I hardly slept at all However when I mentioned this at checking out I was compensated with having my breakfasts taken off the bill and promised a free upgrade next time I come so I ended up feeling more pleased than I had thought I would be I have stayed at the Russell several times before After my sleepless night I thought this was the last time but because of the way my complaint was dealt with I will certainly return , The staff were all friendly professional and helpful and the location is great The hotel building is magnificent although the rooms are pretty standard 
3955,The Principal London, Uncomfortable bed small room windows requiring repair and were drafty and noisy and the room decor was extremely dated , Ideal location with friendly helpful staff
3956,The Principal London, the extractor fan in our room didn t work the window in our room didn t open and as the room was small the poor ventilation was an issue especially when the shower was on also there were no extra sockets so charging our phones etc was difficult We moved to a different room on the 3rd night of a 3 night stay so at least the last night was better but 1st and 2nd nights were disappointing , location
3957,The Principal London, Tired room with peeling wallpaper stained furniture cracks all over the room The duvet was lumpy however they fixed this right away The iron didn t work very well Extremely cramped toilet as in the sink fitted just over the toilet seat had to be a contortionist to use it however it was clean , Hotel front very impressive facade lobby staircases doorman Excellent staff and service throughout the stay shower clean and fresh towels and shampoo body wash lotion provided every day Good mirrors well lit Cupboard and safe with coffee making facilities TVs and wifi Superb Location 1 minute from Russell Square station bus stops a Tesco express Pret and The Brunswick mall brimming with restaurants and convenient stores Also 10 mins from the Britush museum a very big plus 
3958,The Principal London, We had booked superior rooms but they were unavailable however the hotel gave complimentary breakfast and bottle of wine , The hotel was old but well looked after loved the entrance and stair case 
3959,The Principal London, Would have liked bigger room and one with a view but you don t go to London to sit in your room Breakfast good but a little expensive , Beautiful grand hotel Comfortable clean room Polite and helpful staff Excellent location in the heart of London Great base for exploring
3960,The Principal London, didn t like being woken up an hour before needing to be woken up especially at 3 30am, good position for sight seeing good breakfasts great staff
3961,The Principal London,No Negative, The friendliness and courtesy of all the staff from the check in desk to the dining room staff I loved the comfortable bed the view over Russell Square gardens the high ceilings and ornate deco and the buffet breakfasts with everything anybody could possibly ask for even me as a vegetarian 
3962,The Principal London, Despite the grand public spaces the rooms are rather tired in terms of d cor and furnishings and really need to be torn apart and modernized The windows are grubby and haven t been cleaned in years After coming from a four star hotel in Valencia that was exquisite in every respect I realized I had returned to shabby Britain , Helpful and conscientious staff 
3963,The Principal London, Automatic 12 5 tip added to everything Why do companies do this It gets right up my nose Leaves you feeling either ripped off or nowty for asking for it to be removed Such a shame Would have been 11 out of 10 otherwise , Lovely hotel staff were fantastic very helpful Food was wonderful too 
3964,The Principal London, The Saturday evening bar staff were fairly busy and less attentive than usual The air conditioning was very noisy we opened a window to cool the room but then of course there was noise from outside The bathroom was small fortunately we are small people but even so the space is small for even one person I really do not like the glass doors on your bathrooms less privacy and the light from the bathroom is intrusive if someone is asleep , The staff were friendly and helpful particularly the reception and concierges The room was comfortable and had all we needed Breakfast as always was very good and generous We like the atmosphere and ambience and it is so well placed for stations concerts etc 
3965,The Principal London, Room was very tired feeling walls and skirting needed a good sand down and coat of paint Rust damage down back of hand basin clearly visible from toilet , Very friendly helpful staff 
3966,The Principal London, The bedrooms are tiny but saying that we weren t in the rooms a lot , The breakfast was lovely The building itself very impressive Concierge people was so helpful 
3967,The Principal London,No Negative, This is a grande olde Dame of a hotel very charming right opposite Russell Square It is undergoing careful renovation but this is not noticeable or bothersome I stayed near the top floors and renovation has not reached there as yet I quite liked that fact and I have to say it was very nice to stay in such an olde hotel Some reviewers have criticised the older rooms but I did not find fault and I stayed in a small double Everything worked wifi was high speed water was very hot TV had plenty channels Housekeeping was very good I have stayed in very upmarket hotels over the years and yes Russell is showing her age at the top but this is being repaired A brief problem on the floor with a tripped fuse was resolved within ten minutes by Maintainance unlike a previous Hotel Du Vin that I stayed in where they did not even fix an issue in my room my entire stay so very very good staff taking care of everything All the staff from the Doormen Conci rge to Reception were very nice and helpful to me Sometimes I think guests have a duty to be decent guests also and respect the olde spirt of the hotel you stay in regarding negative reviewers on this site Walking down the staircase was lovely each morning and the emerging marble lower down was fantastic you must meet George the lucky dragon he brought great luck to me that week of my stay Good olde Grande Dame Lovely staff Will benefit from her renovation within 
3968,The Principal London, Front desk receptionist was extremely rude Programmed my key card incorrectly my room was in a far corner of the hotel 4 long corridors I dragged my suitcase and backpack there back and forth twice until they were able to get it right She didn t apologize mostly shrugged and said sometimes it s sensitive Stands out as bad service , Generally good value
3969,The Principal London,No Negative, The staff were absolutely amazing The location perfect great cafes in area for breakfast options etc Beautiful room especially the bathroom Highly recommended 
3970,The Principal London, When I arrived at 10 30pm the double room I had booked 129 was not available had been double booked and I was offered a single 129 with a so called free breakfast even though I knew the breakfast was normally 19 so they were actually ripping me off Eventually they agreed 109 with a free breakfast the room itself though was incredibly small so much so I had to move the cahir in front of the door to be able to see the to feom the bed, The cooked breakfast was good quality though poor value for money 19
3971,The Principal London, The building is old and there was a lot of noise from banging doors other residents I guess , Helpful friendly staff Great location walking distance from the British Museum and a short tube ride the the West end theatres 
3972,The Principal London, Was impossible to store extracted breastmilk in the freezer due to hotel policy I could use the fridge at reception but I would have booked a different hotel if I knew this beforehand Aircon was quite noisy windows were dirty , Staff very friendly and helpful Very well located easy travel to St Pancras 
3973,The Principal London, Room rather gloomy due to limited light and external low level noise assume to be some kind of extraction units Extra milk would have be helpful , Location excellent excellent customer service
3974,The Principal London, The rooms were to small and everything crammed in The overall condition of hotel is poor with major decoration work needed Bathroom was in poor condition with bath panels falling off the extractor fan did not work There was excessive noise from outside I e The kitchen vents etc so we could not have windows open at night if we had wanted to open them it was only about 5 which is ridiculous The air conditioning was so loud we could not get a full nights sleep it also seemed to be stuck at one temp even if you adjusted it The TV remote did not work properly so had to use controls on the TV unit itself which meant getting out of bed to turn TV off which at the hotel prices should never be the case we wanted luxury not excercise , The outside of the building stunning property
3975,The Principal London, Extract fan outside the window droned on and on all day and all night aggravating tinnitus , Location central period features nice bathroom with a bath Friendly staff
3976,The Principal London, Have stayed here several time in very nice rooms but this time the room was very tired with watermarks on the ceiling from a leak The shower leaked so much that there was no pressure I was moved to an equally tired room across the corridor but at least the shower worked I was obviously in the budget area but not at a budget price , Staff very helpful
3977,The Principal London, The first room a twin room facing the court yard was awful noisy air con and windows could not open Unable to sleep But we got another room which was very nice We dont really eat breakfast and it was a little annoying that the reception lept trying to make us book breakfast , The hotel is old but charming and the staff very accomodating Lovely bar The location is great tube next door but one can easily walk to to many of the main attactions 
3978,The Principal London, The room was a bit small and warm as only 1 window of the 3 could be opened for only 3 inches Our room was on the side of the hotel and the morning sun makes the room so hot Bathroom was a bit disappointing Small very tine sink next to bath like u have in your house in a downstairs toilet your elbow touches the wall when brushing teeth or cleaning face shower head is the old fashioned the one attached to the wall so you cant take the head down , lovely grand hotel staff very helpful ideal location The concierge and door boy were very friendly ask for a taxi and the door boy waves one down for you outside the hotel Very clean and love the old Victorian style A hotel with a lot of history Would book again 
3979,The Principal London,No Negative, I appreciate warm professional staff willing to assist the customers great hotel very well placed near British Museum nice ambiance Comfortable rooms and clean 
3980,The Principal London, Room didn t face on to Russell Square but was quite noisy Windows did little to cut out minimise noise Fellow guests were also quite noisy walls doors were quite thin and noise filtered in , Cleanliness of the rooms was great Despite not requested bath towels were replaced daily Staff were very friendly and eager to please i e offering additional services 
3981,The Principal London, Size of room, Staff was very nice and helpful Single rooms are small and seem to need some refurbishment The location was the main reason of my booking Breakfast is good with good selection 
3982,The Principal London,No Negative, The building exterior was very impressive the interior was stunning Loved the history of the interior the bar was very comfortable and the restaurant for breakfast was excellent Our room was quite small but had everything needed including a comfortable bed
3983,The Principal London, There wasn t anything to not like, As we were celebrating our anniversary they had a large bottle of prosecco on ice along with a lovely chocolate moose left in our room on our arrival along with a card wonderful surprise 
3984,The Principal London, Hotel interior is looking a little tired and could do with a minor make over the rooms are very clean so don t be put off , Location is excellent and the hotel is quite grand prices were pretty reasonable for central London and the staff were excellent 
3985,The Principal London, Noise in room was awful toilet was stuck to the side of wash hand basin making it difficult to use very small bathroom windows need replacing urgently this will help with noise I was surprised at breakfast to find only mugs on the table no saucers no table covers tea and toast would be nice if brought to table herb sausages at breakfast scrambled eggs need to be kept hotter as with most of the buffet breakfast was lukewarm , Excellent location staff very friendly and helpful were able to answer all our questions 
3986,The Principal London, Disabled wet room Was not informed about this during check in, Spacious room for central london Beautiful building Close to Euston station and roti King
3987,The Principal London, the rooms are not so good the first night I stayed on the 5th floor the room was unconfortably cold as the roof is not insulated and the windows are very old and draughty Only lukewarm water in the shower in the morning The second night I moved to the third floor the room was larger and nicer but again the windows were draughty and single glazed and the sink in the bathroom was ridiculously small , Tha historical building which dates back to the turn of the century The common areas entrance hall the main staircase the bar and breakfast room are very grand and luxurious George the resident dragon on the second floor landing its twin is under the ocean on the Titanic 
3988,The Principal London, Window needed to be washed but not much of a view on the backside of the building anyway , Convienent location on the Picadilly line gives you direct access to Heathrow Coventry Garden and Leicester Square Just a few blocks from the British Museum We had booked a superior room but were informed prior to arrival that due to renovations it would not be available Provided us with a rebate for downgrading to a standard room and gave us free breakfast The room we got was much bigger than we expected which was a pleasant surprise The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay The breakfast was great although I don t know if I would spend the 19 50 per person if it was not included 
3989,The Principal London, Can not think of anything , It is beautiful looking hotel fantastic staircase comfortable bar lounge The staff were all really pleasant and helpful from the minute we arrived at reception to collecting our bags when leaving 
3990,The Principal London, shower was over the bath and it was high to get into A walk in shower is preferable for me however it didn t spoil our wonderful stay , beautiful decor great position
3991,The Principal London, Nothing no complaints throughout our stay, The hotel and staff was excellent we have been before and will be back in the near future really enjoy our stay there
3992,The Principal London, the shower in the bathroom is not detachable and every time had to wet my hair , the location is good very near the station and some good restaurants hotel s architecture both inside and outside is amazing 
3993,The Principal London, I had a double room at the back of the hotel which was a bit noisey due to air conditioner units the room should of had a fridge and being a double room should of had two of everything in the bathroom which it did not , staff and facilities were good as were comfort levels 
3994,The Principal London, Room wasn t available until 1 5 hours after check in time Bathroom too small we expected a little more from a four star hotel , Beautiful entrance and grand looking building Comfortable bed 
3995,The Principal London, I can t think of anything , My daughter and I came down to visit SOAS and were looking forward to staying in style We loved the space in the room the armchairs that the windows opened onto the park having an actual bath in the bathroom having real glasses rather than plastic cups The beds were comfortable and cosy We could leave our suitcases with Concierge and generally we loved everything about the Russell Hotel 
3996,The Principal London, Refreshments in the bedroom were very poor for a hotel of this calibre Wallpaper loose on ceiling All rooms should be in excellent condition, The ambience of the hotel was very good Very good staff Position very good
3997,The Principal London, Shower went hot and cold and noise from other rooms annoying I know its central London and the traffic noise doesn t bother me but someone throwing up in the next room that sounds like its right by your head is not so good , Comfortable room and a decent size for a single room Location excellent Very clean and had nice desk chair tea and coffee stuff small double bed was great Also liked the general ambience and the style of the hotel is lovely 
3998,The Principal London, Could have done with a hook next to the shower to hang your towel on , The building was spectacular inside and out The staff were very friendly and efficient The room was to a high standard and the food was out of this world 
3999,The Principal London, The room is far away too small than we though and the picture shows the facility is old in the room the sink and drainage hole of bathtub broken and worse We change the room more than one time Enduring the rest of our staying , It s really an old hotel the lobby is astonishment attracting Heater work well and enough 
4000,The Principal London, Despite being on the 7th floor we couldn t believe how noisy our room was from the traffic in the street below Single glazed very old windows that really need replaced though a good wash would be a start Bed was NOT comfy The room was small but clean I think these rooms are for booking com customers you get what you pay for i guess , Lovely looking old building nice entrance area friendly staff good breakfast 7th floor bedroom with fabulous view Close to the tube station 
4001,The Principal London, room was small but no complaints given the price that s London unless you pay top dollar , receptionist really pleasant and helpful I worked most of the day in my rom and it was perfect for that 
4002,The Principal London, the toilet was stinking pretty bad normal rooms were not great and looked different from website had to upgrade to premier to get a nicer room and it wasnt as nice as hoped still , the staff was very nice and hotel looks great from outside but not so much inside rooms 
4003,The Principal London, The room did not appear to share the classical feel of the hotel It felt far cheaper than the 235 I paid But the bathroom was excellent , The service location and general appearance
4004,The Principal London, Can t think of anything really , I found the staff super friendly and helpful front desk restaurant door men room staff dining room and kitchen staff they all took the trouble to talk and help that s impressive I love the history of the building it has retained its wonderful Victorian heritage don t change that I loved the dragon on the 2nd floor staircase so cool The wifi in my room and all around the hotel worked well It was located very close to the tube station 
4005,The Principal London, No issues, We have stayed several times over the years live the building its location and find the staff very helpful Breakfast good range and excellent value eaten at leisure 
4006,The Principal London, The bathroom sink was very close to the toilet therefore lack of room to sit on the toilet properly would be a struggle for a larger person especially a male to sit on in comfort Also lack of mirrors light in the room a nice dressing table chair but no big mirror light to get ready in front of , Staff were all extremely friendly the location was good Hotel was clean presentable at all times the breakfast was lovely 
4007,The Principal London, Hotel is going through a major refund but is definately looking tired, Staff were very helpful and kind as it was my daughters birthday weekend so went the extra mile with rose petals on the bed and cake 
4008,The Principal London, Would have been nice to have a view of Russel Square from the room but luck of the draw I guess , The hotel is beautiful inside and out Staff were very friendly and approachable 
4009,The Principal London, Nothing not to like , We liked the friendly welcome we got when we arrived at the hotel The staff were very helpful We booked a superior double room but were told we had been upgraded to a junior suite a wonderful surprise The hotel was absolutely beautiful 
4010,The Principal London, Having no lift Found the 3rd floor very hard to climb the stairs as I m restricted because of health problem Definitely would go back to this hotel Only on a ground floor , Rooms very large clean We had lovely views overlooking the park
4011,The Principal London, The breakfast was always the same the room and bathroom VERY SMALL the fruit juices were not fresh the staff that opened the doors was always grumpy, Excellent location very clean
4012,The Principal London, The bed that was not so confortabl My room was looking in the inner part of the building and was really noisy outside , The position close to the tube and all the places I had to visit for my business trip 
4013,The Principal London, Not convinced that teaspoons were replaced each day as they had a feint residual smell No double glazing so room a bit cold and moisture inside window overnight Ridiculous price for breakfast originally 19 which I declined , Upgraded from single double room 
4014,The Principal London, Had room overlooking courtyard which had massive air conditioning units they were really noisy needed earplugs Tea and milk was not replenished, Staff friendly and helpful Location excellent Beautiful looking hotel and breakfast good
4015,The Principal London, This isn t a dislike but our bathroom was looking abit tired and needed a face lift But having so many rooms I am sure the upgrade will get there We were on tge 7th floor , The whole atmosphere of the wonderful hotel
4016,The Principal London, We had more than a little trouble with a window right next to the bed that we couldn t get closed which caused a very uncomfortable draft in my small room The concierge tried helping and we put in a request for maintenance but it was two windows causing the issue They fixed one the second night but not the other , The staff is excellent they went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and comfortable highly recommend them for that They deliver a genuine feeling of Old School London marvelous The location is perfect for bus underground and walking my externally booked Stonehenge tour also met up at this hotel making it extremely convenient 
4017,The Principal London, Had to change rooms twice once because the bath had a chip in it the mirror had a big crack across it and the alternative room given was tiny for the price paid I feel the up keep of some of the rooms is quite poor given the star rating of the hotel We also had to pay to upgrade to a better room which I don t think was fair given the rooms we were offered originally and the quality of them, The actual room we eventually got was amazing even though we had to pay an upgrade because it wasn t in the price bracket of the one we had initially booked The receptionist was very helpful but I don t know what would have happened if we had not paid the additional upgrade to get a better room 
4018,The Principal London, I have used this hotel a few times before and never been disappointed however our room this time 118 was quite shabby inside compared to previous visits There wasn t even any bottled water Also on trying to find the room at 11 30pm after a long day the signage was very misleading and led us to a door which was closed off and unavailable due to construction We then had to get a member of staff to show us the alternative route which we would never have found had we followed the brass signage , The hotel location is excellent and the building is stunning inside and out The staff were accommodating and very pleasant as always The breakfast special offer was also a good bonus plus the fact we could leave our luggage with the concierge as our room wasn t ready and we didn t return until 11 30 was a real comfort It was lovely to be able to sit in the bar with a glass of wine and unwind after a very hectic day 
4019,The Principal London, the shower in my room kept collapsing the wind howled through the window all night such that the air conditioning v noisy kept kicking in to keep the temperature up kept coming on i eventually had to turn it off We had a whisky nightcap in the bar which had bits floating in it The waitress explained it was from the ice We had specifically ordered without ice It took two of us complaining twice to get it changed V poor considering 12 50 per glass Breakfast v average more like a 3 star hotel , a very impressive hotel when first entering 
4020,The Principal London, Cold room no fridge or mini bar TV was useless and would barely work room was a bit tired , Staff extremely friendly fab location Very convenient location to shops bars and restaurants Extremely comfy bed in junior suite and spacious room
4021,The Principal London, sound insulation our room gave on the street and it was really noisy small bed a bit expensive, Staff s kindness and efficiency The cake for my girlfriend s birthday really nice attention cleanliness location
4022,The Principal London, I wanted to do a checkout the night before I left due to an early train and I was surprised it wasn t possible The next morning checkout took a little longer than planned and we missed a train to the airport getting us there later than planned But the great thing was Reception had kindly printed our boarding cards for us which made up the time , The beds were great the concierge was perfect the breakfast copious our stay was worth every pound Nicely located quiet inside our room and wonderful in every way 
4023,The Principal London, I have been staying at the Russell several times a year for twenty years though less frequently now I feel that breakfast arrangements are less customer friendly than they used to be paper napkins have replaced fabric there are no saucers for the coffee cups and I had to go hunting for a desert spoon and a teaspoon , Overall very pleasant 
4024,The Principal London, My room on the 7th floor had been refurbished but some of the fittings were of poor quality and should have been rejected , I have stayed at the Russell before and am pleased to see the refurbishment work continues The staff were all attentive and sought to ensure I was having a pleasant stay 
4025,The Principal London, Room small overlooking air con units and the windows were screwed shut Had to rely on air con not a comfortable night , Nice location and really nice building
4026,The Principal London, Breakfast was tasty and good value at 12 but not if we had had to pay full price of 19 , Bed and room were comfortable if a little cramped Getting to the wardrobe was difficult with the table and chair in the way Linen good quality but again the bathroom was neat Beds although twins had to be touching to leave room at either side Glad windows opened but they could have done with cleaning or repainting Thermos flasks of tea at B F was brilliant idea Location of hotel made up for any negatives 
4027,The Principal London,No Negative, This is a grand old hotel currently being refurbished but still very comfortable It is a great location especially if you are catching early morning trains or coming into London late in the day Very close to the British Museum 
4028,The Principal London, its a very old hotel undergoing rehab which made for some noise and dust However the worse part of the hotel was the internet We needed to work and were unable to connect to anything workable Its a cool old hotel but if you re going on business and need internet bring your own , The location is excellent The exterior of the hotel has beautiful architecture 
4029,The Principal London, Reception were exceptionally slow at booking in checking out The rooms were very tatty paint flaikinh off the wall the sink was cracked etc Lack of vegetarian food available , Location very good Very grand building from the outside which is let down internally 
4030,The Principal London, Opaque window so had no view, Well positioned Clean comfortable and well appointed room Staff friendly and very helpful We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again 
4031,The Principal London, Long waiting time at check in which was not yet peak time Noisy difficult getting to sleep and woken up early for the same reason, Location and general quality
4032,The Principal London, we had no cold running water with 2 days to go we were offered another room which was a bit of an inconvenience to move our things and room was much smaller we were offered breakfast on next 2 mornings as compensation as it wasn t included in our price so that did make things a lot more acceptable , location of the hotel was very central for all the things we wanted to see central for tube 
4033,The Principal London, The Windows in the bedroom had broken sashes and paint flacking off and odd bodged tiles around the toilet, Excellent location with friendly and helpful staff the consierge was very helpful when I asked for a route on the tube 
4034,The Principal London, Windows are made with frosted glass so there is no way to see the view or even to open them No mini fridge in the room There is no information on how to call the reception from the room The sink in the bathroom was blocked and hook for the towels was just laying in the hole detached from the wall photos attached Moreover there was very strange sound coming from the street which was annoying and disturbed our sleep Water costs 5 ponds per bottle Do not feel like 4 stars at all , Location
4035,The Principal London, The confusion at check in as I d altered the booking from double and a single room refunderble to a twin and single none refunderble they said that I still had the refunderble booked and needed to pay as to late to cancel luckerly I had proof on my phone but they still insisted I contact booking com to check, The door staff where very friendly and helpfull
4036,The Principal London, We had a broken cold tap in the bathroom which couldn t be repaired that day We booked an alarm call for 6 30am which came late There was no trouser press in the room We had paid extra for an upgrade WE, The room was large the beds were very comfortable The lifts appeared quickly when summoned We liked the ambience and the beautiful staircase 
4037,The Principal London, Pillows were lumpy shower drained very slowly so you have to keep stopping it for it to drain breakfast way overpriced at 19 80 asked for a nice view but had a horrid one so kept curtains closed , Comfy beds beautiful Victorian building good location next to a tube station half way between Madame Tussaud s and the West end theatres Well placed for Covent Garden Leicester Square Piccadilly Circus Good local coffee sandwich shops incl pret a manger cafe Nero 
4038,The Principal London, WOULD APPRECIATE A 2 LEVEL CHARGE FOR BREAKFAST I ONLY EAT A BOWL A CEREAL MATRESS TOO SOFT , BEDROOM COMFORTABLY WARM BUT DINING ROOM IS VERY COLD 
4039,The Principal London, Small beds Premier Inn is ahead of most hotel chains on this front Also cost of a glass of wine at 10 for a relatively basic Malbec was a bit steep but they have to make their money back somewhere , We got a great deal through booking com called the shopping package Fabulous value for two nights a good breakfast friendly staff and beautiful building 
4040,The Principal London, The breakfast could have been cheaper ie included in the price We were with a party of 17 there wasn t any negotiation on the price , Nice warm clean room very friendly kind helpful staff 
4041,The Principal London, It was a bit noisy with busy road just outside, Nice room Well maintained yet still with character Eco friendly products in the bathroom Friendly staff 
4042,The Principal London, The room was much smaller than the one we had last time , Excellent location superb historic building very nice and helpful staff One of my favourite hotels in London 
4043,The Principal London, Despite it being Midwinter the temperature of the rooms was very high and the air conditioning made no difference Even the alternative room we were offered was just as hot , Neat rooms
4044,The Principal London, During my last 2 days the WiFi connection became very weak and spotty Staff said it was being worked on but I sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority , Despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history Hotel Russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should The staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable I also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room I look forward to coming back throughout the years to come 
4045,The Principal London, The windows in our room were unfortunately in need of repair with one rather loose glass pane rattling every so often from the traffic on the streets below Traffic is heavy from 6am so this meant no lie in for me Double glazing may help , Excellent reception by the manager upon our arrival Upgraded our room following a room mix up and offered complimentary dinner by means of apology The concierge was also very helpful and the location of the hotel was fantastic for access to public transport On our last day the hotel kept our bags secure while we enjoyed the remainder of our time in London Will most certainly be staying again 
4046,The Principal London, the bathroom is very small so there wasnt enough room to put my toiletries , location excellent and the opulent decor really stands out staff were all very friendly and responded very quickly to any requests we made 
4047,The Principal London, Light fittings and bathroom door were dirty cooked breakfast was very greasy and not enough electric sockets available , Excellent customer service staff fantastic location good coffee 
4048,The Principal London, bathroom a bit old and it wasn t cleaned properly Room itself was excellent , Location near the underground station is super convenient Had a quick meal at the bar and really liked the food Beds were good too twin superior room 
4049,The Principal London, Room was clean but in need of some repairs eg broken tiles on bathroom floor and bottom drawers badly worn , Room was ready early staff friendly and helpful Lovely breakfast
4050,The Principal London, Despite being in the heart of London but the location is very noisy and inconvenient A lot of people move around super noisy and you would never feel piece of mind on top of that single rooms are very small like a grave I would never stay there again , Next to the underground station good wifi friendly receptionists
4051,The Principal London, Location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view I had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated , Classic architecture preserved nicely 
4052,The Principal London, TV is at a height and an angle where you cant watch it when sitting in a chair You either have to sit far away or stand up not to get a distorted view Breakfast not being included in the room rate is a big minus for me , The quality of the breakfast was excellent 
4053,The Principal London, The mattress bed sheets comforter and pillow not comfy enough Aicon a bit noisy , Overall staff are commendable helpful and attentive Location is good and very convenient Facade of hotel looks impressive 
4054,The Principal London, the noise level in my room from the ventilation put it this way I woke up 3 times, Bed was comfy the breakfast was really nice and the bathroom was good
4055,The Principal London, Not a dislike but some areas could do with a spring clean Its a busy hotel so difficult to close areas off to follow this through However this would not stop me from staying here again, I have stayed at this hotel a few times now and can never find any major faults with it It has great connections on the tube however is in walking distance to your main shopping areas and sight seeing Staff are very friendly and go out of their way to ensure your stay is as you expect it to be The room was spacious and very comfy bed I will stay here again 
4056,The Principal London, The noise It was extremely noisy in the morning from 5am with the sound of sirens going to the nearby hospitals Every 3 minutes in fact The standard twin was small and bathroom tiny , The location was good in that we could walk to a number of places
4057,The Principal London, Ran out of hot food items eg bacon sausages left waiting for breakfast on both days windows don t open in the rooms for security reasons so no fresh air in the room Hotel bar prices are quite expensive , Great location handy for tube we felt safe Good breakfast nice room comfortable bed 
4058,The Principal London, Air conditioning horrendously noisy cutting in with a loud bang every 20 mins throughout the night Very poor sleep as a result , Really central location
4059,The Principal London, The public areas were very grand but our room was a little worn the windows were filthy there were lights missing and the bathroom floor was not entirely clean , Scrambled egg was brilliant the highlight of a very well supplied breakfast buffet Fantastic location very helpful and friendly staff Good value for money for the location 
4060,The Principal London, The window in room 524 was very old and was a draft coming in from the gaps , Bed was comfy had a nice view in the room and bathroom was nicely Set out 
4061,The Principal London, We were in a family room Frosted Windows looking at brick wall No natural light and room was very old and cold Not enough towels or toiletries for us all, Staff and location were excellent Breakfast was great also 
4062,The Principal London, No bath in the room inside courtyard facing window horrible view Windows wouldn t stay open shower door wouldn t close Very small television and phone located in bathroom , The style of hotel excellent staff and great location
4063,The Principal London, Price ok for a business trip though slightly high considering breakfast wasn t included in room price Upgraded room could have been nicer , Great location in front of Russel Square park Beautiful old building and great service from staff 
4064,The Principal London,No Negative, The bed was comfortable there was enough light in the room to work often hotel lighting is not suitable The room was well equipped and a good size for London
4065,The Principal London, Some of the staff are not very helpful not professional The facilities are bad e g small left not suitable for people with wheelchair or having many large luggage My room was very small with tiny sink in which the water not moving easily rapidly get full The do not disturb sign was missing , Location price
4066,The Principal London, Nothing not to like at a 120pn price point, Well maintained Victorian splendour Great bar and breakfast room Wide carpeted corridors Large room with requested walk in shower
4067,The Principal London, The only reason i booked with hotel Russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up , I like the decor
4068,The Principal London, the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby , we got upgraded to the junior suite heating had broken in there however they had already put two heaters in so we didn t need to ask the reception bar staff and porter were very friendly and accommodating 
4069,The Principal London,No Negative, The location is great A lot of nice restaurants and caf s around the corner The subway Underground is less than a minute away and that takes you directly to Heathrow airport covent garden picadilly circus and Knightsbridge British museum is just 5 minutes away on foot 
4070,The Principal London,No Negative, This is a wonderful old hotel in a great location Easy access to underground but also with walking distant to most attractions Serge and Bernard made our stay at the Russell very special From the moment we arrived to our departure 3 days later they went out of their way to make our stay at the Russell memorable 
4071,The Principal London, we had 2 rooms booked and one wasnt ready at check in time we had to wait an hour for it the bathrrom in one of the rooms was tiny, location was excellent rooms were nice and the bed was lovely staff were all friendly and helpful
4072,The Principal London, Absolutely nothing, The hotel is just amazing and such a pleasure to stay there in central London From when you walk through the doors you feel special and the reception staff are fantastic Loved my stay here and will be bringing my family back for a special visit
4073,The Principal London, Lifts are little small so at busy times and with suitcases became a challenge More drawer space would ve been helpful and compliment refreshments tray would ve benefitted from bottled water Room overlooked all the boiler pipes etc which at times was very loud Nice breakfast but over priced for what it was, Very convenient location Friendly staff always happy and eager to assist Beautifull hotel sumptuously decorated I had a junior double room which had a large bathroom with bath and shower Great for relaxing at the end of a busy day 
4074,The Principal London, We stayed last year and our room was nicer didn t like the view from 246 the machines heaters or what ever they were noisy However would still stay again , The location is good hotel is very nice Staff lovely and friendly Breakfast good Spacious room
4075,The Principal London, The room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner I expected it and it wasn t much of an issue , The staff member who checked us in was fantastic his name was Miles and he was so lovely helped us enormously and scored us some cake for the room A winner in my book Even free glasses of wine as our room was not ready at the stated time 
4076,The Principal London, Rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms Small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including 3 stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room , Location of the Hotel is very good very close to public transportation
4077,The Principal London, No notice given fire alarm tested no staff on floors to say there was not a fire Rooms not cleaned until very late in the day, Breakfast good staff in dining room good
4078,The Principal London, The bathroom is very small, I had a very comfortable small room overlooking the square The bar has a good atmosphere to relax in after an exhausting day and to enjoy a light meal The underground is nearby which makes it easy to get around in London
4079,The Principal London, The frosted windows limited light to some extent but then again views in London can be rather poor , This is a very high grade hotel with splendid rooms friendly staff and a good splash of luxury 
4080,The Principal London, I was initially given a room which had no WiFi and without heating Room was freezing cold I was offered to t have a electric heater to warm up the room The room was changed but the one which was changed was much smaller and was noisy The wash basin had non functional tap Luckily I had one night stay booked only Won t like to stay in this hotel ever again Not recommended , close location to tube station 
4081,The Principal London, Maid didn t make the room two days, It is a begging xx century building with very comfortable and warm rooms The building was conceived by the same architect of the Titanic elegant restaurant 
4082,The Principal London, Very very poor sleep during stay , Not much A very very loud heating system which banged as though some one was hitting the door every 15 minutes throughout the night Requested a room change for the next one to be even lower like a turbo engine starting directly over the top of the bed Also given the wrong room number on arrival 
4083,The Principal London, Odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms Don t people have the internet The dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down Staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being 3 people behind the bar chatting to each other All in all a great hotel but not well run , Amazing exterior
4084,The Principal London, We felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel I e Toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths The room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar This was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe , Staff were very helpful and nice to deal with 
4085,The Principal London, Windows need cleaning Shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing The only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up , Overall great price for central London Some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really Not impeccably clean but not what I d call dirty either Windows could use a cleaning Room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central London Staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until 1a is great considering every other pub closes at 11p or midnight Plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the Picadilly line is one block away I stayed here 12 nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price I paid 
4086,The Principal London,No Negative, Beautiful building external and internal which makes you feel like you are staying somewhere special Very handy for the theatre which was the reason for our trip 
4087,The Principal London, The air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also, The hotel was beautiful in setting just what we were looking for
4088,The Principal London, The hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working 24 7 you can not imagine the noise check the photos No refrigerator Room was rather small, Close to the center Living in a hotel of your dreams like a fairy tail the personnel was extremely polite and helpful
4089,The Principal London, This property is listed as accessible My daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods THIS FACILITY IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THEY SET UP A MOTORIZED DEVICE much like a stairway system installed in one s home Can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went The embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated I ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the 5 6 steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing This facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times In fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair The staff requires education Later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system Please change your listing to not accessible The table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over The bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed , The concierge Max and doorman Serge were extremely helpful in our navigating the city The location is very central facing Russell Square very close to the British Museum and 15 20 walk to Piccadilly Circus Russell Square is very nicely landscaped 
4090,The Principal London, Tiny room for 200 while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door Had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space Ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking Beware , Good location in central London close to several tube stops 
4091,The Principal London, Lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor Opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek , Atmosphere staff overall facilities location 
4092,The Principal London, The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas We were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room This turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows Noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small Was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room , The location was great and the sense of place and old world was good however 
4093,The Principal London, I generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because Carluccio s is close at hand and I am more interested in Italian cuisine than a more conservative English hotel cuisine I hesitate to say that I am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects Nevertheless these might be the only parts of the Russell that would benefit from change That being said however few hotels manage change successfully and I would hate to see the Russell lose its undoubted charm , The Russell is one of my favourite hotels in London perhaps my favourite The architecture and the decoration of the ground floor in particular is interesting as well as charming the view over Russell Square is lovely the staff especially the concierges are very helpful and the proximity of the hotel to the British Library extremely convenient 
4094,The Principal London, The bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip The pillows were well used and lumpy The breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were Luke warm and queuing up to make toast , The offer I booked was good value the wine and chocolates were a nice element the hotel was in a good position and the hotel was clean and well laid out The staff were all friendly and helpful A good selection at breakfast but some elements were poor quality
4095,The Principal London, Found the room far to hot comparable to when I slept in Egypt but that s probably personal to me Would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping , Location was great for tube and walking into the heart of action
4096,The Principal London, Bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in London if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it But overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return,No Positive
4097,The Principal London, The room we had was v small for the amount we paid 135 for one night You could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes, Good location and beautiful building and the bed was comfy Easy walk to theatres shops and sites
4098,The Principal London, no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly Small tv screen , the atmosphere and the architecture of the building Comfortable room Nice bathroom with a great shower 
4099,The Principal London,No Negative, The staff particularly the porters were very friendly and more than happy to talk to you and make you feel welcome Serge provided us with a detailed history of the building and local area 
4100,The Principal London, Our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful ,No Positive
4101,The Principal London, Staff not as professional as I remember Layout of the reception Entrance Hall does not reflect the grandeur of the hotel , Proximity to St Pancras Kings Cross Tube stations Comfortable rooms and good hotel
4102,The Principal London, I had to wait over 45 minutes for a bar meal , The bed was extremely comfortable and my single room was spacious in comparison to some of the single rooms I ve had in other hotels Handy for Euston and St Pancreas Stations
4103,The Principal London,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and attentive The interior it historic and stunning The bar is cosy and yet sophisticated a good place to drink and relax in even if traveling on your own 
4104,The Principal London, No double glazing on our windows so traffic noise awful from 5am No conditioner in the bathroom no shower caps breakfast food was pretty ordinary Seems like it s now aiming at the Imperial hotels market which is frankly down market Used to do better , I love this building and many of the bedrooms have plenty of space and character 
4105,The Principal London, Room was tired looking very small and Windows had so much condensation damp I had to use a towel to dry it off Not good for my asthma, the staff were really all very helpful professional and lovely Location was superb for us
4106,The Principal London, I didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost I ve stayed at other 4 Star hotels with much more variety The bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card I had to make several attempts , I liked the fact that the hotel was a lovely old building with a grand reception area and decor The staff were friendly and the rooms spacious and clean The hotel was within walking distance from the British Museum Covent Garden Soho I also liked the fact that it is practically next to Russell Square underground station and Holborn statio is very close 
4107,The Principal London, We have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room 625 so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before Will maybe avoid this room next time ,No Positive
4108,The Principal London, The lifts are very small Breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers I would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages, The location is excellent the stuff is friendly and overall the service was very good The room is clean and comfortable
4109,The Principal London, The first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes Then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well , Good location Staff were friendly
4110,The Principal London, Would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price Shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles Not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future , Beautiful hotel fantastic staff kind helpful friendly knowledgable Great breakfast selection Beautiful common areas Perfect location for our needs 
4111,The Principal London, The room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double No bath no view in fact no window I can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard I am very dissapoibted with both the hotel AND your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel , Not a lot
4112,The Principal London, Breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night, Loved the location very grand old style hotel everything was perfect lovely room and bathroom Staff very friendly 
4113,The Principal London, Bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable Room a little dated and check in was slow Due to roads being closed around Bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to 45 mins later we found it Was only a short walk so could be better on other days , Great location friendly Tempus bar beautiful building and opposite park and the history such as George the Dragon Good quality breakfast as always with PH just missing touches such as tea pots tea cups and fruit coulis etc
4114,The Principal London, The bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways If the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable, Good location 
4115,The Principal London,No Negative, Quiet room although so central Possibility of a single room Water hot and plentiful Bed comfortable Hotel clean Breakfast lovely Newspapers provided 
4116,The Principal London,No Negative, Opulent surroundings and friendly helpful staff The Tempus Bar brings added luxury with its leather wood paneling and wide selection of drinks Great location for Soho and Covent Garden We loved every minute of our stay We will definitely return 
4117,The Principal London, I have never seen a worse bed in any hotel I ve stayed in anywhere in the world Was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment , Staff dealt with my complaint very well
4118,The Principal London, tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room Still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night Not warm enough , handy location nice hotel 
4119,The Principal London, however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel TV handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work Concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment , the architecture the lobby breakfast room and bar Very class and Brittish old style 
4120,The Principal London, The buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet I ve ever had Plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology Sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease Such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel , Room was small but comfortable clean and good value for money Reception staff were good other staff seemed fairly disengaged Hotel is historic and architecturally interesting 
4121,The Principal London, Decor is extremely tired and dated Wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom Dust around edges of carpet I m not sure how this is acceptable in a central London hotel which costs upwards of 110 per night Definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although I can t praise the staff enough , Concierge and reception staff were outstanding Friendly helpful the best customer service I have come across Truly the saving grace of this hotel Called reception from our room and one of the staff arrived at our door within 3 minutes and was very polite and cheerful Particular thanks to Carey on concierge who was exceptionally helpful 
4122,The Principal London, There was nothing that we didn t like , The hotel was beautiful It was very clean It was ideal in location The staff very friendly very helpful 
4123,The Principal London, Had a bad experience with room service 45 minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another 15 minutes Clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call We also paid for late check out until 2pm but were disturbed 3 times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication , Great location spacious room Room was ready early so we could check in at 12 30 
4124,The Principal London, Bathroom could be more taken care of windows were old and a little worn off There could be possibility to go to the balcony, The Hotel has very beautiful interiors Nice helpful and talkative staff Extremely comfortable beds
4125,The Principal London, Personal not amiable The room did not match the pictures on the website The AC in my room was really noisy and it took me 4 visits to the reception for them to change my room , Great location for shopping and close to St Pancras Station
4126,The Principal London, Bring earplugs Lots of traffic noise but no problem with earplugs in , Very nice hotel with excellent friendly staff Comfortable rooms and beds Very nice breakfast and good food in general I will certainly use it again when in London despite the traffic noise Excellent value when booked through this website 
4127,The Principal London, Bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures, Friendly staff great location good sized room with a comfortable bed
4128,The Principal London, The breakfast experience is like something out of BHS They need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience Also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service I won t go in again , Location and price
4129,The Principal London, Nothing , Outstanding customer service comfort in the rooms and the public areas of the Hotel and just that feeling of being made to feel welcome every day 
4130,The Principal London, My room wasn t very clean Dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk When I mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me White spots on extra blanket So I didn t want to use it Although I love the location and this is my 2nd stay it will probably be my last , Love location Hysterical value of building Breakfast was good but I don t understand why a 5 charge for a tray when your already being charged room service fees 
4131,The Principal London,No Negative, We stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered Awesome location We liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible I think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before It sure wasn t The room stunk had a bank of about 20 aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool The bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky Would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good They also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu 
4132,The Principal London,No Negative, The hotel was beautiful Very elegant All the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Bernard the Concierge The location was great with much to see and do within walking distance We would definitely stay there again 
4133,The Principal London, There was a large cobweb in the corner above the TV room 225 The bar area was difficult to find a seat so I had to resort to staying in my room when I just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer , The staff really looked after the customers in a very polite and professional manner 
4134,The Principal London, Had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested Freezing room until radiators kicked in Tired carpet Poor insulated windows, Central location Beautiful Victorian features Very comfortable bed Very serene view
4135,The Principal London, Auto service charge Paying extra for breakfast Good food but no better than other UK 3 4 star I ve stayed in No soundproofing , Comfy room with reasonable extras Needed a shower cap tho as shower didn t lower control was on bath tap 
4136,The Principal London, The bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere , Very reasonable rate spotlessly clean standard room Very good breakfast with smiling helpful and polite staff Nice bar area 
4137,The Principal London, We booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly They moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together They gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there They then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine For the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again , The location 
4138,The Principal London, My room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience , Really really friendly efficient staff I went for the single room option and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was was clean and with a spacious bathroom Very comfortable stay a I m glad I booked it Convent Garden is only a 15 min walk away and Russell Square Tube station is just outside the hotel so very convenient 
4139,The Principal London, Not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room , Location and style and history of the building 
4140,The Principal London, Breakfast pricing of 19 for 2 ppl was not included in our stay deal Seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps London thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at Giraffe Cafe 2 minutes away very nice , The bed was amazingly comfy and huge The hotel was clean and a work of art Amazing and beautiful building Staff extremely friendly and courteous Very well informed and helpful Loved all the retro art deco features rooms tastefully done Would definitely stay again great location 
4141,The Principal London, We got a room that was very small and not very fresh The pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got We could change room though , Very helpful and nice staff Tube directley from Heathrow to the hotel 
4142,The Principal London, We had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast Our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight I was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users I also found I kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests The shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height I required and needed constant raising We went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two So why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier , Location of hotel for our trip was good the hotel is impressive and the staff were friendly The beds were comfortable and clean 
4143,The Principal London, Staff at the reception didn t give us 2 sets of cards The lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room , Location was great and the room was very spacious 
4144,The Principal London, No leisure gym facilities , Easy access to the West end on foot Friendly professional staff The building is beautiful with art deco features rooms of a good size 
4145,The Principal London, The decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped This was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel , The style of the hotel was quite grand and the Christmas decorations were lovely and festive The location was perfect for my needs and there are lots of shops and cafes very nearby for e g breakfast or lunch with pubs and restaurants close too or very short walk away for even more choice I was in a single room that was well suited size wise The layout of the room is well considered and the most is made of the space 
4146,The Principal London, Some noise at times if staying on the front of the Hotel from road noise But the windows and curtains muffle that overnight , Superb looking place extremely comfortable and welcoming 
4147,The Principal London, Only a few things the blind in the bathroom covered with dirty fingerprints and the one in the bedroom coming away from windowframe Also couldn t get the shower to work but that may just have been me , Staff very friendly helpful and welcoming from the moment you enter Upgraded free to a double room instead of a single Fantastic central location moments away from tube station and an easy walk to Central London locations Lovely clean spacious comfortable room and fantastic room service 
4148,The Principal London, Our bedroom was very small that together with our very small bathroom and the continual annoyance that the water in the bath was very very very slow exit added to our chagrin I did mention to Reception staff the problem we encountered with our bath however nothing transpired to resolve this matter , The monies offer for our stay was tempting enough to get us there
4149,The Principal London,No Negative, I was booked in the wrong twin room at first I was moved to a lovely comfort room but the telephone did not work and had to go to reception to request engineer to fix phone Had to be moved again as phone could not be fixed 
4150,The Principal London, Bar staff did not know that a egg benedict had bacon in it No wake up alarm despite the fact that they asked if i wanted it , price was good egg florentine was nice 
4151,The Principal London, Breakfast seemed chaotic the first morning we went to the buffet to get our cooked breakfast when we returned to the table it had been completely cleared the very disinterested supervisor apologised but did nothing in the end we had to go to another table to get cutlery and cups breakfast was now cold coffee did eventually arrive I like hot milk with my coffee which wasn t a problem but in the second morning the hot milk arrived but was quite clearly off it took some minutes for anyone to come close to the table and even longer to get a replacement cup and milk the cup had a huge chip in the rim so yet again we had to wait, On the whole all the staff were very helpful and professional and friendly especially Max on the concierge desk making sure we had a car booked to take us to the Ritz for dinner and the very polite helpful doorman
4152,The Principal London, Nothing, Beautiful hotel staff were very friendly and helpful Brilliant Location 2minties walk to a tube station and right opposite Russell Square gardens Would definitely stay again
4153,The Principal London, Unwanted alarm call at 7 am rather spoiled my day But got our breakfasts free to compensate so pleased with that Breakfast room needs refurbishment to make more of the Titanic connection , Superb location Great ambience Loved the Tempus Bar Sensitive restoration of historic features and information about them was much appreciated 
4154,The Principal London,No Negative, Staff were extremely polite and happy to help in any capacity Although it was a single room it did not feel cramped or as though I was less important than anyone else Lovely bathroom 
4155,The Principal London, Pillows hard Shower tray didnt drain had to time shower Outside patio door didnt fit draughts to room, Location across the road for bristish museum 10 15 mins walk leicester square
4156,The Principal London,No Negative, It was my daughters birthday there was cake gifts a card awaiting us in our room situated opposite a lovely park staff very nice smiley well worth a visit Christmas tree was lovely 
4157,The Principal London,No Negative, Me and my girlfriend booked this hotel in the treat your partner package We stayed one night but enjoyed ourselves The facilities were lovely Unfortunately we missed the free breakfast as we sampled the night life in London The late check out was a lovely touch Will definitely come back next year
4158,The Principal London,No Negative, The rooms were booked for my 50 birthday so I could celebrate with friends It was perfect and please pass on a thank you to the staff on duty The whole atmosphere friendliness of the staff Fantastic 
4159,The Principal London, The room which we were in was a standard one needs a revamp There was black mild on bathroom tiles if any older persons were stopping in that room it s very difficult to get into the bath , The entrance 
4160,The Principal London, the food choice in the restaurant is not very pronounced and exciting more fresh fruit at breakfast, room excellent staff friendly and efficient breakfast very good
4161,The Principal London,No Negative, Could not fault the staff or the hotel from start to finish Staff couldn t have been more helpful or friendly The room was amazing very spacious spotless and so comfortable The hotel is in a great location literally round the corner from Russell Square station I would definitely stay here again and have been recommending it to everyone 
4162,The Principal London, During our stay there was a problem with the toilet not clearing however this was fixed fairly quickly and another room given to use that toilet whilst we were inconvenienced So a minus and a plus here We had a meal arranged for Christmas lunch and my wife who is partially disabled had to flag down a taxi for herself directly outside the hotel even though there was concierge staff on duty nearby I was angry at the lack of helpfulness , The location is unbeatable The staff are friendly and very helpful Max of the concierge staff was very helpful friendly and enthusiastic 
4163,The Principal London, Room was small and very basic for price but bed very comfortable View was onto a wall Would be nice to have a mini bar fridge and water plus additional wall sockets We had to unplug TV to charge phone I pad, Location was perfect for our theatre visit and sightseeing Very close to bus and underground Staff were very helpful especially at breakfast in the bar when restaurant was crowded 
4164,The Principal London, The beds vere hard and unplesant The rooms old and need a renovation The staff in the bar did not know what a frozen cosmopolitan was And they did not give u time to look at the bar meny They wanted to take ur order the minutt you sat foot in the bar Not good at all The hotel was to expensive all in all ,No Positive
4165,The Principal London, That s the beds were not secured and if you sat up in bed to watch TV or read the bed moved forward away from wall The bathroom was a bit cramped around the toilet due to the large sink There was a smell coming from the sink when you used it I think its needs some bleach We did not eat breakfast at the hotel due to the price of 19 50 each for 2 nights would be nearly 80 00 We ate out instead , The staff were excellent all round and very happy to help you with anything always said hello The doormen were particularly good and the overall level of service and friendliness was the best I have had Loved to be able to open the windows fully as it was very warm and opening the windows enabled a pleasant comfortable sleep Excellent position from tube station I deal 24 hours shop across the road Lots of places to eat breakfast around the hotel 
4166,The Principal London, Nothing staff were not helpful and infact rude it was not what we were expecting it looked dated and nothing like the pictures we then decides to stay at the May fair hotel instead and got a refund won t be going there again that s for sure, Nothing
4167,The Principal London, expensive breakfast went to pret some fittings not right bathroom door did not shut plug in sink didn t Forgivable because its such an iconic building but certainly not competition to the best in the west end , great building marble staircase comfy bar
4168,The Principal London, The bar was closed when we returned at 1 o clock on new years eve They wouldnt even bring us a drink to the room , Entrance to the hotel is very nice wish we arrived earlier so we vould have eaten
4169,The Principal London, Old hotel with small rooms for 4 stars Construction work right outside my window Could not sleep Did not effect price Rather stay in a modern hotel with upgraded facilities , Great location
4170,The Principal London, Room was smaller than cheaper hotel next door Less facilities I e tea coffee selection Music from wedding booming until 12 30 pm Though they did pay for two breakfasts to compensate , Nice reception area
4171,The Principal London, The TV didn t work in the standard rooms it s very dated very basic and not what I d expect from a 4star hotel premier inn would have been better shower had mould sort of inside the sealant really noisey this place needs the double glazing looking at, The junior suite was really nice little things like the windows not shutting properly let it down the location was great
4172,The Principal London, The quality of the mattress of the bed was really bad For the money I paid I expected at least a decent mattress , Good location Conveniently located next to the tube Nice looking building 
4173,The Principal London, Far from the attractions and Russell Square tube is pointless, Everything was perfect Room fizz chocolates and petals plus birthday cake upon arrival Kept our luggage for many hours safe 
4174,The Principal London, The hair dryer was attached to a unit that was positioned approximately 8 feet away from the dressing table This is too far away when trying to style your hair Fortunately I had taken my own hair dryer The lighting in the room was too low It would have been helpful to have had a bright light positioned by the dressing table to make drying of hair and putting on of make up that much easier , It was close to the office where I work
4175,The Principal London, missed breakfast one day as insufficient capacity in the restaurant and the wait would have been too long as I had to go to a meeting, Location and price
4176,The Principal London,No Negative, Location of hotel is excellent Big spacious room Great value for money Lovely Christmas feeling decorations Only tiny negative I booked a room for 3 people and the room only had toiletries tea coffee cups for 2 people 
4177,The Principal London, Wifi didnt work in the room Staff weren t as polite as you would expect for the price Despite changing the key numerous times none of them worked well for the door Cant control water temperature No free water daily Restaurant food disappointing All in all we cant recommend this hotel , Just only location is 15mins walk to big shopping steeet and easy access to tube 
4178,The Principal London, Trainee receptionist at front desk was rude and abrupt Very poor and mean selection of tea coffee etc in hotel room and the same for shampoo moisturising etc samples in bathroom , An extremely beautiful hotel in a brilliant location Comfortable beds
4179,The Principal London, I ordered a sandwich from the limited room service available after 10pm but was very disappointed that the beef slices had an inch of thick fat on each This was extremely poor quality , The location was great for catching the tube and only one stop from King s Cross The staff were extremely friendly and helpful Plus there was an excellent breakfast 
4180,The Principal London, The dining room was too full and very noisy We did not like having to queue for a table The tap in the bathroom leaked , The staff were friendly and efficient 
4181,The Principal London, I feel that the bathroom showers baths could be improved and made more user friendly Having to clamber into the bath to have your shower should be a thing of the past, The helpful staff nothing was too much trouble 
4182,The Principal London, The staff could have been a little more helpful with our luggage They didn t seem to realise that helping us from the door to the lifts would have been a huge help However the staff were very friendly which made up for that , The staff were extremely helpful and engaging The bedroom was extremely well equipped iron hair drier kettle which made it extremely easy for us to prepare for our evenings out on the town and well as enjoy tea coffee and cakes during our stay Oh and the view was amazing We had a corner view looking over the park 
4183,The Principal London,No Negative, The hotel was esquisite and staff was extremely pleasant and helpful We very much enjoyed the substantial buffet breakfast It is less than a block from the Russell Square tube station 
4184,The Principal London, Although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice Our room was really nice the first night large room with a window We decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room Very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool There was a bank of about 50 air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy The bathroom stunk of mold and Lynx deodorant The drains were blocked and the bed was terrible It was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night Between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all I think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing An upgrade was offered to us the second night for 20 pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night But we definitely didnt On a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible Super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex Not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place , The building is beautiful and well maintained great location easy to get around and great value compared to other hotels in the area Very grand and gothic love the links with the titanic too 
4185,The Principal London, The main light in the bedroom didn t work and although maintenance came quickly it was never replaced meaning the room was quite dark We also thought we would have a safety deposit box in our room which turned out not to be there , Welcomed by very friendly staff comfortable bed and clean room The bar was especially good and the bar staff were very nice A convenient location 
4186,The Principal London, The exterior of the building is magnificent but the interior has seen better days and in need of a refurb At the end of the day the rooms are compact clean and comfortable just don t plan on spending too much time in them which you shouldn t be get outside and see some stuff or go hang in a pub , Location was convenient for us about half way between the Eurostar station and Covent Garden so an easy walk or tube ride to everything Couple of decent pubs within a stones throw as well 
4187,The Principal London, Shower , Only problem was the small bath and the shower head was far to low my husband is 6 foot plus as are many men he has back problems and found ot extremely difficult bending down yo take a shower 
4188,The Principal London, Breakfast on Sunday morning was a disaster Arriving half an hour before service was due to close we found a queue to get a table with many many tables waiting to be cleared there was no hot food left and a real shortage of staff Hot food did not finally all come through until an hour after we arrived at the restaurant Staff were great throughout , Great location and close to tube station Lovely building 
4189,The Principal London, Some staff not helpful few problems with the room Leaky shower door bed on castors with brakes that didn t work a rattling window and a loose connection on tv, We loved the architecture and look of the hotel Some staff were wonderful Location was amazing 
4190,The Principal London, The positives seem to end with the building The staff were pretty rude and dismissive particularly in the bar where it seemed like it was all too much effort to bring the food or take a drinks order The room was freezing and the hot water broke for a period of time The breakfast was in a nice room but again it was freezing and most people seemed to have their coats on , The hotel is beautiful The exterior and the interior are stunning The location is also very convenient to the Piccadilly line tube station and short walk to Euston Kings Cross and Tottenham Court Road The breakfast buffet had a lot of options 
4191,The Principal London, disappointed that our upgrade did not live up to expectations of pictures on the invitation email which I suspect were from a different hotel altogether This was misleading The suite was very noisy with traffic on the road outside and noise from the stair well just outside the door I felt this was poor value for the additional money spent , very convenient location
4192,The Principal London, room key was older strip type which failed to work even the replacement was temperamental which was a bit of an inconvenience with me being located on the 8th floor , staff size of room and cleanliness of it grand old hotel

4222,The Principal London,No Negative, We had just one night in London and the hotel s location let us make the most of it Took the tube directly from Heathrow no transfers and found the hotel right around the corner from the Russell Square tube station The next day it was an easy walk to St Pancras Station to catch the train to Gatwick We spent our day in London eating shopping and visiting the British Museum everything within extremely easy walking distance Grand old hotel with updated comfortable rooms and magnificent public spaces It occupies nearly a block and the hallways are quite long and could probably be updated but the rooms are very pleasant indeed Stayed on a Sunday night when the room rates were exceptionally low they re much higher the rest of the week Charming doorman too 
4223,The Principal London,No Negative, The staff and atmosphere at this hotel is the best I have experienced for a 4 Hotel This is my second visit and I would most definitely stay there again

4228,The Principal London, The windows of the room we stayed in were badly insulated there was a draft but as we didn t stay in the room much during daytime it was ok , Everything it s just great to stay at such a place and let yourself being pampered 
4229,The Principal London, Unacceptable level of customer service Once we arrived we paid for an upgrade for a more spacious room with a view The room was indeed lovely yet the temperature in the room was extremely low it was FREEZING COLD They send us an engineer to fix the air conditioning system We spent approximately 2 hours calling at the reception and waiting for the engineer to finish his work waiting for the air conditioning system to be fixed At some point we had to leave the room because we had scheduled business appointments The hotel personnel reassured us that by the time we would be back everything would be fine At 11 30pm when we returned to the room we faced the same condition a freezing cold room We spent one hour fighting with the duty manager and the hotel personel till they brought us 2 portable heaters in the room and we eventually managed to heat the room with those heaters The air conditioning system never worked as the hotel personnel kept insisting , Great location Clean rooms 
4230,The Principal London, The side facing the road is a bit noisy The position of the TV in my room is a bit odd the angle is wrong for sitting down , Close to British Museum and Tube station I also like the interior decoration Enough sockets for all my devices to charge at the same time 
4231,The Principal London, I booked one double room for myself and my husband and a twin room for my daughters The girls room was lovely and spacious giving them great comfort whereas ours was rather cramped with a small bathroom and not much space to get in and out of the door once our suitcase was on the case stand I also felt the wardrobes were not deep enough to fit suites in without the doors staying open This was even more restricted by the ironing board being located in the wardrobe too , A beautiful building evoking the style of days gone by The location was excellent for travel around London good facility of the underground and commercial parking nearby The breakfast was lovely and if booked as part of a package deal great value for money Wonderful staff 
4232,The Principal London, Double room size is not as the pictures lighting in the room is noisy no fridge water in bathroom switches hot to cold suddenly room is cold so I had to open air conditioning to heat, Excellent free wifi lots of restaurants and cafe nearby 1 min walking to tube station 10 min walking to king s cross train station 24 hour bus reaching the area

4261,The Principal London, I booked a room for myself and 2 sisters It was a superior room with 2 double beds but it was only set up for 2 people so we had to ask for everything extra I e towels tea and coffee toiletries which was a bit annoying We booked well in advance so it wasn t like they didn t know we were arriving That was the only downside of our stay as the hotel is lovely and it wouldn t put us of staying again,No Positive
4262,The Principal London, VERY over priced Stated as a four star and in my opinion not even close Room floor squeaked every where was annoying unless you made it a game to try and walk from bed to bath without squeaking not possible Room given was NOT the room pictured in the ad when I reserved as junior suite not even close although I was told on site it was one of the best buyer beware Shower bath access was difficult and I am very agile The tub rim to step over was to my knee caps and I am 6 3 so if you are short good luck , Lobby was beautiful from the era built Location in relation to train and tour access was very good 
4263,The Principal London, The single room is small but I was more bothered by the noise from the hallway The walls are very thin Also there was a little mold on the shower wall on my first night It was removed after I called the front desk about it the next morning Otherwise the bathroom was nice , The location is conveniently located to the metro shopping mall restaurants park and The British Museum The exterior is beautiful and the bar is nice

4268,The Principal London, Our room was one of the top twin room paid 320 a night but no slippers no bath gowns no face cloth Very poor toiletries Bath tub handle was not clean and rusty water has been dripping And bath room was very cold Room has a one very cheap small table which wobble so badly with two armchairs Not impressed at all , Staff are very helpful and efficient Very good service 
4269,The Principal London, First had a room in the loft which was extrememly warm and some kind of machine noise outside if we opened the window Not a good night s sleep Very expensive breakfast, Unhappy with first room got moved as soon as a room was available
4270,The Principal London, The location and rooms were lovely therefore it was a shame to be disappointed with the check in process taking at least an hour and with a long queue forming behind On check out the long process was repeated along with forgetting to remove an amount from our credit card for sundries although saying they would do so, The architecture atmosphere and location
4271,The Principal London, The Receptionist advised us that our room had a nice view of the park however on getting to our room you had to stand on the bed look out of the very small window to see the park , Hotel was clean and well located for trip to Theatre restaurants Staff were friendly helpful

4274,The Principal London, Returned 1530 to get ready for an early evening concert to find room not cleaned etc No real apology from desk staff not told what was happening no complaint form available when requested A cup of tea while we waited would have been a nice gesture During our wait heard other guests complaining about the same situation and they were in a suite Not a four star experience Whilst the room was spacious the bathroom left a lot to be desired Access to a small sink was in a gap about 18 inches wide down the side of the bath with a shower screen further reduced by a heated towel rail that projected approx 5 6 inches on the wall side The choice was between bump or burn , Comfortable bedroom plenty of room Breakfast well organised and an enjoyable meal Good location close to the underground 
4275,The Principal London, I was disappointed with both of the rooms I booked and not sure if I would book again because of this They looked very tiered and in desperate need of a revamp The photos online are misleading of the bedroom and the bathroom was also poor also there was a leak on the stares and had buckets out catching water , The down stares area bar and dinning room is lovely and has a bit of wow factor Also the lady on book in was very welcoming and helpful

4278,The Principal London, The air conditioning was difficult to control but this may have been down to the unusually mild weekend we enjoyed, The Russell is a very comfortable hotel with pleasant efficient staff and a great Breakfast choice Less than one hundred yards from the tube station and for the fitter person within walking distance of the west end 
4279,The Principal London, Rooms could do with a bit updating but that is my personnel opinion , From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were looked after really well Nothing was too much troubleReception staff were very freindly and hall porter and concierge also Had a drink in the bar on the Saturday night and again very freindly and helpful lovely atmosphere in the bar 
4280,The Principal London, The supposedly double bed room was too narrow and the room was closer to a single than to a double bed room The tv too small No mini bar Even the towels were for one person Plus the inside view was awful and there was a continuous noise from the power installations But after my complaints they transferred me to one much better , location and staff

4283,The Principal London, Bar area small for a big hotel we wanted to take a coffee in there one afternoon but all the seats where taken but only around 15 people in there, Excellent staff very helpful We went to London to celebrate my husbands birthday and the extra touches in the room helped to make it a special time

4289,The Principal London, Lack of double glazing meant it was a bit noisy but it is London , Good location right near Russell Square tube station Big room with plenty of space 
4290,The Principal London, The rooms could do with a bit of refurbishment but that s being quite picky , The hotel is in a very convenient location for Central London and was great value for money Our booking was made at a very reasonable rate and we just wanted rooms for one night but they were also able to give us rooms with baths on a special request 
4291,The Principal London, the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs Had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either , The location was good close to the tube
4292,The Principal London, Looked like a room from the 1970s Dim and dismal decor old utility furniture Filthy windows Looked out onto a service shaft Extremely poor value for mopney I stay every few weeks in London usually closer to West End either Charing Cross or HorseGuards all are about the same price and infinitely nicer places to stay TV was tiny and no remote housekeeping brought us a spare , room was v quiet Air con worked but fan would only work on full or not at all

4313,The Principal London, The room was quite dark and had too few electrical outlets If I needed to plug in my laptop I had to unplug the lamp as there was only one outlet near the desk That made the room even darker In 2015 a guest expects better Also your website says that the checkout time is 11 00 whereas according to the guest directory in the room it s 12 00 This inconsistency should be corrected ,No Positive

4335,The Principal London, The single room was very small and completely misrepresented in booking com It was really claustrophobic and tiny I could not upgrade and there was no fridge The worse that happened to me was when had to stay another night and checked online that they had available room and when I went to the front office to ask if I should book online or direct he informed me that the hotel was fully booked and if I booked online he would honour it but he would Rush before me to close the bookings Worse hotel experience ever, The bell boy and the staff in charge of the cloak room where friendly and helpful 
4336,The Principal London, Let down by lack of attention to detail Bedroom was cramped and lacked sufficient storage space if we had been staying more than one night we would not have had enough room to hang store clothes Bathroom had no soap holder so soap was left in a puddle on sink no additional bar of soap for shower, Great location

4345,The Principal London, Hotel staff didn t appear to have a good command or understanding of English The receptionist argued that my debit credit card could not be used as a credit card when in fact it had been used as a credit card at Hotel Russell just a week prior when we first arrived in London for the first half of our stay Had to request management to sort this out Her attitude was non too friendly during this experience As mentioned before we stayed here during the first half our trip as well The movie which cost a staggering 8 could not be enjoyed due to the poor satellite reception though the weather was near perfect Room service the first night was acceptable however on night two the food was not delivered When I called to check on the reason I was told that it was after 10 00pm and therefore it could not be delivered The original order had been called in before 9 00pm As if this was not disappointing enough our reservations which I had made on line weeks before the trip was somehow bungled up and when we arrived on Friday we were told the reservations were for Saturday though I had an email confirmation of that Friday being our arrival date We were able to get a room but then had to switch rooms the following morning as the room we were put in for one night was already reserved The location and appearance of the hotel was not enough to outweigh the overall negative experience of staying at Hotel Russell , Location 
4346,The Principal London,No Negative, This hotel was perfect for us We could walk to many sites and museums and the tube stop was right around the corner if we didn t walk It s a 10 minute walk to Euston Station or King s Cross The hotel is very elegant with a beautiful lobby Our room was really comfortable and quiet The bathroom was good sized We had a mini fridge and a tea kettle so we could have tea in our room the wifi was good Really everything we needed to be comfortable was provided and we were in a great location We loved it and would definitely stay here next time we re in London

4359,The Principal London, We were given what I would describe as someone s flat that they let us have for the weekend It had two separate bathrooms one with a shower the other with a bath The sink in the bath bathroom did not work The staff basically said oh well The room had scuffs on the walls the carpet needed replacing and the bathrooms were obviously in disrepair The room was supposed to be of modern design but fell flat They should embrace the history of the hotel and reflect that in their rooms and service , The hotel beckoned to a bygone era and has retained some of that charm 
4360,The Principal London, Had stayed at the hotel a few years ago had a beautiful large room very disappointed with my return visit At 340 for our 2 night stay I didn t expect to get the smallest hotel room I have ever been in was amazed that they managed to shoehorn a bathroom into the space they had There was a bath too I am only 5 feet tall and I couldn t lie down in the bath a good shower stall would have made much more sense The bed was comfortable Everything looked pretty shabby the windows were very dirty didn t matter that much the only view we had was of a white tiled dirty wall Will not return here , Fantastic location could not be better 
4361,The Principal London, It needs a little revamping and we were told a big renovation plan was soon on the way, The location is great and the Russell is one of the well known historical hotels in London
4362,The Principal London, The room was pure value for money I booked a Double Deluxe room but nothing about the room was luxurious It was small poor decorated the bed was on wheels one of the lightbulbs on the ceiling was hanging out of the socket and the toilet roll holder was broken I expect much better than this for a room that costs more than 200 per night , The hotel is in a great location just in front of Russell Square and near the British Museum and Oxford Street It also has a nice bar 
4363,The Principal London,No Negative, Took the English Breakfast and found it was a good way to start the day The front desk lent me an adapter so I could recharge my North American laptop and this was greatly appreciated Found that the Heathrow express which I had booked wouldn t work for me and the staff arranged an early morning taxi again greatly appreciated 
4364,The Principal London, Room was average for a 4 star hotel 150 was blocked against my credit card on arrival I paid the actual 1 night cost of 99 the next morning with a debit card but was told it would take up to 1 week for the 150 to be released from my credit card , Location was good

4366,The Principal London, Room small disappointing with the double bed pressed to one wall water serving bath and shower sink was luke warm not hot Whilst compared to other clients 175 for our small room with no breakfast was clearly a cheap offering by comparison to others available the 4 stars should relate to all rooms not just how impressive the lobby staircase are , The hotel itself location staff were all great I have travelled extensively and stayed in many hotels the public areas in this hotel are very impressive 
4367,The Principal London, Room was small with no view It was decorated cheaply very out of date and tired No mirror to get ready in , Staff were great and the lobby area and bar were great
4368,The Principal London, The design of the bathroom is appaling room 654 We could not wash our hands Although some of them are smiley the front desk reception could have been more helpful , It is a spacious hotel and generlly clean It has a good bar The concierge is good 
4369,The Principal London, The showers didn t get very hot, Very friendly staff Good sized room Good location Clean building and room Good value for the money being in London and right by tube station
4370,The Principal London, The staff were very unfriendly in both the reception area and the restaurant we booked a twin room for our 3 night stay and when we checked in there was no twin room available and we had to take 2 small single rooms No apology I emailed 4 times about my booking no response I rang the hotel 3 times as my flight was delayed no answer We paid for the room on check in and when we went to check out they insisted that we didn t pay and had to find the card receipt to prove we had paid when we gave it to the receptionist we got no apology again and were not asked if we enjoyed our stay I would not stay at this hotel again , The bed was comfortable
4371,The Principal London,No Negative, I did ask for a slightly earlier check in 12 instead of standard 2pm as I had just travelled from Australia they had not received this request I only had to wait for one hour instead of two this was greatly appreciated Lovely bathroom for a small room

4378,The Principal London, Considering the price of the room the facilities are very basic Only enough tea and coffee for two drinks in the room Also the facial tissue and toilet paper were extremely cheap Although I did not require them extra pillows and blanket were not present You could probably request some of the above however I do not think you should have to , The location the decor friendly staff and overall cleanliness 
4379,The Principal London, Horribly loud air conditioner Called desk to find out cost to call our car rental They told me no charge and then charged L9 each about 28 total for two calls when we got our bill They did take it off after some convincing Ridiculous charge for breakfast so we opted for local Starbucks , Good Housekeeping Nice coffee service in room Great concierge Serge Easy access to underground and buses

4390,The Principal London, Traffic noise from the street I was on the 3rd floor The overall feel of the hotel is a bit old Entry foyer felt dark and depressing Others would probably say it was atmospheric but it just felt a bit scuffed on the edges with thick paint job to hide the dings , Reception and concierge staff were very welcoming and friendly The location can t be beat for tube nearby and Boris Bike stands There s a Pret a Manger for quick bites and breakfrast and Brunswick Square also has loads of shops

4392,The Principal London, The room is like what they have in Italy I mean the single room is really small The overall cleanliess is OK I wasn t happy with the dust on the towel rack or the desk tho And the fact that a 4 star hotel doesn t have a fridge nor a scale in the bathroom was really annoying , The locoation was great I used to pass the building when I was studying here I felt really comfortable with a familiar environment

4398,The Principal London,No Negative, Hotel Russell is a lovely old hotel with a wonderful location minutes to the British Museum and with the tube right around the corner The standard double was fine clean comfortable and roomy enough for our week in London My wife especially appreciated the deep tub in the large bathroom

4401,The Principal London, The staff didn t speak english very well The junior suite was more like a double room and be sure to ask for a view to the square cause the air vent in the back yard will keep you awake all night The hotel itself need a bit of upgrade it s not a 4 star hotel , The placement of the hotel is perfect 
4402,The Principal London, The hotel has seen better days The d cor generally was tired Various fittings in the room were in need of repair notably the table which wasn t level and the sink tap which bled black bits after use The room also stank of smoke which got worse when the a c was turned on The staff were generally uninterested On early arrival I asked if I could have access to the room to get changed as I had cut my leg while travelling I wished to dress the cut and change any clothing which had blood on it Two of the three staff members I asked were perplexed by the question despite being able to see the injury The third staff member offered me a Band Aid and use of the ladies toilets Its not easy trying to open a suitcase in a cubicle Five minutes in the room or any room and I would have felt a good deal better disposed towards the venue I particularly didn t like the attitude of the duty manager when we checked out and raised the issue of the faults in the room He implied it was our problem for putting up with it but on past performance ie the lack of effort while I m standing at reception bleeding I wasn t hopeful that anything would have happened I further was not impressed by the implication in pre arrival emails that the hotel was going to upgrade us as it was a celebration stay They didn T Instead they gave us one slice of an inedible lemon cheesecake I remain unimpressed as the promised follow up from the hotel regarding our concerns hasn t happened Breakfast was average Service remained indifferent Not what I expect from a four star hotel I wouldn t recommend or return to it , 30 seconds from tube station

4490,The Principal London, TV reception was poor but you don t go to London to watch telly , Location The hotel was really gorgeous to look at giving the feel of luxury but at a for Central London excellent price Really nice staff Restaurant menu did the obvious well enough All in all very happy and would not hesitate to book again 
4491,The Principal London, The only complaint I would make is that the windows would not open and also the plumbing in the bathroom bowl was a bit sluggish , The friendly helpful welcome on arrival The magnificent and beautiful interior The fact that all the long corridors still retained their original arches and chandeliers The fact that the bedrooms retained their original high ceilings windows and deep skirting boards The luxurious and very tastefully beautiful choice of carpeting in the corridors The smart uniform of the staff

4494,The Principal London,No Negative, Friendly staff excellent location really worth the price for a superior double room on a July Friday night in centre London Asked for a room with a park view and they managed to arrange one Although the police siren at night was a bit annoying but this was not a problem for us
