361190,Hilton London Wembley, The swimming pool wasn t as clean as I thought it would be but everything else was amazing , The staff were so nice and the breakfast was delicious and our bed was super big and super comfortable 
361191,Hilton London Wembley, Aircon not up to the job 3 people in the room on full was still warm but hotel provided us with a fan and room did smell a bit damp otherwise perfect, service was great doorman really good and receptionist also Mohan in dinning room was exceptional and location perfect for daughters graduation at Wembley
361192,Hilton London Wembley, Parking was more expensive than I thought although it was validated by hotel even though I left a day early was charged forv2 days stay , The staff were very friendly and did everything possible to help The hotel is clean and the rooms spacious and beautifully decorated The location is ideal although it is out of central London there is a station close by with regular services 
361193,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing , It was my second stay during my trip to london I choose to return back to the same hotel due to the beautiful treatment from the staff to the residents in the hotelso I thought it would be the best option for me to spend night in hilton prior my flight on the next day would like to thank eveyone for their assistance and warm welcoming 
361194,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast in the executive lounge could have been better by having hash browns so that a full English breakfast could be eaten and more choice of cereals , Bed was amazingly comfortable 
361195,Hilton London Wembley, The front desk was helpful but not what you d except for a four star hotel you will have to repeat yourselves a few times The pool was take up with an outside swimming class which were teaching small children and there was no room for a paying guest but this was the only bad points which id like to see change but i will be back thats for sure , Its easy to find if you live outside of London and your traveling to wembley as its about 2 minutes walk the hotel Its very clean and the staff on the front desk are helpful 
361196,Hilton London Wembley, Lighting was poor I was a bride getting married at the venue and wasn t given a suite after being told a few hours before that I would get it It was disappointing to not get the suite but even more disappointing to know that I didn t even get one of the rooms with better lighting on the other side which should have been common sense to the hotel , The room was spacious and comfortable 
361197,Hilton London Wembley, Can t fault it , The staff were very helpful and friendly beds were comfortable and love the pillows view from the room excellent very clean room love the Bar and the service 
361198,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing , After long trip from Oman we arrived hilton hotel in morning time at 9 00 AM and the receptionist told us our room is ready which was something we appreciate it from the hotel management team rooms are spacious and very comfortable compare with rooms sizes in london hotels Staff are helpful and willing to offer assistance anytime breakfast was delicious and the staff working there are really supportive and smiling all the time we really had wonderful timing in there I would like to thank Mrs Daiva for her great supervision hilton wembley located in very attractive area surrounding with outlet shops and many restaurants and 10 mintue by the train to Paddington station which is another advantage As usual hilton hotels are the best in terms of professionalism of their staff I would like everyone for thier great work and keep it up with the good work 
361199,Hilton London Wembley, The only thing that could have been better was the bed was a little hard , Location was excellent only a couple of stops on the tube from central London and the rooms were large and spacious 
361200,Hilton London Wembley, Terrible customer service in particular the bell boy who was rude The lock in one of our two rooms is spoiled , The hotel is close to the Designer Outlets 
361201,Hilton London Wembley, I was expecting a bigger room than what we had , the location is very good just next to the designer outlet lots of restaurants around it as well Staff are very helpful and friendly Facilities are quite good as well Breakfast are delicious 
361202,Hilton London Wembley, The rooms were far too hot no windows that opened and the air conditioning was appalling It was meant to go down to 18 C and it certainly was nowhere near that we were melting , The Hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were nice and big The breakfast was great 
361203,Hilton London Wembley, The minibar fridge did not work in one room the fridge in the next room would get locked every time The sink was clogged the counter had horrible stains over all cleanliness was lacking, The room was nice and quiet the bed was comfortable
361204,Hilton London Wembley, Basic nothing special I treated my mother to tthe visit for a family wedding celebration Time looks to have paid a toll on the company as standards improve and gaps are bridged within the hospitality industry , Having stayed at H10 Meloneras Palace Gran Canaria I was hoping for a simila experience My Daughter held her 18th Celebration London Hilton after attending a show and that was excellent 
361205,Hilton London Wembley, Again poor water pressure it can be more comfortable if the water pressure is higher Parking is very expensive I had to park in a commercial car park and paid 40 pounds each car for two days parking I feel this is a little bit pricey , Got my room upgraded with my Hilton membership card Good location close to the tube station The executive lounge provides breakfast and free drink Tastes OK for free breakfast Staff are very helpful 
361206,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing to cause annoyance The accommodation was fine , It was our wedding anniversary and the staff had put Swan shaped towels out and petals on the bed which was lovely Great and kind service 
361207,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast was a bit of a let down but it had good selection of food and relatively cheap The porter wasn t really helpful and was on phone all the time during the collection , It was a comfortable stay nice room and bathroom Many outlets bars and restaurants nearby which was very convenient 
361208,Hilton London Wembley, Brekkie Buffet Not Large Enough For A 5 Star Spread Cld Have Been Better Probably You guys Shld Waive Off The Charges For Water Btls After All It s Just Water , Toilets Were Clean Rooms Were Pleasent
361209,Hilton London Wembley, Price For big events this is very expensive vs room size quality , Great hotel for Wembley location cannot be better friendly staff and nice room 
361210,Hilton London Wembley, A staff member walked into my room whilst i was naked and did exactly the same to my brother who was in a different room on the same day she was part of the house keeping team knocked the door lightly and let herself in rather than ask if anyone was in I was quite shaken and embarrassed There was also a big ball of blonde hair on the carpet in our room when we checked in It matched with the color of the carpet so was maybe difficult to see , The way the manager delt with my concerns 
361211,Hilton London Wembley, Not a lot really forgot our swimming stuff though so couldn t use the pool our fault not the hotels but will make sure I have them next time , The Executive room was lovely and definitely made our weekend Great location within easy reach of the tube lines and of course Wembley Wembley arena Would highly recommend this hotel
361212,Hilton London Wembley, I thought we were getting an executive suite that over looked the stadium We actually looked out over the shopping centre The Suite was not what I would expect for the cost of the room This was a standard room with extra fittings We only had 1 comfortable chair between us The term suite was not how would classify this room , All the facilities were great The location was exactly what we wanted as we had planned to see Adele 
361213,Hilton London Wembley, The executive lounge was very crowded in the evening , We arrived at the hotel early and were able to check in right away They also gave us late check out when we requested it Asked reception to bring up some champagne flutes which they did with no problem The breakfast was great and we enjoyed using the health club facilities 
361214,Hilton London Wembley, The beds were the only complaint we had We had to change rooms because our bed was so uncomfortable but the matter was delt with quickly and effectively and as mentioned previously the staff were absolutely delightful Yes the first bed we were given was uncomfortable but Hilton really was fantastic in resolving the problem We are very happy customers and we would thoroughly recommend this hotel , The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly One member of staff in particular Janade was absolutely fantastic So friendly and helpful What I think is most important though is that he was human We had a laugh and it truly felt like we were talking to a person rather than a member of staff you know I love that kind of service Very happy 
361215,Hilton London Wembley, The quality of breakfast and room service was mediocre at best That such a prominent hotel did not have its own car park or did not cover the cost in full of the local car park , The location was very convenient for access to the tube Room was spacious 
361216,Hilton London Wembley, It was very expensive and for us it was just very poor value for money we only booked one night there because we were due to go to concert at Wembley The view from our window was of a corrugated wall about two meters away There was three smallish bottles approx 500ml of water which you had to pay 2 99 each for there were no bath robes as it claimed there would be the carpet was stained in various places and the TV did not work properly There was a tray with a kettle for your tea and coffee needs but it contained three small cups three sachets of coffee three decaf coffee two teabags two lemon and ginger teabags two sachets of white sugar two brown two sweetener and three little pots milk We were not impressed we had stayed for three days beforehand at the Travelodge Stratford for half the cost of the one night at the Hilton and it was far superior spotlessly clean nothing was too much trouble and you did not have to pay for the extra things We would definitely not recommend the Hilton the Travelodge was much nicer ,No Positive
361217,Hilton London Wembley, Very expensive for relatively basic room Paying for location presumably , Breakfast was varied and good however Husband was ill later that day and said sausages seemed undercooked Location for Wembley was perfect even though our concert was cancelled 
361218,Hilton London Wembley, The hotel held 600 on my bank card on Wednesday and it s still being held today Monday We paid the bill in full on Thursday morning I find this very disappointing,No Positive
361219,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Breakfast was plenty of choice only thing wrong was tea was only warm not enough milk ect in room considering how much we paid price was inflated because of the concert we were there to see but overall enjoyed our stay 
361220,Hilton London Wembley, No dressing gown slippers Bathroom dated No please make up my room sign so had to ask for service one day and woken 8am another, Bed ice gym view
361221,Hilton London Wembley, The strong smell of liniment in the room The fact that more water came out of the shower hose than the shower head Only one small bottle of shampoo and shower gel ,No Positive
361222,Hilton London Wembley, An absolute rip off Appalling service Uncomfortable bed Useless bar staff Rude and despicable behaviour from security No guarantee to get in the bars Extortionate prices for food and drink 24 70 for two glasses of very average wine Buffet only in the restaurant for 120 A complete rip off even with excellent service but the service was SHOCKING 600 for one night just the accommodation for complete GARBAGE , Very little 
361223,Hilton London Wembley, Found the selection of drinks available is limited in Skybar , Staff were extremely helpful from the moment we stepped out of the taxi desk staff and concierge were fabulous Rooms were really clean and beds were very comfortable with plenty of pillows It was well stocked with kettle tea coffee etc All rooms had a hairdryer iron and air con Great unlimited breakfast with choices from the continental to full english pancakes and waffles even omelettes made to your own preference On the 9th floor is Skybar they also have a swimming pool and gym It is a great location for events at Wembley so close to shops SSE arena and much more 
361224,Hilton London Wembley, After concert sky bar was open to all and sundry we couldn t go in executive bar as shut And getting a drink in sky bar impossible as couldn t see the bar for non residents we gave up and went to our room and got room service , Nice room great view room service great 
361225,Hilton London Wembley, Quilt rather on the thin side More TV channels fridge empty Shower a bit weak, I loved the location the staff were very friendly and helpful great hotel to explore if attending events at the stadium or arena Rooms very spacious
361226,Hilton London Wembley, Limited bar menu as event day Hotel price high but again event at stadium so can t blame them, Good room size Helpful staff Good choice at breakfast
361227,Hilton London Wembley, Small uncomfortable bed Basic bathroom Poor amenities in room Very over priced for what we got Very poor service in Ikons and Sky bar by overworked but under skilled staff , Good location
361228,Hilton London Wembley, There s not parking for the hotel however There is parking next door The parking is a little expensive even though the hotel subsidise this , All in all was excellent
361229,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Great area to stay plenty to do around the area for shopping and eating Short walk to the train station easy to get to the centre of London by train 
361230,Hilton London Wembley, Being with very poor mobility the car park was a big No No as to price and location A couple of hundred yards to me is like half a mile , Staff were amazing Ambience very good 
361231,Hilton London Wembley, Shower curtain didnt stop the water flooding the bathroom as it didn t reach the floor Mini bar was empty and two bottles of water were on the table which we were charged for without knowing that there was a cost Gym was not 24 7 as the website stated , Room was clean and comfortable Location was really nice Staff were friendly Breakfast and room service were good 
361232,Hilton London Wembley, The clock radio dock in our room didn t work A member of staff attended and advised us that all the music docks had been disconnected to stop people playing music too loudly at night as they had received previous complaints It sounded like a strange excuse to me as he just went and got another one which worked and plugged it in for us Why not just remove them altogether if that really was the case ,No Positive
361233,Hilton London Wembley, Went to executive bar 20 mins before close No beer left Went for a swim in the morning no jets working in pool Went for breakfast no set tables no cutlery no plates They had very limited food left Staff really not sure what they were doing , The bars
361234,Hilton London Wembley, Some of the staff were quite rude and abrupt especially the staff at breakfast because they were not happy we arrived at 15 mins before they took the breakfast off ,No Positive
361235,Hilton London Wembley, Went to eat in the Icons bar and although there were a few meat free options they all had cheese or mayonnaise so I had to settle for a bowl of chips of my dinner Having checked the online menu in advance and then arriving to find a reduced menu on offer severely restricted my food options , Good sized room and bathroom Loved the Wembley wallpaper in the escalator area Really convenient for the stadium and the limited to the bar to residents only so we were able to enjoy a final drink after the show without it being too packed 
361236,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, From the the moment we checked in to the moment we left the following day everything was spot on The stay was amazing I ll be coming back soon 
361237,Hilton London Wembley, The distance from central London but I guess any closer to London would have been more expensive, The concierge was very friendly and understood the purpose of our trip The room was clean and comfortable The service was perfect in every wat
361238,Hilton London Wembley, The carpet was stained and the view poor but we were only there overnight so that didn t really affect us Also the washbasin didn t empty quickly as the plug was stuck , Friendly staff Very comfortable bed The location for the SSE arena could not have been nearer The breakfast was cooked nicely and there was copious selection and the staff in the restaurant area were lovely and very attentive we did not want for anything Good to see also that we were checked by security on entering the hotel after we had been to the concert therefore we felt safer that only hotel guests were able to enter
361239,Hilton London Wembley, I can t complain about anything but if you really want something the air conditioning in rooms could be renewed Weather was very warm so if you need air con high it s a bit loud But in the great scheme of things it s a trivial matter just turn it down a little , All the staff were very friendly You only had to pause in what you were doing and someone would ask if everything was ok and if they could help We were greeted with smiles from the moment we walked in to the moment we left Rooms were clean and well set out Bedding immaculate Bed very comfortable If this is what every Hilton is like I ll stay in more 
361240,Hilton London Wembley, Our breakfast in bed order wasn t collected from the door handle We d paid for standard breakfast but decided on breakfast in our room There was no cooked breakfast left so Hilton offered us a complimentary pastry basket free of charge with coffee and juices , The bed was huge Bath shower was amazing could have stayed in it all day 
361241,Hilton London Wembley, Hotel said we could park in car park adjacent when we called them to book room and said there was no need to book car park On day of arrival car park was full and nowhere locally to park on event day Wifi is advertised as free but actually costs 10 for 24 hrs , Location and cleanliness of hotel was great 
361242,Hilton London Wembley, Staff where unhelpful no parking after being reassured there would be room service took a long time and when we received it the ice cream was melted and got the drink order wrong, Location was good and was very clean and tidy
361243,Hilton London Wembley, Unable to use car park even though rang day before arriving to see if could pre book and told by Hilton staff we didn t need to So very upset when told as we hadn t booked couldn t park ,No Positive
361244,Hilton London Wembley, Parking facility atrocious Your site stated no need to pre book however this was not the case as an event on 2 hours spent driving round to find parking which was far out from hotel No a great experience for a lady and 5 year old Spoilt the day Hotel were no help at all Stopped off to put bags in and all they were interested in was paying for the room,No Positive
361245,Hilton London Wembley, No parking was a massive issue and we got put into an disabled room without my knowledge before meaning that the facilities were extremely close to the ground and I couldn t fit in the shower because it was to low Also they didn t have free wifi and no phone reception Not ideal for the price we paid , The location was great staff was friendly and the food fantastic 
361246,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing but if I could improve anything it would be in in room air conditioning ours was noisy and the room did not really alter much it felt too warm room 608 , Staff friendliness ease of check in out food fantastic Rooms very clean and everything you d need Location amazing Overall fabulous stay
361247,Hilton London Wembley, The only problem was the hot water wasn t working properly But got sorted , Everything Literally The hotel was beautiful the actual rooms was just lovely me and my partner had the best sleep ever as bed was just so comfy staff was very friendly and helpful 
361248,Hilton London Wembley, First time in a Hilton and I was not impressed The reception is a open hall not very welcoming The fixtures and fitting where badly maintained from broken lift buttons faulty standard lamps to bath shower tap handles that come off The worst was the net curtains in the room where properly filthy and the carpet stained The place needed a good clean I didn t help that the hotels theme colour is brown Also the room amenties are dated no charging USB points the television was over elaborate to use and had no on screen programme guide and programme information Also I would expect a on screen interactive service to request hotel services but no old fashion telephone ordering and handle mounted request forms for breakfast If it was not for the location quality of the bathroom and comfort of the bed I would have been unwilling to pay the bill Overall not impressed would not chose it again or any other Hilton hotel , Location 
361249,Hilton London Wembley, Found the bar staff on a night not very nice on one visit they tried to short change us Also could be very rude Asked one night if we could have a bowel of snacks nuts or crisps said to us if you what something to eat There is a restaurant in the hotel , The hotel was next to Wembley stadium which was ideal for us Also a good shopping centre next door The breakfast was great a fabulous choice of different food The reception staff very pleasant and helpful Restaurant staff also couldn t do enough for you 
361250,Hilton London Wembley, We arrived and we were told that the car park was 50 discounted rate we were also told that we were in a disabled room as all booking com customers are put in disabled rooms We agreed as my husband had a THR op in March We placed our luggage in the room and did not look closely till later when we came back The bathroom did have a walk in shower but had a very low toilet and sink which was a problem for us There was a very small window which made the room dark and appeared drab the view was a roof basically no view at all We had a drink in the bar and tipped as always and found out a 10 service charge had been added as well Next morning we checked out and I expressed my dissatisfaction with the car park charge only to be informed that it was actually 15 I didn t get a chance to talk about our issues as the receptionist chose to talk to us with her hand which is extremely rude and demonstrates that she was not listening The car park was a multi storey with a narrow exit which we only just got out of there were scrapes and broken tiles on the way out Would definately not stay there again or recommend to others , Not a lot
361251,Hilton London Wembley, Generally speaking prices for room service prices at the bar the restaurant in room entertainment are expensive which would put me off staying for longer or make me think about eating outside the resort Also why do Hilton hotels insist on charging for wifi it s 2017 for goodness sake I think guests would enjoy it more if at every opportunity they weren t asked to empty their wallets , Buffet breakfast is always exciting at any Hilton I ve stayed at and it was no different here Staff were very attentive at breakfast I was offered a coffee refil three times and orange juice brought to my table plates were promptly swept away just as I d finished using them Food was excellent tasty and good quality Think every member of staff I walked past greeted me with good morning Couldn t ask for a better location to visit Wembley stadium Parking was 15 as guest otherwise 85 View from sky bar over Wembley was brilliant 6 a pint in the bar plus service so not cheap but ok as a one off treat 
361252,Hilton London Wembley, Staff Some were polite but upon entering we felt very intimidated by the women checking us in No one informed us we would need photo identification nothing on booking com or an email just a letter on their front desk Food was a let down Expensive to say the least and tiny portions Ended up with food poisoning on our first night and continued untill Wednesday Bed was hard and sheets really rough same with the pillows thought we had a big double bed but turned out it was two singles pushed together Wifi READ THE SMALL PRINT Only free for 1hour then you get charged no mentioning this when giving us the wifi code so very misleading , Big modern hotel which is right next to wembley stadium Has restraunts and a cinema in walking distance of hotel 
361253,Hilton London Wembley, The bed was very noisy and it was rather difficult to get comfy We had 2 drinks that came up to 28 60 I thought that was a rip off and out of a plastic cup ,No Positive
361254,Hilton London Wembley, I found the reception staff a little difficult to deal with but especially the security staff during the evening , Eventually the room was fine and the facilities were very good 
361255,Hilton London Wembley, Room not ready on arrival too many security checks on entering bars etc especially involving the quizzing of my 16 year old son I accept security was required on the main doors but once inside the hotel as residents we should have been allowed to enjoy the facilities without being subject to continuous scrutiny , location
361256,Hilton London Wembley, Air con in room is rubbish and the rooms are so warm The car parking is surpose to be in with the price that s why I picked the hotel Only 50 of the 85 for 24 hours is complementary had to pay 35 at the payment machine to get out of the car park The staff at the hotel told me it was free parking when I checked in and when I checked out , Going to Wembley great hotel
361257,Hilton London Wembley, I did not like the fact that after paying 245 for a one night stay there were so many additional costs that you wouldn t expect when paying so much for a room for one night and which are also usually included these days in most hotels A couple of examples being 9 95 for basic wifi and a 5 tray charge for room service the tray charge seems to be a means for the hotel to take away any tip from the the staff who deliver the room service as I would normally give the room service staff a tip directly I very much dislike this practice which I have seen becoming more common in some restaurants and hotels I was also very shocked when we asked for one glass of Prosecco in the bar on the 3rd floor and were told this would cost 10 45 The glass was tiny and needless to say we did not entertain paying such a price this was a brazen example of a business taking advantage of a captive audience I E knowing there would be a large amount of guests due to the fa Cup Final In my opinion these inflated prices reflect very badly on Hilton as a company and such treatment of their guests smacks of greed and opportunism , The location was perfect for attending the fa Cup Final which was the purpose of our visit The room was a good size and was clean and comfortable The food we had was of a good standard both room service and breakfast Staff were friendly and helpful 
361258,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Excellent breakfast buffet very good service Exceptionally robust security arrangements for getting into the hotel and returning Also the internal hotel security was very visible in all areas I particularly liked the two bars within the Icon Bar one for residents one for public Food was available and was served very promptly so good planning ahead as this was a very busy time just following the Cup Final Would definitely stay again 
361259,Hilton London Wembley, Not being told in advance that they were asking for photo due to security level I dont carry any as don t have a driving licence I didn t have two credit cards as only take one to large ocassions Bar staff ignored me until another customer pointed out Idbeen there before them, Staff at breakfast brilliant
361260,Hilton London Wembley, Room service woke me up early and tried to come into the room even though check out wasn t until 12 I wasn t dressed so it s a good thing the latch was on ,No Positive
361261,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing to note , My wife and myself stayed 2 nights at this Hotel We travelled to the Hotel in our private vehicle and parked in the Gold car park situated 50 metres from Hotel which is discounted for Hotel guests our vehicle was safe and secure The Hotel is conveniently located metres away from Wembley Stadium restaurants bars shops and public transport The Hotel was very clean comfortable our King size room was clean comfortable and quiet Staff were very friendly and professional We dined in the restaurant both evenings food was good breakfast was very good with plenty of choice Overall we enjoyed a very relaxing 2 night stay I would certainly recommend this Hotel we will definitely return in the future 
361262,Hilton London Wembley, Air con in room was so noisy could leave it on Staff incorrectly validated car park ticket took us over 30mins to exit car park whilst hotel staff argued with car park staff Issues between Hotel and Car Park should not be addressed in front of guests and we should not have been made to wait further inconvenienced whilst the two parties argued over whose fault it was , Great location
361263,Hilton London Wembley, Room wasn t clean lots of dust The key card to enter room kept deactiving being on 7th floor this was a big pain having to keep going down to ground floor for them to sort problem as I have problems with my health I needed to enter the room and couldn t the spa was dirty Alwful smell down there like sewage smell wasn t nice floor in changing room very dirty and pool wasn t clean either carpark we had to pay 15 as we met at hotel cost us 30 to park our cars this was never stated, Bed was very comfortable
361264,Hilton London Wembley, Mini bar was empty I could not get a plain ham sandwich after 11pm 24hr room service sandwiches are pre made so no changes Shower over bath would prefer a walk in shower , Staff are very professional and friendly The lobby and view of Wembley stadium are spectacular at night The drop off point is very handy Parking is literally next door just before the hotel drop off point entrance can t miss it and validated at a bargain price for guests The twin room we had was very quiet spotless and a decent size beds were firm but comfortable bedding was fresh clean cool and plump Bathroom was decent in size spotless fresh fluffy towels nice toiletries and water was hot Large wardrobe 3 large drawers and suitcase rack are very handy I particularly love the hairdryer dresser area with large mirror and comfy office type seat Room service breakfast was lovely highly recommend poached eggs bacon sausages hash browns decaff coffee breakfast tea croissants danish pastries served with bonne maman jam miniatures I would recommend asking for an extra jug of milk to go with tea coffee if you are ordering room service breakfast for 2 as the one supplied was not enough for us Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our restful stopover at the Hilton Wembley and would like to thank the staff in all departments for the excellent service 
361265,Hilton London Wembley, We met up as group of 9 people in the bar before going to Wembley Stadium and on 2 out of 3 visits to the bar we were overcharged when they are already charging 6 60 for beer from plastic glasses to overcharge twice was very poor what made it worse was they said they could not refund cash and gave 2 of the ladies a free glass of Prosecco to make up for the overcharge ,No Positive
361266,Hilton London Wembley, Being elderly Going to a Birthday Party Didn t realise Hilton at Wembley is TOTALLY FOR SUPPORTERS FINALS ETC You can t drop off luggage So no garages 50 a day PLEASE CHECK OUT WHATS GOING ION BEFORE YOU BOOK ,No Positive
361267,Hilton London Wembley, Checking in was a nightmare Service at the bars was slower than reception and thats saying something Quite grumpy Obviosly it is a cash machine , Nice room and breakfast but should be for the price 
361268,Hilton London Wembley, We requested late check in and late check out received two emails email informing us that they were approved but that late check out would be subject to availability The email approving late check out was not communicated from Hilton reservations to Hilton Front desk Front desk phoned the room to see why we hadn t checked out at noon Booking com helped resolve the situation by confirming the email Outcome poor communication within Hilton departments ,No Positive
361269,Hilton London Wembley, Staff at the Icons Bar slow understaffed, Reception staff very professional and helpful Good knowledge I didn t get ask if I was Hilton Honors which was disappointing but it was corrected when I raised it Car Parking nearby and the venue on the doorstep literally 
361270,Hilton London Wembley, there was no proper hot water available it was little warm but almost cold water i was forced to take bath with it bathroom platform was not properly cleaned, in 3 days they never change the bed cover and not proper cleaned
361271,Hilton London Wembley, Staff were not checking us in quick enough regardless of the fact I went to the Honours check in counter The rooms are noisy you can hear people in the corridors talking and babies crying in other rooms , Great location for our conference
361272,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, The Staff are really friendly and hospitable especially Johnathan on reception he was really welcoming and let us know about things to do in the local area The breakfast is really good something for everyone and the rooms were spacious and comfy with a lovely hot shower i stayed in room 684 0
361273,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, We had a fantastic stay at the Hilton at London Wembley The staff were so pleasant and very helpful The room was kept very clean and the beds were very comfortable 
361274,Hilton London Wembley, The wifi situation is a bit of a shame free wifi for 60 minutes for one use is a bit stingy Considering the quality of the hotel and the professional level of service you would expect the basic amenities like wifi to be readily available so that was a little bit disappointing luckily I had a dongle with me which was expensed through work , The staff were super friendly and very informative I checked into the M by Montcalm yesterday evening and even though the room was much more expensive the staff were atrocious in comparison to the service I received at The Hilton I was very impressed and they gave me all the information I would require up front Breakfast was very good fantastic choice of food and all available when you book breakfast a pet peeve is when hotels charge to different prices for continental and English breakfast so the set up at The Hilton was superb 
361275,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing, The room was light and airy Also very comfortable It s was our second stay with you and both experiences Very good The restaurant was good and the food excellent Also your gluten free choice was good 
361276,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, After staying there recently for a boxing event we were really pleased with this hotel The staff were really helpful and friendly food was beautiful service was always so quick and efficient even with how busy it was because of the event everywhere was so clean and tidy all the time and the room had everything you needed They couldn t of done anymore to make our stay any better Perfect
361277,Hilton London Wembley, he view out the window was very dull and of a roof top and another hotel or possibly other rooms within Hilton I did say it was an anniversary hoping for a nice view room but still got this room not the biggest of issues as we not in the room much , The bed room was very large and very clean the staff were friendly and the location was perfect for shopping food and leisure transport links were very good 
361278,Hilton London Wembley, All good as you would expect from Hilton no complaints at all , Excellent overall Comfortable clean room Good bar food and breakfast All as you would expect from Hilton and great value as there were no football games or music gigs at the stadium 
361279,Hilton London Wembley, A minor point I m not an officienado but coffee at the hotel is abysmal Don t know if it s the water but don t bother making coffee in the room as it s undrinkable The coffee at breakfast isn t much better , Perfect location for an event at Wembley Stadium or Arena Parking next door is great 15 per night but pretty good for London and especially if there s something on

361302,Hilton London Wembley, If the hotel provided larger beds as the standard size for single occupants and the executive twins there would be no better place to stay , The staff are excellent Every single member were polite courteous and went that extra mile to improve our stay The security were great to talk too and not intimidating at all The bar staff were always happy to help and had good sense of humors particular recognition to Angelo at the Sky Bar who was a real pleasure to engage with and a top chap I must stress how impressive the service is here as this is the only reason i am giving a review 
361303,Hilton London Wembley, The woman who dealt with my check in was miserable She was not friendly at all and I felt that as a guest she was rude Perhaps if she didn t want to be in the reception dealing with people another job would suit her , The hotel looked amazing clean and very comfortable I attended an event there and it finished late The staff late at night was courteous professional and efficient Very impressed with them

361306,Hilton London Wembley, Staff not very nice or kind probably becuase there were too many people checking in on the day No slippers provided Tap of the shower got rosty and very hard to be turned on off Not worth the name of Hilton or the price overall , The hotel looks newly built furnished comfortable bed and delicioius breakfast right next to wembley stadium and 10 min to underground so good location

361317,Hilton London Wembley, Unfortunately that s where the good bits end Staff were shocking don t think any of them had ever encountered cup final day before Sky Bar was shut and that was sole reason we booked this specific hotel Restaurant was apparently fully booked for lunch and yet tables were empty and we wouldn t get any lunch All in all it was utter rubbish in the hotel itself just easy to get to the stadium was its only plus point , location next to the stadium was brilliant

361329,Hilton London Wembley, Disappointed with service in late night bar after shift changeover our bottle held behind the bar in the wine cooler with our room no marked on it was conveniently misplaced and they tried to fob us off with a cheaper drink until I made a fuss Soured an otherwise very enjoyable weekend , I arrived with one more guest than had been booked for the room and Reception notified Housekeeping of this within 20 minutes an extra bed had been delivered and set up in the room Excellent service could not fault it

361331,Hilton London Wembley, sky bar was closed prior top kick off and that was main reason we chose this hotel staff were awful and looked like they had never experienced a cup final day ever before Restaurant was fully booked for lunch and yet we arrived at 11 30 and attempted a booking immediately Specifically requested early check in between 11 12 when I booked and yet rooms were not ready until after 2pm All in all it was disgraceful for the Hilton brand that we expect a certain level of service from and yet it was one of the most awful hotels and service I have ever had , closeness to the stadium 
361332,Hilton London Wembley, communication with booking com was nothing short of a disgrace seems like hotel and booking com have no form of communication would not book again through this platform ,No Positive

361334,Hilton London Wembley, The smell was horrible and was lurking all day and night car parking described as 15 for the day but if you needed to take the car out in between you had to pay more As well as this the car park barrier in the morning when we were leaving wasnt working leaving us over an hour late to our next destination I could have just parked in the open car park at the top of the road which was 10 all day and you could come in and out at anytime as it was pay and display , The bath tub and large windows

361338,Hilton London Wembley, Considering we paid for a room with a view we were put on the 4th floor and I would have thought we would have been put much height i e 7th 9th floor , What made me book this hotel was the fact that it has a rooftop bar a swimming pool and it s close to great retail outlets The pictures online do not do the hotel enough justice The beds were extremely comfortable haven t slept so well in ages The bathroom looked very nice although the shower temperature kept rising on and off when showering which was slightly dangerous The breakfast was great they make fresh omelettes right in front of you The swimming pool was great although we saw a couple of plasters floating around should definitely be more monitored

361367,Hilton London Wembley, parking is in a associate car park so you will need to walk up the street although it was discounted for the hotel for overnight at 15 its a good old trek to you room loooong corridors dont leave anything in your car or you will need your walking boots, nice hotel clean and modern
361368,Hilton London Wembley, The voucher could have been for breakfast or the following night as eating and drinking on a fixed voucher when we needed to be fresh for monday was not desirable and rest is all we wanted thats why we booked two nights , Handled the situation of check in well Your systems were offline and I could not get into my room until 10 30pm Not good but i received a voucher

361383,Hilton London Wembley, Would have been nice to have vege sausage option at breakfast and feel breakfast could be set out a little better , lovely facilities and good sized rooms
361384,Hilton London Wembley, Tubes , Excellent hotel with great staff only problem is went on a weekend with engineering works on both jubilee and metropolitan line which was frustrating coming from south London and Camden But other than that really want to come back 
361385,Hilton London Wembley, We presumed that room service was 24 hours We had been to a show and had been unable to eat so returned to the hotel thinking we could get room service I rang to enquire and asked what was available for my coeliac daughter I was told the mineral water in the room was the only thing available I found this very patronising We had bought drinks from the bar to have in our room with our meal We couldn t drink them because of having no food This leads me on to what a waste of money seeing as the drinks were so expensive There was only 1 type of ros in the bar which for the quality of hotel and size of it we were disappointed My daughter asked for a snack which was listed in the bar menu She knew these were gluten free His reply was they did have them but not now This is 2017 and gluten free is something that should definitely be catered for even with snacks The temperature of the room was hard to control I could not get the temperature below 18 I also would have liked to open a window but they were non opening I did not discuss this with staff due to it being a 1 night stay only However I would have to think before booking again because I felt unwell in the morning due to the heat Reception was also very hot As a non smoker and with my daughter having a health condition affecting her breathing it was very disappointing to see how many people standing right next to the main entrance doors We had to walk through their smoke which was disgusting Seeing as our room was in fact above the street maybe it was a good thing the windows didn t open Talking of cigarette smoke When we arrived in our room we fancied a cuppa There was only 1 sugar satchet but after ringing through there was a tap on the door shortly afterwards and we were given a bag with some tea coffee etc 1 minute later there was another tap and it was a young lad who had a handful of sugar and milk We thanked him but explained we had already been sent some , Amazingly comfy bed Great shower 100 cleanliness Breakfast was fantastic coeliac friendly also Staff were helpful Close to tube station
361386,Hilton London Wembley, There is no proper parking at the location The staff don t leave the hotel reception area to welcome you or take your luggages or ask for any help They basically just give you the room access card and that s it No one even cleaned the room the next day despite that the sign was there Technology in the room is very old fashioned a key for every single light spread around the room absolute pain ,No Positive
361387,Hilton London Wembley, We ordered food from room service at 9 30pm and we hadn t eaten all day so we were starving Room service finishes at 11pm and our food was nowhere to be seen by 11 05pm I called to complain and apparently there was no record of the order ever being made but I very clearly heard my boyfriend make the order After a while on the phone complaining as everywhere would be closed by now and we were so hungry with no options we were offered complementary sandwiches and a cheese platter Better than nothing when you re so hungry Unfortunate however that the issue did arise initially I would ve expected something more organised for a Hilton , The bedroom and bathroom was spotless very comfy beds I informed the hotel it was our anniversary and arrived to balloons and chocolate cake kissing towel swans and a congratulations card Very sweet 
361388,Hilton London Wembley, The bed was like sleeping on the floor Wallpaper was peeling off the wall Shower head leaking more water than coming out of the shower Walls are paper thin hear baby screening all night Very unhappy would not recommend ,No Positive
361389,Hilton London Wembley, The toiletries in the bathroom were very basic and no toothpaste with them which i know is a minor but other than that the whole experience was fantastic , We enjoyed the whole experience and all staff were so friendly and attentive food was delicious Facilities great 
361390,Hilton London Wembley, Every staff member had different rules No robes and slippers were provided had to beg took over an hour to deliver to our room Be prepared to be very disappointed with the spa The entire room was covered in dust TV not accessible because of the mounting to the wall therefore can t plug in your laptop Mini bar was locked Green in between the tiles in the bathroom Have to pay for wifi 15 a night for parking Isn t this the Hilton I m certain I paid for the name and not the service , Great access to shops and restaurants less than a minute walk away 
361391,Hilton London Wembley, Couldn t fault any aspect of the stay , The Hilton London Wembley was fantastic An unexpected complimentary upgrade saw us in a beautiful modern spacious room with a great view of the arena Staff were all very pleasant knowledgeable and accommodating which added to the overall experience Subsidised parking was an absolute bonus and made the travel much easier Overall really pleased with our stay and would highly recommend 
361392,Hilton London Wembley, Parking should be free all the time for hotel customers 15 per day 45 i paid for parking after 3 days of stay , Very friendly staff confortable and clean rooms Enjoyed sauna steam room and swimming pool

361394,Hilton London Wembley, Someone trying to enter our room hours before check out however this was resolved quickly by the hotel staff, The room was fantastic and the swimming pool was perfect
361395,Hilton London Wembley, Although I didn t venture down to the bar in the evening the hotel felt a little soulless would be a good word Lots of memorabilia in the public areas which you might expect from a hotel which is literally a stones throw from Wembley Stadium but is somehow all felt artificial The staff were professional but not particularly warm or welcoming The major negative for me was that the disabled parking space was cordoned off apparently to discourage the general public from using it My partner who is a Paralympic athlete dropped me at the hotel She has two prosthetic legs and wanted to join me for a drink but the car park entrance is a fair walk from reception so not at all convenient t Surely the disabled parking bay is meant for the general Public who are using the hotel i e Disabled people who are dropping off picking up guests , Room was comfortable bathroom exceptional 
361396,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, I loved the facilities and the location it was right next to the Wembley outlet with a variety of restaurants so we didn t have to travel far Was perfect 
361397,Hilton London Wembley, the fridge smell really bad and male member of staff in the restaurant wasn t professional , fantastic staff and beautiful views great comfort for the price 
361398,Hilton London Wembley, 1 House Keeping are the worse ever they would never do their work without complain 2 Since the room has no window to open so it was so HOT so you have to open the air condition all the time, I Really liked the location to the property and All the Receptionist Staff they are really friendly and helpful
361399,Hilton London Wembley, The air conditioner or heating was very noisy unless it was something else underneath us , The room was lovely It was clean and looked new with a nice bathroom The breakfast was very good I would stay there again 
361400,Hilton London Wembley, Lack of smoking area where the bar was Bar was located on 3rd floor and we had to go down to the ground floor out the front to smoke leaving our drinks in the bar as not allowed to take them out I, Good customer service Staff very friendly Breakfast was very good and room was excellent 
361401,Hilton London Wembley, Long queue for breakfast at expectedly busy time as most guests will have been at an event the night before and hot food buffet not restocked very quickly Food that was there was good though , Perfect location for events at Wembley stadium or arena Rooms clean and comfortable 
361402,Hilton London Wembley, We requested a travel cot before arrival but there was nothing on record when we arrived We asked the lady at reception for a travel cot but when we returned in the evening there was still no travel cot in the room We rang reception and a travel cot was brought to the room at half 9ish The hotel corridor smelt of cannabis and a plate of food was left on the corridor for 2 days until I reported it to reception This was outside the lifts on floor 6 Several other plates with food on was left on the corridors for several hours The beds where not comfy and on arrival to the room we found a champagne bottles cap which I d extremely dangerous for our 1 year old daughter crawling around The room was not cleaned to a high standard , Location was good 
361403,Hilton London Wembley, Room was a little cold and there were some initial issues with the booking but this was sorted at length , Food was amazing and the bed was outstanding 
361404,Hilton London Wembley, The room service phone operator was rude and the breakfast was cold when it was delivered to our room, The room was beautiful and the help when we arrived with our bags etc was very good
361405,Hilton London Wembley, Staff at reception where have of hearing and didn t understand simple English which was very frustrating Bed comfortability wasn t the best pillows where too big and stiff , The facilities where amazing and very good sized rooms
361406,Hilton London Wembley, It could have been better if we have requested a room that we could see outside rather than having blocked by the building in the middle of the hotel , It was a great place All correct
361407,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast does need some attention Not wanting to be overly critical but 5 star and serving coffee in a mug and only 1 choice of cold meat Mortadella seems rather limited Also WIFI limited to 1 hour in public areas I don t really understand the reason for this Also the connectivity in the room was okay the download rate was rather slow I would have preferred a separate shower from the bath Shower curtains always leak and make the floor slippery , The room was spacious and well appointed 
361408,Hilton London Wembley, Not there own car park price was ok as its London, Hotel was easy to find Excellent hotel staff facilities out of this world breakfast was wonderful Staff very friendly helpful s much so I have already booked another stay at the same hotel 
361409,Hilton London Wembley, The Cook making the omelettes at breakfast time said it will take 20 mins to make the omelette totally unacceptable When I went to collect it after 20 mins the cook still had not started making it , The beds in the rooms were very comfortable 
361410,Hilton London Wembley, would have liked biscuits with the tea and coffee in the room and the room was noisy with a droning noise all the time , The bed very comfortable also the whole layout of the room

361414,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Lovely room hotel not easy to get to from West Sussex but that was mainly due to the rail strike unfortunately our concert was postponed so couldn t take advantage of another night 
361415,Hilton London Wembley, The queus for breakfast were just too much You could really do with an extra egg chef on busy days too, The TV has a really big variety of channels and entertainment There s a really cool speaker in the bathroom so you can leave some music on and relax in the bath

361418,Hilton London Wembley, We had pre paid for breakfast and when we went down to get breakfast at 10 25hrs we were told that breakfast stopped being served at 10 00hrs which was a real disappointment I was sure the reception had said breakfast was served until 11 00hrs That said the person we spoke to in the restaurant rustled us up coffee and croissants and some danish pastries so while it wasn t the cooked breakfast I was looking forward to it certainly left us feeling a little better , The location was perfect for a night at Arena Wembley The facilities were great and the staff were helpful We used the car park 15 for overnight parking for hotel guests not too bad when the price is 40 for non residents We went in to the hotel bar after the gig which was friendly and helped to extend a good night out 
361419,Hilton London Wembley, Room directly above the bar made for a difficult time getting to sleep until the music was turned down , Spacious room good burger in Icons bar Perfect location for a gig at SSE Arena 
361420,Hilton London Wembley, We had been put in an upgraded room disabled room The shower was for wheelchair users and bed was smaller than expected When we were moved into our original room it was great but I had to complain to get this I couldn t understand why this happened , The breakfast was really good and great value for money
361421,Hilton London Wembley, N A, The view from the bar overlooking Wembley stadium even in the dark was breathtaking 5 minute walk from tube 30 second walk to wembley arena Memorabilia displayed on walls from past visitors
361422,Hilton London Wembley, Some rooms miles from lifts only about 3rd of exec rooms actually have decent view of stadium , Lovely welcome given champagne in our room for daughters birthday Great location for shopping and the arena Pool and gym great and exec lounge very good 
361423,Hilton London Wembley, the staff completely ruined my birthday night told me the boxing would be on and when we arrived all ready it was not showing I then had no time to do anything else which made me furious The down stairs in the hotel was far to rowdy me and my girlfriend wanted a quiet weekend away and there was loads of drunken people and the noise level was ridiculous ,No Positive
361424,Hilton London Wembley, Phone constantly ringing at 7am due system fault Poor signposts to red car park so parking charges were high, close to London Outlet comfortable rooms good breakfast
361425,Hilton London Wembley, The second night with X factor personnel staying at the hotel I was denied entry to the hotel as I was wearing jeans and a t shirt and a Santa hat as I had been a guest at the royal Albert hall On my return to the hotel the entrance was cordoned off due to somebody called Sharon Osborn being in the hotel lobby I had to wait over 20 minutes for security to eventually say if you are actually a guest you should have a key card I showed him my key card and eventually he let me in Then once entering the hotel was stopped again by X factor staff wanting to know why I was coming into the hotel I had to show my key card again to prove I was a guest My second evening was ruined by staff at the Hilton Wembley and security staff , First night was fine second night was a nightmare as some staff and judges from the X factor were staying in the hotel 
361426,Hilton London Wembley, Living Well needs a refurbish the facility compared to the rest of the hotel is very tired, Excellent Customer service from all the staff even when under pressure on busy X Factor weekend

361433,Hilton London Wembley, Reception staff very unhelpful and very poor attitude in respect of parking which is up the adjacent road and not clearly marked but was made to feel like i should have known and not guided clearly by a rude receptionist , Bed was very comfy
361434,Hilton London Wembley, Bed was hard bathroom wet room pretty much flooded when showering a wedding party was distinctly audible into the early hours parking is extortionate even with validation from the hotel I ve stayed in Premier Inns that are better than this for half the price , Good location 
361435,Hilton London Wembley, The bath hadn t been cleaned at all after the last guest Unfortunately we didn t realise until gone midnight so didn t ring housekeeping and cleaned it ourselves We went down for breakfast before half ten and didn t get seated thanks to a long queue until 10 45 We had a cooked breakfast but the juices pastries and fruit had been cleared by the time we wanted them at 11 10 Breakfast stops at 11 there were only 4 wait staff on duty not nearly enough as were needed to clear the tables and seat people before the sitting ended We ended up after a 20 discretionary discount paying over 200 to stay in a room with a dirty bath and to miss half our breakfast Appalling value and understaffed , Location Next door to Wembley arena and stadium and 5 minutes or so from Wembley Park tube 
361436,Hilton London Wembley, No Tv s in bar area showing England V Australia rugby , Perfect location to see concert at SSE Arena Bed very comfy Great discount on parking only 15 for 24 hours
361437,Hilton London Wembley, The scramble eyes very strange taste Staff double booking our room very inconvenient, The choices that can be made re the egg cooking station The buffet style breakfast is an excellent way to cater for everyone 
361438,Hilton London Wembley, the loud bass from the disco two floors below us No free wifi What hotel in 2016 doesn t offer free wifi Traveled all over the world and have never found a hotel until now that didn t offer basic free wifi Breakfast was bland and tasteless and lacked staff to restock the buffet breakfast The scrambled egg made from powder was not nice in anyway , Location is good hotel is very clean and impressive in decoration 
361439,Hilton London Wembley, All fine no complaints , Everything the room and bathroom were well equipped the shower had a flexy hose not the wall mounted type TV and WIFI were great I was upgraded to the Club Lounge which was cool with good finger food and beverages The Club breakfast second to none too We also parked next to hotel and got a good discount on an Event day 
361440,Hilton London Wembley, Expensive Very mean with tea coffee in room just 2 sachets coffee 4 milks especially at 179 a night , Very convenient for Wembley Arena Nice breakfast Comfy room 
361441,Hilton London Wembley, Only thing that annoyed me was the tv sound being on in the bathroom Didn t see the point in that , Got us an early check in really friendly staff Room was great comfy big bed 
361442,Hilton London Wembley, Room standard Deluxe King was advertised but there were only guest rooms We ended up in a twin single bed room after paying for deluxe King room To watch movies we were directed to call reception for a code We called throughout the night and the only person who picked the phone dropped the phone on us The mini bar wouldn t open The bin wouldn t open What was supposed to be a dirty weekend ended up as a nightmare, Cleanliness
361443,Hilton London Wembley, Staff didn t have any 5 pound notes in the bar till so said they d bring change over 20 minutes later the arena emptied so the bar got extra busy Result is that 5 pounds not passed on and 2 bottles of beer cost 20 Ridiculous , Great bed blackout curtains and a fabulous sleep 
361444,Hilton London Wembley, We arrived late and room service finished at 11 which was fine the the out of hours menu was very poor, Loved the room size and the breakfast staff were fantastic
361445,Hilton London Wembley, The bar was understaffed we waited a long time to be served the first time and they had no Baileys We returning later in the evening we gave up trying to get a drink and there was no seat s if we could have got one , We like the location as we had to go to the arena
361446,Hilton London Wembley, There were not enough staff on duty meaning that queuing was a feature of the stay Given that there was a function on at Wembley Arena on the Friday night there was just not enough staff in the bar We waited around 25 minutes to be served when we ordered drinks a pizza and a burger The lady serving us was excellent however instead of ordering 2 or 3 drinks we only had one lost business We queued for breakfast and then queued to settle our bill Like the people behind us who said we have never queued so much in a Hilton Hotel , The staff who were on duty were polite and courteous
361447,Hilton London Wembley, Going to London Central took us an hour every day going and coming back whether we used the underground or cabs , The Designer Outlet is just few steps away where you could find many good restaurants and shops Nike M S and others The area around the Wembley Stadium is open and nice to walk Supermarkets and Wembley Park Station can be reached within 5 minutes walk 
361448,Hilton London Wembley, Only 2 complaints when you upgrade to stay on the executive floors the rooms are no different to the others What you get is the lounge access and at 40 extra a night not sure it s worth it Alcohol can only be consumed there for 2 hours a day so 40 a day for a water and coke seems a little daft Could do with some extras in the room to make it stand out 2nd thing the shower was a little poor for the price of the room, Hotel is lovely staff excellent so helpful I have stayed a few times now would highly reccomend Car park price good
361449,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, The whole experience being at this hotel was excellent with comfort class design and so close to all amenities excellent staff and service I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone

361451,Hilton London Wembley, The bar drinks selection was a little disappointing for a Hilton , Excellent staff perfect location for visit to Wembley had a fantastic night Thank you Hilton 
361452,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, We found the staff to be very helpful and polite the room was spotless as was the rest of the hotel the breakfast was a large selection and very pleasant staff to help
361453,Hilton London Wembley, 1 Receptionists were terrible The only lady there was keep talking on the phone and nobody gave me any help or attention It seems that they are interns or trainees from a hotel school lack of experience and skills I understand that people need time to learn and practice but I also believe that to ensure the quality of service a supervisor should be around 2 The receptionists again After checked in I found that I was not told the wifi password normally they would indicate me at other Hilton hotels I called the reception three times the first two calls were not answered I waited long enough And I also asked for extra shampoo and dental sets I asked for two dental sets but they only sent me one they said in 5min but actually sent in 25min I had to call them again and after another 20min they finally sent me the second set It was really late already and I had to keep myself awake to wait for them 3 The water pressure for the shower was really low not comfortable at all water was not hot enough neither 4 You can not get into the hotel from the car park they provided I understand this and this is a minor problem , The price was reasonable location is fine not far from a tube station The main hall was interesting got lots of signed sports jerseys The hotel is close to a designer outlet and many restaurants Got convenient stores opened till late 
361454,Hilton London Wembley, No bathroom on ground floor , Gorgeous breakfast really special Loved the pool sauna and steam room The actual room was beautifully spacious and the bed extra comfy 
361455,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, We stayed at this hotel as we were going to the England match excellent location easy to walk to central station and was able to get around London on the tubes the hotel was clean pleasant staff and amazing breakfast
361456,Hilton London Wembley, The car park was expensive The service room was fair for a 4 hotel The fitted sheet in the bed was torn for a 4 hotel No welcome snacks in the room Tiny shower gel for a couple No free wi fi for a 4 hotel, The location is near Wembley stadium 
361457,Hilton London Wembley, That the breakfast option was not to be had on line unfortunately if I needed to be in the area again despite being my first choice I would have no choice but to look elsewhere , The perfect location Staff were very helpful and efficient 
361458,Hilton London Wembley, Where does one begin Booked an Executive Corner Suite for a nice little treat for our stay and to a show Great view but that s about it Our room took what seemed an eternity to be released then we were never contacted as promised so after the long wait decided to go to reception Eventually got our room First off we noticed only one dressing gown with no slippers as we started to shower then decided to look around to see what else was amiss Pulled back the sheets and to our horror found pubic hairs and dirty footprints on the bed sheets on further investigation there were several stains on pillows cases and sheets Also the Cup covers were also used and dirty Complained and was given another similar room similar being the operative word we were basically given a Downgrade Complained again to the Manager who proceeded to argue that this new room was not a downgrade At this point I invited the Manager to come up and compare the two rooms he declined and then after some heated conversations was given a third room This room was ok but by then the damage was done we were late getting ready for our show and put a damper on the whole stay The food and drinks in the Executive lounge was not up to the Standard of the Waldorf in Aldwych so we were all in all very disappointed with our stay We were offered a discount on our room which we accepted To make matters worse the reception took two amounts off of my debit card The original booking fee and the subsequent discounted fee followed by more phone calls and arguments only to be told that they cannot refund the fee until several days later so everyone beware of this procedure as I am not into funding loan Mr Hilton with my hard earned cash for free Still awaiting some form of an apology by email guess we have got a long wait All in all not a pleasant experience for our nice little break , Location was great that was about it 
361459,Hilton London Wembley, that we was a resident and we had to pay more for the dinner because I didn t book in advance Reason I didn t book in advance is because I couldn t guarantee the traffic, There was a great atmosphere
361460,Hilton London Wembley, Cards locked us out of our room twice only to b told on the third time that we should not keep them next to mobile phones , Beds are comfy facilities excellent
361461,Hilton London Wembley, Shower water pressure was a bit weak Bar prices are quite high , Comfortable big beds luxurious quality in the rooms Overall considering the location it s reasonable value for money 
361462,Hilton London Wembley, Room was freezing despite turning heating right up Walk in shower soaked the whole bathroom Tea at breakfast luke warm , Freindly staff but not paticularly helpful
361463,Hilton London Wembley, No Toothpaste or Toothbrush but other fancy hair net Conditioner etc also no bathrobe or Slippers to go to pool and sauna, Very big room nice and spacious
361464,Hilton London Wembley, These are observations not ve s for the hotel 3 95 for the in room water mini bar not stocked have to ask so fridge unit locked Be a little careful of the various tube over ground stations serving the area they re all Wembley something but you can pick the wrong one , Very excellent hotel overall good staff Location good 
361465,Hilton London Wembley, Light switches There wasn t one main switch for all lights I had to go round the room turning off all the lights that had been put on for me Not a big deal but a little annoying when you know the likes of Premier Inn or Travelodge even have this , The bed was fantastically comfortable I could have laid in all day Great view of Wembley Stadium from my room as well Breakfast was lovely too The staff in the restaurant were very nice and looked after my work case whilst I had breakfast 
361466,Hilton London Wembley, There were not enough staff working in the dining room during breakfast The tables were messy there was a shortage of glasses plates etc and some of the cooked food was cold as it had been there a while , Bedroom was very comfortable with good facilities
361467,Hilton London Wembley, 4 for water no fruit or cookie no wifi Dirty plates sat outside neighbouring room until 11am from the night before , Staff friendly Location brilliant Good gym and pool 
361468,Hilton London Wembley, Had to trundle down 7 floors to reception for more coffee and sugar supplies for the room having made only one cup each as there was no reply from housekeeping Slightly annoying first thing in the morning , Bed amazing room a good size clean and comfortable 
361469,Hilton London Wembley, Disappointed that the Sky Bar closed early despite being told several times that it would be open after dinner , Lovely room great meal in the restaurant and ideal location for Wembley Stadium 
361470,Hilton London Wembley, We were not aware there was such a good shopping centre near by It was fabulous Best to tell people , Location was perfect 5 mins from tube 2 mins from Wembley 2 mins from shopping centre
361471,Hilton London Wembley, I was at the Spurs game at wembley and they couldn t cope with the volume of customers wanting drinks The management of the bars were running around without a plan They are opposite Wembley so if anyone should be organised it should be them Drinks prices were really overpriced even for London , Rooms were lovely and the beds are comfortable There were some biscuit crumbs though at the side of the bed that weren t cleaned from last occupants 
361472,Hilton London Wembley, Room wasn t clean enough hair in the bathroom and in the carpet Tv low quality lack of the channels no HD 60 of the channels aren t working No EU plug only in the bathroom The hotel is for the international travelers so it is time to forget the UK plug Wifi complicated too much information is needed to use it , Close to Wembley stadium very friendly reception staff breakfast is fine 
361473,Hilton London Wembley, I spoke to the receptionist stating if it was possibility to have food taken to the room as i m a diabetic and not had the best night She stated clearly that this was not possible and not part of the company policy I had then when to the 3rd floor and asked the lady at the serving area and explained my situation and she was happy to help me out i Found it was noisy in the late evening The football match was on so i would recommend just to check who is playing one another , I like that you can park overnight for 15 This was at Gold Car Park which was a minute walk from the Hotel I liked the comfort of the hotel room I liked how tidy and clean the room was I like the lighting in the room The room had a fridge in was a bonus to keep my medication and my drinks cool Hotel close to the Wembley Outlet and 2 minute walk to the Underground station 
361474,Hilton London Wembley, We checked in at 11 00am as we were there to watch the NFL Both rooms signed the paperwork however we were never asked for a credit card details for room extras which seems to be normal practice They did look after our luggage though and gave a receipt Unfortunately when we came back that night they had no record of one of the rooms being reserved This was very frustrating especially as we had already done the checking in process that morning We never got our luggage that night either but had to go down to reception in the morning to collect it ourself Not happy,No Positive
361475,Hilton London Wembley, Didn t get the Room I originally booked which was dissapointing Prices in the bar a result very steep Over 6 at the bar for a drink and then a service charge on top Not good , Great clean room airy and comfortable Staff all friendly and helpful
361476,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Great venue for the stadium we were there for an event Plenty of eating options nearby Easy to get to from centre of London Hotel was clean generally pleasant 
361477,Hilton London Wembley, My room was opposite the lift which from my experience tells me lots of noise as every person from every room will walk past Classed as an Executive room I would call it a normal room As expected the room was very noisy The sound of chairs dragging on a hard floor which tells me there was a staff room nearby This woke me both mornings 5am on the first morning Not good, I travel a great deal and stay in many hotels across the world Thus in comparison my stay was ok at best 
361478,Hilton London Wembley, The only thing I disliked was the fact the mini fridge in the room was not prestocked with soft drinks but I understand different hotels have different policies and it wouldn t stop me coming back in the future I needed a drink late at night and felt it an inconvenience to call rooms service for a soda and asy daughter was asleep I didn t want to leave the room to get it, The staff were all so friendly and helpful my daughter loved the pool and everything was so easily accessible
361479,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfy and rooms spotless Breakfast was excellent On arrival there was a little confusion as they could not find our booking however this was immediately rectified and the manager sent pots of tea biscuits and cakes to the room as a little gesture which was very much appreciated 
361480,Hilton London Wembley, I didn t have a mobile phone signal in room 417 but when I was moved to room 412 facing Wembley stadium the signal from O2 was much better The staff moved without any fuss I would have liked hooks to hang up my pyjamas to air them A non slip mat or rug outside the bath would be a good thing , The hotel and staff made me feel special 
361481,Hilton London Wembley, No free wifi other than one complimentary hour In 2016 wifi is available in supermarkets coffee shops transport it should be free in a Hilton hotel , Staff pleasant Efficiency Quiet Clean Breakfast great
361482,Hilton London Wembley, Long walk 0 5 km and many many steps up to Wembley Park underground for mature visitors Wembley is far out 12 tube stops from London West end etc , Beds v comfortable great bathroom very convenient to London Designer outlet Shops 2 good supermarkets within walking distance convenient car park with hotel concession rates nice swimming pool free to residents
361483,Hilton London Wembley, Would have like a room with a view, The staff were so helpful and kind Paulo is an asset to the Hilton lovely chap would definitely come again but would like a room with a view
361484,Hilton London Wembley, Room service quite expensive ok without the tray cost , The location next to the arena the friendly staff members the food was perfect if a little expensive and the room really clean and comfortable 
361485,Hilton London Wembley, The prices of the food mini bar was extortionate Toiletries could have done with being bigger as you only get 2 uses from them and there was 2 of us who showered on both days we were there Also put an instructions manual for the TV as we couldn t find the TV Guide The speed of service when checking in could be improved however was okay , The pillows were super comfortable and the bath felt luxurious I LOVE that you could leave your bags there to collect later after checkout as me and my friend had an event to attend that evening as well and we had done some shopping throughout the day Very close to amenities which was really good and excellent views from the window 
361486,Hilton London Wembley, The staff is totally untrained and not compitant To get in touch with room service it took me 15 minutes to contact as nobody was picking up the phone We don t know this is a effect of ressession may be less staff or This hotel is managed very badly The lady on the reception doesn t know what is Amex platinum card I will not recommend this property to any one ,No Positive
361487,Hilton London Wembley, WiFi reception was poor in room 411 , Have stayed at hotel previously Liked the location and the hotel Used it as a Base to see London The bedrooms are clean and spacious and the bed was comfortable 
361488,Hilton London Wembley, There is an extra 5 for every room service call which mounted up We ended up getting our own food after many calls so we dont keep getting charged anymore than we had already Despite being in a double room there was only one set of toiletries , The staff were very helpful 
361489,Hilton London Wembley, On arriving at our room we found that the bathroom was without a shower curtain I feel that if we had not have mentioned it to the reception staff it we could have had an accident , On arrival at the hotel we were given a room with a view of the stadium which was good 
361490,Hilton London Wembley, Checking in the receptionist needed help from a colleague and then couldn t find my Hilton Honors account despite me giving her the number She seemed generally bored and not too interested in welcoming guests In an Executive room for 2 people we had one bathrobe Called housekeeping 3 times before I could get through and general reception twice always engaged Said they would bring one up Never did The lamp next to my bed wasn t working as the bulb had gone As it was around 10 30pm and after the fiasco with the bathrobe didn t seem worth bothering to try and get this sorted out In the bathroom out of 2 bath sheets one was new and fluffy and one old and worn odd to leave two such disparate towels and so obvious one was ready for throwing out This stay was disappointing especially as it was a treat for a friends birthday and It felt like no one had an eye on the fine detail I expect better at 175 a night , Second stay here and very convenient for the Stadium and Arena Buffet breakfast is very good The women working in the Executive Lounge were friendly and helpful 
361491,Hilton London Wembley, The fact that you can not unload luggage and told its high security when anybody can walk in and go to floors obviously this just an excuse not to hire porters, Positin and restaurant
361492,Hilton London Wembley, Would have liked the sky bar to have been open , Huge bed modern room with lovely en suite Breakfast catered for all with a great selection of food and value for money Very friendly staff 
361493,Hilton London Wembley, Car park was too expensive You have to pay 15 everytime you leave the car park after 2 hours Not ideal if you would like to go out for meals or events and return backo, Staff were friendly
361494,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast was included after an upgrade I got but I wasn t allowed to go into the restaurant and had to eat at the bar At the checkout the manager told me it should have been included , The room was good as always
361495,Hilton London Wembley, Only downside was no shower curtain in the bathroom everything else was superb , Check in was swift efficient and friendly Room was cleaned to within an inch of its life Bar staff very friendly Photos show door to door Hilton Hotel to sse Arena 
361496,Hilton London Wembley, Being picky here but using 1 pillow was too low for me and using 2 was too high and gave me neckache , Literally about 12 steps from hotel to SSE Wembley Arena Breakfast choice was great Everything was absolutely perfect staff room location food 
361497,Hilton London Wembley, Some staff weren t very good had to wait for ages in bar for drinks They closed the bar early dinner was inconsistent There 4 of us for dinner 1 meal was fantastic 2 were lukewarm and the other was inedible , Comfy bed Big room Breakfast very good 
361498,Hilton London Wembley, Bedside electrical sockets were not live so could not charge mobile Bedside clock radio dead so could not use alarm , 9th floor lounge facilities Proximity to stadium and arena 
361499,Hilton London Wembley, Not a very comfortable bed because of the obvious rush after the arena closed there should have been more staff at the bar 25 minute wait to order two drinks and the kitchen should have stayed open for a little longer Room service menu was very limited with only pre made sandwiches so if you don t like mayo you go hungry , Excellent location next to Wembley Arena Reception staff very helpful Great overnight deal with the Gold car park next door 
361500,Hilton London Wembley, The fact that we had only booked for 1 night , Exceptionally helpful and friendly staff nothing was too much trouble Bed was so comfy and room had everything we needed Luxury at a great price 
361501,Hilton London Wembley, Just the pillows but asked at reception for different ones and they came within ten minutes, Lovely friendly staff nothing to much trouble great for watching seasick steve concert and in walking distance to shoping centre and tube station and the breakfast was amazing will be coming back again next year 
361502,Hilton London Wembley, If making use of the affiliated car park bring a small car The bathroom sink and tap arrangement is a bit odd Suggest whoever designed this set up be nominated for the Turner prize as it would look good with a stuffed shark in it and wouldn t make it any more ridiculous Operating instructions for the aircon in the info pack please , The room was clean and well appointed facilities in the hotel are good and the staff helpful breakfast is excellent Ideally placed for the Arena will definitely book when next going to a show Also very close proximity to numerous restaurants so great for grabbing a meal before the show 
361503,Hilton London Wembley, to have known that we needed the gold parking on arriving and that the ticket would be discounted on check out would have been useful to know without having to ask at reception when we arrived with the car in limbo ,No Positive
361504,Hilton London Wembley, The Gold car park next door is very ackward to maneuver especially for big cars so be careful , Good location friendly helpful reception staff and cleanliness The Gold car park next door is convenient and one hour parking is free through hotel authorisation 
361505,Hilton London Wembley, The accessible facilities room only had one small double bed and the hotel unable to make this a twin room whereas all other rooms can be either twin or double This was a problem as twin had been ordered two brothers The bar staff were incredible slow both at around 6pm and then later around 11 15pm Plenty of staff on duty but no organisation by manager and so some of us waited over 10 minutes to be served whereas other people were served much more quickly Even when this was very politely pointed out staff still continued to serve one side of bar and ignored people on other side This was a shame as breakfast staff and restaurant staff were so much better , Location next to SSE arena brilliant meal at hotel before show and drinks afterwards Breakfast was excellent a really varied selection of things to choose from Meal in restaurant previous evening was also very good 
361506,Hilton London Wembley, The fact I was put in a room above a very loud function which resulted in me having to call front of house twice as my 4year old couldn t sleep I should have been put on a higher floor as staff were aware this function was taking place Also no phone signal in the room given add to that 9 99 for 24hrs Wi Fi every other hotel if stayed in its been free and 11 50 for a kids movie As of yet the noise complaint still hasn t been dealt with Not happy with the service given,No Positive
361507,Hilton London Wembley, There was a fake eyelash imbedded into one of the towels and I found that no matter how I used the shower it just soaked the floor , Room looked very clean and was very comfy It s a great location for the SSE Arena 
361508,Hilton London Wembley, Service was not very quick both in the bar and breakfast The bar was very small for the number of guests and minimal staff Also very expensive , Excellent location for Wembley arena Comfortable and spacious room

361510,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, I was travelling on my own and had booked a twin room but was upgraded to a double free of charge Parking next to hotel reasonsably priced for London and secure and well lit Staff very helpful 
361511,Hilton London Wembley, The air conditioning was too noisey to have on during the night and the window didn t open so the room got way too stuffy The staff at breakfast were less than attentive we were sat at an unpaid table and had to ask for cutlery They had no dairy free alternatives which meant my husband had a hearty breakfast of melon Not great I thought Hilton was up there with Marriott but apparently it s not as good as travel lodge , Excellent location as we were going to a concert at Wembley arena 
361512,Hilton London Wembley, The room seemed to be equipped for one rather than two in that it had only one easy chair at the table and one dressing gown , Literally a few yards from Wembley Arena and Stadium We had an Executive room More expensive but with free food and drinks in the lounge and an excellent breakfast it was good value we felt After a gig at the Arena we were home and in the bar in under 5 minutes 
361513,Hilton London Wembley, I had no connection on my phone and when i tried to connect to Wifi it didn t work so i had to always always go all the way downstairs to make calls or answer messages Also I was a bit disappointed with the view from our room The view was just Rocks on the floor and nothing else , The bathroom was very nice and the bed was super comfortable The TV has more channels then other hotels so you can just watch movies at night if you want 
361514,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast was a major let down compared to other Hilton hotels I ve stayed in over the years Toaster machine needs to be replaced due to 4 attempts to get any sort of colour on my toast Stock levels on various items were never topped up Apple juice was non existent had to ask 4 members of staff for butter by which time my toast was stone cold Staff don t understand the concept of stock rotation as when topping the stock of sausages bacon scrambled eggs etc all the new stock was dumped on top of the stock that had been sitting there for a while If anybody left it till late for there breakfast they could be eating food that had sat there for hours Not the Hilton standards I m used to , The whole experience was spot on with our stay 
361515,Hilton London Wembley, GOT THE HUMP WITH THE BOUNCERS ATTITUDE ON THE THIRD FLOOR BAR, STAFF WERE GREAT BUT THE BOUNCERS ON THE THIRD FLOOR WERE TAKING THE P OUT OF ME IM DISABLED NOT DEAF

361517,Hilton London Wembley, On match day the only food on offer in the restuarant was a buffet at a fixed price of 50 per person absolutely ridiculous , Wide variety of breakfast items and a specially made soya porridge for my partner with a great view of Wembley stadium from the restuarant
361518,Hilton London Wembley, I had some Issues with my card being pre auth The funds were available from the 7th 350 for my two rooms When I arrived they said they were able to take 145 room 1 but not the 205 room 2 When I spoke to my bank they said 2 payments of 145 was authorised The hotel said they tried to auth 145 but this declined so they tried it again and it worked This meant i was 145 down I managed to pay the 205 but I am still unsure why the hotel said this had declined but my bank said these payments were authorised ,No Positive
361519,Hilton London Wembley, Could improve check in process but not a major problem , Excellent location across road from Wembley stadium and Arena Friendly staff with excellent customer service 
361520,Hilton London Wembley, No hot choc in tea making facilities Drinks served in plastic cups It s a Hilton Charge 4 for water in the room thought a still water would be included , The speaker in the bathroom and excellent location for Wembley Also the rooms are very nice for a basic 
361521,Hilton London Wembley, More T bags and fresh milk would be nice, The bed was huge and soft and aaahhhh so were the pillows just gorgeous Great view with a comfy chair by the window and handy table Loved the large TV Bathroom facilities were superb 
361522,Hilton London Wembley, Room had not been cleaned and even though we informed reception of this nothing was done to rectify Safe for valuables didn t work , Location was excellent rooms were spacious breakfast was excellent 
361523,Hilton London Wembley, NOTHING, On arrival we got upgraded not sure why but overwhelmed We received excellent service The staff all very friendly I have already recommended the Hilton at Wembley as members of my family regularly visit that area 
361524,Hilton London Wembley, earlier breakfast for early departures ie pre 7 00am , proximity to Wembley stadium restaurants easy to get to from St Pancras International Train Station Eurostar 
361525,Hilton London Wembley, Asked for high floor got level 4 We booked the deluxe king room room was at a good standard but what you see in most hotels so unsure what made it deluxe , Good location great reception sky bar and icons bar were great 
361526,Hilton London Wembley, The tv took a while to connect but apart from that all was very good, Staff were very helpful and friendly Great choice of films in the room and the bed was huge 
361527,Hilton London Wembley, Not the comfiest of beds we booked a king suite had to wait 25 mins to get served in the bar after a concert at wembley under staffed , Excellent location for wembley stadium arena 
361528,Hilton London Wembley, Being dragged out of bed at 1 30 pm for a fire alarm that took nearly an hour before we could get back in our rooms No fun being left outside on a chilly night without many clothes on and very little information from staff about progress or where to stand , The bed was excellent and the bathroom facilities very good when we could use them 
361529,Hilton London Wembley, We had left a parcel and when we rang up about it We was fob off and told to call back and talk to housekeeper Not what we expected from the Hilton, We liked the staff some where vary helpful others not
361530,Hilton London Wembley, No tea or coffee facilities in the room or complementary water snacks like all other hotels we have stayed Dental kits arent great with horrible tasting toothpaste that still leaves your teeth feeling dirty Considering it is a hilton hotel we expected it to be much better than any other hotel we ve stayed at Next time we would definitely choose the crowne plaza again over the hilton Not a great experience, Location was good and look of the hotel was very nice
361531,Hilton London Wembley, A bit out of the way however the links to central London are very convenient, We arrived in the morning and the staff was very accommodating with our early check in The hotel is stunning the rooms are large with plenty of storage space comfortable large bed and beautiful bathroom The value for money was excellent and I would definitely come back there again 
361532,Hilton London Wembley, Lifts difficult to access with the number of people arriving all at the same time but not the Hotels fault , The Executive Lounge was great Nice quiet area with brilliant view Excellent facilities included in price of room 
361533,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Quick check in upon arrival Upgrade to suite an unexpected surprise So very close to Wembley Stadium Just overall perfect We had a false alarm fire evacuation during the 2nd night which for the size of the hotel was handled very professionally 
361534,Hilton London Wembley, there was nothing, The bed was extremely comfortable and there was no noise from the corridor even when the hotel was very busy We had a great nights sleep The staff in the bar were very helpful when we asked about dining and even reserved us a table since we could not get into the restaurant The reception staff were very welcoming And the breakfast well what can I say it was amazing 
361535,Hilton London Wembley, The hotel could do with brighting up as I found the corridors dull and the dark coloured carpets looked well worn , Everything was right nearby the Wembley Stadium Areana and the Shops All in walking distance 
361536,Hilton London Wembley, Lifts were very busy but our room could not be accessed via the stairs keycard didn t work in the doors from the stairs , Friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms Spurious fire alarm at silly o clock in the morning was resolved very quickly and staff handed out bottles of water and space blankets whilst we were waiting outside 
361537,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing even the midnight fire evacuation was dealt with efficiently and did not detract from our overall great experience , Location was great Staff in all areas were so friendly and helpful but particularly consierge beds super comfy and breakfast excellent Parking easy and good value for the area 
361538,Hilton London Wembley, Being woken up at midnight for a fire alarm and waiting outside in the freezing cold for half an hour and then being let back in without an explanation or apology from any staff at the time Also housekeeping tried to come in our room when the do not disturb sign was on the door , Great room overlooking the stadium Fantastic breakfast buffet 
361539,Hilton London Wembley, we had to wait 20 minutes over our original check in time before our room was available We then discovered that it was a twin room not a double as was booked on line When I spoke with the receptionist she informed me that we had booked a twin I said no it was a double She then replied a double room is the same as a twin It s not A twin room usually has two single beds A double has a double bed We were moved to a double room which was basically two single beds pushed together with King size bedding on it There was also no assistance with our luggage after check in , Very comfortable bed Spacious room Clean but not up to the usual Hilton standards I m afraid 
361540,Hilton London Wembley, There was no Bluetooth speaker in the room other chains I use offer this in rooms of this price free wifi was slow and a little unreliable limited number of coffee and milk in the room, As a reasonably new hotel it was clean and tidy with a modern feel Well situated for the restaurants in the London Outlet Shopping Centre 
361541,Hilton London Wembley, That you have to pay 5 to use the mini bar and you have to pay to go to the sky bar etc, Loved everything about the hotel but the breakfast was not worth the amount I spent for it the scrambled eggs were terrible but the rest of the breakfast was lovely just expensive
361542,Hilton London Wembley, The window in the room does not open The toilet was filthy with urine and hair I had a headache for 2 nights with no air in the room We were told we had a lovely view we didn t One member of staff was very rude at the breakfast serving , The London outlet next door
361543,Hilton London Wembley, Bit far out after midnight when the tube closed its a pricey taxi ride , Good quiet hotel good quality good breakfast good pool and spa area variety of restaurants close by 
361544,Hilton London Wembley, Wi Fi didn t work and complicated should be simple to use Breakfast wasn t great with not enough staff and had to ask to refill food etc the music and decor was dull and staff looked dis interested Asked for a coffee for way home after breakfast and had no top to stop coffee spilling , Location was great and reception staff very helpful Had a late night food in the bar upstairs and Food was great and so were staff Room was ok but shower wasn t working properly with water escaping from shower head When we went for breakfast we had to walk past someone s sick in the corridor which no one had cleaned up from previous evening 
361545,Hilton London Wembley, The pool could have been heated and the drinks a little cheaper in the hotel bar , The service was superb and the hotel offered everything we desired from our stay 
361546,Hilton London Wembley, Not much to dislike except the view from the window there wasn t one It was expensive for one night but it was a treat , Proximity to Wembley stadium couldn t be better we were attending a concert at the stadium It is a lovely hotel 
361547,Hilton London Wembley, The drinks in the bar were ridiculously priced 26 for a large wine and double whisky lemonade The pool is so much smaller than the photo looks Also disappointing to have a kids swimming lesson going on whilst using the pool hardly relaxing Also had to queue a little while on arrival but a guy in a suit clearly someone on a business trip or convention was asked if he needed help and was able to jump the queue , Lovely room and bathroom quiet clean Nice sauna and steam room Fine for what we needed Loved the designer shopping outlet and the restaurants nearby 
361548,Hilton London Wembley, No hotel parking Paid parking near by but 15 to go in and out each time , Location is great Friendly staff and great service Clean and comfortable room 
361549,Hilton London Wembley, Family rooms from 551 to 565 or so has internal view to the wall Should be same on 6th floor , Perfect location right in front Wembley stadium next door to SSE arena and within 7 8min walking to Wembley Park underground station 
361550,Hilton London Wembley, Noise from banging water pipes, We had very little sleep as there was a continious banging noise coming from our bathroom it was every five minutes i asked my wife if she wanted to complain but she said she can sleep through it which i could not when the banging did recede at around 4 am i finally got some sleep of which i slept through my 9 am alarm and was late for a family celebration in southall the noise appeared to be from the water pipes i did report this to the staff of which she gave me a 20 per cent discount on the booking which we did not feel was enough we loved the hotel and felt privelidged to be stopping there but sadly came out with a big negative against the many positives 
361551,Hilton London Wembley, Only 1 sachet of coffee in the room despite there being loads of Decaff coffee sachets Only 1 packet of biscuits left too Over 300 for the night has to be borne in mind for this Waited for over 30 minutes to get served at the residents bar did not seem to be enough staff for the rush after a concert , Comfy bed and quiet clean room 
361552,Hilton London Wembley, Did not appear to cope particularly well with large number of guests attending concert at the nearby stadium Long queues to check in in the restaurant and bar Unfortunately on this occasion service was poor value for premium price , Very comfortable room particularly spacious bed Good location for nearby Wembley Stadium events Staff friendly and tried their best to help despite being under pressure from large number of guests staying at hotel 
361553,Hilton London Wembley, Staff allowed people to use the escalator up to the 3rd floor and hi jack the lifts on their way down to the ground floor preventing those waiting on the ground floor from getting to floors 4 and above , Location and accommodation great 
361554,Hilton London Wembley, The only window in our room looked out onto a wall which was very depressing No views at all The one room price was 595 for 3 which was a bit of a rip off The hotel was booked full because of the Billy Joel concert at Wembley and sense they up their prices when big events are next door , Staff were very helpful Bar snacks and breakfasts were excellent Discounted car parking very close by and location is great for Wembley stadium Rooms were clean and beds ok although hard for my liking
361555,Hilton London Wembley, Afternoon tea , Comfy bed Excellent location for Wembley Loved executive lounge but disappointed at limited choice of beverages Still great though Prosecco would have been a welcome addition Also afternoon tea could have been healthier with sandwiches loved breakfast choice and quality of food Delicious 
361556,Hilton London Wembley, Security , First night we went to N event met up with friends in Sky bar We were told to move to residents bar on level 3 Which we did my partner went to our room for about 10 mins to put phone on charge on return he was not allowed back in bar We were all escorted to our rooms and not allowed out This weather by external security firm Next day Hilton staff so apologetic And fabulous service over evening meal accompanied by complementary champagne 
361557,Hilton London Wembley, On the busy day of concert the hotel was in our view not staffed to cope anx therefore everything good about it and staff was undermined a real Shame as it meant the most fundamental levels of service were compromised, Location helpfulness of staff Good breakfast choice Good facilities
361558,Hilton London Wembley, The hotel was fully booked due to the concert at the stadium so there were queues to access the lifts to get up to your room and no easy access to any stairs as an aternative , The bed was very comfy and the pillows were amazing best night s sleep in a while 
361559,Hilton London Wembley, 350 per night and extra 16 each for breakfast Room looked out at a corrugated metal wall when I asked for a better view I was told we would have to pay more Restaurants couldn t cope with demand Food was poor quality Extra charge for wifi in room , Location
361560,Hilton London Wembley, There were the tiniest products in the bathroom so stingy for the price we had to pay and so insufficient for two people for two nights There was a serious lack of staff in the bar after an event and their lack of ability to do their job efficiently was obvious for all to see The cleanliness or lack of it in the corridors was poor there was a piece of plastic bag on our floor when we arrived and it was still there on the second day despite us seeing the cleaners on our floor both days The lack of attention to detail in laying the tables for breakfast no salt and pepper One morning my cup of tea looked like a cup of hot milk when the waitress poured it from a large just of tea, The breakfast was good and the location of the hotel was perfect for Wembley Arena and Stadium
361561,Hilton London Wembley, Balloons on bed and one slice of gateaux for my husbands 60th was appreciated but a bit sad A celebration bottle with two glasses would have been far more approriate , View of Wembley Stadium was fantastic Breakfast delicious with very attentive staff 
361562,Hilton London Wembley, Lenins are not changed We stayed for a total of 5 nights and I had a mushroom sauce spot on the inside of the duvet cover It was never changed and I did not ask for it to be changed because I wanted to see if they really change their lenins every 3 days as they promise I was disappoined unfortunately The floor has almost 100 rooms and the lifts are situated in one place only For our room it was a relatively long walk especially when we came back with shopping bags Make sure to ask for a room close to the lift if this is not convenient for you , Staff was nice They allowed us an early checkin and late checkout for no extra charge The location is wow You can see Wembly stadium for the restautant on form some rooms London Designer Outlet is literally next to the hotel Rooms are spacious 
361563,Hilton London Wembley, The drinks were a little expensive but it s only what you would expect from the chain My sister said that they closed the roof bar for a wedding which was a bit disappointing but i suppose it can t be helped , It wasn t actually myself that stayed here I booked it for my sister and her husband But she said that she really enjoyed herself 
361564,Hilton London Wembley, I thought the bar menu could have been better with more choices , I liked the location the cleanliness and the friendliness of the staff even though I didn t have breakfast I thought the price was superb had I have taken it one of my colleagues told me the breakfast was superb 
361565,Hilton London Wembley, Room not re dy at 3 00 pm so waited for 2hour and had access to exec suite for a few hours from 3 00 pm up to 9 00pm on a Saturday night closed toi early , Parking too expensive as you had to pay on average 10 for each exit and only 15 00 for 1 day if you did not leave the car park at all A royal rip off abd its not Mayfair 
361566,Hilton London Wembley, Would have liked more milk pots in the room There were only four for two people Could have requested more but it was late , Great size room with a very comfortable super king bed The room was also really quiet we couldn t hear anyone else at all Excellent breakfast and secure parking at Gold car park with reduced rate Brilliant location 
361567,Hilton London Wembley, The restaurant was pricey when travelling as a family However there are lots of more affordable restaurants nearby , The cleanliness and the friendly staff Great location for the arena stadium tube shops and restaurants The hotel breakfast was lovely with a great variety of food 
361568,Hilton London Wembley, Room service was bad not what was in menu Had to go without in rhe end Then they left the tray in the room with the food on all day 1 coffee satchel The carpet was not vacuumed Only 1 chair ,No Positive
361569,Hilton London Wembley, The wifi did not work correctly and was slow when it did work , Felt welcomed soon as we walked through the entrance very clean Was given complimentery bottle of wine to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary Will be returning next year Thank you hilton wembley
361570,Hilton London Wembley, It was a little further out from London Euston than we had imagine however it was each to reach on public transport We lots of shops and eateries just two minutes walk away , The welcome and service was impeccable from all staff Lovely room overlooking wembley thankyou for the free upgrade too Breakfast was gorgeous too something to suit all tastes 
361571,Hilton London Wembley, Room was not up to standard There were items left in mini bar fridge from last person which were a week out of date On leaving the reception tried to Bill me for the mini bar clearly this hasn t been restocked Shame as our overall stay was good , Location to the arena
361572,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Excellent choices at breakfast food lovely and fresh Rooms very spacious clean and that bed was so comfortable I didn t want to leave it Location ideal for Wembley stadium 
361573,Hilton London Wembley, We went to the pool at 8 30pm on a Sunday The changing room shower cubicles and pool area were covered in hair If appeared to have not been cleaned for a very long time Considering it was evening time we were shocked to find a group of children playing noisily with frisbees and unsupervised in the pool The water was disgusting with huge clumps of hair floating around so we headed off to the sauna to find that it was even more rank there I ve been to council community pools with a much higher standard of cleanliness My advice would be NOT to visit this hotel if it is for the pool sauna Everything else was great , The hotel lobby and restaurant bars were wonderful The bedroom was amazing Staff were friendly Perfect location less than a minutes walk from the arena discount shopping centre and restaurants 
361574,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing to dislike, Staff were excellent it was our Anniversary the bed was decorated with two swans made from towels there were red rose petals all over the bed There s was also cake with fresh fruit The bed was comfy the room was large clean the breakfast choice was brilliant The hotels Sky Bar provides fantastic views of the stadium 
361575,Hilton London Wembley, we checked in at 11 30pm we were behind two girls who insisted that they had a booking but were told they did not We had to wait 10 mins while one of the girls checked her phone for the booking The receptionist could have asked us to book in while she was doing it In the end I had to ask if we could book in before them , everything was like brand new
361576,Hilton London Wembley, I stayed on the 7th floor and it was very noisy I got no sleep until 3am because of a wedding reception in the hotel , Check out time and room facilities

361586,Hilton London Wembley, A rather large amount of children staying at the property and using the fitness centre swimming pool A separate pool for children to do as they please would be far superior , Possibly the best Hilton hotel resort to stay in Friendliness and efficiency of all staff services and facilities bars and restaurants within the property and all round value for money

361599,Hilton London Wembley, The receptionists asked if I wanted to pay to access the drinks in the room only to find the fridge was actually empty when we arrived, The breakfast was delicious and there was plenty to choose from
361600,Hilton London Wembley, It was a little difficult to find the hotel as there was no signage on the high road and the distance from the lift to the room was long, The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful and the location was perfect
361601,Hilton London Wembley, Would have like to have gone to the roof top bar but couldn t because of an avent , The modern rooms and the stunning lobby and bar and the fact we were able to check in earlier than the check in time

361608,Hilton London Wembley, Too few staff on duty at the bar when we got back from the show at 10pm , We stayed at this hotel as we were going to a show at SSE Arena and couldn t fault the location 
361609,Hilton London Wembley, Can t think of anything , Location was great for the SSE Arena Nearby restaurants were great and shopping on doorstep too Staff were fantastic and the room was one of the best we ve stayed in for years Thanks very much we ll be back again

361611,Hilton London Wembley, Weak WiFi reception in our room but reachable , Everything Staff were friendly and helpful Facilities were clean and organized Location was great in a quiet neighbourhood Overall was great 
361612,Hilton London Wembley, Stayed 2 nights both of which were interrupted by members of staff trying to get into our room when we were inside it sleeping We couldn t fathom why this kept happening to us and the receptionist seemed to be shocked however did nothing to sort the problem As a 7 month pregnant woman I was so afraid that me and my boyfriend were being stalked or targeted by someone creepy , Nice bathroom and room with a big comfy bed Enjoyed the size of the room too 
361613,Hilton London Wembley, The furnishings were not what I expected from a Hilton property The hallways to the room looked industrial with almost no pictures to brighten things up , The front desk staff and the bar staff were very friendly and helpful The one feature we did think was notable in our room was the small square area of the bathroom mirror that never fogged up after a shower 
361614,Hilton London Wembley, After checking in we experienced a power cut the lifts did not work and we couldn t get to our room for a while After a long journey all we wanted to do was order some room service but due to the power cut this was not possible The kitchen opening times were not extended , Location was good beds were comfortable and clean Bathroom was a good size Lots of wardrobe space 
361615,Hilton London Wembley, There was a number of weddings taking place when we stayed so we did not get a good sleep There was music playing and other guests were noisey, Polite staff and clean rooms 
361616,Hilton London Wembley, No view at all not even a sky one just metal of building very close to windows wish this had been stated as I would not have booked as open views are very important to us Cleanliness on first day was poor only one toilet roll and half used bottles of toiletries left and hardly any tea coffee or sugar so had to ask reception second day every thing very clean and fully supplied a bit random Mattress hard and uncomfortable Seat dirty first night Room getting a bit shabby Disabled Access 617 , Reception staff helpful Nice bathroom with white towels great shower and TV speakers for sound Pool and Gym V Good Quiet and air con good Relaxed atmosphere Situated in a great area good for shopping eating out and small supermarkets and Wembly Stadium steps away 
361617,Hilton London Wembley, The timings of the restaurant and bar were different all over and the bouncer to the sky bar was extremely rude , The stay was fabulous Breakfast was excellent there were a lot of things to choose from and everything was fresh and tasty I had a better nights sleep here than at home the pillows are just wonderful I d stay here every time I come to London 
361618,Hilton London Wembley, Miss information regarding opening times of the bar area a group of us went there to enjoy a last drink of the evening at 1240am to be told bar closed at 1230am this then meant we went out of hotel spending 60 pounds on cabs to find nothing only to be told when we woke to the hotel again they said we could have had the drinks for 2 reasons 1 we could have bought on our room tab and drunk them outside of the bar and secondly when I checked the hotel information the bar is supposed to be open till 1am Spoilt the evening for us all , Great location and really enjoyed the stay the hotel was very well set up and professional 
361619,Hilton London Wembley, Due to a football team staying we were moved out of the bar whilst enjoying a drink areas we were resting in several times This was not bought to our attention would happen when booking Also an old tray of dirty cutlery food was left by the previous room occupant and remained there all day evening we had to ask for it to be removed , Location was great 
361620,Hilton London Wembley, We booked a week before and ot was amazing Room was fantastic facilities were great We both enjoyed ourselves no end Would definitely book again, We booked a week before and had an amazing time Room was fant
361621,Hilton London Wembley, the food was disappointing 45 for a very ordinary buffet dinner that could be had in many pubs for a third of the price or less and with waitress service , Gorgeous bath towels lovely thick and soft and the duvet was sumptuous 
361622,Hilton London Wembley, The cleanliness was very disappointing there was stains on the pillows and duvet there was food in the corridors which was left there for hours this with the cleaners operating on this floor so they must of walked past this there was half eaten food in the fridge and the shower dripped for the price I paid I was very disappointed at the end of the day I booked a room at the Hilton the name should say it all but on my visit it did not I felt like booking somewhere else, the location was good as we had tickets For Wembley food was good as booked breakfast
361623,Hilton London Wembley, 20 minute plus queue to check in Grrrr 4 for a bottle of water in the room is a bit much given most hotels I stay in even on busines its complimentary , Location to the stadium 
361624,Hilton London Wembley, We were told over the phone that the pool closed at 18 00 so we didn t take out swimming things When we got there the sign said it didn t close until 22 00 Also after having a bath in the room the plug wouldn t work so we couldn t empty the bath water , The view was better than expected The bed was huge and very comfortable The way the staff handled the crowds when the football team were leaving the hotel 
361625,Hilton London Wembley, Room not ready till 4 45pm which really spoilt our plans to soak up the wembley atmosphere before the 5 15pm kick off We were told by reception we could use the executive lounge facilities which we had planned to after our 7 hour drive I booked and paid for an executive suite for that very reason so that we could have food and drink after our long journey But on trying to access the lounge we were told it was out of bounds till later but we could go to the Sky bar instead So we did but our supposed complimentary food and drink turned into a 40 bill for 2 beers 2 vodka and lemonades and 1 fish and chips I understand that there was a match on and players were still at the hotel but I would imagine a large amount of people book this hotel to watch various sporting events so it s not fair that I paid a lot of money for facilities I wasn t allowed to have On checkout I complained but the receptionist just shrugged and said at least your team won Had she validated my car park ticket for free I would have been quite pleased but no I still had to pay the car parking fee I accept things don t always work out but it s how businesses compensate their customers that sets them apart The Hilton offered nothing Not even an apology There s a lot of hotels close enough to the stadium so in future I will choose one of those , Location is superb for Wembley events
361626,Hilton London Wembley, The Guiness was lovely but the price was steep Must be the London prices Still had an enjoyable evening in the bar , For my son and I Having the Hotel close to the Stadium was brilliant Especially after watching the community Shield After a long day it was nice to have a shower and relax in the Hotel bar 
361627,Hilton London Wembley, Confusion as the Executive lounge was closed during the day and we were issued with a card for the Icons lounge but they would not accept it, Location and facilities Executive lounge very good and staff helpful
361628,Hilton London Wembley, We had to pay extra for breakfast however it was only 10 the range available was super fresh, Security was tight Only allowing residents into the hotel It was a match day they kept excellent control Staff were helpful We had forgotten our toothbrushes tgey were able to provide us with some All in all very accommodating comfortable stay 
361629,Hilton London Wembley, Check in was a joke should have had an executive room but told wouldn t be available until after 5 15 considering we had to be in Wembley stadium before that obviously this was unacceptable so we had to settle for a normal room no mini bar They kindly still allowed us entrance to executive lounge fab it was empty no canap s only soft drinks we had a ball NOT , Location is excellent 
361630,Hilton London Wembley, Having to pay for wifi Showers water wasn t hot enough neither much power The parking lots of roads closed around the hotel therefore hard to navigate to the car park Parking normally is 35 a night day light robbery get your ticket validated by reception will drop it down to 15 , Excellent location Warm welcome from a hunky receptionist called Daniel Clean large rooms
361631,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, The rooms were large bright and the beds were super comfortable There was a great atmosphere on Saturday due to the Liverpool team being guests in the hotel and our kids loved the excitement It s a great hotel if you re going to any event in Wembley stadium 
361632,Hilton London Wembley, Reason for the visit was to go to an event the hotel would not hold our bags for us the next day as a typical hotel does Our event didn t have the facilities to hold our bags we wasn t allowed to take our bags in So we travelled 3 hours and spent a night in London spent all this money for nothing All because the hotel wouldn t hold our bags ,No Positive
361633,Hilton London Wembley, The only thing I would have to say that really disappointed me was the bed During mine my friend s stay on 5th June 2015 the bed was like a dream one of those mattresses you lay down on just sink into However during this time around s stay the mattress was less than satisfactory extremely disappointing I sat down on the bed upon entering the room immediately noticed the difference as did my friend We both ended up not being able to sleep properly during our stay on 10th July 2016 due to not being able to get comfortable as the mattress was too hard to be able to get comfortable on we both ended up with our shoulders back hurting when we checked out the next day Please please change back to the mattress supplier you were using during 2015 , I absolutely loved the size of the room I love the fact also that there was a gym swimming pool to use at my leisure Good location within walking distance to the SSE Arena Wembley good connections to the tube 
361634,Hilton London Wembley, I think the pool area could be slightly updated or have nice pool lighting to match up to the standard of the rest of the hotel , The bed was so comfortable The hotel is modern and clean very nice all round and in a great location 
361635,Hilton London Wembley, Absolutely nothing , Could not have faulted our stay A friend and I travelled from Burton on Trent to watch a theatre show in London Searching for a hotel was hard due to the expense and they didn t look worth the money That was until we saw the Hilton and decided it was perfect We had to pay the extra to travel but it wasn t a problem Our stay was amazing and we ll worth the money My friend and I are single parents who work long hours so this was a major treat Thankyou so much to your staff 
361636,Hilton London Wembley, The staff are very rude and not very well spoken Over the 2 nights we had a member of housekeeping walts into our room about 3 times without even knocking This is out of order I will not be coming back there again, The bathroom Wasn t much more too like with such Un helpful staff 
361637,Hilton London Wembley, Being told by the barman that I was being awkward for sending back a beer that was absolutely rancid He didn t want to take it off the bill and continued to tell me that the beer was fine Luckily a fellow customer tasted the beer and agreed with my point This barman is a liability to your hotel I complained to the duty manager but he seemed indifferent Their loss Will never stay here again , Great meal in the restaurant In contrast to the bar the staff couldn t be nicer and the food was great 
361638,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast options were lacking Room service was poor nothimg was actually cleaned Absolutely dirty swimming and changing areas with no staff or lifeguard present Kids were diving and in the jacuzzi etc No notice of wedding events so we couldn t even use the sky bar the whole time we were there , Welcome at check in was good but is expected from Hilton
361639,Hilton London Wembley, Should be able to smoke on the bar balcony ended up going to a different pub due to not being able to smoke would have loved to have stayed there but we are smokers, Hotel was lovely staff very helpful 
361640,Hilton London Wembley, The wifi could should have been free in the room this is quite standard in hotels these days , The location was very convenient Room was quiet and bed was very comfortable 
361641,Hilton London Wembley, The Front desk staff response to simple enquiries She cut me off before I could get a word in , The breakfast It had a lot of variety to choose from 
361642,Hilton London Wembley, The sink was blocked really slow to drain despite its pretty bowl presentation I did mention this at check out and I m hoping it will be sorted for the next guest s , Beautiful room presentation with coffee and tea supplies Posh presentation very clean Bathroom mirror had a clear mirror despite steam in bathroom so I didn t need to wipe over for a clear view It was my boyfriend s birthday and the Hilton manager wrote us a Hilton birthday card How cool is that Thank you 
361643,Hilton London Wembley, The bed was a little hard There was no free water in the room 1 bottle was 3 95 very expensive , Nice modern hotel with easy access large beds and clean rooms
361644,Hilton London Wembley, You have to pay 50 to use the minibar to cool your things These 50 are refundable but still it is annoying specialy when the minibar is already empty so i didnt get the point of this Also when we reached the hotel no one helped us in moving our bags to the room, Big room nice room
361645,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast included for that price , The biggest and most comfortable bed I ve ever stayed in The bathroom was also amazing and the location was perfect as we went for the Beyonce concert 
361646,Hilton London Wembley, I was given a room with disabled access and facilites it felt a little cramped and the bathroom was obviously not as pictured as there was no disabled bathroom in the photos , Breakfast and hotel location and facilities were excellent If you walk the right direction which I didn t on the first day it is walking distance from the station on a pedestrian walkway 
361647,Hilton London Wembley, The room was so hot and air conditioning didn t appear to be working Also noise buzzing in bathroom disturbing, Couldn t fault breakfast and comfy beds Very clean too 
361648,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Our overnight stay was excellent The staff were exceptional from reception to the excecutive lounge Breakfast was a lovely surprise as the variety and amount on offer was amazing we also had afternoon tea and drinks throughout our stay My first thoughts on booking was that I may have paid a little to much for our overnight stay but when you added up the lovely breakfast afternoon tea and beverages throughout our stay we were quids in My only disappoint we did not have time to stay longer but we will be back 
361649,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast was average and some of the teapots plates and cutlery were dirty which was a bit shocking The juices were not fresh and not a lot of variety when it came to the food Staff were not that pleasant The bathroom in the room was below average and not very clean Housekeeping didn t do a good job at all The corridors had a musty smell , The location was awesome The hotel seemed nice modern

361684,Hilton London Wembley, Never again The Hilton had a event on during my stay the music was so loud I could feel the vibrations through the floor Having specifically requested a quiet room I really didn t appreciate being kept awake until the early hours of the morning In addition the staff within the executive lounge were incredibly rude and uninviting Had I turned up in a business suit I m sure i d of got a different reception but as myself and my husband arrive for breakfast we had the door firmly closed in our faces by the lounge manager , Nothing
361685,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast should be included as with Holiday Inn I walk with a stick I was given a disabled room which I did not ask for I would have preferred a bath Not disabled shower , Clean well designed room Comfortable bed
361686,Hilton London Wembley, At check out on the 9th of July the lady at the front desk was either new on the job racist or just rude and unhelpful Thank goodness for the guy who did a fine job I asked for an additional hour for check out just to do some last minute shopping behind the hotel and she bluntly refused I had stayed more than 5 times T this hotel and never received that kind of treatment , Everything else

361691,Hilton London Wembley, I thought the hotel was over priced based on the fact the room was really quiet basic I really disliked the fact I couldn t open a small window a notch to allow some fresh air to circulate on a hotter day The majority of the channels on the television wouldn t connect and I think for the 294 I paid I was a little down on a day that has cost me a lot of money for a break away for get away It s a shame as I would have loved to come back and have a better room on a later date The breakfast did deserve crest as it was delicious 5 , I loved how the Hilton
361692,Hilton London Wembley, A little more coffee sachets and milk in the room would have been helpful and I thought having to pay for the bottle of water in the room was excessive, Location Friendliness of staff Breakfast Excellent choice and relaxed but good service

361716,Hilton London Wembley, The food and drinks could have been cheaper in the hotel but it is London , Really friendly staff very clean room and bathroom And super huge and comfy bed 
361717,Hilton London Wembley, Some of the wallpaper in the rooms was flaky and some of the paint had been scratched off the walls Paid wifi was expensive and therefore didn t use it although being from the UK this wasn t a problem , The bedrooms were a good size Bathroom decoration was nice looked clean and sleek 
361718,Hilton London Wembley, For the price that was paid I would have expected a complimentary bottle of water, My parents are aged and have limited experience of staying in hotels What I liked about the hotel was that they were able to find their way around and communicate with the staff easily Breakfast quality and variety was to the standard that I expected Rooms were very comfortable easy to work your way around use the bathroom facilities TV Radio etc

361720,Hilton London Wembley, You were unable to put anything in the fridge as you had to pay 5 I think for this to be open for the mini bar We simply wanted to put our drink in there to keep cool The room was basic for the price we paid Also to charge 3 95 for a bottle of water was very overpriced , The bed was lovely and comfy along with the pillows The location was fantastic
361721,Hilton London Wembley, More information on events being held in the Sky Bar for example to be given and other things happening in hotel A map would help too , Comfortable clean room Easy parking with decent discount Literally on the doorstep of Wembley stadium And decent mirrors to get ready in Checked in 3 hours earlier than usual time

361726,Hilton London Wembley, There is nothing we could fault , The location is perfect for Wembley Stadium right next door Rooms were very clean and spacious and staff were very pleasant 
361727,Hilton London Wembley, The bed was hard so was the pillows the air con was very noisie there was a big brown stain on the carpet as soon as you walked into the room which did not impress me as they say first impressions do count It was meant to be a Deluxe room , Very close to the venu we was going to the view was very good 
361728,Hilton London Wembley, Watch out at the bar as they automatically add a service charge on without asking One of those hotels where you just can t get cool enough , Hotel was lovely great location if you are going to Wembley price hiked up because we were going to a concert more than double so value for money not great 
361729,Hilton London Wembley, Maybe a little more support for the minimal bar staff after the concert but that is just a minor issue in my opinion, Wonderful experience We stayed at a busy time as there was a Coldplay concert on but everything was still taken care of really well 
361730,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast was very disappointing Hot food was all gone and had to wait half an hour for more Totally unacceptable from a hotel of this calibre, We enjoyed the executive lounge and the swimming pool

361735,Hilton London Wembley, I would have expected a better stocked hospitality tray and also complimentary water Picky I may be but would have least expected biscuits on the tray and and more teabags etc Also think having to pay 3 95 for the bottle of water is extortionate even at London prices Also as we were only staying one night I would have expected that housekeeping would have known this and would not have expected them knocking on the door before 9 am to clean it seeing we had room until 12 noon check out Organisation at breakfast could be a little better having to constantly ask for tea coffee clean cutlery etc shouldn t have to happen, Location was excellent for attending Wembley Stadium Beds were comfortable and room generally clean and tidy Check in and out was very quick and staff very helpful Great to have car park on the door step and a big plus was the cheaper parking rates at 15 better than the 85 if you don t get the ticket validated

361741,Hilton London Wembley, expensive for a night at capacity struggled to cope with numbers staying as bar overrun with people and queues of people just to get into lift to the bars room service very slow as a result too Expensive for a night even had to pay for water Only one tea bag a couple One pack of biscuits a couple Stingy comes to mind , Right next to Wembley stadium Staff attentive Good breakfast 
361742,Hilton London Wembley, Only thing to spoil my stay was the alarm going off at night and having to vacate the building but this can t be helped , Staff friendly and helpful Excellent facilities and room Wonderful breakfast Couldn t ask for more Would certainly visit again 
361743,Hilton London Wembley, For amount of money we paid for a executive room It certainly wasn t value for money Was looking forward to going to the sky bar after a gig at Wembley But couldn t get in because they let so many non residents in The queue was out the main reception and you could only go up in one lift We also had to queue to get in the other bar they wouldn t let us charge our drinks to the room Although location was excellent I would not stay there again,No Positive

361749,Hilton London Wembley, The rooms were quite poor and basic considering price of room and also check in time after early request House keeping had the room for over 2 hours and still had to call for a change in bedding due to dirty marks on duvet Better value at premier inn and rooms almost identical, The lobby looked fantastic
361750,Hilton London Wembley, Breakfast should be included in the price of the rooms , The bedroom and especially the bed was fantastic absolutely huge could fit at least 3 and a small child in the bed we had Excellent location for Wembley right on doorstep I left a pair of shoes which they posted back to me 
361751,Hilton London Wembley, There is no fair system of obtaining service at the bar when it is busy The bar staff look at whoever is in front of them rather than asking who is next I would really prefer to stand in a queue and wait my turn in a fair way Its unfortunate that the public display their ignorance and continue to selfishly push in Needless to say I left and spent my money in another establishment , Close proximity to Wembley arena Secure gold parking at a reduced rate when staying in hotel

361790,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing really springs to mind other than a pet irritation at not providing a complimentary 40p bottle of water in a 125 room simple psychology chaps we would pay 130 and you could provide 2 and make a profit and we would feel like you had made s real effort on our behalf , Close to tube and only short time to Central London Comfy bed and all room appliances worked correctly Small but good gym pool spa facility Modern recently built building

361859,Hilton London Wembley, We have not had a fridge in the room remotely locked by reception before and given that our fresh milk for early morning tea was inside was a little annoying Also there was no toilet brush surely a requirement for every bathroom , The room was comfortable well planned with an attractive bathroom It was spacious and well lit 
361860,Hilton London Wembley, The staff attitude and aptitude in the bar and restaurant at times left a lot to be desired 1 or 2 were very good but on balance getting their attention or even some cutlery seemed to be too much to ask ,No Positive

361865,Hilton London Wembley, Staff very slow to take dinner order Too few bar staff for after gig drinks so long waiting time , Good rooms and decent pool Great for Wembley Arena and designer shops Food excellent
361866,Hilton London Wembley, Disappointed that the night manager seemed to target our group which ultimately spoiled our evening After being alerted that our music was too loud out of respect for other guests of the hotel we turned the music off not down The night staff deemed it necessary to continuously patrol on the floor we were staying on Inevitably the next knock at the door came and we were told that if we didn t go back to our own rooms we would have to find alternative accommodation As a group we knew we had kept the noise levels down to a minimum and even the people who were in the next room came out to say the only persons voice they could hear was that of the night manager I proceeded to ask if there had been another complaint about the level of noise coming from from the room which the night manager responded I don t have to answer that As a result our party decided it would be in everybody s best interest if we went back to our rooms After all we didn t want to be paying a rate of 165 per night with no bed to sleep on which was what we were threatened with Spoiled what is our only weekend away of the year Apart from that the hotel is in a great location and majority of the staff are very welcoming , Facilities staff on arrival and hotel on the whole was fantastic 
361867,Hilton London Wembley, Mouldy grapes in the mini bar left by another guest left an unpleasant smell in the room but was swiftly sorted once room service was called, It was quiet in our room heard no noise from the hotel or other guests doors banging

361870,Hilton London Wembley, I stayed at the Hilton Wembley with my girlfriend several times and enjoyed my stay This time it was on Valentine s Day of this year It was also the first time I have made a request with them Which was a simple one for a bottle of wine and some chocolates to be in our room up arrival Despite emailing them twice this request was not only denied but it was also completely ignored So I arrived unsure of whether this day would be made that bit more special for my girlfriend and I This was not an extravagant request and had been granted upon staying at other hotels such as Novotel Wembley on other special occasions However the least I would expect would be the decency of a reply from staff In the morning we were woken with a ridiculously loud message on the speaker warning us that a situation was in progress and we should wait for further announcements This continued for approximately 10 minutes without anything else being said until another message came up advising us it was safe to return to the hotel reception I am not sure what the problem may have been but as a matter of safety and judging by the last message given it could ve potentially been serious Therefore I believe all guests should have been told to stay in their rooms and wait for further announcements Due to our experience at this stay I believe The Hilton failed to meet the high standards they claim to have and in doing so have lost a loyal guest I can not express my disappoint any more , The room was of the normal high standard the Hilton are known for but that was about the only pleasant experience during our stay 
361871,Hilton London Wembley, Service in Icons bar was very poor Staff were slow and overwhelmed even when not busy Tables not cleared and bar cluttered with used plates and glasses Not very inviting Bar food average , Clean room and great location for venue Polite staff 
361872,Hilton London Wembley, On arrival we were greeted kindly and reassured the wait for reception would be as short as possible by the concierge however as he then directed us to a free receptionist another traveler obviously with little manners walked straight into the Hotel and up to the desk we again waited for a free assistant the concierge again offered us forward the receptionist then answered the phone and we had to wait a while longer I find this extremely rude and unprofessional and believe that a physically present human being should always without exception be dealt with first and foremost , The location was perfect for our stay and the Hotel was lovely and modern we had two perfectly nice nights sleep in a very comfy bed 
361873,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Check in was 3pm but we arrived at 12 30pm to find our room all ready and waiting The staff were very helpful As we were attending Wembley arena for a concert which was straight across the road was fantastic If we were to attend another concert or for the football I would be booking this hotel again

361876,Hilton London Wembley, Personally I found the bed and pillows uncomfortable but then there is nothing like your own bed , We were a group of friends staying as we were going to the Strictly Tour at the SSE Arena which is right opposite the hotel staff extremely helpful friendly Rooms very nice clean and we were able to get into our rooms earlier than the normal check in time Breakfast was very good every possible option was catered for 
361877,Hilton London Wembley, Table booked at Icon Restaurant and meal failed to show up after waiting 1 hour had to leave to get to show on time next door at Wembly Arena One restaurant and one bar closed No explaination given by hotel,No Positive
361878,Hilton London Wembley, Seems severely understaffed long waits for service at reception bar Food service seemed non existent Eventually gave up on getting room service at 10 50pm and went out to McDonalds Stuffy bedroom, Staff friendly Room very clean Great location Excellent coffee
361879,Hilton London Wembley, The Hotel seemed as though they were under staffed to the amount of staff they had last year I had requested if it was possible a room close to the lifts and I had an email confirming my request but when we arrived the only way to do this was to put a single bed into a double room which was close to the lifts but then we would have had less space to move around so sadly we had to decline The family guest room which we were booked into was too FAR away from the lifts and there isn t a family room close to the lifts so it was hard work as myself and my mum are disabled and we really struggled getting to and from and ended up having Room service for all of us as it was too far for us to walk The quality of the room service food was of a very disappointing standard especially for the price and we couldnt eat it where as last year we couldn t complain about the room service food Also the room cards didn t work when we got to our room and I had to find a telephone to ring reception and wait for another card to be brought up to us I Think that it is wrong that my HHonours from last year does not count as I didn t book straight through the Hotel but surely IF YOU HAVE PAID AND STAYED IN THE HOTEL THEN YOU DESERVE TO HAVE THE RECCOGNITION WHETHER IT IS BOOKED DIRECTLY OR NOT , The hotel is situated brilliantly for Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena the staff were friendly and seemed to mean it when greeting you etc and they didn t just seem like they were Robots saying the same sentence to everyone The cleanliness was fantastic and the room was nice and spacious which was great 
361880,Hilton London Wembley, The evening meal service pre show was poor The front of house did their best but the food couldn t come quick enough As soon as we ordered we were told it d be a 20 25 min wait This was 15mins after the resaurant opened Took 40 mins for our food to arrive Other tables never recieved their food in time Given the location I was expecting a service geared towards guests attending events at the arena or stadium When the food did arrive it was excellent but there was obviously a staffing capacity issue , Location room breakfast were great Staff were friendly and helpful 
361881,Hilton London Wembley, The biscuits in the room all contained nuts being someone who has a nut allergy this is not accounted for Maybe a choice is something that could be looked into , Breakfast was amazing service friendly couldn t fault it
361882,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast is poor The eggs were packet eggs the bacon very fatty and cheap and it was very disappointing , Icon bar was really relaxed and just what we were looking for for a pre show drink Location is beyond excellent and the staff were lovely 
361883,Hilton London Wembley, I am nitpicking but our view from the room wasn t fantastic Our room was a bit far from the ice machine and lifts and It is a little far from Wembley station None of those things would deter me from staying there again though , Really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Room was great and was really close to restaurants Would definitely stay again 
361884,Hilton London Wembley, Wish we could have opened a window , Third time staying here definitely recommended Lovely clean modern hotel in nice location right beside a good selection of shops and restaurants Short walk to tube station too 
361885,Hilton London Wembley, Bathroom was not as clean as expected from a 5 hotel Toilet had urine stain on seat Would be great if bathroom slippers were provided, Friendly staff great breakfast very comfortable room 
361886,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing to not like, VERY GOOD LOCATION FOR PARKING AND GETTING INTO LONDON EXCELLENT ROOM AND REALY HELPFUL STAFF GOOD VALUE WE WILL MAKE MORE USE OF THE LEISURE FACILITIES NEXT TIME 
361887,Hilton London Wembley, The staff at the fitness centre swimming pool part were quite rude I bought a nose clip from there and the woman who served me took my card to use in the machine and tapped it on the card machine thinking it was contactless without asking my permission Then when I left my towel on the table by the swimming pool by accident and let the staff know I said sorry and I said I hope that s not too bad and very rudely a woman replied of course its a problem but I will deal with it So I did not like the attitude of the staff , The bed was very big and very comfy which made the stay comfortable The use of the swimming pool sauna and steam room for free was also very good 
361888,Hilton London Wembley, Swimming pool is dirty and some rooms have no view at all Sometimes price is super expensive to stay , Staff are friendly rooms are very clean Great location to stay Facilities in room are brilliant

361892,Hilton London Wembley, 1 Safe in room wasn t working 2 Very poor slow service in the Legends bar at one point there were people waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be served and there was only one barman present around midnight Also as reported to hotel management there were some very dodgy practices going on especially by one bar man I have the name and time of this on receipt that is adding 10 service charge automatically and then not explaining why it was being added nor giving the opportunity for it to be removed even though it should be discretionary Further he rounded up the bill so he said that s 8 50 gave change of 1 50 when the bill said 8 25 in other words a nice little earner for him if he did that each time throughout the night , The location is fantastic for events at the Stadium and Arena Easy access into Central London Service by majority of the staff there was very good 
361893,Hilton London Wembley, However I did ask for a chocolate on my pillow as special request to my MD s to get me in the good books But you didn t Daymmmm, I was in breakfast heaven The sausages were fantastic 2 types of bacon black pudding AND Nutella muffin We went on a conference meeting and the staff were fantastic I was never without bottled water
361894,Hilton London Wembley, The shower head was leaking at the seal where it attaches to the hose so the pressure was down Also the gym was abit small and struggled to get on a machine in the morning , liked the room bed really comfy 
361895,Hilton London Wembley, Price is steep considering no breakfast included Parking is extra and no information was given by staff Drinks in bar are expensive, Location very close to SSE arena Wembley arena restaurants Large rooms beds
361896,Hilton London Wembley, The room wasn t clean got a ticket from parking in bay where reception confirmed I could sorted out by Hilton in the end Staff where helpful but ONLY after I raised my displeasure, The hotel is ideally located to the area a stadium and outlet stores
361897,Hilton London Wembley, Public areas were overcrowded with non staying people waiting for taxis after event at sse arena No seats available at the icons grill for food or drink was like being in a rowdy club Restaurant was at capacity and room service was severely overpriced at 8 ish for a hot sandwich 5 50 for a glass of wine and then a 5 tray charge Especially steep when room service is the only option STAFF ARE ALL OUTSTANDING X, The staff were lovely nothing was too much trouble
361898,Hilton London Wembley, Booking com told me total price was 164 On arrival Hilton staff charged me 204 However with a late arrival and going to see a show I payed Morning after spent an hour trying to sort out why I was charged more eventually was told the difference would be reimbursed Missed out on a few hours sight seeing Was not and still not pleased with service , Rooms were very spacious view was nice and in brilliant location 
361899,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Exec room with lounge access was definitely worth the extra money Perfect location opposite the SSE Arena and parking 15 when ticket validated on check out
361900,Hilton London Wembley, The minibar was empty the surfaces in our room were covered in dust the bed was possibly harder than concrete and I spent the weekend with a bad back because of it , Location was very good right next to the SSE arena which was the purpose of the trip Staff were very helpful and friendly 
361901,Hilton London Wembley, location it was too far away from London central and there weren t so many things to see around either than Wembley Stadium the operator was often busy on the line I had to call more than 3 or 4 times just for a simple information question I felt like the receptionist was a bit too lazy to provide me with some information about London as it was my first time visiting I really needed bit of information for sight seeing etc she told me to get a brochure by myself and eventually I gained no information from her during our stay there was a christmas eve party Due to the noise I couldn t sleep so I set in the lobby around 3am where I found 2 drunk girls disturbing me I think that the hotel should also consider other guests by not holding a loud noisy and unpleasant event , Most staff members were nice but it would ve been better if every staff were greeting with a smile and make us feel more welcomed and comfortable
361902,Hilton London Wembley, Had to change rooms as there was no hot water in my room the showers was not functioning correctly should have offered me a free meal or something for the inconvenience, Hotel was modern and clean as well as being well equiped
361903,Hilton London Wembley, The front staff were not nice and very unhelpful at the front desk They demanded we paid straight away and said that is their policy the year before that was not the case The food in the executive lounge was not as good as last year Last year they had really nice Indian treats , The hotel was nice and clean Most of the staff were very accommodating and welcoming The Christmas dinner was nice but the year before we had lovely decorations on the table which we did not have this Christmas The bell boy was a star we wanted to be near to our family and he arranged it when the front desk tried be very difficult in making the changes The bell boy persued on our behalf and we got upgraded to a suite This bellboy should be the manager he knows how to keep people happy especially at Christmas I wanted to see him again to find out his name so I could commend him to his manager 
361904,Hilton London Wembley, The hotel had a huge number of Underground workers and their families staying men were working on Xmas Day families crowded around reception area chatting making it difficult for guests to check in Porter spent whole time looking at mobile while I struggled with bags Manager apologised ,No Positive
361905,Hilton London Wembley, Perhaps a faster more efficient service upon checking in Very disorganised and the relentless questions from the staff 25 minutes to check in Hardly any reception staff , The location and comfort of the hotel
361906,Hilton London Wembley, Felt a little cold attention to customer service would be beneficial on arrival and departure room generally tidy but attention to detail as dust and hairs visible Otherwise all fine , Easy access to local venue Room was a good size bed comfortable general facilities in room good 
361907,Hilton London Wembley, In the restaurant on level 3 the Icons bar and the Executive Lounge it was very cold and draughty The heating was difficult to control in the bedroom It was either too hot or too cold , The executive room was very well designed and actually had a mirror above the dressing table and plugs for my hairdryer The bathroom was well designed also The shower was very good 
361908,Hilton London Wembley, The cost of parking in the area If you are taking your car in and out of the recommended car park the hotel has no reduced price deal The result is a cost of a mere 5 an hour , Good well equipped room with a great view 
361909,Hilton London Wembley, Was advised room service does not serve hot snacks meals like burger and fries and there was no hot chocolate in the room which I thought would have been standard Also bedside cabinet was a bit sticky , Nice comfy big bed Stadium view Close to Macdonalds which was a Godsend something hot to eat 
361910,Hilton London Wembley, Couldn t make tea or coffee as the uht milk tasted off, Friendly helpful staff Room was clean and had everything we needed Bed was so comfortable Perfect for Wembley arena as literally next door 
361911,Hilton London Wembley, The service at dinner was very poor we only had one course in the end, It was fabulous The breakfast and dinner was delicious Having Andre Rieu and his JSO there at the same time was awesome I forgot my skirt there and it was kindly posted to me 
361912,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Immediately next to the vicinity of Wembley arena Especially with the poor weather and my elderly mother who cannot walk far The staff upgraded us to a better room and had the beds changed from a double to twins immediately Exceptionally friendly and helpful 
361913,Hilton London Wembley, The fact that the room we had only had a view of a wall wasn t so great and the fact that neither of us could get any kind of phone signal from inside the room was exceptionally bad If we wanted to make phone calls we had to go out of the hotel In addition we ordered room service one night after leaving a concert at the arena and when the waiter delivered it he noticed that we had a map of the tube open on our laptop Spotting this he said Oh you re figuring out where to put the bomb Cue the blank stares However the rest of the staff we met and interacted with were generally quite pleasant , Ease of accessing the free wi fi was really good as was the turn down of the room on a daily basis There was always stocks of tea biscuits and bathroom products in the room as well The close proximity to the arena and the stadium was really beneficial for us and not only that but the place is also close enough to a few shops and restaurants so everything we needed was close enough by 
361914,Hilton London Wembley, Issues with the bellboy refusing to help with my luggage as he was Too busy swiftly Dealt with by reception Beautiful room great bathroom only gripe was broken shower wall unit which meant I couldn t adjust the height very simple should have been noticed by cleaners and dealt with beforehand i was only staying for one night so didn t want to be bothered by repairs in the room No big issue a great hotel, Breakfast was great loads of choice Very tasty Gym staff were helpful and the equipment was of high standard A little pricey but would stay again 
361915,Hilton London Wembley, Not enough staff on in the bar area had to wait a long time for our snacks Bathroom in our room was very smelly on arrival had an unclean odour to it Food and drinks were very expensive Not enough options for a vegan diet , Hotel and staff were excellent Location perfect for venue 
361916,Hilton London Wembley, Poor facilities in the executive lounge Very slow bar staff in the bar waited half hour for a drink , Good location for our trip Friendly staff at check in 
361917,Hilton London Wembley, I didn t like the parking arrangement the cost of parking and the cost of doing anything in the hotel like eating Definitely for corporates with big budgets Not consultants who pay for their own expenses , It was clean and the facilities were good 
361918,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, We stayed here as part of my girlfriends birthday weekend and I also proposed to her The staff were more than helpful and helped with the surprise absolutely brilliant 
361919,Hilton London Wembley, Tv channels need sorting out reinstalling and the shower kept going from hot to cold at times , Great price huge comfortable bed and beautiful room with great facilities in the hotel 
361920,Hilton London Wembley, Unhelpful male Manager on the front desk during check in and ignored me when there was a problem with my key card on a separate occasion Poor lazy attitude overall There were Several other problems including being removed from my room and downgraded to a shabby room twice by the same male Manager Rooms smelt damp because you can t open the windows and generally unclean unless you complain To date never been refunded for a forthcoming four night stay from 29 Jan 2016 even though a refund had been requested and submitted to the Director of Operations because of past poor service during several previous stays Never Again I recently checked into a local hotel and guess what Not a single bottle of free alcohol on offer Apparently one local hotel stole the entire shipload in order to keep disgruntled guests happy So I m told , Location
361921,Hilton London Wembley, First we ask for a double king bed and we got two small beds we asked for a upper floor but got the lowest floor food in the bar not too tasty the menu in the room is nice but the one in the bar very poor choice and the food not so tasty they advertise a sky bar but is never open the pool small and dirty Except reception every department in special bar have short and unexperience staff The New Year party was the worst we wait at the bar at least 45 min for every drink and managers just standing at the end of the bar not helping or organising anything bathroom disgusting photto to prove Never again going back , The hotel was in good location looks very nice and modern
361922,Hilton London Wembley, no batteries in remote trays of food left in corridors quite some time it took me almost 10 min on the phone to find out the name of the closest tube station , very helpful friendly staff
361923,Hilton London Wembley, I have made it somewhat of a tradition to stay here around the time of my lady s birthday which is also close to our anniversary This is the third time we have stayed and we always look forward to a beautiful dinner served in the beautiful restaurant facility that the building has This time however we were sorely displeased to be dining in the bar opposite as it lacked the atmosphere of romance that initially made us fall in love with staying and dining at Hilton Wembley , As it was a birthday treat for my other half I requested some birthday cake and we arrived to see it waiting on the desk That was very pleasant and appreciated
361924,Hilton London Wembley, Everything from the slow check in to the noises outside the bedroom to the loud cleaners down to the equally slow check out Why are they a four star rated hotel charging rates they can t support and deliver in customer service standards No conventional class about the hotel Cheap and tacky place selling rooms with disgusting views unless you are fortunate to get a stadium view room Mislead by online photos Never again , Nothing stands out 
361925,Hilton London Wembley, Rooms were unclean apology followed by some fat manager who just nodded at our complaints the sort you just want to head butt because he really doesn t care but sent to offer you a menu of insincere apologies plus four bottles of wine in the hope you get drunk and stop bothering him Morning scrambled eggs looked like snot two days running in executive lounge Ripe off Frustrating time overall , Location
361926,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing great beyond the lobby lights That s as good as it got all downhill from the lifts upwards Three parties over the course of the stay made the place unsuitable plus told to vacate room second night into the stay happens all the time I was told and placed in an inferior room with no compensation to date Director of Operations was useless to date beyond saying he was sorry Got offered cheap nasty wine Standard by the looks of it and kept on standby for such musical room moments Awful room views Depressing time , Bright and shinny lights in lobby 
361927,Hilton London Wembley, Oversized bloke with oversized glasses who was upon check in Rude lazy bored disinterested looking and unhelpful front desk male manager The type that clocks in and clocks out for his shift and just simply turns up to work to collect his pay cheque each month and knows he will never be fired from his cosy job but just getting by with doing the minimum by the looks of it The clip board idiot Poor customer service ,No Positive
361928,Hilton London Wembley, Bed was a little bit hard Staffs were kind but there should have been someone who directly takes care of customer s needs When I requested to search for my lost stuff it took much longer time to solve it because they just asked to someone involved in house keeping and relied on the answers If the staffs initially went to the room and search it directly the lost stuffs would have been easily found , Executive lounge has good selection of quality foods Complimentary breakfast has limited range compared to buffet breakfast in 3rd floors But it was quite enough to start a day In the evening from 18 00 evening snacks and drinks are served which is quite enough to have a dinner One bedroom suite was very clean and has modern design Sauna and steam room was also good 
361929,Hilton London Wembley, The spa facilities were quite basic and could of been better The pool was cold not heated , The hotel was lovely and clean Very modern and stylish and finished to a high standard The staff were lovely and friendly 
361930,Hilton London Wembley, had to change rooms because no hotter it was defective shower Staff just say yes but do not always understand seems a bit of a cultural language issue, Most everything
361931,Hilton London Wembley, Not having free internet in our room , We liked every thing about our stay specially the executive lounge but free internet with the executive suite booking would have been the icing on the cake 
361932,Hilton London Wembley, Christmas dinner was a flop I ordered braised lamb Couldn t eat it as it was tasteless A real disappointment as this was the main reason for our stay , Location was good hotel clean room large staff helpful Great experience having a sauna and steam 
361933,Hilton London Wembley, The room where we stayed was very noise upstairs for the two nights and part of the ceiling near the door fell off on us and then there were no water for a couple of hours I got the room on a deal and was very upset to see that if I had paid full price i would ve asked for a refund , The executive lounge 
361934,Hilton London Wembley, How can you possibly think it is appropriate to allow a private function on top floor to have loud music heard throughout the hotel until 2am And on Christmas morning Other than that our stay was what we needed and loved , Courteous and helpful staff especially Daiva at restaurant
361935,Hilton London Wembley, For the first time since I have been staying at the hotel the service in the Ambassador restaurant was extremely slow this did not effecte me as I had booked an early dinner so had plenty of time others did not Maybe staff off sick at last moment can happen anywhere, Convenience to where I was going Ease of booking in and out Choices for food and drinks and where to have them and most important comfortable beds 
361936,Hilton London Wembley, The rooms bar and the restaurant for dinner were pricey , Well run clean hotel with friendly staff Excellent breakfast buffet The breakfast was good value
361937,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, I didn t realise until I arrived that I had been upgraded to an executive room which included breakfast my initial booking was for a standard room without meals so it was a lovely surprise
361938,Hilton London Wembley, Very minor bathroom vanity top not been cleaned , Quality of acommodation room fittings and facilities all excellent also hotel situated so close to venues perfect 
361939,Hilton London Wembley, Only two problems with this hotel 1 The rooms air conditioning in the bedroom would not go below 18 degrees c making it excessively hot to try and sleep in but the worse thing was the bar In the hour and a half we were in there it took 20 minutes to get a drink The staff used their hands to add lemon or lime to the drinks When spirits were measured they tipped most of the drink over their fingers Beer glasses were upturned and stacked on the drip trays prior to being filled so they were contaminated around the rim None of the staff ever washed their hands No second sink for tap water so this also was cross contaminated with general grime and rubbish Orders were wrong constantly with at least 3 couples complaining to the manager in the time we were there Bottle tops were thrown on the floor making a serious slipping hazard for the staff all of which had a serious lack of understanding of English For a four star hotel it was disgusting which is why we chose not to eat there Oh and at some point the beer prices went up by a 0 50 a pint for no reason , Bedroom was big and comfy Great location for Wembley 
361940,Hilton London Wembley, The cleanliness lacked thereof There was a tray and plate left outside a room on the corridor for at least 10 hours and when we had breakfast there was many tables that needed clearing and cleaning which I would expect immediately considering how much customers pay for the stay and services at the hotel , The service we received was excellent the breakfast was nice 
361941,Hilton London Wembley, Coffee really bad Hotel hot and stuffy Long wait to check in Wifi not good in room Only got one biscuit and 2 sachets of coffee in room , Clean and comfortable good location for Wembley arena 
361942,Hilton London Wembley, Someone had left an opened tub of pomegranate in the fridge Judging by the sell by date of a month before our stay it could have been there some time Maybe it was a gift off the Hotel had been frozen prior to our arrival We didn t take that chance At the bar a beer with a wine soda 16 50 only 5 64 at the nearby Torch pub , The location of the hotel is approximately 20 paces from the SSE Arena door to door where we came for a music event It is also within a stone s throw of the Stadium This may sound like it could be a negative but in no way did it have any adverse effect on our experience inside the hotel 
361943,Hilton London Wembley, Our shower head was broken loose Paying for water was terrible concidering the price i paid for the room , The staff were excellent and the hotel beautiful
361944,Hilton London Wembley, Only thing I can comment on is some sort of air con possibly noise which was a little annoying But wasn t that bad as we didn t investigate it to see if we could change it , Fast efficient friendly check in plus facilities for express checkout in the morning which was handy 
361945,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing to fault , The hotel was very clean the rooms were nice and big and the staff were very friendly The hotel was in the perfect location for the Wembley Arena Fantastic hotel 
361946,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Lovely room good size enormous bed cannot fault it Gorgeous selection at breakfast eggs made to order great coffee Had a nice little swim in the pool steam and sauna to follow Literally next to Wembley Arena so THE perfect place to stay if you re going to a gig which we were 
361947,Hilton London Wembley,No Negative, Staff were very helpful especially the concierge who s name unfortunately has slipped my mind He was very helpful and went out of his way to sort an error with my friends parking fee 
361948,Hilton London Wembley, No hairdryer thought this was standard Breakfast was excellent but only downfall was a family with 2 young children that they couldn t control Running around screaming not good, Rooms were spacious and clean Even had a clock in room which is fab 
361949,Hilton London Wembley, I paid 126 for the room which I d booked in November I am aware that the earlier you book the better value you get but I do think that this was a little pricey for just a one night stay also for this price I felt it should have included a free breakfast The only other minor gripe I have was that the free WiFi was complicated to access , The staff were extremely friendly the hotel is located in a perfect place for events at Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena and is a short walk less than 10 mins from Wembley Park Tube station 
361950,Hilton London Wembley, Wedding at the hilton had loud music until the early hours keeping us up Our water was cut off at 10 00am 2 hours before leaving time so couldnt have showers, Nice bathroom
361951,Hilton London Wembley, The cleaners entered are room while we were at breakfast on the morning of checking out before we checked out and took the program and threw it in the trash it was my little brothers who was very upset A unforgivable mistake Room was dustier then expected , The location was perfect right next to the event we went to and the London Designer Outlet which was handy for meals

361954,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast had excellent variety but nothing really stood out The food was average at best , Loved the check in Oscar Iglesias was simply wonderful at making us feel welcome He went out of his way to ensure we had a comfortable stay and has ensured that I remember the Hilton brand from now on As I am a member of other hotel chains I usually tend to seek out those hotels His wonderful service and hospitality has made me a Hilton Honors member for life Other than that our stay was very comfortable and the location is great right next to the London Designer Outlet and Wembley Stadium 
361955,Hilton London Wembley, Too many trainees but complete lack of management of the trainees we have waited almost whole breakfast for coffee tea we have complained about the food in the main restaurant absolutely no reaction from the manager of the restaurant we have found in the minibar after 1st day only yoghurt from the breakfast and cup filled with old coffee and it took 3 days to refill the minibar Totally overpriced compared to the quality , Place reception room itself
361956,Hilton London Wembley, customer service staff smokeing outside in full view not enough staff on bars when checking in no information on anything at all to do with the hotel at all very upset for what we paid it ruined our stay which was special as we were vip s to the x factor , location

361958,Hilton London Wembley, The mini bar was empty upon arrival and I have since found out that the hotel charged me for the consumption of a whole mini bar despite the fact I didn t have anything to potentially take from it I have since raised this with my bank as an error but I sincerely hope this does not become an issue Unfortunately I cannot afford to spend 70 on alcohol when I am away for business purposes , The luxury of the rooms the executive lounge and the location for travelling into central London

362003,Hilton London Wembley, The VIP lounge was not on the top floor but next to the bar on the 3rd floor and wasn t as expected This let the experience of an executive room down a bit The breakfast in the VIP executive lounge is quite limited in choices , Lovely hotel great location for music venues and the main stadium for sport venues Nice rooms spacious quiet clean and comfortable

362012,Hilton London Wembley, poor allocation of staff to both the exec lounge in the evening and also the bar later in the evening It is to be expected that when a show in the arena is finished that the bar would be very busy This was not provided for until it was evident that customers were getting impatient The staff are excellent but have to take the flack from guests who are frustrated due to poor staff allocation to services Similar experience in the exec lounge in the evening with one member of staff and 30 guests , location fantastic facilities excellent reception staff amazing

362022,Hilton London Wembley, The WiFi in my room did not work and after 4 telephone calls they finally sent somebody to check it After 2 hours they eventually moved me to another room which didn t really solve the problem as it also had poor WiFi not very good for a business trip , Very nice hotel and transport into London was fine
362023,Hilton London Wembley, The swimming pool was below poor Dirty cold and generally not what you would expect for the hotel name price Also the hotel is not very child friendly, The overall location and general quality of the rooms was good The restaurant whilst very expensive has great views of Wembley stadium On the same floor as Ireland rugby team

362031,Hilton London Wembley, 1 i was given the room 625 absolutely no views there was a huge structure part of the hotel just in front of the window so it was sad that such a beautiful location was fully hidden from the room 2 too much sound from the adjacent room the lady in the other room was not being too noisy still it was like i was with them 3 breakfast was very average and i would suggest if you are in London do not bother for such a trivial breakfast at Hilton go out and for half the price get fresh and varied breakfast, good size room

362045,Hilton London Wembley, The shower was a bit of a let down and the tap over the bathroom sink seemed to be in the wrong place One of the towels was a bit grubby not as white as it should have been , I have to say the buffet breakfast was fantastic The food was hot and the staff were excellent 
362046,Hilton London Wembley, the room wasn t prepared when we arrived and had to wait until this was done despite arriving at 10pm long after expected check in time, the stay was for a wedding so was pleased with the accommodation and hotel facilities

362048,Hilton London Wembley, Nothing all very good , The staff were really friendly and had even left wine and chocolates in the room due to our previous trip having to be changed which was not their fault A great view of the stadium and made our trip so easy Love it s so close to various food and shopping establishments 
362049,Hilton London Wembley, Being woken at 5 35am with a fire warning Evacuated the building for about 1 hour but better than burning , The hotel was clean and tidy The reception area and bar area was very nice The location was ideal for Wembley tour and shops 
362050,Hilton London Wembley, Staff were not very helpful at reception when we booked a cab which did not turn up on time 1 hour late Hence making us late to a wedding we had travelled over 200 miles to attend staff did not seem to care or help us resolve the problem or offer an alternative cab , Loved the location of the hotel and the rooms were very clean

362052,Hilton London Wembley, The internal phone system in terms of communicating quite poor Each extension failed to connect me efficiently The lines rang without anyone answering for around 10 mins , I enjoyed the spacious bedroom
362053,Hilton London Wembley, Parking is still expensive at 15 00 for 24 hours Make sure you use this car park tho and tell the hotel as other options are not available besides 85 for 24 hours Also only free wifi if u r a hilton member This should be free as a standard , Fantastic hotel 
362054,Hilton London Wembley, The breakfast buffet made us really sick My friend and I felt sick all through out the morning and afternoon We even threw up , The room had a nice view

362057,Hilton London Wembley, Couldn t get the wifi to work but we didn t ask for assistance so wasn t necessarily their fault, Location was great Bed and room were comfortable 
362058,Hilton London Wembley, Staff bar and restaurant service very slow Restaurant meal not tasteful very poor value for money This lets down an otherwise very nice hotel, Very clean and excellent room Reception staff very good
362059,Hilton London Wembley, But far from tube expect free wifi in room in a 4 star hotel for this price fire fault meant disruption late at night evacuation had to move one room as water leak AC wasn t working in one room had to request a fix took several attempts to pay the correct room rate was being asked to pay more, Location overall standard parking in gold car park was full but could park in red car park for same price sky bar excellent views of Wembley stadium good gym another bar on 3rd floor premium feel to hotel staff friendly and helpful 
362060,Hilton London Wembley, That we paid for a room and could not get any peace because of a wedding party on a floor below which had the room shaking because of the noise and was informed that it would be finishing at 01 00 in the morning Not very happy Breakfast was good but the service was poor with the tea and coffee No questions asked on checkout to see if we enjoyed our stay poor , Good size rooms and very clean 
362061,Hilton London Wembley, Things too more work than necessary as the staff had trouble understanding us most likely due to northern accents but checking in ordering drinks etc was hard work Fire alarm went off at 10 30 pm took an hour before we were allowed back in no compensating for it what so ever Quite annoying for a multi billion pound company Rooms were nothing special for the extortionate price I know its London but we could of got better with a large branded company for less , biscuits in the room were lovely cleaning staff were friendly
362062,Hilton London Wembley, We have to wait in the queue to check in and during check out We were given a room which has handicapped bathroom in it Not sure if that is normal as it is our first time stay in Hilton , We liked the location and the staff were really helpfull

362068,Hilton London Wembley, It is a general observation but I hate to pay for breakfast In my opinion it is unfair and hotels could earn more money adding breakfast into a price of the room , Perfect service Nice and well trained always ready when you need them Helpful and kind Perfect to stay if you want to see something on Wembley Arena Not so bad if you are in touristic travel to see downtown 
362069,Hilton London Wembley, Actually just one minor thing the Wash Basin in the bathroom the tap is a bit too distant from the basin itself causing constant water spillage nothing major i guess but there you are this I feel can be looked into , It was highly noticeable that all staff reception concierge restaurant and service staff are extremely helpful amicable and very professional in my view this goes a long way to making your stay a pleasant one 
362070,Hilton London Wembley, Would only say that the mini bar fridge has no room in it for customers who want to keep their own things cold and moving things around in it triggers charges to the room bill as the computer system thinks you have removed eaten drunk them , The hotel staff were amazingly helpful and friendly On the first morning of our stay a manager director was in reception asking customers if there was anyway in which he the hotel could help and was very happy to arrange for the hotel to chill our own bottle of fizz for when we returned that night When we got back to the room the bottle was in a bucket of ice with 2 glasses and a couple of strawberries perfect service 
362071,Hilton London Wembley, The fire alarm went off because of a power cut and we weren t told it was a mistake until we had got dressed and made our way down the stairs, Brilliant location clean very comfortable
362072,Hilton London Wembley, On arrival my request for one of the rooms to have an extra bed in it had been lost however it was quickly resolved This room also had no batteries in the TV remote and despite being reported to 2 different staff members it was never rectified The hotel also suffered a power cut in the evening but this was totally out of their control , We were attending a wedding in the grand ballroom and had a thoroughly enjoyable day

362076,Hilton London Wembley, Wet carpet which we had to report twice Our room was changed because of this however we raised this before we went out at 15 30 at 10pm no one had done anything so we had to wait around for our room to be changed Interrupted twice in the morning By a member of staff to ask what time we were checking out This was raised to the hotel however nothing has been received from management as promised , Great location Friendly staff Nice hotel
362077,Hilton London Wembley, 50 pounds deposit for the movies and then realising they took 250 pounds in total had the money back in cash later on Air conditioning in our room was awful Mini bar wasn t clear lined had gone off milk from 17th July and moulded veg 3rd day in the pool and it smelt terrible which me and my family didn t stay in for long at all , I liked how the staff were helpful when we came across a few problems They were able to give us access to Sky 9 the executive lounge for the whole week whilst staying with them as well as giving us fresh fruit due to another problem First day the guy was cleaning the pool smelt fresh as he was cleaning the walls etc 
362078,Hilton London Wembley, They re holding money from my credit card untill today I don t know when i can return my money they say to me that the money on holding and 2 3 hours they re return but until today the money not return I don t know why, Good building and the room very comfortable
