481054,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Neighourhood didn t look like the one you would walk around but the city center is only 10 mins drive by car, Really nice hotel with friendly stuff super clean and new Exectly what you would expect from Hilton hotel but the price was incredibly good 
481055,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, AC was not working We had booked 10 rooms only 8 rooms had proper air conditioning Wouldnt recommend someone this hotel due to that issue , Rooms were very nice Breakfast was excellent 
481056,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, The neighborhood looked unclean and run down , I selected the place because it was only 2 Kilometers from the concert at the ippodromo and the taxis were less expensive 
481057,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, The location while quiet and peaceful was a bit too far from the city for me personally Also my partner and I definitely saw streetwalkers at night Not sure there s anything anyone can do about that one but just to people know if they walk around later at night with children , I loved the ease of everything If I needed to print something keep my luggage on hold borrow an iron etc everything was done with a smile speed and simplicity 
481058,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Breakfast never changed Fruits not the best in quality No hotel transfer to hotel within Hilton group and drop off to Central Station, Its expensive for area and what this hotel offers
481059,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Hard to get to if you want to travel from Central train station to this hotel Breakfast is very average No egg option Juice is not the real juice Very poor selection of fruit No Hilton hotel to Hilton Hotel transfer They seem to not replace your bottle water or coffee sticks etc unless you call the careline , Receiption was great They put us up on the 4th floor for our duration of stay Bath is great House keeping is done well but they do not replace your bottle water or coffee sticks 
481060,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, The rate upon check out was 20 Euro more than the confirmation I got from Booking com This is probably the error of the system as the hotel received confirmation email from booking com with the wrong rate I m on the process of claiming 20 euros per room 3 rooms back for my reservation , The staffs of the hotel are very friendly and helpful 
481061,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Room carpet not in good condition doesn t feel quite safe to walk on bear footed Mini bar contained one small bottle of water and that s it Not quite Hilton experience , Staff was very helpful even with taking care of package I left for a shipper to collect after I left The breakfast was great with lot of choice If you are there for Salone di Mobile it is well positioned between fair and Brera 
481062,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Some parts of the neighbourhood particularly near the train station were a little rough But Milan is like that rich areas next to poor areas, Very very good breakfast staff are really friendly and easy to talk to Room had a lovely comfortable leather chair and it was clean 
481063,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Located rather far from the center The easiest way to reach it is by train from Milano Certosa Poor WiFi it took me a very long time to connect on the first day and for the second day they actually changed the password unfortunately without any notice Messed up my bill at checkout first charged too much then returned too little after I contacted booking com with request to fix it and returned the rest only after my second e mail , Very good hotel modern clean large room large beds great bathroom all the facilities present and so on 
481064,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, There is a stupid regulation in place If you leave the electronic key card stuck in the room room slot to charge your iPad or cellphone the hotel doesn t clean your room basically the hotel justify this leaving the key stuck in the slot is the same as not disturb This policy is not customer friendly also not a full minibar in the room if you like a beer or a coke you have to go downstairs and get it from the lobby Not enough eironbords available to eiron a shirt No newspaper in the morning this hotel is not worth as 4 star, The Parking
481065,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, They should start shuttle service to fiera Milano direct Even with some nominal charges to guests After the show was tiering to go catch metro or train and again walk or wait for shuttle , Breakfast shuttle service to certosa station wifi 
481066,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Not many choices for the restaurant around the hotel , One of the best hotels ever stayed biggest bang for the buck Need to book at least 3 months in advance 
481067,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Pathetic monotonous below standard breakfast Food quality below average During my entire stay every day staff will tell me bread is finished and you end up eating one type of lousy bread rolls This situation was at around 9am during peak hours Everything is messy and chaotic during breakfast hours Staff is absolutely unfriendly and careless Fruits butter Tea bags hot water will take long time to be replaced No one is bothered to replace until someone draws the attention One coffee machine create long cues Staff is reluctant to serve you on table Location is also industrial area and depressing Not for businessman It s not a very efficient place and not a encouraging environment , Front desk staff members are modestly friendly Room service is reasonably efficient Dinner was pleasant but very limited choice 
481068,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, the location was not great too far from the town centre cafes restaurants and bars the location was not great too far from the town centre cafes restaurants and bars, couldnt fault the hotel on the inside at all it was beautiful 
481069,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Location is the problem Also hotel takes 10 Euro day for car park fee but there is a parking area infront of the hotel So no need to pay parking fee The name Hilton makes you to reserve a room in but this is not an Hilton quality , Wifi working fast enough
481070,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Very poor breakfast and lunch both quality and sortiment Bad noise isolation you could hear neighbour bathroom door close etc Hairdryer was working for 1 minutes than overheated and needed to rest No minibar you have to go down for a drink in the room only water But shared minibar with same sortiment as normaly in the room Far from city center Airport transfer tried to charge 10 more than advertised at the reception because paying with creditcard Gym is small and no good air One of the trademils was not functioning other had no Ipad holder I had a rather poor experience with this hotel , Room size is ok Bed was ok 
481071,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Staff a bit officious and not interested in helping us after my husband s wallet with our Euros was stolen 30 mins by tram or taxi out of central historic Milan , Rooms were clean and comfortable We got an early check in without additional charge 
481072,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Considering the brand name I would expect a very high level of cleanliness which was not the case , good standard business hotel no surprise breakfast offers a decent choice
481073,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Overall the hotel seems dated and lacks any charm whatsoever Be careful of the steps in the front they are all painted grey and drop suddenly with no warning signs i fell twice There is no bellboy present to help with luggage There is nothing around the hotel in terms of restaurants i found 1 and things to watch Lots of graffiti though and deserted streets Very far from city center I ended up taking the metro tram into the city center which was much cheaper, Staff was friendly Room was spacious though dated Free shuttle service to the bus station to take the 8 euro bus to the airport taxi costs 100 euro Found 1 great restaurant closeby 10 min walk L immagine bistrot Cheaper than most hotels but still over valued in my opinion
481074,DoubleTree By Hilton Milan, Industrial location Staff couldn t provide a basic cake or bun to have with coffee during the day Had to be cajoled twice to get a cookie Couldn t provide a light for a cigar No solution and no help Another customer interceded Generally non reception staff had little interest or initiative , Modern Courtyard Enclosed Car Park
