416936,London Marriott Maida Vale, Breakfast was not up to the mark May be because it was extra busy Staff was struggling to keep everything running in a timely manner Best tip is to go to breakfast early , Rooms and location 
416937,London Marriott Maida Vale, Parking was quite expensive at 30 per day Swimming pool was outside of the hotel as part of a fitness club and we could only use it at a certain time when there was no class taking place , Staff very helpful and nice They even wrote a birthday card for my son and offered some cake and a balloon Room was great in size and bed was big and comfortable 
416938,London Marriott Maida Vale, Room service made a mistake with our order , breakfast was very good wide selection of food Bed was brilliant extra wide good night sleep Staff very helpful getting taxis for us in all very good 
416939,London Marriott Maida Vale, The worst hotel I ve experienced My room is next to the executive lounge so from 6 30 in the morning the noise of opening and closing the door began That s terrible I pay more than 300 for one night why did hotel give us a so bad room , Nothing
416940,London Marriott Maida Vale, I booked 2 triple rooms 2 months before my arrival and I asked interconected rooms but I was surprized that our rooms were not pre arranged and finally we got seperate rooms which gives the impression that they do not care about their customers The car park is very expensive 30 per day and such expensive hotel should at least provide free or cheaper car park , The staff was very helpful Cleanliness was very good and the breakfast was nice although fewer choices available 
416941,London Marriott Maida Vale, Just a little costly but probably worth it given the high standards of comfort air conditioning and convenience in parking the car , Really comfy beds and excellent air conditioning during our stay on a really hot weekend 
416942,London Marriott Maida Vale, Two significant problems a A 10 service charge is automatically added to your restaurant bar bill The fact that there is a service charge is in the very small detail on the back page of the menu very difficult to note in advance of purchase Supposedly discretionary but it is automatically added thus you have to have the bill reissued Also unclear as to whether all the service actually goes to the staff b I had room 500 and periodically throughout the night there was a loud noise fro the ventilator in the bathroom I called for this to be rectified bu nothing happened Overall disappointing, Well located for Central london and plenty of restaurants shops and bars within a few minutes walk
416943,London Marriott Maida Vale, Bigger tables in the restaurant, There was no fitness centre at the hotel which was very misleading to say the least as this was one reason my husband chose this hotel for my birthday treat Very disappointed
416944,London Marriott Maida Vale, Had to pay extra 5 GBP to eat at ground floor instead of executive breakfast Non sense In my room there was a temperature of 18 Celsius every time I came from may daily activities To low for me And generating useless energy consumption , Bed excellent And I had possibility to iron my clothes in the room incl ironing table available 
416945,London Marriott Maida Vale, Bed mattress was not most comfortable probably bec it was old, Good location not far from central london with abundant public transport Spacious room by London standard Friendly staff 
416946,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, The BNB was in such an old cool looking building Our rooms were a little tight for three people but it was still a very comfortable stay The breakfast is fantastic not to be missed for sure And the owner was so welcoming warm and had so many things to say about Edinburgh 
416947,London Marriott Maida Vale, I couldn t find anything negative about this hotel except the breakfast wasn t included and if we wanted to get it included it was very very expensive , Lovely Hotel Great Location Lovely Staff Handy having a bar and restaurant on site if you are back hungry thirsty after your sightseeing Kilburn Station is very handy and Staff are very nice and helpful 
416948,London Marriott Maida Vale, The location was a little further out of the main city center than expected The neighborhood is undergoing heavy construction and renovation It was not as pleasant an area to simply hang out in with fewer restaurants close by Overall it was a very nice hotel and I believe after the construction is completed it will improve the overall neighborhood feel , The hotel itself was great 
416949,London Marriott Maida Vale, The Parking was awkward you had to go into the hotel first to get an allocated space which costs 30 for the night which I think it s extortionate for parking but there we go then drive around the building and enter on the left They explain it to you which is fine but considering there s double yellows outside and only permit holders parking it s awkward to leave car if you re alone in order to get the Gate key and information , I loved how quiet it was despite being on a main road I loved how close it was to Abbey road and the tubes and over ground and how friendly the staff were The bed was very comfy and pillows also although I found it hard to adjust with my neck but that s because im awkward haha My partner loved them 
416950,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Comfy Bed Room pleasant temperature despite heatwave fridge and tea making facilities very useful Good location for Little Venice and a walk along the canal sorry breakfast was cheaper at local restaurant Didn t have time to use the pool 
416951,London Marriott Maida Vale, Charged us 30 for parking and didn t inform us of this charge when we asked for parking I also rang to ask about the parking as to whether we had to book and there was no mention of a fee until we checked out,No Positive
416952,London Marriott Maida Vale, Checked in Friday left Sunday Room not cleaned on Saturday Cleaning staff not helpful and some language difficulty Barman on Sunday morning very surly when asked to provide tea and coffee , Reception and Foyer staff friendly and helpful 
416953,London Marriott Maida Vale, Despite specifically asking for a room where we could open the window to let in fresh air the room was hot and stuffy but we couldn t open the window The aircon went down to 18 but failed to cool the room sufficiently enough to sleep well There were four of us staying in a family room yet only 3 towels were provided We ordered more and they came very quickly but why didn t they just leave 4 sets of towels in the first place , The two double beds were comfortable and the room was a reasonable size and clean Reception and concierge staff were friendly and helpful Service was quick 
416954,London Marriott Maida Vale, The decorations and carpet in the corridors to the rooms were very tired and in need of updating or a good clean It was a concern walking to the room as to what we would be greeted with but the room was amazing and very modern , The bed room was wonderfully decorated and spacious
416955,London Marriott Maida Vale, please return my money back the staf is poor not welcome , Booking history 27 April 2017 I booked 2 room 2 nights through booking com total 552L 28 April 2017 There is a deduction in credit 2 times for 276L and 276 L total 552L So our hotel is paid all Proof of my credit card photo attach in this email 17 Juni 2017 Marriott cut again some money on my credit card 276L so There is an overpayment from us Please give us more money back 276L
416956,London Marriott Maida Vale, Booking com had not reflected the fact that you had to pay for parking in the overall review which was disappointing Also there was no direct access to the pool from the hotel , The staff were really lovely and the rooms were modern and very clean The location to the tube was excellent and you were in central London in minutes 
416957,London Marriott Maida Vale, There was no view out of the window worth looking at The AC conked out on the first night in the room that was given to us although they did later shift us to an alternative room which was fine Some of the staff seemed to have problems with understanding simple things like a weighing scale which indicated a poor command over the language , Location wise it was fine being situated close to the overground and the tube station There are also multiple shops in the neighbourhood for food groceries and knickknacks The room that we had was large enough considering London standards and the three of us did not feel boxed in although we stayed for 5 nights Staff was helpful The breakfast spread was also very decent
416958,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Very convenient very clean and very friendly staff Everything was good about this hotel modern clean comfortable rooms and beds Room had tea coffee making facilities House keeping staff were excellent Reception and concierge really friendly The 16 bus from Victoria Station stops right across the road from the hotel 
416959,London Marriott Maida Vale, Disabled access difficult to exit the room if on your own if you are in a wheelchair also walk in shower instead of bath was expected but crossed wires when enquiring meant it was nott possible but we coped and staff very apologetic , The extras that come with booking an executive room far exceeded expectations
416960,London Marriott Maida Vale, There is noisy construction across the street that prohibits sleeping during the day The drinks at the bar are expensive as is the breakfast buffet I accidentally selected No Cancellation on Booking com and the Marriott property would not let me change it even though I am a rewards member I probably would have stayed there anyway but I wanted the option , I liked the Elgin Cafe around the corner for meals and drinks The Abbey Road Recording Studios and zebra crossing are a 15 minute walk from the hotel 
416961,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, The hotel was in a perfect location 5 minutes walk from the TUBE which linked you to central London The facilities were extremely clean and modern and the customer service was exceptional all around 
416962,London Marriott Maida Vale, I paid full amount of approx 800 upon check in but I was very upset to be asked to pay an additional 150 50 per night as a deposit I queried what the deposit was for and was told it was to cover if I got drinks at the bar or needed laundry done or if I wanted to add in my daughters for breakfast theirs weren t included I said that I had stayed in numerous hotels all around Europe including UK and had never been asked for such a thing I said I would pay for drinks at the bar or breakfast there and then if needed I have never had my laundry done in any hotel but if I did I would pay up front there and then They insisted I pay and I asked for a manager who struggled to justify this and tried to convince me this was for my benefit What kind of fool did she think I was Did they expect that I might trash the room or steal the towels or the TV They had my Visa debit card details and my passport just in case She eventually agreed to reduce the deposit to 50 which I still wasn t happy about but grudgingly agreed as we were all tired and wanted to get to our room Imagine all the extra interest earned on all of the 50s per room per night per Marriott hotel that floats through the company account before the money is refunded It will probably take a week before my deposit re appears in my account Next morning our daughters did decide they wanted breakfast we were told it would be 19 each however if we went to reception and got a voucher it would be 12 I queued for 10 minutes at reception and gave up They went up to Starbucks up the road instead The breakfast myself and my wife had was nothing spectacular Typical tepid buffet stuff , Rooms were modern spacious and clean Staff especially in breakfast room were very helpful 
416963,London Marriott Maida Vale, Internet was not very good free wifi was not free unless we joined up as a member to Marriott Hotels , Very nice comfortable modern room and bathroom 
416964,London Marriott Maida Vale, The aircon was noisy and I would have liked to see some biscuits and a couple of bottles of water in the room , The room was clean modern and very spacious
416965,London Marriott Maida Vale, It is relatively far from central London Usually takes more than 30 mins by bus or by tube to get to most attractions , The service is very good and the room is very comfortable Close to bus stop and tube The value for money is good 
416966,London Marriott Maida Vale, I didn t like that there was nothing to dislike , From check in to check out I loved this hotel I was staying for business working close by at Lords Cricket ground so the location was ideal and close to a Tube Station connecting me to the rest of the city The staff were extremely helpful The room was incredible LOVED IT bed was so comfy the pillows too and the shower was very powerful which was great I liked the random addition of the knock on the door with free chocolates random but cool I could not recommend this hotel enough 
416967,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, The hotel was lovely and modern within less than 5 minute walk to Kilburn Park underground which gets you into central London in around 10 mins Secure underground parking 30 is expensive but for the security worth it The room was clean modern and comfortable my only small issue was there was no bath only a shower and after a long day walking round London would have been lovely to have a soak Within walking distance there are various shops and eateries Wouldn t hesitate to book again 
416968,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Nice spacious rooms with comfortable beds with a huge TV built into the wall which was very smart There are two tube stations near the hotel both only a 10 minute walk which was handy 
416969,London Marriott Maida Vale, WIFI is very expensive 15 no reason why it shouldn t be included within the cost of the room price , Hotel is close to the tube Kilburn Park and only 20 minutes from Kings Cross good location away from the busy centre Room was clean bed comfortable and had everything you needed In room dining was prompt and the quality of the food was good 
416970,London Marriott Maida Vale, Hotel is very clean but there s no classy restaurant nearby nearby , Food is ok and staff are good but there s no classy restaurant nearby most of the resto near only prepares junk foods and street foods which are not good to a child s with lots of food allergy 
416971,London Marriott Maida Vale, It s just a bit far from downtown , Staff is very helpful and friendly Location is good though not great near tube and over ground station The neighbourhood is quiet and beautiful suitable for family The room is excellent very comfortable Marriott style 
416972,London Marriott Maida Vale, Three of staff were very unfriendly didn t understand what we were asking weren t bothered or that was how they came across Bacon and beans at breakfast were cold We tried to have a meal on Saturday evening we were the only guests in there and we were told to get our own drinks across the other side of the hotel as she was on her own Then after taking our order she came back to say there wasn t any focaccia for our starters at that point we cancelled our order and left We ordered sandwiches in the bar ham and tuna but we got cheese and chicken Potato wedges were not cooked and had to be sent back Total chaos though the lady was very apologetic Although a break with family we do use Marriott hotels across the UK and overseas for business so I wanted to see how well our visit went with a view to using this venue at a future date Not a good experience I m afraid , Bedroom very nicely refurbished very clean BUT no biscuits after a long journey a cup of tea and a NICE biscuit would be most welcome Other Marriotts used regularly for business and social are far superior 
416973,London Marriott Maida Vale, Just one thing at the reception I was informed that I could get access to the wifi within 10 minutes this didn t happen and I had to connect my laptop to the iPhone hotspot hopefully next time I could get access to the wifi facilities immediately or at least within a couple of hours Thanks , The room was very clean the staff were friendly and the beds were very comfy 
416974,London Marriott Maida Vale, the general condition of the hotel the internet is not great neither in the bedroom i asked for the plaster for my scar and they didn t have while the shop in front sell it the hair drier in the rooms are very bad quality , the room was great however the communal area was old and smelly the uniform of the staff and the reception area in old looking comparing to the rooms it gives the impretion that the only part has been refurbished is the rooms In general the hotel is very old looking and sometimes smelly but the rooms are great 
416975,London Marriott Maida Vale, Room should have been more thoroughly cleaned with a bottle top on the floor and something that looked like crumbs And then hair in the shower cubicle Decoration in the hotel corridors looked very tired carpet in particular needs to be changed , Room was modern spacious and well designed 
416976,London Marriott Maida Vale, Nice property but extremely poor customer service that made me cut short of my stay they almost made me sleep out in the cold I was tempted to call police on them Horrible experience Sad ,No Positive
416977,London Marriott Maida Vale, Breakfast seemed a little stressful for staff and forgot our tea and coffee on the first morning The coffe wasn t very nice anyway Kept up on the first night by neighbours having a party with loud music though when there were complaints the management soon sorted it out and it was turned off , Staff were very friendly and eager to assist Bedrooms were comfortable with great TV and free WiFi Felt quite luxurious 
416978,London Marriott Maida Vale, Very pricey room without breakfast Over Easter price was steep irrelevant it was easter for us as we only stayed as nearby daughter had new baby Pool was outside and round the corner shut at 5 30pm when we stayed Pool small crowded and up freezing public stairs Husband told had to pay 5 for locker padlock Very disappointing as we hoped pool would be main relaxation for us No moving or magnifying mirror in bathroom obviously really meant for business men on expense accounts , Comfy modern room Quiet too
416979,London Marriott Maida Vale, A couple of dislikes about breakfast the cereal tasted a little stale and one of them wrongly marked jams marmalades not named and hairs were found in them , Staff were helpful and courteous throughout our stay They followed through with personal requests which made us feel welcome My children felt safe and comfortable which means a great deal to me One of my children has issues staying in strange places so if they re happy so am I 
416980,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, I told reception it was my birthday and when I came back that evening there was balloons a card and macaroons waiting for me Was such a lovely touch 
416981,London Marriott Maida Vale, Staff at the front desk tried to give us a double room rather than the booked king Staff at the desk were not aware that the room was already paid asked for full payment Swimming pool is not within the hotel you need to go outside and up the road in order to use it , Clean comfortable room
416982,London Marriott Maida Vale, 2 sachets of coffee where left so bad service from that point of view New refurbished rooms are sealed I E the windows cannot be opened so you are 100 reliant on the AC system which can be noisy etc So this is a major issue if you don t like AC environments Personally I don t and this would put me off using it again , Nice room nice hotel quiet for London rooms nicely refurbished
416983,London Marriott Maida Vale, Not a great view Smoke alarm flashing throughout the night which woke me a couple of times The Concierge staff could have been friendlier , Bed pillows very comfy room dark quiet so no disturbances Nice large screen TV Great location for Tube overground stations 
416984,London Marriott Maida Vale, Key fob had to be rebooted for room and executive lounge No food in executive lounge , Concierge and desk staff helpful Room very quiet little road noise generally Bedding crisp and bed big 
416985,London Marriott Maida Vale, We had to leave the hotel and go outside for the pool entrance , The staff was really great especially Agnese She found out it was my sons birthday and had all the staff sign a card and sent up balloons and a basket of treats to the room This was way beyond any service I have received at any other property 
416986,London Marriott Maida Vale, The wifi access didn t work for me or my partner It s not clear how to access it or the costs The corridors could do with a better design perhaps a bit of a spruce up as the rooms are very modern and clean in comparison , The bed was very comfortable The room was immaculate and everything was stocked up toilet rolls teas and coffee The receptionists we came into contact were very friendly and welcoming 
416987,London Marriott Maida Vale, Would have liked to have breakfast but it was so expensive , Nice rooms allowed us to check in early so we could get ready for a wedding Bar stayed open late when we got back
416988,London Marriott Maida Vale, Windows could of had a safety catch so we could of opened them View of roadworks flats wasn t great, Bed was really comfy Modern spacious rooms 
416989,London Marriott Maida Vale, When not booking direct with hotel you weren t entitled to free wifi in your room Hotel is in Kilburn not Maida Vale, All staff pleasant Bar staff in particular
416990,London Marriott Maida Vale, New rooms have very bad lighting Difficult to see to shave or apply makeup No opening windows and a humming noise went on all night, Refurbished rooms are very good if a little small sometimes 
416991,London Marriott Maida Vale, Minor points Window locks were shut and insufficient breakfast tea provided in the room Lack of drawer storage space , The beds were SO comfortable Excellent shower and plenty of lovely towels Quiet location Very polite helpful staff 
416992,London Marriott Maida Vale, The reception wasn t anything I was expecting would have been nice if it was modern Just little out dated Also the wifi was very slow didn t seem to work very well , The pillows were dream very soft and light Bathroom was lovely The new designer for the bedroom was bonus Also the tube was near the hotel and Tesco s good if you wanted to have some stock up in your room There was a mini fridge Also on the last day we were able to leave our bags for free of charge helpful when you wanted to do last day of shopping without having to carry suitcases around 
416993,London Marriott Maida Vale, The bed linen the horrible top sheet that you always get tangled in And there was a duvet cover and all but it was with the opening up which means you end up hugging the dirt from everyone else Please drop the sheet turn the duvet and cover around and all is fine , Bathroom fresh and clean 
416994,London Marriott Maida Vale, There was a loud humming from the air conditioning unit in the roof which made it quite difficult to get the kids to sleep, Comfy beds recently refurbished room large shower good food
416995,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Amazing experience the moment i arrived i was greeted respectfully and asked questions regarding my stay and purpose of travel to later be spoilt by a member of staff named Amanda and the Mariot team with balloons and bottle of wine All facilities were clean and beds were extremely comfortable All in all I had a great time and was definitely worth the price paid 
416996,London Marriott Maida Vale, Room was a little on the small side for a room containing 2 doubles we had room service but didn t feel we had enough room to eat except on the bed , Bed was excellent
416997,London Marriott Maida Vale, My only criticism is that breakfast was mediocre nothing special about it at all although the staff were lovely , Refurb is great Really comfy bed black out curtains did the job a treat and the shower was fab 
416998,London Marriott Maida Vale, I would have liked the room to have been better cleaned We had to clean the table ourselves twice and the carpets were not vacuumed daily , Excellent location Friendly staff Nice room of good size 
416999,London Marriott Maida Vale, no breakfast tea in rooms three days running car park very very expensive room charges varied enormously through 10 11 day stay , liked the cleanliness of room n en suite
417000,London Marriott Maida Vale, The location is poor While it s close to tube station the surroundings are not great , The hotel itself is fantastic Our King room was fantastic with amazing decor and the best shower ever 
417001,London Marriott Maida Vale, Got back to our room approximately 4 45pm and housekeeping hadn t been done Our breakfast tray was still on the table and beds hadn t been made Consequently when they did arrive we wanted to get ready for the theatre so they just took our tray and emptied the bins , The room was super Just what we expected Clean and comfortable 
417002,London Marriott Maida Vale, I liked it all , Hotel was lovely beautiful room clean kingsize room with a fridge brill for our snacks an comfortable bed like heaven shower was great 2 heating an air con in the room was perfect staff very happy to help friendly Breakfast was cool cant complain over bacon and eggs you can ask for freshly made omelettes coffee and porridge nice range of bakery food 2 lovely helpful staff in the kitchen both days Restaurant Fratelli in the evening was really quite but the food was lovely wasn t a massive range to choose but nice for my self and partner meal cost with starters an a bottle of rosey 75 Bar is nice 5 7 cocktails 2 for 1 or its close to 20 for 2 drinks after Kish is opposite nice restaurant 40 with drinks portions was massive Free use of the bannintinees gym while being a guest at the hotel was a nice perk I booked in 2 treatments massages and it was great for us newbies from treatwell based inside the gym brilliant worth booking in you can also use the saunna an steem room as well as the pool an gym after 
417003,London Marriott Maida Vale, Having to pay for wifi, Stayed for my birthday with a group of friends we had joint rooms and it was lovely So good for the money and the rooms were amazing We were all a little hungover in the morning and the hotel allowed us to have a late checkout 1pm which was handy 
417004,London Marriott Maida Vale, 30 for one night of parking is extortionate Wasn t aware of the 50 deposit payment upon arrival in case of ordering of room service etc Bed was stiff but may be as new Bizarre having to walk out and round the corner of the hotel to use the pool Nearly 20 for breakfast was overpriced Wifi only free in the lobby have to pay extra everywhere else, Lovely pool etc Parking very secure Lovely large TV in room Rooms fantastic Very clean Very modern
417005,London Marriott Maida Vale, Although adequate the breakfast room was not as pleasing as the room , The size of room was excellent I particularly liked the quality of the bed linen 
417006,London Marriott Maida Vale, Can t think of anything , My family were emigrating to Seattle so this hotel was perfectly situated for us whilst they finalised their move The staff were helpful friendly and exceptionally cooperative in what was a stressful time for us Our rooms were ideal for us and the choice and standard of food at breakfast was magnificent I know that I am biased in my views of Kilburn but this place is ideal to explore not only locally but the whole of London 
417007,London Marriott Maida Vale, They took a fee for the wifi In my opinion it should always be included I was going to do some work in the evenings before I went to sleep and had to pay for 24 h there s a Starbucks just down the street though the air con was very loud , Staff was really nice and helpful Room was fresh and comfortable Amazing bathroom The location was perfect took only 3 5 min to walk to the underground 
417008,London Marriott Maida Vale, Pool the gym in a separate building and children are allowed until 6pm last entry at 5 15pm which is quite early if you wanna spend the day in the center It s not possible to open the window in the room to let the fresh air in and the air conditioning was super loud The wardrobe was too small , Staff were very accommodating Good buffet breakfast served until 10 30 on weekdays Good location for exploring North and Central London easily connected by bus for city sighting 
417009,London Marriott Maida Vale, Service of staff at reception desk is so so gym and pool next to hotel is outdated and not very hygienic , Refurbished rooms are comfortable good location 
417010,London Marriott Maida Vale, Couldn t try the restaurant since it was closed on sunday though a meal at the bar could be had, Friendly helpful staff Good location near shops and the tube Enjoyed the new rooms
417011,London Marriott Maida Vale, Nothing it s a great place to stay , Our room was ready when we got there at 10am I ve never seen that before but was so pleased to drop our bags off relax get a cup of tea and then go back out again When we walked into the room myself and my girlfriend was immediately impressed there was an extremely large TV and it said Welcome David nice touch It was clean quirky little art posters in frames and sculptures of motorbikes made out of metal wiring so quirky and made the room so modern up to date and also a personal touch The bathroom was so big and the shower area was spacious not cramped up I m 6ft 3 and I ve stayed at some places where you feel you can t move while showering this place was brilliant Staff wished us a Happy New Year when passing them in the corridor very friendly People staying here were or seemed very respectful towards one another no doors slamming no banging no one running down the corridor or arguments just peaceful
417012,London Marriott Maida Vale, The room was too hot no option to open windows and air conditioning was loud We felt we slept in a storm hence no sleep The tea and coffee in the room were not stocked and the duvet was made upside down My husband and I had never stayed in a 4 5 star hotel in England and can honestly say that the travelodge and premier inn are of far better quality , The breakfast was nice and staff were very accommodating 
417013,London Marriott Maida Vale, The buffet breakfast is not better than premier Inn No halal sausages The restaurant toilets no bin and don t flush Not enough milk for tea in the rooms Over price the car park, The bathroom very clean
417014,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, The 6 bed was lovely and comfy could have slept all day But had too much to see and do If we had more time I would have loved to use the swimming pool facility hopefully next time we hope to be back 
417015,London Marriott Maida Vale, The bed was very very uncomfortable I suggest new plush bed upgrades Very Springy lumpy and not soft, Friendly stuff excellent chef AAAA enjoyed our dinner and he even came out personally to see how our meal was fantastic The room was clean nice and modern the shower was amazing hotel was very clean and fresh very nice
417016,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, The staff were lovely very helpful and friendly Lovely comfortable and clean room Will definitely be staying here again and for longer than one evening next time 
417017,London Marriott Maida Vale, I d expect a decent free wifi service to be honest Bit misleading calling the locale Maida Vale too quite a bit out from there , Room was great 
417018,London Marriott Maida Vale, Couldn t have been better, After the staff were made aware it was my birthday I came in to find a card balloons and a bottle of wine and cake on the table in my room
417019,London Marriott Maida Vale, Poor services hotel how mentioned by staff if u need cleaning or make your room must call on request too bad Staff reception not friends ly poor, Room cleaning not done well Only few staff good duty manager hutam and bell man Ronald n liss n some few staff the rest are poor
417020,London Marriott Maida Vale, Major pay for WiFi in room Shower temp Luke warm Minor spa in a gym next door ended up not going as a result had to ring for checkout a time as it wasn t in the literature in the room bar shuts down at about 1 00 For the price maybe not the gym spa you would expect all of that stuff to be taken care of to be fair, Really good product clean tidy and well situated good for tube nice and quiet comfortable and modern staff were great 
417021,London Marriott Maida Vale, Everything Always kept waiting for 30 minutes so check in making us late for dinner resignations and missing out table heater in room wasn t working so we froze We re food was being served flys were around see attached pictures of flys on the wall by food Building works all morning couldn t sleep gave me a head ache Ask to speak to management and I was ignored and told we would get call back but nothing When I was checking out and explaining problems with my stay manager was very rude and defensive just crap also nothing like pictures location was not nice Don t waste your money , Nothing rude staff couldn t care less about guest
417022,London Marriott Maida Vale, Unfortunatly the spa is not part of the hotel so for this time of year November not so ideal You also had to walk up and down the stairs in your costume as it is quite small , The staff were lovely The receptionist was making small talk I didn t realise I would get a cake card and wine as I mentioned it was a birthday present Very attentive when making requests spare toothbrush extra milk I would definately recommend it as a cosy friendly hotel but if you are looking for a nice spa it is not ideal 
417023,London Marriott Maida Vale, It was a con I was told 12 per person for breakfast and 3 50 room charge when my bill come it was 44 it s a rip off Parking is 30 per car not only that there was drilling going on all morning, Nothing
417024,London Marriott Maida Vale, Prices in bar restaurant prices a little high Having to pay to access wi fi in room free in public areas , Central location friendly helpful staff clean fresh hotel
417025,London Marriott Maida Vale, I didn t realise that the pool gym weren t accessible from the hotel it s a short walk This wasn t a major issue but it did stop me from using the facilities, Lovely freshly decorated room and nice hotel All staff that we came into contact with were extremely friendly Great bar area and restaurant too 
417026,London Marriott Maida Vale, As the hotel was in Maida Vale getting to central location London was a bit tiresome, We stayed in a suite it was wonderful and I would recommend the room to anyone
417027,London Marriott Maida Vale, you have to go out to the gym as entrance is outside but worth it though, flexibility of the staff especially with regards to my refundable deposit i loved the new decor of the room as well breakfast was great too 
417028,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Hotel was in a perfect location Away from the madness of the city but yet just 5 stops away from Oxford Street Bedrooms were really comfortable Overall I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to a friend We would definitely stay again Staff were just so helpfull

417046,London Marriott Maida Vale, i would have preferred to be informed that the swimming pool and gym isn t located at the hotel but around the corner so you actually have to leave the hotel as its misleading to say you have these facilities when they are in different locations Breakfast was very average One of the managers had a word with her colleague in front of us which wasn t pleasant to see It seems not everyone was on the same page The cocktails were horrible from the bar I was just happy it was 2 for 1 It also would have helpful if we were told the hotel is under construction and there will be a lot of noise from 8am 6pm because then I would have booked somewhere much peaceful or be prepared for the noise Because of the constructions we had to make plans everyday to avoid all the heavy banging Definitely not booking that again, the reception staff were friendly and helpful

417073,London Marriott Maida Vale, The bed was a little hard but that s just my personal opinion I prefer soft beds I don t know what it is with Britons and double duvets , Most of the staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful especially the girl named Beak for last name The rooms are big with plenty of space so are the bathrooms We had a nice stay although we wasn t using that much time on the hotel The hotel was located a 8 10 minuts walk from Kilburn Park st who provide the Bakerloo line There s a bunch of nice breakfast restaurants nearby if you don t want to spend money on the expensive hotel breakfast

417075,London Marriott Maida Vale, The price Then wasa asked for an extra 40 00 to check in early Why do they think this is acceptable when the room was already nearly 170 00, The location for where I had to be

417078,London Marriott Maida Vale, It was a bit odd that there was just one apple one mars bar and one bottle of water when we arrived and only the water was replaced for the second evening We went to the restaurant and felt the service was quite slow considering the amount of staff and the few people in there we had to wait a while for our food despite the first being only bread However the staff were lovely and also helpful and polite We were annoyed to be charged a service charge and then asked for a gratuity too We would have tipped but for the service charge as we felt this should be a choice , Very nice welcome lovely big room and nice bathroom very comfortable and large bed

417084,London Marriott Maida Vale, soft drink almost as much as an alcoholic drink, I loved the locate on 2 minutes walk to the nearest tube station lots of shops and restaurants near by For us it was a perfect hotel to use to get to the west end for our show 
417085,London Marriott Maida Vale, Only grip was the breakfast was warm not hot and that wasn t the hotels fault really due to other guests leaving the lids open on the serving hot plates , Great hotel in a quieter part of town clean and tidy with pleasant staff

417089,London Marriott Maida Vale, The Ryanair approach to service charges Wifi access and service charges at the bar even if you collect the drinks directly and add to the room charge as I did Daft and honestly an exploitation of your customer base, Great rooms beds
417090,London Marriott Maida Vale, Pool area was very small dark and dingy and while trying to relax before our treatments from the spa bannatynes the pool was noisy with young children jumping in , The room was spacious no noise from outside

417093,London Marriott Maida Vale, The pictures of the pool leisure facilities were taken when it was new are very misleading now The pool is not on site short walk but not worth booking the hotel if your wanting a nice swim in nice surroundings , The staff and the room were excellent The executive lounge was worth it lovely breakfast kids welcome 
417094,London Marriott Maida Vale, Nothing comes to mind, I book a room with access to Executive Lounge I love being able to pop in for a coffee or afternoon tea etc The staff are brilliant every time we visit they cannot do enough for you
417095,London Marriott Maida Vale, Bathroon dirty and poor carpet is dirty and poor even the furniture is old and not good The restaurant and the breakfast is very poor I dont think is 4 star hotel definitely less may be 3 or 2 Starts Really is not value fir the money we spend, I dont like the bathroom dirty and poor The carpet also poor and dirty even the restaurant and the breakfast is not good I do not think its 4 stars definitely is less may be 3 stars or 2 even
417096,London Marriott Maida Vale, The fact the health club was not directly downstairs you had to come out of the building and round the corner to Bannatynes so couldn t go down in your dressing gown However health club staff were great too It was in Zone 2 so needed a different tube ticket, staff were excellent particularly the Sheffield lad on reception 
417097,London Marriott Maida Vale, Entrance of hotel very stylish rooms a bit worn asked to be moved as christmas lights outside my room kept me awake Bed in second room not very comfortable had to argue and show evidence that breakfast was included toa very unpleasant member of staff, Staff on the whole very accommodating on friendly
417098,London Marriott Maida Vale, Bar closed a bit Early, Unfortunately there was a problem with our booking through booking Com but the staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful We got the room for the rate on booking com even though the rate at the time was much more expensive 
417099,London Marriott Maida Vale, No big deal but the beds were a little soft for me personal preference , The rooms were very comfortable and suited our needs on the occasion we stayed
417100,London Marriott Maida Vale, The price we paid for the hotel it should of been half of that because it was noisy out side and it was not worth 450 for it, The staff where excellent

417102,London Marriott Maida Vale, Already paid and they took a 50 security deposit Service charge on drinks in the bar Surely that s my choice to tip , Decent check out time and nice rooms
417103,London Marriott Maida Vale, We though the pool was part of the hotel but it turns out it s the gyms next door so it s not just for hotel use Had to pay 30 to park at the hotel over night which I though was a bit steep Location was good but 5 minute walk up the road was dodgy young gangs robbing the local shops made me feel in safe Cleaners in the morning knocked once and woke us up and opened the door luckily we had the inside lock on so they couldnt just walk in because the door only opened so far with the lock on Rooms are a bit dated and bathrooms could do with a makeover , Staff were lovely and friendly bed was massive and so comfortable Location was perfect for what we needed 
417104,London Marriott Maida Vale, The fact that one of my friends who s name was not on the room lead was able to check in and get the keys on my behalf without conferring with me first,No Positive
417105,London Marriott Maida Vale, We would like to have controlled the air conditioning It was noisy and too warm and the window didn t open We moved rooms once because of a noisy generator nearby the second room was better but there was still the background hum The ice machine in the corridor was very noisy , Spacious room with everything you need

417108,London Marriott Maida Vale, I didn t like the paper thin walls I could hear next doors conversations word for word I didn t like paying 5 for a bottle of London Pride , Bed was good 
417109,London Marriott Maida Vale, Yes on floor 3 two doors along we had a large group of men in the suite on the end being noisy and smoking some sort of drug Was frightening for our child we phoned security and they did seem to sort it out although the cleaners had to spend a long while cleaning the room the following morning ,No Positive
417110,London Marriott Maida Vale, We Had to wait 20 mins to be sat down for breakfast We gave our hot drinks order and only half arrived We had to ask 2 different members of staff before we managed to receive the teas Bed room was booked for 4 people but the complimentary soaps etc were very limit There was 2 towels in the bathroom but not 4 There was only 2 mugs and never enough milk to make a morning coffee for 4 people There was a constant high pitch noise in room 406 It continued throughout the night The ice machiene was broken on the 4th floor so we had to walk to other floors to find ice When checking my parents out of room 420 they mistakingly check myself and the 3 other guests out of our room in 406 despite us staying for another night We were unable to get into our room My parents in room 420 had a lot of traffic noise No toilet brush in bathroom pillows were very flat Staff were at times unenthusiastic and Not very helpful A lady working on reception didn t seem to know Much about anything for example the use of spa facilities When phoning ahead to ask for an early check in time the man didn t have very good telephone eticate , Despite the eggs being cold the breakfast was tasty and filled us up for the day Free water with added fruit was very refreshing and a nice touch We enjoyed having a restaurant attached to the hotel for evening dinning 
417111,London Marriott Maida Vale, The full benefits of the Executive Lounge were not explained on check in there for we missed out on free Beverages afternoon tea canapes partly our own fault for not reading literature given to us However I do feel reception staff should have highlighted freebies on check in The room 340 was great for us although the mattress on the sofa bed was past its best I asked for another mattress or atleast a mattress topper but instead got a blanket laid on top of mattress So had to put up with my teenagers complaining each morning how uncomfortable it was , Good facilities food location Small kitchen in our suite was a real bonus roomy there was 4 of us 2x adults 2x teenagers 
417112,London Marriott Maida Vale, Disappointed short car park stay to offload luggage cost so much Would nit beat deal from booking com so got less margin when I booked though them, Good location
417113,London Marriott Maida Vale, We didn t like the fact that the pool and other facilities had to be accessed from outside of the hotel building Therefore in order to use the pool for example guests would have to get fully dressed to go out the building and into another , Breakfast was fantastic really enjoyed it Would be nice to have the option of alternative types of sausages and bacon such as beef sausages and turkey rashers for people who do not consume pork products 
417114,London Marriott Maida Vale, Upon checking in we were assigned a room on the second floor The walls were dirty and when I sat on the bed sank to the ground I complained to the front desk and we were moved to the sixth floor what is considered the executive level The rooms are very dated The bed was way too soft The bath tub is very high and narrow and dangerous to step in and out of Closet space is practically zero and dresser drawers are so thin that we lived out of our suitcase the entire week As a Marriott Silver Elite member I was rather surprised this was not what I expected for a Martiott property , Good location Great staff Very good amenities The restaurant and bar both offer great service and food
417115,London Marriott Maida Vale, The bed It was the worst nights sleep I have for a very long time The mattress on inspection appeared old and well used and a topper had been put on top but it was the wrong size and made it even more lumpy I expect better from Marriott and it definitely split our stay , Staff and facilities Room size and cleanliness 
417116,London Marriott Maida Vale, The swimming pool and spa involves walking out onto the street down the road and round the corner The website description claims it as adjacent This is stretching the truth There is presently only one lift to the underground car park due to modification work being done in the hotel Getting up and down to the carpark was unnecessarily and tediously time consuming Often you called the lift and the other lift that didn t service the basement would arrive and cancel the call for the lift you needed , The staff were efficient attentive and friendly They solved all of the problems we encountered some due to booking com not doing what they were supposed to do and another because their billing computer had a glitch Brilliant Persian restaurant Kish direcly across the road Great food and great value Fairly close to the tube bus and rail services and easy to get to from the M1 
417117,London Marriott Maida Vale, Paid 298 for room and on arrival was further charged 100 security 50 per night This was not explained at time of booking On checking out money had been deducted from 100 Had to stand my ground for reimbursement Staff unhelpful , Convenient for me Lovely hotel Room was very comfortable 
417118,London Marriott Maida Vale, Noise from next door room late at night Sounded like the occupants were just talking but the sound travelled too well via the connecting door and seemed very loud at 1am both nights , Very helpful staff Excellnet food in the restaurant
417119,London Marriott Maida Vale, Initial concern when my booking could not be found Very poor bar meal with fish that was barely cooked in a soft soggy batter It was said that there was a problem in the kitchen , Helpful bar staff
417120,London Marriott Maida Vale, First you say you have a pool and there s no pool at the hotel You use the pool of a gym in a different building Second you were giving me a different room of what i ordered I asked for a quiet room and got a room situated just by the main road so quite noisy I didn t get the free London travel thing you offered me No one said to me i had to pay an extra 50 pounds deposit when i got there good i had some cash with me do you still want me to continue Not happy I payed a lot of money and it wasn t at all what i expected , I didn t like it
417121,London Marriott Maida Vale, Property needs some refurbishments as some of the fixtures are showing its age , For London standards rooms were quite big Hotel is not too far from the underground station Kilburn Park and there are bus stops nearby that service Westfield s Oxford street etc Another positive is that the rooms are fitted with multiple power points which makes charging multiple electrical devices so much easier 
417122,London Marriott Maida Vale, Location is very bad far away from central London Underground access is around 20 minutes Better to use the bus services The room was not very clean in need of refurbishment ,No Positive
417123,London Marriott Maida Vale, Buffett Breakfast was lovely but very expensive and same thing everyday would have been nice to have more variety , All the staff were so friendly and willing to help with anything 
417124,London Marriott Maida Vale,No Negative, Room was a good size Large bed Good facilities Helpful staff Very clean and a good location with easy access to underground and overground rail services very easy for travel to Euston 
417125,London Marriott Maida Vale, Compared to other marriotts this one is not very nice but again London has a different standard Also wifi wasn t free We were charged 20 pounds Additionally you have to be wary of additonal charges They charged us extra for something we didn t use but once we pointed it out they removed it , For London standards it was a good size room and very clean 
417126,London Marriott Maida Vale, I booked this hotel because it had a pool and I had planned to swim before breakfast However it did not open until 9 AM by then I have I had to be leaving the hotel So be aware if you wanted to use the gym facilities , Heathrow is clean and the beds were comfortable 
417127,London Marriott Maida Vale, Very old looking passage and room view was pathetic, The staff very good Room service excellent one guy Mr Sheldon was fantastic well trained and very courteous
417128,London Marriott Maida Vale, we booked executive room with free late check out and free wifi but it turned out that during check out they asked out to pay for the wifi and when we told them about our room category they were not aware of the offer and then they removed the bill of wifi and the late check out was only till 2 pm and most of the hotels accept check out at this time for free and the executive lounge was not worthy compared to Marriott parklane as there was nothing to do in it and only limited selection of food and even breakfast was not to the standard will stay here next time due to the location but will take the basic room as you do not need to pay extra charge for things that you will not benefit from and there are lots of coffee shops nearby so no need to pay extra charge for breakfast , Liked the location and the view of the room staff were friendly
