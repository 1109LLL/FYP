426102,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No tea or coffee making facilities in room Just one small disappointment my daughter and I arranged with the front desk staff to order a taxi to take us to the airport after asking for an estimate of how much the fare would be We ended up with a hotel transfer by van which became clear on the receipt we received at the end of the journey and which was double what we expected to pay Happily the hotel have met the difference in cost between the two fares They have been very pleasant to deal with over this issue Suggest that travellers make themselves aware of the difference between the two options and check as to what they are getting , Location was excellent easy to walk to all major attractions in Vienna and very quiet Friendly and helpful staff very clean air conditioning comfortable beds adequate sized room good bathroom facilities Plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants nearby Lovely building and lovely ambience Would recommend 
426103,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The flusher for the toilet was falling off the wall of our bathroom but we were able to deal with it every time One morning someone came to clean the room at 8 30am or so and it was fine but we were woken up by it and it was just a bit too early , The room was fairly basic but considering the value and location it was more than enough We were really only sleeping there we didn t spend much time in the hotel The bathroom was small but it was clean Solid wifi for the time we did spend there too 
426104,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Avoid the 6th floor if you want to sleep at all during the night The AC settings cannot be changed without the AC starting to beep and buzz and vibrate at very short and irregular intervals Also avoid the night time receptionist an older gentlemen because all he will tell you is that it is your own fault if you have an early departure time and that nothing can be done which is not what you want to hear after a day that started at 5am was full of meetings and knowing very well you need to get up at 5am again no matter how little you have slept , Even though I arrived early the receptionist gave me one of the first available rooms so I could head to my meetings and appointments without a suitcase in tow 
426105,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, We booked for 3 people but only 1 bed in the room The communication was difficult to get an extra bed They happily got us a bed but I m not sure this is common , Great position we were offered upgraded rooms that were renovated and a little larger for not too much more Quiet location You can park in the street for free on weekends Only 5 mins walk through the parks to the centre of old town vienna We only had 1 day in vienna so a perfect spot to explore the city from

426175,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, I booked a executive room for me and my boyfriend when I arrived in the evening and checked in I realised it was 2 single beds pushed together when I asked for a double bed When I called up the next morning I called down to the reception who said that that s the executive room only has 2 single beds and no double bed which I though was ridiculous for a 4 star hotel So they put me in a classic room however explained my mini bar wouldn t be free even though I paid for this benefit with the executive room When I went down to the reception to talk to someone face to face I was ignored for 10mins waiting as the two meme era of staff was on there computer and talking amounts themselves Once I was acknowledge I explained that I still want to the executive privileges that I paid for they then agreed Also breakfast was another disappointment 16 for some cold meats and mediocre hot breakfast would not recommend this hotel unless your happy to put up with the bad customer service and a great location But they re is other hotels with a similar location for less of the price This place is definitely a rip off and when I checked out they tried charging me for a coke from the mini bar which was included in the executive room price Overall a let down, The location was great 2min walk from the Christmas market

426196,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, Super staff friendly and helpful throughout our stay Peaceful location with parking right outside but close to the metro and lots of areas of interest We loved Vienna 
426197,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Parking is a special rate at the local underground public parking room was small and the receptionist while trying his best was unable to upgrade us to a larger one , Great location very close to city centre and next to landmark Rathaus
426198,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Charge of 10 euros if you want tea and coffee making facilities , Staff friendly and accommodating Walking distance to everything Supermarket and restaurants within one block 
426199,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Partial shower doors don t make any sense I guess this is the trend in most European countries but a shower curtain could add so much functionality if a full shower door cannot be afforded , Beautiful room in the city center but away from all the chaos of the city good spread at breakfast very friendly staff and service 
426200,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Double bed was in fact jointed twin bed i e could feel an open space between beds while sleeping , Received extra jam treats in a room upon arrival and a free drink in lobby bar Breakfast is nice Location brilliant 
426201,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Please be carefull with hotel taxi Recepsionist ordered taxi finally we cannot use credit card and had to pay only in cash and driver asked bigger amount than recepsionist said , Breakfast was excelent with clasical music 
426202,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Though there was nothing wrong with the room and the lift worked well enough I d have preferred not to be on the top floor , The location It was literally just behind the Rathaus and in an area where we could walk to many attractions The whole area was full of magnificent buildings Hotel was clean staff were friendly and helpful and the room only deal was good value for money 
426203,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, In general the amenities were expensive room service parking and breakfast is rather high Also the parking lot is rather far about a 6 minute walk to the hotel , Wifi is good room was comfortable and staff was super friendly 
426204,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Room was quite small and poor sound proofing Air conditioning didn t work and couldn t get fixed since it was a weekend, Very good breakfast choice Helpful reception staff giving us good restaurant recommendations
426205,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and I like how clean all was Walk in shower was fantastic easy to handle Little Zum Loefeln was very nice too 
426206,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Nothing it was great , Nice hotel in a great location very close to the town hall only a 15 minute walk to the Hofburg palace The room was spacious and very clean with all the amenities you d need Breakfast was a good spread pastries bread cheese sausages eggs bacon fruit cakes cereals Would definitely stay here again 
426207,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, I got some hives on my back in the morning after the second night a skin rash it looked like an insect had bit me , I loved Lemar the receptionist who went the extra mile to help me I forgot my phone charger at home and he gave me his own to use for the whole of my stay Thank you again Lemar 
426208,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Would be nice if the staff could advise properly that although parking is free around the hotel on weekends there is a restriction that left side of the street is restricted to residents only right side parking is available free ,No Positive
426209,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, Cannot say enough good things about the staff Sonja on the front desk was amazing friendly helpful and just a pleasure to talk with Then Kathi was so helpful too she even called a pizza place for us to have it delivered to hotel They were all just so easy and friendly to work with Great job ladies 
426210,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No parking Additionally when we asked about where to park the guidance was vague and we got a 30 Euro ticket This hotel needs a map of nearby public parking instead of just telling guests See that building there There should be parking around there , Comfortable rooms decent location good breakfast buffet 
426211,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Only thing that was a minus was the warm rooms There was an air conditioning system but it still felt very warm We went in April and it was very warm outside too , Great location modern clean and very large room Reception very helpful pretty much cannot fault it ticked all the boxes for a city break 
426212,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Carpets in rooms are quite dated , Location was excellent for anyone participating in or spectating the marathon as it is very close to thetown hall and the finish line Quiet but central location Parking was easy when we arrived on Friday night as we could park on the street outside Check in staff very friendly Hotel would be fine for a business trip 
426213,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, breakfast too expensive so went to different cafes in vienna instead which we enjoyed, this hotel was well positioned to metro station in a quiet area of vienna traditional hofbrauhaus close by will have no hesitation in staying here again 
426214,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Not wort that value of money 190e for two night without brekfast is too much money for this hotel , Location is good near to uban station and 1 3km from Stephanplaz free parking 
426215,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The room was under the roof quite cold and not that dark but with a nice view on the outside if you re tall enough to reach the window , Great position and value for money
426216,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, The hotel has its warm and comfortable athmosphere The stuff is absolutely amazing especially Natalia from the reception was extremely helpful in all the requests starting from destinations to visit finishing with booking beautiful places for dinners Everyone is friendly and nice 
426217,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The quality was not of a four star hotel The blankets in the double bed were separated , The location was close to the city center and to the subway stop The staff was kind and always ready to help 
426218,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The bed was very very unconfortable extremely small room in Wien you can find more hotels for the same value closer to the centre parking is in the public garrage Staffs are very nice , Just a breakfast was fine 
426219,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Standard room is pretty small there was hardly enough space for two , Really nice and friendly staff very good location 5 minutes from the Rathause and Christmas market Room looked quite cosy though we expected it bigger Good breakfast too 
426220,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No one to help with the luggage No kettle to boil water on the room and no tea or coffee maker they will ask for 10 EUROS per day for them No place to park your car in all the street in front of the hotel , Location is not the best location in Vienna but it s good enough Wireless is very good 
426221,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, I did not like the fact that the walls were so thin you could hear EVERYTHING We had a crying sick child next door heard everything all night for 3 days Also parking is a few blocks away not on property as advertised not very clear as to where to park We paid 80 for 2 days Alot of money , I liked the location of this hotel i LOVED the breakfast buffett We paid 16 each every morning it was worth it It was clean spacious Great place 
426222,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, Perfect location extremely close to the biggest Christmas market in Vienna as well as being a 5 minute walk from the centre of the city Very nice room staff were extremely friendly overall service very swift and hassle free Brilliant Hotel Would visit again 
426223,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Staff was a bit stuffy and pro forma with their service For example when asked to break a large euro cash bill they declined saying they didnt have enough cash onhand Really , Quiet location despite being well located near center city Nice amenities Good beds 
426224,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The room was really tiny ok for one or two nights but not more The breakfast was more or less ok however taking into consideration price of 125 Euro per nignt you expect a little bit more usually , The location is good enough As the main purpose was to visit Rathaus Christmas Market it was really convinient to do from here 10 15 minutes by foot 
426225,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, Breakfasts were excellent very good choice of well cooked and prepared food Rooms were comfortable and warm Good choice of bathroom extras Quick lift 
426226,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, After paying a high price due to the location and high demand for the Christmas Market which is understandable I was charged 10 per day for the use of a kettle which was absurd We had our 8 month old daughter with us and we needed hot water for her bottles The fact that we were charged for the kettle was just unfair and shallow It ruined my whole experience with this hotel chain , Location was great next to the Rathausplatz for the big Christmas Market
426227,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Pictures of the rooms are very very deceiving We were shocked at how small the rooms are compared to what the pictures show Staff argued that the description of the room says how many square meters the room is which doesnt make much sense as I don t know anyone who says I booked a 25m2 room in a hotel but I know a lot of people that say the hotel website has amazing pictures I booked it I suggest to put realistic pictures or remove them We were offered a 10 discount for a future booking it won t happen We would have been happy if a discount was offered for this stay not the next one , The location was great staff was nice hotel was is beautiful like all of Vienna 
426228,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien,No Negative, Hotel is well situated within 15 mins walk of the town centre but near to the park in a relatively quiet location The buffet breakfast was very excellent great value for money 
426229,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Some communication problems with a delivery I was receiving Little things took the polish off the otherwise elegant hotel unless super careful the shower could leak all over bathroom soap dispenser kept falling off the wall no iron in room Why are hotel laundries so expensive , Really easy to get around the city from here 
426230,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Room was non smoking but smoke kept coming under the door from other rooms No electricity socket in bathroom Very small shower with taps on the narrow walk so when I turned round in the shower I would often know the tap making the water very hot or turning it off Very small room which was ok if room had been was a bit cheaper Cetnral location bit not much happening on streets around the hotel as mostly business area , Staff very responsive Breakfast good Clean and tidy Free wifi 
426231,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No central light only few lamps Only 3 power sockets per room all occupied with lamps so inconvenient if you need to charge several devices at the same time Cleaning service was just awful though manager tried to appologize , Location of this hotel is really good as well as the sunrise view if you re lucky to get room with windows facing Rathause street 
426232,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, A hotel without a soul A generally speaking cold feeling The bottle with liquid soap in the bathroom was empty OK there was another in the shower Poor number of TV channels , Locaton is perfect Hotel is clean room was OK Breakfast within expectations Very friendly staff A big flat TV monitor 
426233,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Room a little bit small , Near the rathaus and Hofburg walking distance to most of the tourist sites in the old town Clean hotel and helpful staff Wifi is ok 
426234,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, The staff was not all smiles and helpful The garage was quite far away There was a few road blocks that day and it made it more difficult to get to the garage and the staff handled it just matter of factly and we had to detour another 10km to get back It s not that near the center of the city about 20 30 mins walk And the staff didn t give directions on how to get there besides walking we have an elderly couple in our group and an infant more directions and instructions would have been appreciated , It was comfortable It has air conditioning and the area was nice and safe
426235,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, they were rude and had lack of information about the town they told us if we want to bring yr luggage to yr room we charge u 5 Euro and lots more we said we need a hot water please give us atleast a coffee maker and they said 10 Euro more and lots more at first the gave us very bad and small room because we said we paid room with air condition and they said this is it with yr price we paid 150 Euro per night for 3 nights 448 Euro and they said hotel is 4 star, the place were good because were so close to everything 
426236,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Uniform of personel that wear in breakfast time I saw I feel they looked untidy and hadn t good shap Even simple white clothes looks better , Easy resarvation very clean room good personel very clean publice toillet with nice music 
426237,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, I had a bit more expensive room but whatever I tried rooms open and fan on it was impossible to get it slightly cooler in the room Airco was only an option on the topfloor under the roof, staff was very helpfull and kind location really close to U bahn
426238,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, the room was too hot no AC and when I asked for a room with AC they said they didn t have any Sleeping there for three night with no AC was difficult , Very respectable and friendly staff
426239,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No air conditioning, Good location comfortable bed and room big windows amazing breakfast nice staff and possibility of leaving lugagge before checkin
426240,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, one lady of the staffs is especially horrible My friend was ill and need some hot water She asked for 10 EURO pro DAY to rent an electric kettle Then we just asked her to give us a pot of hot water She said ok but only for this time tomorrow is not possible with a very arrogant attitude The worst service we have ever met in EU Such kind of staff doesn t match 4 star hotel at all , Location is good Near the metro
426241,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, No air conditioning in August Staff is nice but not very helpful They changed a room with air conditioning the second night after several requests in the reception , 15 mins to city center 5 mins to metro Spacious room 
426242,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Rooms in the hotel apart from sixth floor are NOT air conditioned which is disappointing as it is a very good hotel , Location and breakfast was good
426243,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Only downside was no airconditioning but fans were supplied and there were big windows , We liked how central it was and how beautiful the hotel was Really clean really friendly 
426244,Austria Trend Hotel Rathauspark Wien, Given a room someone was already in Upgraded to new room but air con didn t work It was 36 C at 9pm in the middle of a heat wave Parking is actually on the street not private , Staff did their best to handle a comedy of errors They were polite and helpful
