212473,The Sumner Hotel, the price that I was quoted online when I reserved the room was NOT the price that I was charged I was actually charged almost 100lbs more than I was supposed to be this is quite annoying and frankly it is NOT good value for what you obtain for that price I would have booked a more up scale hotel small additional annoying issue the pillows are massive but impossible to sleep on since they are foam and do NOT give so after the first night I had to make my own pillow from a towel and sweaters the tea at breakfast was so weak it was horrible and the coffee tasted horrible also my bathroom door jammed shut and I could not use it one morning and had to leave and asked the hotel staff to repair it good thing I was NOT locked inside , the staff were very nice and very polite 
212474,The Sumner Hotel, The bed was saggy seemed worn out , We were delighted with the breakfast buffet the warm and friendly staff members made genuine hot chocolate for my daughter upon request Our top floor room faced the back and was very quiet 
212475,The Sumner Hotel, Nousy Room in the basement despite had requested as preference in the booking reservation an upper floor and quite room Breakfast very poor with cheap industrial products, Nothing
212476,The Sumner Hotel, Limited cupboard space not enough for two people The promised consigner service non existent Could not get a knowledgeable answer to any question asked and even got a very misleading information, The room comfortable with large comfortable bed Bathroom modern and well equipped Very good breakfast Good location 5 minutes walk from marble Arch underground station 
212477,The Sumner Hotel, External traffic noise all night breakfast was a plus but felt the serving area for multiple guests gets crowded , Excellent welcome courteous staff and very well located Comfortable spotless room 
212478,The Sumner Hotel,No Negative, We had an excellent stay at The Sumner Hotel Amazing location Walking distance to everything Excellent public transport links The hotel was really nice small boutique feel The breakfast was lovely and a nice bonus 
212479,The Sumner Hotel,No Negative, Staff were extremely helpful We ended up here after being stranded by the BA computer failure so we needed some assistance Would definitely stay here again 
212480,The Sumner Hotel, I felt it was a bit far from the evening entertainments 2 trains from West End , Hotel was a lovely townhouse on a quiet street Breakfast was great staff was good and helpful rooms were clean and spacious About 4 blocks from Tube Neighborhood felt very safe Good location close to Wallace Collection Marble Arch Hyde Park and Oxford St shopping 
212481,The Sumner Hotel, Would have been nice to have Tea coffee making facilities in room , Boutique hotel in a great location just 2 minutes walk from Hyde park Marble Arch and the underground 10 minute walk from Oxford Street and easy access to anywhere in London Room was small but comfortable Mini bar and TV neither of which we used Lovely shower in bathroom Breakfast was nice in the basement dining area The lady serving was fabulous going the extra mile to provide my Mum with Gluten free bread on the 2nd morning after only having crackers on the first morning Such a lovely touch 
212482,The Sumner Hotel, The hot water was adequate but a little erratic Better mixing valves might help , Location is great Just a few short blocks from Marble Arch and the Central line The breakfast room is bright and cheerful and the food selection is varied and good There are a dozen restaurants within a block or two many reasonably priced The staff were VERY helpful and friendly The rooms are reasonably sized for an old London hotel but don t expect American sized rooms 
212483,The Sumner Hotel, The plug in the wash basin did not work and the shower was poor but the water was lovely and hot , Everything and everywhere looked sparklingly clean and tidy 
212484,The Sumner Hotel, From the reviews I was expecting a haven but it didn t quite meet our expectations The room though large for London was a bit dated with no frills though it had a vey small modern shower room and toilet which unfortunately had a leak so we ended up with wet feet There were warning signs all over the walls I m all for health and safety but it made the room feel a little unwelcoming Why install a slippery floor in the bathroom No tea making facilities but you could request complimentary tea and coffee in your room I particularly dislike having to request a cuppa so didn t bother This approach seems to be quite common with chains but very unusual for a boutique hotel Our room was quite noisy and the curtains didn t close properly so it wasn t that peaceful overnight Thankfully it was only for one night I am always hoping to find a little gem of a place I can return to when I m in the capital I m afraid I m still looking , The hotel was in a convenient location with easy access to the underground The hotel is very nice from the street and throughout the public areas with a very bright comfortable lounge I didn t have much interaction with staff other than check in check out so can t really comment on that aspect but from what I experienced they were quite pleasant The bed and pillows were comfortable but the duvet was strangely on the small side There were USB chargers in the room and for foreigner travellers adapters The towels were soft and fluffy Breakfast was adequate usual b b fair They did serve a selection of different types of milk and as someone who doesn t drink cows milk it was very nice to see 
212485,The Sumner Hotel, Curtains that closed , The room was clean and tidy although the one curtain didn t shut properly and we had to use a clip to keep the curtain closed Very good value for money especially as it was just a five minute walk to Marble Arch tube station 
212486,The Sumner Hotel, I didn t realise that our room and the dining room would be in the basement so we didn t get a lot of natural light The decor of the dining room is very basic and doesn t match the luxury of the rest of the hotel , The room was a nice size with a really comfy bed 
212487,The Sumner Hotel, At the end of our stay we still didn t understand how the shower actually worked We think that something was wrong with it , We liked the location in the city center but yet quiet The breakfast was very good with fresh fruits like grapes strawberries etc We staff was very friendly and helpful The room was nice and cosy The salon was nicely decorated and had an Apple computer and a lot of literature 
212488,The Sumner Hotel, The elevators and stairs connections are a bit unusal and not perfect if you have problems walking in narrow stairs , We arrived late at night nearly 11 o clock and we were warmly welcomed Very good breakfast we think We like to have a bit more than a toast or continental breakfast Not overloaded breakfast table but just enough if you want scrambled eggs bacon or sausages youghurt cornflakes bread instead of toast and a couple more choices No problem asking for coffe in the reseption Very quitely inside the hotel and very little traffic noise from the street 
212489,The Sumner Hotel, Could not open window during the night as street was noisy Cupboard very small Pillows very hard and spongy Step into bathroom lethal although signed , Breakfast was brilliant Lady working in breakfast room was charming and very helpful Staff very friendly in general and ready to serve teas in lounge Location is great Amenities very good Lots of plugs to charge things plus a European plug enabling to charge without adapter 
212490,The Sumner Hotel, Honestly the only complaint that we had was that the room was far too hot But that s about all we didn t like , The room was comfortable the staff really welcoming and helpful particularly at breakfast We also enjoyed the coffee and tea on tap Thoroughly worth it 
212491,The Sumner Hotel, The decoration of the room was into my taste too concervative the living room at the hotel was really beautiful why the same interiation did not continue at the room Also the lightning at the room was too dark, Excellent location Very quiet hotel rooms which is always a bonus 
212492,The Sumner Hotel, Both bedside lamps didn t work and the shower barely got warm and our checkout receptionist had all the personality of the grim reaper Also the door lock was faulty Shame Would we go back Yes But only just , A nice boutique style hotel close to the action Very clean and tidy and classically modern Goid breakfast but needs sausage s 
212493,The Sumner Hotel, Nothing, Great location near Marble Arch really lovely and helpful staff nothing was too much trouble We arrived very early after a very long flight we were able to check in 
212494,The Sumner Hotel, Because it is so small you can hear the people in the hall easily but it was only bothersome if we were trying to take a nap during the middle of the day because of jet lag , Staff was very friendly and helpful Brought tea whenever we wanted and wouldn t accept a tip Housekeeping was very pleasant and quick yet thorough about cleaning Great location small and quiet Actually got the chance to pretend we lived there for a week rather than being tourists 
212495,The Sumner Hotel, nothing that I dislike, excellent location 5 min walk to Marble Arch underground Central line station So many shops including Primark Top Shop Boots etc Very strong wifi all around the room reception Breakfast is rich english breakfast fresh fruits 4 5 cheese options cereals pastries Pub food fine dining deli pastry etc in the next door 
212496,The Sumner Hotel, the check in could have been a little more welcoming, Overall stay was great had a quiet room and space which is not normal in London hotel rooms it was clean breakfast was very tasty and the complementary tea service was a big plus 
212497,The Sumner Hotel, Small and basic Bathroom not worth 200 per night Basement room noisy as next to breakfast room Could hear music talking and clattering around through walls door in the morning Breakfast buffet was very limited , Large Room Central location for Oxford Street Held luggage till evening 
212498,The Sumner Hotel, Bed Hard Breakfast ok but some food a bit out of date basement room very noisy could hear water running all night and people upstairs walking around all night Not anything great to say really Could get better Larger hotel would have been cheaper Its a B B not a hotel ,No Positive
212499,The Sumner Hotel, I was on ther 4th floor so a bit of a pain with the luggage as even though there is a lift it does not go to the actual floor , The room was v warm and had everything you needed The building is a very nice period property 
212500,The Sumner Hotel, the cleanliness and the facility are bad for me to use there are no any boiling kettle and tea bag or cafe bag, the staff here are quite friendly and the quality of the breakfast is good and worthy 
212501,The Sumner Hotel, The rooms are located half floor from the elevator, The location is great near Marble Arch tube station central line and oxford street the breakfast was exactly what we needed to start our day The hotel is very clean and stuff was very helpful 
212502,The Sumner Hotel, There are about 5 stairs from the elevator to the room Problematic for the elderly , Great breakfast great location wonderful staff A bit expencive but worth it 
212503,The Sumner Hotel,No Negative, Lovely hotel room was a good size with a large comfy bed Although near the road it was very quiet Fridge in room but no kettle to make a hot drink but the staff are happy to supply you with complimentary hot drinks brought to your room complete with a biscuit The buffet breakfast was delicious and set you up for a days exploring Spent 2 nights at the hotel for my husbands birthday and it was ideally situated to do lots of sight seeing and within walking distance to many Would definately return and recommend 
212504,The Sumner Hotel, Beds were a bit creaky but still comfortable Personally would have preferred tea and coffee making facilities in the room , Brilliant location for shopping theatre and transport Beautiful lounges and the rooms were spacious Tea and coffee available anytime in the lounges or delivered to the room 
212505,The Sumner Hotel, Nothing I can think of , Overall excellent Second visit and will certainly go again Very secure and if alone you will be confident that you will be safe 
212506,The Sumner Hotel, No tea making facilities but service was very quick when we ordered tea , The staff were very friendly and very helpful We received a very warm welcome when we arrived 
212507,The Sumner Hotel, No kettle in the room Staff were willing to bring hot drinks to the room Being able to make a drink when needed makes a place more relaxing and comfortable , Convenient location 
212508,The Sumner Hotel, We were misled by the rave reviews we read and the description of the hotel as luxurious and designer decorated The room was small The mattresses were soft and uncomfortable There was a tiny wardrobe no shelves or drawers We lived out of our suitcases for which there wasn t really room for 4 days The room had ironing facilities but no kettle The bathroom was also very small with a tiny shelf , The location was great The staff were helpful The room contained fridge 
212509,The Sumner Hotel,No Negative, The Sumner is in a great location Marylebone neighborhood near Hyde Park and Oxford Street I stayed here for a 7 days and was able to get around without any issues the Marble Arch Underground station is a 5 minute walk away There are also plenty of restaurants nearby as well The hotel itself is cozy and quaint and you ll literally wake up to the smell of bacon from the breakfast room downstairs with a good selection to start your day and super friendly staff The room isn t huge but has plenty of space for solo travelers or couples I stayed on the third floor at the rear of the building and the noise level outside and within the hotel was practically non existent after 9pm so you ll absolutely get the sleep you need The bathroom has all the amenities you d expect and the shower is one of the best I ve used in Europe so far Only small downside was no iron ironing board provided in the room I also have to mention that the hotel staff is exceptional in their service I had a minor dispute on my check out folio and they gladly corrected the issue while being back in the states I highly recommend this hotel for any first time travelers to London 
212510,The Sumner Hotel, One time our room door was left unlocked closed but ajar by the cleaning lady Luckily during the cleaning we were having breakfast and returned to our room before we left sightseeing so it wasn t open for long and nothing was missing Perhaps just by mistake We told this at reception they apologized , The room was really nice clean stylish roomy Comfortable bed quiet room to the inner court Nice breakfast friendly staff 
212511,The Sumner Hotel, Breakfast was cold as we were first in dining room at 0730 couldn t think why it should be Didn t have time to wait for replacement hot food Also my sister left a small mirror in room 208 and despite 3 phone calls and promises to ring back she is still waiting , Friendly staff Great location 
212512,The Sumner Hotel, The room was tired Curtains didn t quite lose properly Sheets were stained clearly hadn t been changed from previous occupant so I had to sleep on top of the duvet No bath , Good location Friendly staff

212517,The Sumner Hotel, Buffet breakfast had been standing too long Room bar although well stocked with spirits there were no mixers Would have appreciated tea coffee making facilities in room, Superb location Friendly helpful staff Good room service
212518,The Sumner Hotel, Having tea coffee making facilities in the room rather than having to ring reception and then they were brought up to room , The size of room furnishings and great towels Availability of limosine from hotel to Heathrow Airport for 55 pounds Plenty of eating places nearby especially Paul s patissiere 
212519,The Sumner Hotel, A bit noisy you can hear room above you but I guess its due old building , The location is just perfect 5 minutes walk from Oxford street The breakfast was really nice and all people were nice there The room was clean and quite big 
212520,The Sumner Hotel, The chap manning reception could have done with a little bit more customer service training a more sullen individual i have never come across , excellent location friendly lady on check in good standard of breakfast 
212521,The Sumner Hotel, No toast or toaster provided but I m just being picky , Breakfast was lovely plenty of fresh fruit Well laid out Tray of tea with tea cake delivered to our room much appreciated Didn t have time to use the small lounge area but looked very inviting abd comfortable with plenty of magazines and newspapers 
212522,The Sumner Hotel, the breakfast was good but the bread could be more fresh and a better coffee , the location was brilliant the hotel was small but very well look after clean and comfortable I would definitely stay here again 
212523,The Sumner Hotel, Basement room avoid at all costs Like a sweat box Choose between noisy air conditioning or silence and heat Shower was useless Scalding hot shower head kept flicking up into my face then a tiny towel Breakfast poor soulless little room scrambled eggs watery bacon part undercooked and part overlooked This is a guest house dressed up It is not as someone said elsewhere the best hotel in London For those who don t know a good hotel when they see one ask yourself why this is available when everything else is full , Not a lot Spacious room and good location 
212524,The Sumner Hotel, I was on a business trip and my meetings always started at 8 am Breakfast only started at 7 30 Since I also had to consider travel time etc it was just too late for me I like to have breakfast usually not later than 6 30,No Positive
212525,The Sumner Hotel, Our room rate included breakfast The choice was not huge but it was more than acceptable There were no tea coffee making facilities in the room but complimentary teas coffees could be ordered from reception , Very welcoming staff Our room on the top floor was large and air conditioned The bed was huge and comfortable The windows could be opened The bathroom was on the small side but very clean It had only a shower There was a good sized guest lounge on the ground floor

212529,The Sumner Hotel, Access to to our own tea making facilities It would of made a massive difference , The location of this hotel and a few local pubs cafes close by made it a great location Loved the size of the room the bed room temperature Staff couldn t do enough for you they were helpful knowledgeable The breakfast was plentiful fresh

212531,The Sumner Hotel, I have stayed in this hotel in the past and enjoyed it I was really disappointed this time as I asked for a high floor and got a basement room with one window facing a wall under the sidewalk I understand they ran out of availability but I would expect from such a level hotel to let me know if all they have is a basement room after I requested a high floor and this room is priced like all other rooms expensive Worse was the insulting approach of the lady in the reception who was trying to convinced me that this is the best room in the hotel and the man in the reception the following morning when I checked out ask me how was my stay but when I explain my agony about my stay didn t really care to listen and just said sorry to hear , This hotel has good location
212532,The Sumner Hotel, A Kettle in the room but I was told we could have tea on request at any time but I like the kettle in a room, Excellent location very clean lovely welcoming staff nice breakfast

212536,The Sumner Hotel, Had a few problems during my stay a male member of staff scared the pants out of me trying to close my door at 1 30 in the morning apparentely I left it open not so sure as doors close automatically without anouncing himself at all all I heard is my door rattled and opening so I thought the worse they apologised the next day and moved me to another room I was in the basement first which was scary anyway as I could see people from my bed walking past throught the gap in the window but no other concessions or compensation was offered for my distressed a whole night of no sleeping as I was petrified as I woman travelling on my own I need to feel safe where I stay and unfortunately I didn t Breakfast room was very hot in the morning aircon was on but not sufficient New room given wasn t very good the aircon leaked from the roof onto the carpet all the time I think this was a recurrent issue as the carpet was higher in the part of the room from the start WIFI was pretty bad as well Would have also liked to have coffee tea facilities in the room rather than having to bother staff in the middle of the night if you fancied a brew , Lovely big bed nice big rooms Very central location

212540,The Sumner Hotel, For my personal preference the bed was a bit too hard but I appreciate that it hard to please everyone Also it would have been nice if the woman in the breakfast room had greeted us when we went down to breakfast at first I couldnt even tell she was a member of staff , The hotel was lovely the room was a reasonable size for such a central location and it felt very safe and secure The wifi was excellent I would definitely go there again 
212541,The Sumner Hotel, The description of the hotel reads that it has modern decor and up to date fixtures It may be up to date relative to worn buildings in area but the rooms were dull and lifeless Cleanliness was ok lounge area good to ok Our room faced the street and it was noisy The breakfast was awful and the breakfast room drab The desk was not that helpful in answering touring questions Will not stay there again, The location was good Around the corner there are several nice places a couple of bakeries pizza and good restaurant Easy to access Tube and sightseeing buses

212581,The Sumner Hotel, Absolutely nothing , The room was very comfortable clean and modern We had Dinner at Le Gavroche for my husbands birthday which was the main reason we picked this hotel a mere 8mins walk away perfect The hotel lounge was very pleasant and we had complementary tea and coffee in there The hotel exceeded our expectations 
212582,The Sumner Hotel, No hot water for most of the time we were there in room 101 the excuse always was we will turn the boiler on it seemed to us the Indian owners were trying to save money by not having it on at all times, location was good as was the general ambience
212583,The Sumner Hotel, We spent the first night in a room located in the basement The room was very large but a bit noisy After we changed room it was great , The crue was very friendly Breakfast was great The room was very large and clean 3 minutes from Oxford street 
212584,The Sumner Hotel, Didn t find the breakfast was necessary I think it is good as an option with an additional charge It would have been nice to have the nightly fee reduced by the cost of the breakfast Also there was limited hot water If you showered after the majority of the guests you had tepid water , The hotel was quite quaint We enjoyed the location and the friendly staff 
212585,The Sumner Hotel, The bed itself was a bit saggy in the center Not the most most comfortable for my back The wi fi was not consistent But both minor details on otherwise an excellent stay Thank you , Excellent location and the staff was really friendly helpful and welcoming The room was large and perfect for a work trip as I had to work in the room a bit The lounge in the lobby is very cozy and welcoming to just sit and relax for a cup of tea 
212586,The Sumner Hotel, Although polite the staff were somewhat distant and it felt like they were going through the motions and had no personal interest in us When we were leaving doors were not held open and there was no offer to help with getting a taxi The process for tea and coffee was explained you need to ask for it to be made and brought to you However the onus is on you to request and specify the drinks rather than for it to be offered which might make some people uncomfortable Hot chocolate I think is charged Our drinks came with one M S chocolate teacake each would have expected a plate of biscuits Breakfast is a little disappointing There is a limited English breakfast selection already cooked and warmed bacon mushrooms baked beans and two types of cooked egg No toast although you might have to ask for it An interesting selection of fresh bread cheeses and cooked meats The pastries look like those from M S rather than freshly made from the artisan bakery round the corner , The location is excellent a couple of roads behind Marble Arch and near Edgware Road There are lots of nice restaurants and cafes nearby The room was very clean with shampoo and bath gel provided and other things like toothpaste available on request When asked tea coffee was provided promptly and freshly made 
212587,The Sumner Hotel, Due to the structure of the property you may need to go up a flight of stair about 5 6 steps to your room even with the lift I m very sure the staffs will help if you have difficulty with that , The staffs are so friendly service is excellent Although the buffet breakfast spread is not fantastic but it is prepared with love and great efforts 
212588,The Sumner Hotel, The breakfast was great and the ONLY small thing we can think of was that the service could be more proactive in looking at the tables We had to ask for toast and to clear our dishes away Just small thing but she acted straight away with a smile , The staff service and the central location were excellent Room was very clean and comfortable A wonderful stay and we will be back
