233504,H tel Bel Ami, View from room was tarpan on opposite building But sound proof windows prevented all sounds , Bed comfy Lots of free extras where kids checked in Clean efficient and comfortable 
233505,H tel Bel Ami, I know that s not something you can change but our room was very small and the same applied to our friends room We could hardly open our two not too big suitcases , I loved all the beautiful art pieces hanging around the hotel and also the overall ambienceof the The brunch on the weekend is superb 
233506,H tel Bel Ami, Air con broken during heatwave throughout duration of stay Staff didn t care and didn t offer anything to make things right Only left a letter on the door saying they were sorry about the situation Temperature in room was nearly 90 degrees F Unacceptable for this level of hotel,No Positive
233507,H tel Bel Ami, The view was not brilliant We did not eat in the hotel as we preferred to breakfast outside , The staff were all very pleasant Particular mention should be made of the concierge Henri who was able to recommend a good place to eat and book it for us Would definitely recommend this hotel 
233508,H tel Bel Ami, I have complained about it before and I will do it this time For a 5 STAR HOTEL I should expect a bottle of water complimentary daily AND a coffe tea facility in the room It must be the ONLY city in the world that does not provide their clients with it a bit stingy don t you agree , Location location location great hotel in the heart of saint germain de pres a minute walk from the famous cafe de Flore caf de deux magots L Entrecote and many more restaurants cafes and shops in one of the best suburbs of Paris Staff was very helpful with bookings and information The room was a decent size considering the closet size one normally finds in the city of life Bathroom even better A plus is the fitness center of whitch we used the sauna after a long day of walking and it was faboulous Breakfast was included and it was ok I have stayed before and I will do it again Highly recommend it 
233509,H tel Bel Ami, Though well appointed and nicely decorated our room was very small without a view If we had stayed longer than two nights with plans to spend more time in the room I would have asked to change But since we were there for such a short stay I didn t say anything so that s really on me , The location is absolutely ideal particularly for a short stay It is just steps from the Cafe de Flore and Les Deux Magots The lobby and bar are very pleasant and the service is outstanding 
233510,H tel Bel Ami, what s not to like but if i have to think of something i would say i am not mad about the perfume used in the passages leading to bedrooms I don t think it is necessary to have this , I particularly like the staff at the hotel who are extremely polite and very helpful and always willing to help with arrangements taxis and umbrellas if it s raining I am also mad about the moving artwork behind the concierge desk 
233511,H tel Bel Ami, Small point For a hotel at this level of ratings and cost I would have expected to have a coffee maker in the room or free coffee in the lobby Room was on the small side but not unexpected for a big European city , Excellent location and friendly staff 
233512,H tel Bel Ami, I really don t like their style of shower with a partial glass shield and a badly oriented showerhead almost guaranties wet sometimes soaking wet floors , well maintained very modern hotel with fairly spacious for Paris room in great location who can beat St Germaine 
233513,H tel Bel Ami, The desk in the room is not a desk The tv screen covers the desk so you will be unable to open your laptop This is not what you expect in a so called 5 star hotel Classification is overrated Also in the public area there is not a good spot to work , The location is great In the heart of St Germain des Pr s although very quiet 
233514,H tel Bel Ami, Standard rooms were very small Our room had a used towel and a dirty bathtub when we arrived but we were upgraded when we complained , 6th Arr and St Germain are great neighbourhoods and the hotel is in the epicentre 
233515,H tel Bel Ami, Small room but it s normal for the rive gauche and you forget about it as the space is well designed , The hotel is a trendy design hotel and its location is the best you can get in the middle of St Germain but in a quiet road Staff very responsive to all our comments Bed is comfortable and for a small room the space is well managed 
233516,H tel Bel Ami, The fitness center is quite small Slow lifts , Very good and pleasant place in boulevard saint germain Nice rooms and staff Very good breakfast buffet Probably more a 4star hotel for Parisien standards 
233517,H tel Bel Ami, The spa facilities are not significant , Hotel location is great Staff are super nice and helpful Hotel decoration is marvelous Breakfast is wondeful 
233518,H tel Bel Ami, The whole hotel is stinking from perfumes The staff refused to help to lower the toxins perfumes in the air even after i explained I got very sic from it I got a room with a loud fan outside The staff was very arrogant about it and refused to hep me to an other room without getting payed 100 Eros for it They said they had no rooms available but there was four room of the same type on booking com and several of other types , Is located in a nice area but I would choose an other hotel without stinking perfumes and with staff that knows to behave towards customers Breakfast nice thou and also breakfast staff 
233519,H tel Bel Ami, Very unfrenddly reception i asked him if the room was ready and the ansewer was im busy now i cant talk to you and he never came back to let me know if the room was ready not profecional at all Very small and noizy room Very bad quality of food in the restuarant we paid 140 euro for two pasta the worst dinner of ourt trip , Very clean room
233520,H tel Bel Ami, Beverages and food items were expensive shower was dangerous to get in and out of, Cleanliness and staffs desire to please the guests lovely boutique type hotel
233521,H tel Bel Ami, They assured me how they make sure I get my ideal room in a welcome email since this was my bday and a romantic getaway but room so plain lifeless and DEAD with aweful view , The neighborhood
233522,H tel Bel Ami, There is literally nothing that we didn t like , The hotel was beautiful clean and comfortable The room featured several little special touches that made it feel homey and chic All of the staff people we encountered were helpful and warm 
233523,H tel Bel Ami,No Negative, It is an amazing hotel I loved everything location comfort services friendliness of the staff and vegan options on the menu One of the best hotels I have stayed in Paris will definitely come back 
233524,H tel Bel Ami, excessively high priced extras food beverage services untrained clueless waitress in bar ground floor bar staff drifting through the afternoon in small conversation groups instead of attending to service cleaning at the 5 star standard,No Positive
233525,H tel Bel Ami, There was nowhere to sit in our otherwise comfortable room except the bed , The desk saff bell staff and concierge desk were extremely helpful and attentive The location is perfect We will go back 
233526,H tel Bel Ami, the card reader in the elevator is balky Fob system would be better , The room was recently renovated and was very nice Bed was super comfy Given its location and the staff of the hotel who are great I will definitely keep coming back to this hotel 
233527,H tel Bel Ami, no tea making facilities in room only coffee but hotel are already addressing this matter, location of hotel superb experienced staff comfortabe size of hotel
233528,H tel Bel Ami, We were put in a corner room which shares a door with another room So we practically heard everyone coming in and out which made it seem like they were walking into our room , Very friendly and hospitable staff Excellent location Clean and nice room 
233529,H tel Bel Ami, Breakfast at 30 euros is pushing it , The location is really excellent St Germain is a wonderful area of Paris Service is top notch but not fawning A different sort of five star hotel The price for this level of hotel is competitive 
233530,H tel Bel Ami, Can honestly say nothing I didn t like, Loved the room Was new and great young and funky interiors staff was always helpful and spent 5 nights there My friend ended up staying with me and was great All the facilities in the room coffee water Were great
233531,H tel Bel Ami, Some one from house keeping kept on knocking on the door all mornig since i was a sleep i did not reply to the door all the suden she just walked in the room while i was steel in bed ,No Positive
233532,H tel Bel Ami, There was nothing negative to mention with the exception that the rooms are small but they are well designed Also in a big city the likes of Paris one would expect that the rooms would be smaller , The Bel Ami was a great stay we were there 5 nights and found that it is perfectly situated for the self sufficient and the not so inclined holiday makers the staff were more than capable of assisting accordingly Very welcoming staff that after check in were more than happy to support when called upon 
233533,H tel Bel Ami, I was told the easiest way to get where I was going was to walk about 200m cross the road and get a cab However on check out I asked them to call a cab and it came quite quickly , Good breakfast good gym
233534,H tel Bel Ami, bedrooms too small for what they cost no coffee maschines inside the rooms employees are rude not a 5 star hotel for me i consider it a 3 5 star dont get the value for your money area is great ,No Positive
233535,H tel Bel Ami, Not enough cupboard space Breakfast could be included for this price, The concierge Louis was wonderful The location of hotel excellent The bed very comfortable Room was a nice size with walk in shower
233536,H tel Bel Ami, The room is too small but clean but the bathroom fixtures like the faucet needs to be fixed i got a broken drain and taking a shower would mean splashing water all over the place because of not effective ahower enclosure For a 5 stars hotel it lacks basic amenities like complimentary bottled water on a daily basis and basic coffee tea compliments, The staffs are very courteous and helpful
233537,H tel Bel Ami, The only thing I would change due to personal pref only this is not a complaint but the bedding could have been softer and I like chocolate on my pillow at night This is all I could really think of because I loved it there , The staff went out of their way every time we requested something for the entire week The concierge was very helpful in booking the Lido trains tours to the cellars and restaurants LOCATION BREAKFAST Healthy options and also options to break your healthy eating habits each day Wait staff beyond friendly Front desk staff wonderful 
233538,H tel Bel Ami, It was unfortunate that i was there while renovation was going on is some rooms it was during the day mainly but management handled that and were apologetic I will definitely come back , very clean modern style hotel room ws small but standard for Paris very clean bathroom andextremely dedicated employees especially Cindy well located in St Germain
233539,H tel Bel Ami, It s not really a dislike but more a warning I booked 2 single beds because I was traveling with my teenage daughter They were in fact 2 single beds but up one against the other This happens often in European rooms In this case there was really no way to distance the beds It was fine for us but I thought I d mention it in case someone is traveling with a person that they don t necessary want to have so close It may be different in other rooms , Everything was perfect We arrived early to the hotel from an overnight flight Our room was not ready so they offered to keep our luggage and take a shower in the spa It s very nice to shower after the flight The room was clean and well appointed The beds were very comfortable This hotel is very very well situated in Paris with easy access to many popular spots 
233540,H tel Bel Ami, The h tel does not provide a 5 star hotel experience with a lot of little detail not up to the standard It is a reasonable 4 star hotel for the service but 5 star for the price Room are small noisy and not convenient The service is average , Good location near saint germain
233541,H tel Bel Ami, The room is small and not a 5 star standard at all The closet is small there is no water kittle or cups You are paying for the location and not the room , The location is fantastic 
233542,H tel Bel Ami, Room small for two people then they added a third bed for my daughter 14 years old a folding bed very unconfortable and there was just no space left to move around The cupboard was broken when we arrived and it took one full day to fix it Really NOT worth the price , Nice hotel friendly staff
