343826,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, Size of room We took a room with a view and it was great decision we could contemplate the city in the afternoon while resting a bit before going out to dinner The hotel is very close to Rijk and Van Gogh Museums 
343827,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Could not get into room and staff knew we were waiting after a long trip They did not inform us and we had to ask if ready yet , Location good and found good restaurants close by
343828,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Would have been nice to look out the bedroom window to see the canal instead of cranes there is nothing I didn t like about NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter , Wonderful staff clean rooms great location 
343829,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Early start breakfast box offered in lieu of full breakfast was poor in quality and value Hotel is a30 minute walk from Amsterdam centre , Quiet location not too busy at breakfast 
343830,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The bed was a bit too firm took a bit of getting used to No fresh milk for tea I wanted to add a bottle of bubbly to the room booking but couldn t do it via the app Not much space to store clothes apart from hanging up space so couldn t unpack everything , The staff Very helpful and friendly We were given the best welcome by the gentleman on reception a lovely lively funny character The room was spacious bright good air conditioning big bed large tv quiet even though we were by the lift Would normally be good views of the canal but there was some construction work going on so the canal was drained but we re civil engineers so interesting view for us still 
343831,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The air conditioner broke down on our first day and was able to be repaired during our three days stay which was unacceptable as the weather was warm hot and the room was very uncomfortable , The accommodation was very good with a clean and spacious room and the staff were very friendly 
343832,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, As in other reviews the hotel is a bit tired in terms of furnishings paint and could use a refresh Our room was very well equipped with a separate make up table and mirror and a roomy washroom with plenty of shelf space , This location was in a quieter part of the city and we were very thankful for that Travel to all attractions was fairly quick either on foot to all the museums or by tram to city center 
343833,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Internet requires payment for videoconferencing No night light Staff reception not well trained forgot whether they did or did not charge for room, Location
343834,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Canal view is full of construction work but nothing to do with hotel, The bed was very comfortable and staff were very friendly and helpful 5 minute walk to Van Gogh museum and tram links to centre 
343835,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The hotel is a bit worn compared to the price I paid for it Currently construction work is also going on outside so the canal is empty and full of construction and at points it was a bit noisy especially as construction started early on a Saturday, Location is superb You are very central but still on a quiet street Payed for a 15 Eur upgrade per night to get a top level room with view This was worth the extra Very nice view except for the construction going on in the canal Staff was very nice and helpful 
343836,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We were disappointed with a view of old bilkes in a skip The deep hole that should have been a canal was a mess and the room needed hoovering in all the corners and up dating , It was close to the museums and canal trip The view was digging in progress for an underground car park as that part of the canal is blocked off The room was large but tired The sink was cracked but clean bathroom 
343837,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We paid extra for a room with a canal view that looked beautiful in the pictures on the website What was not revealed to us until we checked in was that the block in front of the hotel is under construction Our view was of an empty canal except for the cranes and construction material Also noise from machinery was not what we had in mind on our vacation , The staff was friendly and helpful The room was very nice 
343838,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, After long flight I didn t find a bottle of water in my room table it s simple mater and we was have chargeable bottles in refrigerator but i don t like that way water there is very nice please try it Most important when your residence in this hotel you know location of nearest tram line to avoid extra costs for transportation around 7 minutes walking to reach this tram station Overall it was good experience , Location was good far from center station and it s crowded street as well close enough from all what you want to do 
343839,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Construction work on the canal ruining view and creating noise bed was uncomfortable and Gluten Free options limited, Staff were very friendly and helpful on any queries
343840,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, CONFUSION AT PAYING THE BILL I WAS QUOTED A DAILY RATE BY BOOKING COM BUT AT CHECK OUT THE RECEPTION GAVE A HIGHER RATE FOR ONE DAY STATING THAT THEY CHARGE ACCORDING TO THE DAILY OCCUPANCY RATE AND SINCE ON THAT DAY THE OCCUPANCY WAS HIGHER I WAS TO BE CHARGED MORE THAN THE QUOTED RATE STRANGE FIRST TIME I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THAT MORES EARLY RESERVATIONS REDUNDANT BOOKING COM PLEASE INVESTIGATE , GREAT LOCATION 10 MINS WALK TO TWO GREAT RESTAURANTS IN AMSTERDAM RIJK BEHIND THE MUSEUM AND AUBERGE JEAN AND MARIE DIAGONALLY OVER THE CANAL 
343841,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The only strange thing was that the bathroom consistently smelt like someone had been smoking in there I was told this was something to do with the way the air vents are connected , I was upgraded to a suite which was great in terms of space Staff were nice generally 
343842,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The hotel is soul less and charmless The hotel could do with a refurbishment especially the bathrooms and the corridors The breakfast is expensive as is upgrade for early check in The reception staff could sometimes have been more helpful , The bed was large and solid and the bedding was comfortable The wifi was excellent The walls were solid and the curtains thick so the room was quiet and dark at night There was a well functioning safe in the room There was a bath in the room 
343843,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Breakfast selection good but the hot food eg scrambled eggs should have been hotter Bedroom subject to some outside noise Not the hotel s fault but will be more pleasant when canal work is completed , Very happy with our first stay here and look forward to returning in June Very pleasant public areas and nice bedroom Very friendly staff 
343844,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Unfortunately part of the Canal in front of the hotel was undergoing some cleaning or maintenance work otherwise it would have given a perfect view from our room , The location is very good as you can walk to all museums restaurants Dam Square etc Room size is very good by European standard good for a couple Breakfast from hotel was well balanced with healthy choices and good variety of food Staff were all very friendly and helpful 
343845,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, This hotel is outdated and smelled like my grandmothers house There wasn t views of anything Construction ongoing woke me up early The first was mediocre at best , The only good thing was the secured parking Which was public parking 
343846,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Noise of the road work being carried out currently Road is busy still noisy 5 floors up , Large room we had a corner room so huge Clean comfy 
343847,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The breakfast buffet was really good but overpriced , The pastries were tasty and the coffee was amazing The bathtub was also very luxurious and I liked the toiletries The employees also had really good recommendations of things to do that weren t on the main travel sites 
343848,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, the canal in front of the hotel is under construction the view from our window was of a construction area instead of a canal we think there should have been updated information about that fact in booking , staff was very kind and helpful breakfast was good the room was clean and nice the hotel is located close to the museum square not so close to the center of the city we had a very good time 
343849,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, One of the reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful and went out of his way to recommend restaurants and sites to visit The bed was comfortable and the room a decent size

343852,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The bed was quite uncomfortable and mini bar is over priced , The staff were very friendly and very helpful The pancakes at breakfast were extremely tasty 
343853,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The rooms seriously need to be updated especially the carpet I expect more in decor for the price we paid We also ordered room service one night but the food was absolutely terrible When we phoned down to express our concerns with the chef he didn t even care , We arrived at 11 AM after a 10 hour flight but they had a room available and let us check in early The location is walking distance to the museums and parks 
343854,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Pillows were too soft sorry my husband can t sleep on feathers Maid forgot to re stock tea and creamer so we managed without from day 2 onwards Canal works outside meant a building site instead of a tranquil canal but of course there was plenty of canal to see , Great room view tv shower breakfast 
343855,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, nothing to point , All fine however location was particularly suitable because I was going for meetings at the Rijksmuseum if you are on for something else you may prefer a more central location Still this is one of the best parts of Amsterdam Personnel very efficient also printed boarding card immediately 
343856,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Can t think of anything negative really enjoyed our trip, It was my husband s birthday while we were here we were served a glass of bubbly with breakfast Fantastic breakfast which set us up for the morning Definitely use this hotel again

343858,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, Closely located to the museums Vondel Park and the De Pyp area if you are looking for trendy restaurants On the outskirts of the main center so generally quieter 
343859,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Can t think of anything, It was really close to museums so if that is what you are looking for it s a good choice It is also close to a few tram lines so we found it really easy to get around There was also a nice area to eat a few minutes walk away but it wasn t super busy 
343860,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The facilities are outdated especially the bathroom There was a heavy vibration every time we switched on the air con used it for heating as the room was not warm , Good location close to the museums and the tram stop to move around Amsterdam Friendly and helpful staff 
343861,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Would be great to have designated smoking areas as opposed to just outside the front of the hotel The member of staff also couldn t recommend us any restaurants that were good for vegetarians so an increased knowledge of the area for the staff would be be beneficial Also breakfast was 18 each Very expensive in our opinion , The staff were lovely and welcoming The rooms were very clean with comfy beds Facilities were great had no problems there We were on the top floor so the views were amazing Location was also great near lots of cafes and shops and only short walk to tram stops which took you all over the city 
343862,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, I drink green tea in the morning I did not like the green tea Sencha served at breakfast Perhaps consider offering a choice of green teas I found getting into and out of the bathtub a bit of a challenge as I have some issues with stability in slippery surfaces But there were thankfully stability supports attached to the walls , I liked the room very much It had a good design a great view with beautiful windows using agreeable materials I liked the temperature controls which were easy to operate and effective I loved the location It gave us so much flexibility for getting around walking around the canals and visiting the Rijksmusuem The staff were also very friendly and of a very high quality 
343863,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, We like the fact that NH hotels are consistently good The brand is very reliable meaning the staff are always courteous and efficient the rooms spacious and the breakfast surpasses all expectations far beyond anything I have encountered worldwide Many thank yous for a great stay and all the effort that goes into making your successful hotels

343867,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Breakfast too expensive so we went elsewhere City tax on room upgrade wasn t made clear , Excellent room Very good location Friendly reception helpful staff 
343868,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, The staff were incredibly kind Resolved issues with unsoundproofed room immediately by moving us into a room without outside noise They were also prompt in addressing an issue with finding past customers items in room and offered us complimentary breakfast and brought us a gift of stroopwafels Our friends were also staying here at the same time and had to leave early on account of their children and the staff reimbursed them for their cancelled night 
343869,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The furniture and carpet are a little worn but it was cheaper than surrounding hotels of the same caliber My room was clean and the bed was comfortable , 5 minutes walk to Rijks Museum and Van Gogh Museum I had a room 6th floor with a great view of the Old Pipe Oude Pijp region of Amsterdam 
343870,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The amount of towels and toilet paper could have been better There was a plate of food left out in the hall for the 2 days we were there without being cleaned up There was a step going into the bathroom which was a trip hazard , The size of the room was bigger than expected for the money The room was very quiet even with the building work outside The bed was very comfy The telly had a channel with a fire on it to give the room a Christmas atmosphere which was very nice 
343871,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, When booking online nothing was mentioned about paying 50 city tax what ever that is I m still skeptical but what can you do when you want the key to your room , Location is good Tram is literally 2 mins down the road 
343872,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Don t pay extra for a view They are constructing parking garages under the canal Even without the construction view very plain Scent diffuser in the lobby was nauseating , They checked me in early Really appreciated that Very convenient to museums Christiana especially helpful with directions Excellent breakfast buffet 
343873,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, could not improve upon anything one of the best hotels we have stayed in, Breakfast was excellent staff were amazing felt completely at home and there is no better location in Amsterdam 
343874,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The reception area was filthy and positively stank There was a particularly iritating person that assisted us with check in that I found to be patronising and out of touch , We stayed in the best room with a great view over Amsterdam 
343875,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The hotel corridor had a damp smell but the room was pleasantly free of it I am sure if they can keep the room clean and dry they can improve the corridor too The car park did not have a passenger lift , Large Room Short walk to the museums and Concertgebouw Secured car park under different management right under the hotel 
343876,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The hotel does feel a little dated and could do with a face lift Having said that our stay was very comfortable , Staff were very friendly and helpful Room was spacious and comfortable 
343877,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, Staff friendly and helpful Walk from the hotel to the city centre doesn t take long make sure to wear comfy shoes as walking is the best way to see everything 
343878,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We couldn t find bar staff before lunch to enjoy our free drink plus other beverages so we went out , The staff at the check in counter were very helpful We were only there for one night but felt we could have stayed longer to explore 
343879,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, A bit of construction work going on in the canal Not noisy though , Big rooms Amsterdam hotels suffer from small room syndrome but we had a nice big room
343880,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, such a nice place wish we had more nights there close to anything we needed and was just really lovely Nice large room big comfy bed and great shower The only food we had was some late night room service but it was top notch 
343881,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Check in questionnaire was like a test sheet I am a smoker and know that there is no smoking in hotels however I was told I had to smoke outside In the morning I realized that there was a lovely courtyard where you could sit have coffee or cocktails and smoke Although smoking is an unpopular and hot topic simply telling me that the courtyard was available would have been much preferred But we had a wonderful time and I would highly recommend the hotel , Great Great Bed and Best Pillows The room was equipped with everything needed Loved the elevator system as well 
343882,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Though comfortable the hotel is dated and could benefit from a refurbish as the carpets and furnishings in the rooms and corridors are looking a little tired , Breakfast was really good with a great choice Room was quiet and spacious and the hotel is in a great location near a tram stop and only a 10minute walk from some main attractions Van Gogh Museum Rijk Museum Direct bus to the airport stops only a short walk away
343883,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, The staff were welcoming on arrival and the lounge area was comfortable and there were stands with information about the various attractions in the City The room was huge and one side of it was a wall of windows looking out to the top of the Rijksmuseum straight ahead and down on the garden with glass pyramids which were lit up at night We would recommend the higher floors for the best views we were on the 6th The room was spacious and the bed large and very comfortable The bathroom had a full sized bath with a shower attached The TV was large and there was the usual tea coffee making facilities as well as a small fridge mini bar There was plenty of space in the wardrobes cupboards and there was an iron and ironing board not that we used it but it was a thoughtful addition to the facilities There was a fitness suite downstairs and ice making facilities down the corridor The Reception staff were cheerful friendly and very helpful even going online to book our return seats on the plane for us the day before we left Fortunately their English was very good as neither of us spoke any Dutch We found a number of restaurants locally over the other side of the canal and the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum were both within a very short walk from the hotel in the other direction There were busses and trams not far away and apparently the bus usually stops even closer but there are some works going on to build a carpark under the canal so the bus stops a bit further away at the moment The works didn t disturb us at all We would definitely return to the nh Museum Quarter again 
343884,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Room cleanness, Its a nice place but nothing too special Nice breakfast Good location close to museums but keep in mind its a way away from other points of interest 
343885,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable the linen quite nice The breakfast in the morning was really excellent and the staff were so efficient and friendly Everything we needed in a room was there good amenities good housekeeping The front desk personnel were also great They are very close to the Concertgebouw which was our purpose for staying there 
343886,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, There is construction on canal directly in front of the hotel so you do not have the normal view of the canal , Helpful staff comfortable bed great breakfast Quiet area even with construction on canal in front of hotel Easy walk to museums 
343887,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Breakfast is of a high standard but the range of items could be expanded , Big rooms on sixth floor with large glass wall gave great view of local area Very quiet and easy walk or ride to museum quarter and south canal area A reservation error was well resolved by front desk staff Price and location was a good balance between outer areas and the expensive old town hotels 
343888,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The hotel treated me like I wasn t good enough There was a white couple before me that were treated like royalty but when it was my turn I was treated like garbage I won t recommend this hotel if your not white When I asked about a smoking room since I read somewhere that the hotel used to provide them I was given the stink eye and told there are no smoking rooms Talk about an attitude problem I asked if I could have a room with a balcony and was told no directly didn t even search his computer and was given a room on the first floor It was horrible because I felt unsafe as there was a connection to another room from the outside and I like keeping my windows open for fresh air So I couldn t do that either No one told me my package included breakfast so that was out even though in the end I found out that it was included When I went in the room it was marginally better than a 2 star hotel but I found a few pubic hairs in the bathroom I wish I was joking It was disgusting but since I was treated so poorly I didn t want any problems so I stayed quiet My holiday was a nightmare from hell and I wish I had my mom she s better at confrontation than I am I hated my stay there and I would recommend you never stay there Not for the same prices given by better hotels in locations closer to the city center I hope someone from the hotel reads my review and someone gets fired I know that s mean but someone needs to lose their job or I need a refund I didn t spend almost 600 euros to be given the worst room and treated like garbage , Not a thing it was all bad the staff the non existent view the staff the so called cleanliness the staff the location the price and the staff 
343889,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We left something behind but when we telephoned and then emailed we got an immediate response nothing found It was such a prompt response that it was obvious they could not have checked with staff etc It was a pair of dental braces left by a child Hardly something of any value to anyone other than the owner but costly to replace ,No Positive
343890,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, the bar staff were usually non existant which translated to lack of sales that could have been made for the hotel, the central location to both museums and the restaurant district
343891,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Storage space for clothes eg drawers for underwear and folded clothes plus extra hangers in the wardrobe space, Bed was fantastic so comfortable and the linen was also lovely and soft A great selection of food at breakfast Very friendly and helpful staff Great location for the museums and concert hall
343892,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Liked it all , Liked the location close to the museums The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful They gave us an upgrade free on out second stay Good atmosphere Rooms were comfortable and spotlessly clean 
343893,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The pillows and duvet cover And we had problems with the air conditioning but eventually got it to our liking but would prefer to have a window to open instead , The room was a good size and the bathroom was excellent The work on the canal did not bother us at all 
343894,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, It is really expensive Almost 100 euros per night per person is too much high when you can find other accomodations much cheaper , I like the staff cleaness and breakfast
343895,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, For the price we paid and the 4 announced stars I was not happy finding out that the carpet all over the hotel is old stained and smells although the room was good sized everything was old and in need of repairs walls were cracked or had holes carpet was stained all over there was not one single lamp that worked fine and in one case we had to unplug the power cord to turn it on and off the expensive breakfast was just enough with small portions considering the amount of guests and for which you had to wait even to find again some fruit About the cleaning although a message in the bathroom said that to save energy Guests were invited to request the towels exchange only when needed by placing them on the floor we found out that every day for 5 days they were replaced even when we never put them on the floor In addition the hotel should have informed in advance about the works ongoing just in front of it in the canal ,No Positive
343896,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, I was here 6 yrs ago and it looks like even though everything is clean its the same carpet as 6yrs ago and it looks like it needs a change, Breakfast was awesome Location is the best in town 
343897,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The bathroom was not as clean as it should have been The manager was very upset and thanked us for bringing it to his attention Still recommend the hotel , Great location for major museums For first time travelers to Amsterdam suggest you take a one hour canal tour to orient yourself to the city 
343898,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, The beds are not convenient and the wooden chair also was not comfort when you want to seat it your back would hitted by the sharp handles and it had a bad ache that bother your till your brain I recomammend that to change the wooden chair asap to avoid any bad experience for further guests The shifts also were too noisy, The bath room was convenient
343899,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, nothing , stroll from the museum esplanade and Leidseplein full or restaurants and bars There are some works on the canal but hotel windows are really soundproof and you hear nothing It might be a bit dated and deco in need of some freshening up but rooms very comfortable and big

343903,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We had a room on the top floor with a wall of Windows It was very hot and was light from 5AM to 11PM We had to run the AC and keep the drapes closed all the time Also the restaurant left a lot to be desired , The bed was good and the staff was very helpful 
343904,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, I thought it was very over priced per night We booked a standard room through booking com and the pictures shown of the rooms were lovely The room we got was very small with no view and an old bathroom nothing like any of the photos It was compfy but I still thought for what we paid it wasn t worth that money at all , I liked how close it was to everything The location was spot on 
343905,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, We arrived very early before 10 am and although I knew in advance that check in time was at 3pm it would have been nice if they had made an effort to check us in before 3 Instead they did not show any interest to accommodate our early arrival , The location was excellent The museums are just around the corner literally Also there are some lovely restaurants in very close distance Easy access to the tram too

343908,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Upon arrival no effort had been made to follow my booking request for 4 twin rooms and 2 single We ended up with 2 singles a twin and 3 double rooms with uncomfortable put up beds This despite myself and booking com giving clear instructions I was simply advised that rooms are twin or double in this case we have given you double My airing of disagreement met with distain and we were made to wait whilst the receptionist with an air of gruffness arranged a porter to put camp beds in rooms At 250 a night I expect more this hotel was no better than a 100 premier inn back in the UK Expected a far better experience for the cash spent rooms dated and corridors smelt of tobacco on floor 6 , Goodt Breakfast buffet 
343909,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, Height of bath tub could be difficult for guests with disabilities We were extra careful and used the hand holds , Frankly everything was very good We had nothing but positive experiences 
343910,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, They gave us a handicapped room where the bathroom is fully equipped with bars and seats not cosy at all Also the sheet for the duvet was too short and the duvet itself stuck out at the end as it was too long Bedlinnen that fits the bed is the least you can expect for a 4 star hotel Taking the price we paid into consideration we were not satisfied Also room was equipped with a nespresso machine but the two available cups were both decaf not sure why as coffee drinkers prefer their cafeine , Location is perfect It was also nice that we could keep the room till 3pm

343915,NH Amsterdam Museum Quarter, I have a complain with this hotel booking When I have made the booking of this hotel the breakfast was not offered as optional option saying There is no meal option with this room So I could not book the breakfast for 2 persons When we have arrived at the hotel the Receptionist was surprised that we don t have asked for breakfast Of course we asked imediately as usual because we are not eating from the luggage Our surpise was at the end when we had to pay 71 61 for 2 persons 2 days breakfast This is a very tricky way to take more money from the clients which is unacceptable You as Booking com should show that the breafast is so expensive Kind regards Peter Wisky,No Positive
