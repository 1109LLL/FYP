392603,Exe Vienna,No Negative, Very nice staff one of the biggest room I ve ever been in hotel clean and quiet room all hygiene supplies in bathroom Easy to park right in front of the hotel for free Near by U bahn 20min to the center 
392604,Exe Vienna, Stayed here for one night Went to the pool at 10 AM before checkout During these 30 minutes the maid came in and took some of my stuff unopened food in packages rearranged some of my things didn t clean the room Looked like someone broke in so I had to check all my belongings Felt very uncomfortable Reception and maid denied Offered compensation of 7 instead of 10 to have breakfast at their hotel which I of course refused Condition of a 2 star shabby hotel not even close to 4 stars Avoid the hotel that allows their personnel stealing and covers it up ,No Positive
392605,Exe Vienna, Too small room for three persons tiny bathroom poor air conditioning not cooling enough and water was dripping from a c Some equipments wasn t wiped from dust for a long long time windowsill heater wall lamp etc Small elevator , Great breakfast comfortable beds nice views from window 
392606,Exe Vienna, Service at the reception very poor Young blond guy did the misteake in prize calculation twice of course not in our favour He was not nice and arrogant He did not understand english or he didnt want to listen The smell in the room was not pleasant probably previous gests were smokers , Lokalization OK 30 min walk from the downtown 
392607,Exe Vienna, the room was a lot smaller and less cozy than it seemed to be on the pictures same for the pool but that is not surprising It was not bad though but i expected more based on the pictures My partner thought the same , Staff was nice thank you ladies Location is good tram and metro stops are relatively close 
392608,Exe Vienna, We asked for two extra pillows on two separate occasions and didn t ask again as they don t seem to have good communication between reception and housekeeping We had asked for an iron and board the first time we asked for extra pillows Got a brand new iron but they didn t give or maybe didn t have an ironing board The mattress was firm but we slept well as we were pretty tired from our long days exploring Vienna , We stayed in room 503 The room was clean and the hotel was very quiet at night The staff were friendly and helpful We stayed 6 nights and the breakfast was very good We didn t use the gym or pool but can see if people would be upset as pool is quite small 10m X 3m maybe The neighbourhood is safe and the hotel is close to both tram and train lines 
392609,Exe Vienna, Cleaning service waking me up on my last day Sunday around 8 or 9am to ask what time I m going to check out in order for them to plan room cleaning Besides that one service slip I would still recommend the hotel, The location was very good rooms clean and staff at the reception desk very friendly 
392610,Exe Vienna, i booked a double room i end up with a single room and i got charged even extra than the amount ibooked with when i start questioned the manager he was really rude and he didnt give me clear answer,No Positive
392611,Exe Vienna, The room was a bit too warm and the A C wasn t working very good but it was not a big problem , The girl at the reception was very professional she should be an example for many Free apples at the reception 
392612,Exe Vienna, it happend that the room was not cleaned for a day and in another day bathroom missed new shampoos the swimming pool is also small size, Some of staff members were friendly 
392613,Exe Vienna, Pillows acescent food instant coffee capuchino from the coffee machine No possibility to order the parking place , The hotel was pretty good The room was big with comfortable bed but almost uncomfortable pillows The bathroom is a little bit small and with a smell The breakfast you won t be hungry there are hot dishes yogurts possibility to make sandwich etc but The meat for sandwiches wasn t fresh the same with all fruits they were acescent The Coffee capuchino from coffee machine were instant The parking we left the request for the parking place but it wasn t accepted and when we came there were no places But the lady from the reception told us about the parking in 200 m near the hotel And the hotel blocks money on your card so ask them to unblock to avoid double payment 
392614,Exe Vienna, Very noisy room almost impossible to get some rest or relax You could hear everything outside the room like other clients or house keeping service very early in the morning, The room was clean big bathroom good size room good breakfast 
392615,Exe Vienna, The breakfast is rather crowded not easy to find a free table, Good location friendly staff The pool is not heavily used we my son and myself had it for ourselves
392616,Exe Vienna, The air conditioning is not very effective and the bed sheets and towels should be replaced Improving this would make Exe a wonderful place , Breakfast was great and considering the heat in Vienna the swimming pool was a great advantage 
392617,Exe Vienna, Nothing , Nice relatively small hotel Good breakfast Public transport in front of hotel Good wifi Solid breakfast Nice staff Double glass windows for soundproofing All staff speaks Spanish 
392618,Exe Vienna, Parking in the hotel was unavailable due to maintenance Parking space 2 min walking is available for the same fee but have to pay with coins only which was troublesome , Amazing breakfast Street view Close to many shops and markets Friendly and helpful staff 
392619,Exe Vienna, Way of solving issues by hotel management The airconditioning was not working during our three nights stay and this problem was not properly solved I did receive a discount as a gesture and two stand fans only offered at our last night stay But the fact remained that the temperature was to high in the room , Staff was friendly and at the front desk received good information to enjoy Vienna great breakfast very nice swimming pool good parking facility Excellent Wifi connection
392620,Exe Vienna, AIR CONDITION IS VERY OLD AND RATHER HOT DUE TO WINDOW IS LOCKED GYM IS SMALL AND LACK OF GYM EQUIPMENT BUT POOL IS NICE EVEN IT S MUCH MINI, BREAK FAST IS OVER SPECTATION 
392621,Exe Vienna, Unfortunately someone had eaten in the pool and the filter was clogged so the pool had to be serviced while we were there It is not the hotel s fault and they remedied to it as quickly as they could But it was a shame for us , Staff very friendly and helpful Breakfast excellent value at 10 Euros per person Proximity of caf s and small eats really handy and excellent value Proximity to tram stop an added bonus 
392622,Exe Vienna, The room was quite warm even with the heaters off but other than that everything was perfect , The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast was awesome A lot of things to choose from waiters were replacing the empty trays constantly The personnel were very nice and willing to speak any language The location is fine about 30 mins walking from the center which granted a calm area with less noise Public transport and taxi service works great around the hotel s location A complete variety of bathroom items was provided Thank you for everything 
392623,Exe Vienna, The room wasn t cleaned well one day and the swimming pool was out of action for half our stay, Good straightforward hotel that delivered all it promised The room was good and the staff very pleasant and helpful 
392624,Exe Vienna,No Negative, Great hotel which made our trip to Vienna even more wonderful Personnel was extremely helpful and friendly breakfast included a big variety of very tasty dishes and great coffee Hotel also has a gym and swimming pool and a restaurant downstairs Little pleasant things like bathroom robes and slippers completed the wonderful impression
392625,Exe Vienna, pillows were not very good Towels were not changed just picked up from the bathroom floor and folded WiFi password changed every third day , Parking on the hotel inner yard Unexpected wifi not mentioned on the Booking com Some of the speak Spanish so I could practice 
392626,Exe Vienna, Breakfast could start earlier only had 10 minutes before having to head off to work, Good friendly hotel good transport connections was satisfied with the facilities
392627,Exe Vienna, The reason I chose to stay at this hotel was because they had a pool If you look at the picture of the pool it looks amazing When you see it in reality it s very small I went for a swim later on my first day There was a sign up that it was being renovated The pool was closed for my whole 4 day visit The manager gave us 15 off but I was still extremely disappointed The room was very hot at night and the air conditioner fan did nothing I didn t want to open the window because the street below was too noisy , Breakfast was good Staff were nice The tram in front was very convenient 
392628,Exe Vienna, The shower pressure was awful and the temperature fluctuates badly The taps of the bath were loose abd need some maintenance There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which is ridiculous given the price The housekeeping did not clean or replace the wine glasses in the room The pool the main reason we chose the hotel was closed but there was no notice or reduction in price , Good location comfy pretty good value for money 
392629,Exe Vienna, There was no kettle coffee or tea nor drinking water in the room We have to go to the breakfast restaurant to get a coffee or water when I need one Fanny enough I was told only at check out that I could have asked for the kettle and coffee making facilities in fact we asked the reception almost everyday for a cup of tea The shower hot water was temperamental hit and cold as it likes We stayed at 6th floor there was building job started at 7am very annoying , The receptionist Miss Yana is very good The breakfast is fairly satisfied 
392630,Exe Vienna, First we got a room and the bed was a bad bed It made constantly noises So we were offered another room and this room the Laminate was broken There were no extra pillows It is not a 4 start hotel It is a really good 2 star hotel but not 4 They should change the star because it is not then aligned with expectations and they will end up having not satisfying customers , The breakfast was really good 
392631,Exe Vienna, My experience with this hotel was far away from anything 4 I don t understand how do they dare to advertise it with 4 on Trip Advisor 1 Air condition didn t work hotel staff refused to fix it referring to the central heating they cannot turn off It was extremely warm in the room despite the open window We were given another room after we complained air condition didn t work either but at least this room was not on the sunny side of the building and not that warm 2 No bar no restaurant at the hotel What was available nearby was not well suited for tourists while could be good for locals 3 No chance to sleep Saturday night due to the drunk crowd coming out of the night club next door signing something very loud till 5 am Closing the window was not an option due to 1 above 4 The swimming pool was nice but one of the ladders was half broken That scared me 5 Wall mount for the shower was broken in the first room 6 Tiny rooms like 3x3 m bathrooms super tiny 7 Terrible coffee from the machine in the breakfast room and this in Vienna , Swimming pool is there
392632,Exe Vienna, Environment around the hotel is not children friendly Many suspected people especially in the evening time are jumping up and down the streets with looks in their faces and behavior This is not the situation in the street to the hotel but unfortunately the threat is existend in the close proximity to the side streets you have to cross if you are using public transportation or if you want to reach the hotel by foot from a close metro stop a metro stop directly in front of the hotel is there but due to several metro stops close by sometimes it makes sense to use another line and to drop in another station and to walk the rest to the hotel To be more neutral maybe this is the case for all big cities Thin walls You can hear every door closing and opening nearby Even neighborhood chat could be heard although not clearly to understand the conversation still annoying Very tiny old fashioned bathroom I felt not comfortable Had a feeling of disgust To walk in without touching the door is almost not possible No accessories to prepare tea or coffee Rooms need restauration Floor is broken on some parts Very thin pillows More a hotel of between 2 and 3 stars , Breakfast was very good though juice tasted like it was more artificial and not 100 natural Staff was very eager to help and friendly They acknowledged my claims and gave me support to make me feel a little more confident Close proximity to city center If you just look for an accommodation to stay and sleep it is ok Don t expect more in regard of a calm tidy pleasant room The comfort level is between a little bit better than a hostel with the bonus of having relatively privacy see the cons for more detail Price should be around 40 50 euro a day More is a joke 
392633,Exe Vienna,No Negative, Enjoyed the pool Good size Basic surroundings Clean Breakfast is good value at 10 Euros Staff are very helpful Spanish speaking Left property and they bothered to locate it and email me Also helped me when my bank cards were stopped because of fraud in the UK Very well located near Turkish restaurants and cafes and on tram route 44 to the cathedral square About 10 minutes ride to the centre of Vienna From the airport we had to change trains trams once It was easy even with luggage and took us about 45 min in total 
392634,Exe Vienna, Parking lot a bit expensive, Amazing stay in Vienna perfect to begin the working week in a peace atmosphere full equiped room very good value for money service nice and smart staff swimming pool and fitness center very nice bathtube in bathroom and extraordinary breakfast If you are on the 7th floor you have an amazing view of Vienna D
392635,Exe Vienna, Only little inconvenience was the fact that some parts of the hotel were undergoing a small reconstruction mainly painting It wasnt realy uncomfortable anyhow though , The staff was mostly Spanish but very fluent in both English and German and always helpful Breakfast buffet wass amazing definately worth all the money Also the swimming pool and gym was a nice treat in the evening after walking in the city Location is not perfect but a tram will get you to the centre of Vienna in 10 minutes 
392636,Exe Vienna, I didnt think i would ever write about pillows but they were horror i couldnt sleep half night The pool is very small not like in the photos In rest was ok, nice and clean hotel
392637,Exe Vienna, No English TV channels and most listed channels were not available The fan in the bathroom was noisy Some parts need renovation , Nice location close to some main sights and a tram line The breakfast is very OK great selection and good quality 
392638,Exe Vienna, Having a TV with 3 channels 2 germans and 1 spanish in a room with USB and HDMI locked is useless Walls are thin so you can hear next room clearly , Good location clean and good personnel 
392639,Exe Vienna, The bed was making noises all night long if u would change side And the cable on the telephone shower was broken As a result the water had no pressure at all , The spot was good only 5 by tram to the centre of the city The relation between price and quality was really good 
392640,Exe Vienna, Breakfast eggs not tasty general impressions this is not a four star hotel The bed was okay The general impression is kinda Balkan like Ugly smell usedin middle east hit our nose when entering a lobby , During weekends parking is free on the street otherwise 14 EUR a night but it was full when we arrived
392641,Exe Vienna, Car parking and bathtub stopper missing I believe they took removed it for economy reason The personnel was little bit upset disturbed and confused when we asked for car parking ,No Positive
392642,Exe Vienna, Uncomfortable bed shower was awkward no bar seemed drab only german and spanish language tv wasn t bad just not quite as expected for a 4 star hotel , Pool and gym were good 24 7 presence on reception staff were very helpful and pleasant breakfast was nice
392643,Exe Vienna, Shower head holder broken the room also needed some renovation Bed was ok but pillows there too thin even if you folded it and were not comfy, Location indoor pool and bath in the room breakfast view from the window as our room was on the last floor 
392644,Exe Vienna, The bed is not very comfortable Staff need to be trained a bit better to the tourist when they come so we know where we can go A few more comfortable pillows for the families , I liked the pool Clean and safe Wasnt very hot when I got in Good amount of sockets Shower was easy to control 
392645,Exe Vienna, No kettle in the room and the shower head was loose , The hotel is big and receptionists were all nice and helpful Tram stops right outside the hotel which goes straight to the city centre U6 train sration is less than 10 minutes walk The room was normal size No kettle or coffee in the room though Breakfast was good Overall good value for money and the location is good 
392646,Exe Vienna, Once we settled in there were a few things that made us question the quality of the hotel including a flooded shower a hard bed with a flat pillow and a door that allowed the light to shine in from the corridor but there were sufficient shades from the curtains Too it was strange for us not to get something other than beer or water or something to eat in the evening at the hotel bar But they were small complaints in the end as our general impression was a good one We had a great deal and were happy in the end And a little tip There s a great Park and Ride nearby in Ottakring for only 3 40 24 hours should you not get a space in the hotel s parking lot as in our case , Great place All in all we were very satisfied with EXE We were warmly welcomed by a friendly staff the rooms were clean and comfortable a big breakfast and many amenities helped to make our stay quite pleasurable The tram stopped nearly in front of the hotel or a short walk of 5 minutes took us to the underground and from there we could easily reach all of Vienna 
392647,Exe Vienna, beds are not comfortable and a little too small for sleeping in two, nice clean hotel nice staff good breakfast free parking on the other side of the street but not many places
392648,Exe Vienna, Double bed having 2 single bed sheets instead of 1 double Swimming pool looking much larger on the photos Still nice Jacuzzi or whatever it is on the other side of the swimming pool broken , Helpful polite staff nice extra stuff in the room toothbrushes shaver slippers etc

392650,Exe Vienna, It is a bit untidy in the room location is good as it not far from the center however I found the area itself unfavourable And please add at least one English channel to the TV , Really nice and helpful staff great facilities 
392651,Exe Vienna, They offer rooms with balcony but i asked for them they said they will give me this one but i didnt get it and i havent seen any rooms with balcony there, They give hygienic things in the bathroom more than ussual shaving things creams toothbrush welcoming presents wine choco Its cheap room but great With swiiming pool and great breakffest They offer parking for 15 eu
392652,Exe Vienna, It doesn t seem that the maintenance works very often and by this I mean there are somethings in the rooms and in the hotel that they seem broken or damaged For example the wood floor on my room was a little bit damaged as well as the windows from the first room I ve been , The staff is super nice and welcoming I arrived and they gave me a room at the top floor but it wasn t soundproofing I could hear the street noises like I was actually in the sidewalk so o called the reception to change my room and they did it no problems and with all the kindness The rooms are very comfy and the beds too the bathroom is clean and they give you lots of toiletries They a sample gym and pool but they are good and I think it s enough for 1 5 nights staying at the hotel I would recommend for sure 
392653,Exe Vienna, Furniture is a little outdated Rooms could use some repainting and doors should be changed , Room was of ok size clean and fairly well kept Staff was quite friendly Location was good quite close to Schonbrunn Castle Breakfast was fairly extensive with good quality ingredients 
392654,Exe Vienna, The mattress is hard Would be more soft and comfortable After 3 nights will be a problem , Location is good if you don t need carry many luggages and get the subway near by about 800m There s a supermarket just steps away from the Hotel which is very convenient and some restaurants most popular The staff is really helpful and i tried the breakfast once and it s was fantastic 10 euros Good value for the money 
392655,Exe Vienna, This is a 2 star hotel Furniture and floor in bad shape with dents Booked a queen size received two joined beds Room was on the last floor and rain was very loud Elevator all scrached and old looking And I could go on Whole place needs serious renovation , Not too far from center Ok breakfast 
392656,Exe Vienna, I didn t like the gym facilities as they only had a running machine The parking was horrible and unorganized and some of the staff seemed a bit unorganized , I like the morning breakfasts the indoor pool and location The staff were friendly 
392657,Exe Vienna, The Internet was not working in the room There was no way to regulate the heating It took us 1 hour to check in There was one staff on reception dealing with a big group and wait of an hour that we could have used for sight seeing The phone to the reception did not work so we had to go down everytime we had a problem We were told to try the internet every few mins which didnt work and each time to report it it was a trip down to reception We stayed 3 nights and each day the staff promised it would be fixed but no one did anything We had booked it non refundable otherwise we would have moved hotels Could do without the hassle when travelling and planning our trip ,No Positive
392658,Exe Vienna, To get to the center you have to catch 2 trams it takes about 25 30 min The mini fridge in the room did not work , The staff was really helpful all of our requests were complied The breakfast is good also 
392659,Exe Vienna, corridors are awful the beds were very very small also the pillows were very thin Like an A4 sheet the indoor pool was very small maximum 3 people could swim in it at the same time I don t recommend it to anyone ,No Positive
392660,Exe Vienna, I stayed in the top floor room quite noisy really hot even in the winter season they always have the central heating system working allday we cant controll them and also the air conditioner didnt work properly either We ended up to open the window in the middle of winter season to get some fresh air Not reach the 4stars level yet, Good breakfast but quite same menu everyday near metro station gluwein wine hot soup and candy are available in the reception area nice way to welcome guest 
392661,Exe Vienna, The pool area is kinda old and the water had too much chlorine It took us three showers to make our skin not to smell of chlorine The cleaning staff knocked on the door too early The parking was a bit expensive The mini bar had no attached price list it was a mystery for us if we should pay it or not if we consume something , We have appreciated the wine and the chocolate we have received as welcome gift The private parking was inside the yard 
392662,Exe Vienna, Coffee was tasteless , Good value for money with good continental breakfast We got breakfast package when we had to leave the hotel early because of the plane 
392663,Exe Vienna, I can t really think of anything that could have been better except perhaps the location which was not awful but not ideal either , Our stay at Hotel EXE Vienna was a really good experience The reception staff was friendly and nice and we received a nice comfortable and clean room at the 5th floor The room had a backyard view but this was not a problem since the high floor offered a pretty good view of the city skyline and plenty of light entered the room The room was well kept with regard to the furniture sheets and so on Oh and the breakfast A more that great breakfast for 10 euros with tortilla de patatas scrambled eggs sausage vegetables cheese coffee tea juice 5 6 types of bread sweets and many more 
392664,Exe Vienna, Gym need an update Pool small mabe an wormer water Build an sauna Put toilet brush in the bathroom, 6 min from Underground Close to Rathause Clean Good food wine and chocholate in the room 
392665,Exe Vienna, The only major complaint is about poor quality of pillows which are too thin and below average quality for hotels , The location is convenient for travels with car Room was nice and clean There is a hotel parking but needs to be reserved in advance 
392666,Exe Vienna, 1 Unsufficient number of staff there s no one by the pool breaksfast serving is a little messy the receptionist had to come over and give an extra hand to the waiters only 1 man at the reception which makes the reception overcrowded and you have to wait to be received simply not enough people at the front desk with regard to the number of rooms 2 Bathroom is to small without toilet brush the shower is lacking water pressure and the water temperature is constatly changing water and cold 3 For a 4 star hotel it is unacceptable not to have slippers and bath coats in the rooms 4 Breakfast is okay but they have problems with not refilling the food and drinks 5 Rooms are to hot the AC is constantky funing and the rooms are to warm and thexair is really dry 6 Beads are not very comfortable 7 The rooms and the hotel in general are okay but is definetely not for 4 stars and the whole place needs a serious rennovation snd more staff, 1 Very good location and connectivity with city center by tram and by metro 2 Very good breakfast and on weekends untill 11h 3 Free swimming pool 4 Cleanliness 5 Friendly staff
392667,Exe Vienna, The cancelation policy of the hotel is bit strange so pay attantion to it closely In a hotel garage there was no available parking so we had to keep our car on the street The room was spacious as we got for three people but it was not the cleanest There was no king size bed but two connected beds which is very annoying Also the bathroom was renovated but the cleaness was not up to expectations We also stayed in Exe hotel in Marid as Exe hotels are spanish chain which had amazing location and the room was amazing so we stayed a bit disappointed with the one in Vienna , Staff was polite and helpful During the night we were able to find parking in streets around the hotel 
392668,Exe Vienna, The room was very hot and even though our room was on 6th floor it was quite noisy during the night with the window open It was a shame that the pool was out of order during our stay too , Breakfast was lovely and staff were very welcoming and friendly 
392669,Exe Vienna, No other channel than German and Spanish The wifi was out of service one evening Some dustballs showed up during our stay as the cleaning had not been done thoroughly enough , The multilingual staff was patient A small box of Viennese candies and a small bottle of Austrian wine welcomed us in our room The rooms are well insulated against the cold

392680,Exe Vienna, Staff changed our room prior to checkin because our original room was not cleaned Our new room had a spot of dried mud on the ground and some hair in the bathroom The bed was luckily clean enough that we could get much needed rest passing through Vienna The room chairs in the pictures are photoshopped the real things are about 30 years old dirty and stained The overall look of the room is very old , The hotel is located well on a street with lots of caffes 
392681,Exe Vienna, We arrived here for a one night trip and stayed overlooking the car parks at the back and grotty houses The pool was out of order due to an apparent short term breakage yet looked as though it had been out of order for some time No apologies or money off the cost of stay even though that is one of the main reasons we booked the hotel There was also no other pools nearby that we were given access to Breakfast is not 4 it is cheap and nasty only nice part is the coffee Machine made , Wifi a c and staff

392768,Exe Vienna, 1 Me and my friend got a twin room instead of a double room as requested but maybe they did not have any double rooms available This was not a problem 2 The central heating did not work at all It was a bit cold at night and especially during the first night even if we covered ourselves very well with the blankets The hotel should investigate and repair the heating system 3 Someone tried to enter our room on one of our first nights by pushing it claiming that he had the same room as ours I saw the room carton handed to me by him under the door I calmly replied that he should talk to the reception and I shortly reported the incident to the reception myself I received a call from the receptionist that she noted down the room number wrongly but she gave the man the right key card obviously not to our room This should never have happened 4 There was a problem with my card details on Booking website Unfortunately the woman who replied to my e mails did not express herself in English properly and me and my friend thought our reservation was not valid fixed and we could end up without any accommodation just a few days before arriving in Vienna Afterwards I understood that my nonreturnable reservation was indeed firm and I entered my card details one more time It seems that these details are erased from a reservation after some time and the hotel did not take my money the moment I booked The trouble was that the hotel requested those details a little too late The staff should pay more attention to Booking website regulations and inform the clients in a clearer manner regarding their reservations 5 The daily cleaning did not include sweeping the floor Bits and pieces left over from us were still there at the end of our stay 6 I was initially charged for parking for one of our nights and I reported not using it therefore I did not pay it in the end 7 A tall lamp in the room had its power cord cut and was unusable , 1 Me and my friend had a warm welcome on our arrival Thank you very much 2 We received a room on the 6th floor as requested an upper floor but not the last one 3 The room was quite large and it included armchairs a sofa and an extra table 4 We liked that we had a refrigerator and a kettle for making tea which was not included in the presentation 5 Every item seemed new and perfectly clean spotless 6 We had a nice view from the window 7 We had good quality items in the bathroom 8 The twin beds were absolutely comfortable 9 Nice welcoming chocolates on the table 10 A place for storing luggage at the ground floor 11 Sufficient number of electric sockets more than in other places 12 The breakfast was served at convenient hours It was extremely varied and we could eat very well on every occasion but it was not changed from day to day That was not a problem 13 The WiFi Internet worked quite well in the room to my surprise 14 The swimming pool that is free for all the guests 15 During the last night in Vienna on a Monday I needed some help with finding an open pharmacy drugstore at not quite a late hour The receptionist a man different from the woman who welcomed us was helpful and directed me to a 24 hour drugstore in the neighborhood after I had struggled for 30 minutes in vain to find one or at least a shop selling what I needed on foot This must be one of the few downsides of Vienna You cannot expect an ordinary shop to be open at 8 30 PM in the weekdays I find this unbelievable If you come to my country in a big city expect to be able to buy the simplest things close to midnight on weekdays I wonder how do the Viennese cope with a medical emergency at home if by accident they forget to stack themselves with basic medicines 16 The English spoken by the staff was very good 17 The hotel management responded in a timely manner to my e mails
