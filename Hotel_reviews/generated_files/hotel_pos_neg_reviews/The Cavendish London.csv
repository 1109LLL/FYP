253730,The Cavendish London, Breakfast should be included within the rate paid as it was expensive just for a room for 3 nights , Fantastic location in really easy reach of every landmark 
253731,The Cavendish London, The only issue for me was that after 12 am they do not serve hot drinks at the bar of the hotel You are able to order cocktails and other alcohol drinks but no tea or coffee , The location is perfect though there is a massive construction site near by Yet it didn t bother me at all Rooms are clean and full of light Nespresso machines are a great bonus to the room Friendly staff I would definitely recomend this hotel 
253732,The Cavendish London, Nothing It s pricey but represents value given its in Mayfair , Location close to my meetings I booked cheapest room on the small size but inly one night double bed super quiet and comfortable Well appointed with tea chocolate coffee plus espresso machine free mineral water iron and board high quality fittings and linen esp bathroom 
253733,The Cavendish London, Room a little small Some aspects of breakfast a little disappointing bacon does not sit around well for a long period and was hard and tough rather than crispy Plenty of coffee served but it was indifferent and needs to be improved , Pleasantly surprised to be able to book in early Large shower excellent with good pressure Nice to have coffee machine Very good location just behind Fortnum and Masons particularly as we were going to visit the RA Staff were very friendly and helpful Breakfast generous with lots of very good fresh fruit 
253734,The Cavendish London, The rooms are a bit smaller than expected and the bed wasn t overly comfortable too soft 4 Star hotel with no bath robes The bar staff member we were served by wasn t very friendly he seemed disinterested in his job , The location was fantastic perfect location for our trip 
253735,The Cavendish London, Noisy building site next door but that s not the hotel s fault , Very well equipped room with good air conditioning and very comfortable bed Lots of provisions including tea and coffee water iron and ironing board and even an umbrella Breakfast was excellent including good gluten free bread 
253736,The Cavendish London, I have stayed at the Cavendish on Jermyn Street numerous times before and never had a problem This time the room was filthy when I arrived plus the hotel tried to overcharge me on vacating the room The hotel tried to charge me for breakfast that I did not have and questioned my integrity when i said I had not had breakfast Per the time stamped on the breakfast chitty I had actually been at work for an hour in Mayfair when the breakfast was being eaten Attitude of the hotel stank especially towards a guest who has stayed numerous times before usually in the most expensive Penthouse suite Having stayed in this hotel for the past 12 years usually in the Penthouse Suite I will not be returning and therefore they have lost a valuable customer , Location
253737,The Cavendish London,No Negative, It was a 50th birthday treat for my wife I d requested one of the two rooms two adult daughters accompied us be ready before 2pm to freshen up as we had aft tea at the ritz booked for 3 30pm and we were coming by train and one room was ready for 1 30pm when we came back from the ritz our room was ready and had a 50th birthday card and a bottle of champagne on ice with two glasses on the side cannot thank them enough what a fantastic thing to do 
253738,The Cavendish London, Room was a bit small but there are options for bigger ones , Really nice and modern hotel in a great location View from the room was amazing Requested a room on a top floor and was given one pleasant stay 
253739,The Cavendish London, Room was too small for a couple with two suitcases and no space for them It made it impossible to move around Water from the shower wets bathroom floor making a mess , The bed was great Lots of amenities Nespresso machine kettle for tea ironing board And location was great for exploring around good restaurants shopping 
253740,The Cavendish London,No Negative, The staff welcome service and interest in our welfare were most genuine The restaurant breakfast and dinner we enjoyed were excellent An interesting history of the hotel and neighbourhood was provided in our room to read with the tea and biscuits provided I felt the culture established by the hotel s founder Rosa Lewis lives on 
253741,The Cavendish London, Sadly the maintenance of this hotel seems to be sadly lacking We were put into a room and the air conditioning wasn t working It appeared that the Gaul was on the whole floor talking to other people We were moved to another room after complaining There was a fault with the hot water in the hotel Tepid shower Friday night stone cold Saturday morning its bad when you have to boil a kettle to have a wash Hot water restored Saturday night but off again Sunday We had had 4 drinks in the bar on the Saturday and they offered us 20 off the bill which barely covered the service charge which we found quite pathetic Eventually the whole bar bill was written off but I would have preferred to pay the bill and have had hot water , The room was clean and the bed comfortable 
253742,The Cavendish London, Every thing was great no complaints, We arrived at the hotel early around 11am and requested an early check in if possible They took our bags and we received a call an hour later to say our room was ready We arrived back at the hotel and our bags were in our room They then gave us a late checkout complimentary Location is excellent dead central five mins walk to Piccadilly Circus station and within walking distance of everything Beautiful hotel lovely rooms with generous bathroom for central London Staff were so polite and helpful Definitely stay again
253743,The Cavendish London, Upon arrival notices were displayed on reception stating there was no hot water or air conditioning in some of the rooms I checked with reception who assured me our room had both This was not the case unfortunately The duty manager James kindly moved our room but unfortunately we had the same issue there so it was a case of a cold shower in a melting hot room The sheets were also marked with a black mark which was a tad off putting , Location of the hotel
253744,The Cavendish London, The room photos on the internet are not representative of what the rooms are like The room photo shows a chair lounge to read in but my room was so small there was no room for a chair I was told they show the higher price rooms on the internet There was no place to plug in a hair dryer anywhere near a mirror Service at breakfast was terrible and to rub salt in the wound I was charged a mandatory service fee for a buffet breakfast Hotel location is good but there a few casual dining option nearby ,No Positive
253745,The Cavendish London, Staff particularly lady on reception who did my check in and check out She had a very poor attitude to the feedback on my stay and I kept it very short and polite Facilities no electrical sockets by the bed Bathroom awkward shower door opening , Location
253746,The Cavendish London, The quality of the room varies enormously I would advise for executive room and against standard room Prices vary masssively one week from another which doesn t help becoming as much a regular customer as I d wish , Staff very professional and welcoming 
253747,The Cavendish London, no mini bar in the room, staff were amazing and view of the room had the whole is westminter which was beautiful rooms very comfy and the facilities are amazing
253748,The Cavendish London, Everything with the exception of the location This hotel is without a doubt the worst hotel I have stayed in since being a student The rooms are tiny and decorated with lots of poor quality cheap furnishing The staff are good on arrival but the night staff are shocking When we complained about the noise of possibly 20 air conditioning units outside our room the night manager suggested we must be light sleepers Avoid and spend your money in one of the many lovely hotels nearby , The location is super 
253749,The Cavendish London,No Negative, Best thing is its location Definitely worth staying I was concerned about the size of the room since there are bad remarks about its size So i booked a 27m2 room with a 40 pound extra for each day I liked the room it was spacious The room is clean and the staff is helpful So I recommend for travellers people come London for shopping etc 
253750,The Cavendish London, Restaurant was a bit of a let down for lunch Bit tired uninspiring menu and staff after first course weren t bothered about us at all chatting amongst themselves We were the only ones there Breakfast wasn t the best nasty cheap sugary muesli for instance when for the price 22 per head you expect top notch stuff Certainly wouldn t bother again Room was really noisy as we were somehow near a bar but quiet by 10 ish so not a huge quibble , The location was perfect for us off to the RA for an exhibition Very helpful Concierge and staff were great Room was fine very comfortable bed 
253751,The Cavendish London, Our room was very small and highly overpriced for it s size We felt that 440 for 2 nights was far too much we did comment on departure but no goodwill gesture was made Our last stay was a much better experience hence why we chose to stay again this time , We loved the location and the onsite parking
253752,The Cavendish London, Aged room Bathroom interior glass door impossible to open I ask from reception to make something but nothing happens A strange bad smell inside I think it is from the decorated pillows There are very old , Location
253753,The Cavendish London, The room we were allocated initially was disappointing as the view was of a wall and extractor fans so with a continual humming We phoned reception and they immediately changed us to a new room which was light not noisy and with a view so very nice , Location the friendliness and efficiency of the staff the breakfast being able to park at the hotel the unexpected water and mints left in the car when we were leaving the handy explorer phone 
253754,The Cavendish London, Had to wait for room to be ready after arriving at 1pm If not ready surely an upgrade or alternative may have been a better solution rather than asking to come back later , Location perfect staff very friendly Easy and practical to check in 
253755,The Cavendish London, The bed was a little soft and we were overlooking a building site but some things cannot be helped and building in London never stops , The location was excellent so close to central London and opposite Fortnum and Mason The staff were polite and helpful 
253756,The Cavendish London, Chose room to small for me not my wife sink plug US beds not turned for night wait for breakfast , Beds excellent the hotel position and access is brilliant views from window wonderful
253757,The Cavendish London,No Negative, We love the location staff convenience and cleanliness The bed was super comfortable and the shower was lovely after a long day off sightseeing Then amenities were excellent especially the tea coffee complementary tray We will certainly come back 
253758,The Cavendish London, It was our engagement weekend I had notified the hotel of this prior to our arrival and I had asked for an upgrade On arrival the receptionist asked were we here for a special occasion but my partner didn t know of my plans so I couldn t say yes Wen we got our room it was tiny no upgrade no welcome pack Nothing the hotel totally forgot my request I could not complain as my girlfriend would have known something was going on I was so disappointed as I really wanted her first trip to London to be special And finally to top it all as I was paying with my debit card the hotel took an extra 120 to cover any extra spending so they left me short that too And I won t get that back into my account for five working days Thanks a lot guys, We liked the location
253759,The Cavendish London, Standard room is small Hardly place to pass between end of bed and wall Basic toiletries no extras disappointing for the price , Bed very comfortable Modern gadgets like a smartphone with maps in each room Very quiet even though a lot of rooms Location central to all Staff very friendly and helpful Concierge especially sweet and very accommodating 
253760,The Cavendish London, noisy air con at night may have been faulty but having complained staff were great moved to different room with no fuss at all , very helpful staff and lovely extras for birthday including a free upgrade of room cake and card Thank you 
253761,The Cavendish London, Our room although having great views to London Eye etc was also overlooking a nightclub and the noise from that went on until 5 30am , Perfect location for the areas of London that we like 
253762,The Cavendish London, Screaming baby next door meant we changed room Only one available was for disabled guests so bathroom was not really suitable , Room was comfortable large bed coffee maker big shower flat screen Tv
253763,The Cavendish London, Breakfast was badly organized A lot of items ran out and were not refilled in a long time Bread selection was very limited and if bad quality It took forever just to get a cup of tea coffe we waited 10 minutes for our coffee both Saturday and Sunday Absolutely not worth the money there are a lot of nicer breakfast places close by , Excellent location Friendly staff Nice rooms 
253764,The Cavendish London, Noisy air conditioning in the bedroom sounding like external gale force wind Albeit a temporary inconvenience the demolition of the neighbouring property with the intense noise being likened to a terrorist s attack , Everything 
253765,The Cavendish London, The room was very small I don t know how they have the cheek to call it a superior room The reception staff did not action our request for a quiet room away from lifts and all noise in spite of us asking on two separate occasions Clearly don t actually care not sure we d return , Location was perfect most staff were outstanding 
253766,The Cavendish London, My room had a door to the adjacent room which was not properly soundproofed So when a next door visitor started to speak over the telephone at 5 AM I could literally hear every word , Excellent location spacey room comfortable bad good cleaness
253767,The Cavendish London, Our friends were on lower floor rooms and the local idiots with Lamboghini s and Ferrari s kept them awake all night The higher the room the quieter it is , Great Breakfast Very comfortable beds Excellent position in London for shopping and theatre Oh and visiting the Queen 
253768,The Cavendish London,No Negative, After a long flight from the US I felt very comforted to have everything I needed at the Cavendish From the fancy in room coffee to the beautiful facilities I felt very comfortable Wish I could have stayed longer 
253769,The Cavendish London, Bit noisy in the early hours due to a club nearby not the hotels fault obviously Plus work going on across the road noisy in the morning , Staff were really helpful and friendly Place is spotless and great location Beautiful hotel 
253770,The Cavendish London, No real gripes beyond original room allocation , Had a problem on arrival as room initially assigned didn t match description but was professionally and amicably sorted out by Catia on front desk Staff generally helpful and human 
253771,The Cavendish London, Nothing Major 1 The wardrobe was too narrow and not deep enough as the coat hangers made it difficult to close the door properly more obvious in winter when clothes are heavier and bulky 2 I would have preferred the bedside tables to be cabinets 3 I considered the room service full breakfast a tad expensive and the room menu was not designed to encourage partial breakfast e g al la carte was not the full breakfast displayed with boxes to tick my choice , The main thing I liked was not having much to dislike Obvious likes were 1 TV Station choice was very good with multiple news outlets 2 You can walk to many of the theatres 3 The cleaning staff didn t start too early 4 The Staff across the board were cheerful willingly helpful and displayed in my opinion impressive knowledge of Hotel Hospitality 
253772,The Cavendish London, The room temperature setting mechanism is difficult to read and placed in a dark part of the room It could be located very close but with more light The cupboard was a little cramped for two people even though we stayed for one night only, All the facilities were good and the casual breakfast was excellent We were late to dine but the staff and food was excellent in spite of our lateness 
253773,The Cavendish London, Nothing, The service from the staff was great from the moment we pulled up in our car to the moment we left The room although small was clean and very comfortable 
253774,The Cavendish London, There is nothing about this hotel I didn t like , The decor is finished to a high standard the bathroom was spacious luxurious the living area the same The location was spot on for New Years 2016 2017 I will be staying again 
253775,The Cavendish London, Doesn t have a particularly nice bar, Fantastic location for central London shopping and dining Slightly off the busy streets so quiet but very central 
253776,The Cavendish London, I had a bit problem with the air due to asthma The air was so dry that I Ionged for a window to open By regulating the air condition it became a little better the second night , Visited with my daughter We were noticed welcomed and offered help the moment we arrived Bedroom and bathroom were nice and comfortable The restaurant offered a very good but not splendid dinner menu The breakfast was splendid traditional English with high quality like organic free range eggs and so on There were also lots of offers at the meny included which we could order The service was excellent all staff so nice and friendly The location of the hotel in Mayfair was very central Surrounded by shops for the rich lovely decorated for Christmas But luckily short walks to other areas for the more common of us Like Hyde Park Covent Garden Oxford street and more But the best of al is the location so close to Haymarket the theater district I can highly recommend this hotel 
253777,The Cavendish London, The value for money was not there we paid 268 per room for 7 people and the rooms were small and no breakfast was included , The beds were comfortable but the team there were not particularly helpful or smiley
253778,The Cavendish London, Superior rooms small bathroom very small for the price charged Pillows horrendous did not get good night s sleep Problem with their credit card system on checking out they were supposed to email me when transaction had been put through but heard nothing from them very poor customer service , Location good and central for getting around on foot 
253779,The Cavendish London, Only slight problem was that our room was located right next to the lift and so I could hear it throughout the night We only stayed one night but if the stay was longer I think I would ve asked to move rooms I did also find it a bit pricey for one night s stay but I suppose it is to be expected for the location and the quality of the rooms , Room was spacious and clean Bed was lovely really comfortable and big We were provided with iron ironing board coffee machine and an umbrella that could be used if needed The bathroom was large and we were provided with free products which were lovely The hotel is in an excellent location ten mins walk from Picadilly Circus tube and not far to walk to Trafalgar Square Buckingham Palace and Westminster 
253780,The Cavendish London, The room is pretty small in consideration to what you pay for but that is London in general The walls are quite thin so be prepared to hear cleaners and your neighbours The only real complaint that I have is the service at breakfast I stayed for 2 weeks and had breakfast 3 times only and yet every time I was left waiting to be served The staff are polite but grossly inefficient All 3 times I had to fight to make my orders and to be served which is frustrating when all you want in the morning is a hot cup of tea and some warm toasts , Great location if you want to be near Green Park area A lot of shops restaurants and cafes around 
253781,The Cavendish London, Nothing , Lovely position All hotels in London are expensive compared to other parts of the country but this hotel is excellent Nice rooms and extras like a bathrobe and slippers on demand Good in room tea and coffee facilities 
253782,The Cavendish London, All was fine aprat from maybe the mattres that was oubliously rather old so there was like a sink hole in the middle where you would fall down ,No Positive
253783,The Cavendish London, Breakfast disappointing for price Service at breakfast also rather below parr , Excellent restaurant evening dinner at Petrichor overall facilities location staff at restaurant reception cleaning staff all excellent 
253784,The Cavendish London, Tiny rooms no minibar in the room Very expensive for this room size albeit expected in London , the LOCATION in the very center 4 minutes from Picadilly Circus tube station Friendly staff 
253785,The Cavendish London,No Negative, Very friendly and helpful staff Travelling with a 7 year old so all the little things like greeting her with a little bag of sweets a gift pack in the room and her own set of toiletries made our stay very memorable We also arrived very late so the kitchen was closed but when I asked where I could walk to get some chips for her as she was hungry and had looked forward to having that when we got to London the cook fired up the fryer and made her a nice portion Definately a hotel that goes the extra mile 
253786,The Cavendish London, Very picky here but difficult to read and understand shower instructions without glasses which I usually do not have on in shower, The wifi was very good quick and easy to use log in Business area very helpful when I wanted to print out boarding card Did not eat or do much else during mye stay better time next stay
253787,The Cavendish London, Breakfast seemed overpriced at 22 50 it was pretty standard fare and nothing special Had to ask twice for toast and didn t automatically serve tea in a pot first cup of tea from flask and very stewed , Very comfy bed and pillows Location was excellent and very quiet Staff were friendly and approachable 
253788,The Cavendish London,No Negative, Our first trip to London and we couldn t have picked a better place to stay The hotel is lovely close to everything we needed and the staff couldn t do enough for us They even left a card and birthday cake in the room as it was my daughters 18th Would definitely book again if we ever venture back We loved it 
253789,The Cavendish London, Shower breakfast , The location is the best thing Very close to picadilly circus However the facilities were not the best Shower very bad if you considered the amount paid Breakfast also very simple 
253790,The Cavendish London, Not enough tea and coffee etc Kettle with cable was not ideal Cordless kettles are the norm everywhere and safer when filling and using , The views over London The receptionist s friendly and warm conversation Quiet nights sleep 
253791,The Cavendish London,No Negative, The Location was incredible close to everything yet on a safe and quiet street Extra friendly staff luxurious The bed was really comfortable Will definitely be returning on my next trip to London 
253792,The Cavendish London, The bedroom was a little small, This is a brilliant hotel the staff are so friendly and the service is exceptionally good The bed was extremely comfortable thoroughly recommend and I will stay there again
253793,The Cavendish London, nothing, The staff are extremely friendly and the location is perfect I went for a business trip so of course i don t have the same needs that a family on holidays would maybe have As far i m concern the hotel is very clean the bedroom are big enough the view was nice the breakfast was very good and pleasant internet works well the location as i said is perfect and the hotel staff are very helpful and nice I had a lovely time at the hotel

253795,The Cavendish London, Room was very small and very tight Only complaint , Room very clean and bathroom very good Food available all day and varied menu and extremely friendly staff from the front desk to restaurant staff Porter called taxi and very helpful with baggage very pleasant whatever the hour 
253796,The Cavendish London, Classic double rooms vary in size depending on allocation at time of check in Our room and bathroom quite a lot smaller to previous visits and also in comparison to friends room on a different floor Worth noting especially when paying same amount for these rooms , Have stayed at this hotel before and is a perfect location for walking or public transport links to all the sights Classic rooms can be a little tight on space but adequate Rooms one side of hotel have lovely views of London remainder overlook buildings across a road Breakfasts are lovely with maximum choice of hot and cold options Staff very professional and majority very helpful 
253797,The Cavendish London, The first night we were in a room where the air conditioning was not working and could not be fixed The second night we were moved to another room on the top floor with a great view but the bathroom smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke and there was a room opposite which was constantly being used by cleaning staff so it was quite noisy I think we were just quite unlucky though the housekeeping staff might have noticed the smell in the bathroom , Great location for central London Staff were lovely and very helpful Beds comfortable and bedrooms well appointed 
253798,The Cavendish London, Breakfast was good but expensive 25 pounds , Good location Lots of high end mens shops in close proximity Rooms are modern but a little small Nothing special or different But clean and a great bed 
253799,The Cavendish London, Not to do with the hotel directly but parking in London is expensive , I can t fault this hotel at all Totally brilliant They looked after my wife and I Staff were extremely friendly Great location I can t sing its praise any more 
253800,The Cavendish London, Nothing , The way we were treated by the staff from the start until the end of our stay was fantastic The room was very stylish comfortable and had great facilities The hotel in General was brilliant 
253801,The Cavendish London, Breakfast was sub standard There are not enough tables for all guests so we needed to wait 5 7 minutes every morning Shower water pressure was low and the technician told us that it wasn t fixable Room was very small but maybe that s the norm in central London Housekeeping staff did not speak English so we could not communicate with her not a major issue though , Location was great Reception staff was very kind and helpful We had a minor complaint and then they made it up to us by sending a complimentary fruit plate which was very kind of them 
253802,The Cavendish London, lifts didn t go from ground floor you had to walk either up or down some stairs but they are renovating and that could change rooms small but adequate Not a lot of English character to the d cor , the bed was heaven the location was fabulous we walked everywhere the view from the 14th floor over green park was lovely bathroom spacious great price for central london
253803,The Cavendish London, Nothing it could not have been better, Great breakfast Comfortable bed Excellent housekeeping staff Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff Extremely courteous Great coffee machine and bath products Brilliant 
253804,The Cavendish London, Small bar scattered chairs a little disjointed so lacking in atmosphere but that may change with the renovation work they re doing , The bed was the best I think I ve ever slept in in fact I d like to know the make so I can order one All the staff were fantastic from reservation request for high floor to birthday card cake in room valet parking guys were charming and even gave us a tin of mints and a bottle of water for our journey home never seen that in the UK can t fault them very impressive we will definitely be back 
253805,The Cavendish London,No Negative, We have stayed here many many times The location is excellent the rooms are very comfy the breakfast is very enjoyable Just what you need for a central London hotel 
253806,The Cavendish London, Tea and coffee in the 1st floor cafe was too expensive, Brought us prosecco because the aircon wasn t working We hadn t noticed so nice surprise
253807,The Cavendish London, It was on the pricier side but considering that it is so much more than your average 4 I think this is to be expected , We had breakfast in our room both mornings and the service was excellent and on time The food was great This hotel is rated 4 but the attention to detail and the amenities made it feel like a luxury hotel Would definitely stay again 
253808,The Cavendish London, I wasn t aware of the renovation which was not pleasant in terms of having to hold the bags to the 1st floor But i was assured this was going to end in few weeks , Central the staff are friendly the room is clean t

253821,The Cavendish London, Booking com never passed on my early check in request even though I received the email confirmation , Very comfy bed and clean facilties Staff was very helpful 
253822,The Cavendish London, Hotel currently undergoing a refurb so the major of guests I m sure disabled guests must be accounted for have to go up one flight of stairs from reception to the first floor where the lifts to all levels are located Just bear in mind if you re unable to use stairs for some reason , Very comfortable beds excellent breakfast included in our room rate Sky TV channels very central location just behind Fortnums and within a 5 min walk of either Green Park or Piccadilly Circus tube stations

253827,The Cavendish London, A la carte breakfast menu would have been a nice option A huge buffet for breakfast is not my style so it was a better option for me to go to a cafe down the street albeit less convenient ,No Positive
253828,The Cavendish London, Just bit more space in the room , Was my friends birthday the hotel arrenage a nice cake for her they also wished her happy birthday when checking in You could get your breakfast in bed for no extra charge 
253829,The Cavendish London, for my personal taste the bed was just too soft but would be liked by most people , room was well appointed with some wonderful pictures well equipped with tv coffee maker etc shower was large
253830,The Cavendish London, Honestly Nothing , Everything from the welcoming staff to the excellent rooms Nothing was too much for the staff The rooms were perfect and what a location

253834,The Cavendish London, It seems that the hotel struggles to accommodate breakfast busy time Eggs ran out as did the sausage and beans the fact was they were not replenishing quick enough ,No Positive
253835,The Cavendish London, Lack of strong WiFi Internet service We couldn t get a connection in our room had to use the lounge area to connect , Our concierge Richard far exceeded expectations when he so very kindly sorted out problems that our travel agent had neglected to do Not only did he organise our vouchers for prepaid sight seeing attractions he also went far above to organise our return flights home Excellent service

253838,The Cavendish London, The service at breakfast left a lot to be desired Very slow to bting things had to be asked several times Understanding of English was not good However one person stood out as bring efficient professional and friendly he dealt with what should have been an omelette very well and gave us a half a bottle of champagne to compensate for it We upgraded our room which had a superb view but was very noisy next to the fire exit, The location was excellent for what we had planned

253840,The Cavendish London, The pillows were too hard , The Cavendish is in a great location with so many shops and restaurants on your doorstep The hotel room was comfortable if a little small for two people Initially I was put in a room with just a shower but they very kindly changed my room later in the evening to one with a tub which was kind There didn t seem to be any public lobby areas in this hotel but I didn t visit the restaurant on the first floor so maybe there is some public space there I would only visit this hotel again if the room rates were a good deal as they were this time 
253841,The Cavendish London, Wasn t anything I didn t like all staff were extremely helpful, Location hotel ambience and staff were all first class The beds were amazingly comfortable

253844,The Cavendish London, No stairs and long wait for lift Restaurant bar on the first floor was a little stuffy uninviting and expensive, Excellent location and attentive staff Room facilities good eg docking station tea coffee iron etc 
253845,The Cavendish London, Bedroom door opener lacked adequate instruction on the room card for a visitor experiencing this type of key for the first time Had to return to reception to gain entry , Breakfast choice and service

253849,The Cavendish London, The lifts were very slow in arriving but that is a trivial point , The room was excellent having been upgraded when we arrived The bed was very comfy and also very big Everything was spotlessly clean excellent 
253850,The Cavendish London, The lounge on first floor a bit dark and maybe not the place to have the very British Afternoon Tea , Excellent situated with friendly and professional staff and a rooom equipped with a very nice bed 
253851,The Cavendish London, Renovations to the lobby were ongoing They did not cause issues with livability but the Jermyn St entrance was closed It will be nice to have that entance re opened , Although the room and bathroom were quite small they were more than adequate even for a 5 night stay The pre theatre dinner was very well priced and the food was delicious The staff were so accommodating helpful thoughtful and nice Of all of my visits the London and the many places I have stayed Near the Mall Buckingham Palace Marble Arch near Oxford Street Marylebone etc this location was the best for quick access and short walking distances to the tube the museums shopping theatres the Mall and Hyde Park etc and the price was good for the location Will stay there again but ask for a larger room 
253852,The Cavendish London, Lack of a electrical outlet near the bed I needed it for a medical machine and it proved a minor problem , Great breakfast great location comfortable room good value for money by London standards
253853,The Cavendish London, Waiting line for the breakfast Sunday morning according to the staff this is common Slow and small elevators no alternative stairs Long wait in the morning as the elevator often was full No place to fully open a suitcase on the room Like all hotels in London this one is also small and expensive with limited facilities, Great location Small but functional room Good but expensive breakfast
253854,The Cavendish London, Room was a bit small for 2 adults a baby a travel cot and 3 full sized suitcases , Reception gave us an earlier check in as we had landed into Heathrow at 5 00am Awesome capsule coffee machine and an abundance of creamer tea and extra coffee sachets Also lounge on 1st floor is nice and quiet for meeting friends or business 
253855,The Cavendish London, there was nothing to not like about our stay here , Everything about this hotel was lovely The staff the room and the food we also had a brilliant view from our window
253856,The Cavendish London, Little noisy at night could hear voices yet on 6th Floor not sure where they came from but did not stop me sleeping , Location was brilliant A haven in amongst so much activity 
253857,The Cavendish London, Currently under re furb so the communal areas were a little ad hoc, Great location perfect to walk out and see the sights some excellent tailors nearby and close to tube
253858,The Cavendish London, Would have liked a robe slippers 12 5 Service charge automatically added to a drink purchased at the bar ie no service involved , Large windows lots of light Designer coffee machine in the room
253859,The Cavendish London, The room was a little on the small size once we had put the cushions on the floor it was very hard to walk around, The cake and card for my husbands birthday was lovely also the bottle of water and mints left in our car was really appreciated

253865,The Cavendish London, The staff in charge of luggage and the parking garage on the other hand were polite but very slow to react to my simple requests It took over 20min for them to bring up 3 cars which were physically 15sec away from the lobby and they forgot one too so I had to ask again And then the driver had a hard time manoevering my car so as we were late I just had to intervene and get it out myself It was as if he simply didn t understand how to get the car out with the space at his disposal Also upon arrival we asked the garage staff to assist us in getting the Congestion Charge sorted out They simply pointed to a phone number and said to call it This was not expected at all that guests are supposed to take care of such details and it s only when I complained that they were willing to help but at that time it was already too late so I ll have to deal with it online and perhaps incur a surcharge, Excellent hotel in an excellent location Room and quality of bed exceeded expectations Very helpful and qualified staff at the reception as I had booked 8 rooms so check in was not an easy task for the staff but all went well enough 
253866,The Cavendish London, Check in for Breakfast but having said that they were very busy , Really good reception and check in Lovely room with very comfortable bed and very nice bedding Large well presented bathroom Home from Home

253868,The Cavendish London, Leaking bathtub was highly annoying and wasteful 22 pounds for breakfast is just silly no matter what kind of service you re offering Almost everything anyone said in the hallway was heard through the door could ve been a issue if the other guests at our floor had been of the the party starts and ends at the hotell type , Very well mannered staff and attentive service The location was perfect for our minivacation with the goal of hitting the tourist traps Very nice to see that the insane custom of carpeting everthing was kept out of the bathroom Very low noiselevel even though it was obvious that soundproofing has not been a high priority 
253869,The Cavendish London,No Negative, We booked an overnight stay for my parents 50th wedding anniversary and the staff went over and above to ensure they had a wonderful experience They loved the food and lounge area where they could read the papers

253871,The Cavendish London, I found the hand basin tap quite awkward, Extremely comfortable bed Large TV for a hotel room Generous tea coffee biscuits in room Good bathroom Superior Room Very friendly staff 
253872,The Cavendish London, We upgraded to a suite at total cost of around 320 which was very nice but little things go along way breakfast included would of been nice and the mini bar was empty which we found odd Sealed water bottles in the fridge is definitely something we recommend , We like the location the staff all very polite and engaging Nothing was too much trouble

253876,The Cavendish London, despite early reservation we were given the smallest double room classic we have ever been in it was noisy and had a very thin wall and door connection to neighbouring room very bad experience , location
253877,The Cavendish London, There wasn t anything to dislike to be honest , The staff were so accommodating and friendly The room was compact but had everything you needed and the views were amazing It was my birthday celebration and there was a cake as well as a card which was a lovely touch 
253878,The Cavendish London, The bath tub has badly located handrails and it is way too easy to bump one s head or elbow , The location is fantastic on a quiet street but near restaurants tourist attractions all within an easy walk The concierge and bell staff are very helpful We had a 9 month old and the hotel provided a crib high chair baby bathtub and towels 
253879,The Cavendish London, The bathroom needed a better cleaning The room was tiny but that is kind of the norm for a London hotel Sadly Expensive for what you get , The location is excellent

253884,The Cavendish London, The bathroom is very small , The location is fantastic for central London We got a very good deal at Booking com When we arrived we got a upgrade to a bigger room and that made a big difference The staff is very friendly and went out of there way to make it easy for us 
253885,The Cavendish London, We had booked the hotel 4months before and paid for 10days stay Two days before arriving in London we found a deal on the web site offering the same room rate but with breakfast included Breakfast was 22 per person per day over 10days a lot of money for us We asked that our stay could also include breakfast but the hotel didn t allow it I guess that as we had prepaid and they had had our money for 4months we had little to negotiate with other than the hotel s good will Our original room was so small we couldn t get to the bed when our suitcases were placed inside there was not enough cupboard space to unpack our cases so we had to upgrade Finally as we were being picked up at 5pm we asked to keep the room until then The hotel demanded 15 per hour after1pm most hotels will allow a late stay unless they are full as it makes no difference to the hotel if the room is not needed until the next day anyway so for us it was another cause for dissatisfaction with the overall hotel s policies , Staff ere helpful and friendly the location was very good for us and luckily lots of eating places nearby 
253886,The Cavendish London, The room is a little small , The location is quite good near both Green park station and Piccadilly Circus station working distance to buckingham palace
