223241,Nell Hotel Suites, Our apartment was tiny I also found that given the price coffee tea and milk should be complimentary , Comfortable beds and reasonably quiet with excellent wi fi connections and walking distance to restaurants and shops

223251,Nell Hotel Suites, During checking out the front desk guy asked me about an extra quilt where did it go I told him it was over the bed I even went with him upstairs to show him where did we put it but he was rude I got so offended as I felt it s kind of accusation spicifically because we are Muslims Arab A quilt We steal a quilt Come on I strongly asked him to inspect CCTV cam to check on the house cleaners I even asked them to inspect our luggages if he suspects us but he was so weird as if he was sure we stole the quilt even without saying it frankly My family and I really felt bad and furious as we have had many many wonderful experiences with different hotels around the world especially in UK which I really respect and admire We never had such a bad experience and insulting treatment before The staff didn t even apologise for such an insult I definitely would never ever book this what I might label it as racist Hotel again and never recommend it to an Arab friend Shame Shame on them , the location cleanliness
