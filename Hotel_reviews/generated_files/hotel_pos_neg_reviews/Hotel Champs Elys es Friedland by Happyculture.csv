73120,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, Nothing I would definitely go there again , The reception guy is the best there is He s helpful caring and always remembers your name The hotel has a 24hrs complementary coffee and small snacks table and the minibar was free gets refilled every 2 days Location is less than 5 minutes walking from the champs elysee which is perfect 
73121,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, Would have liked a mirror in the bedroom and not just in the toilet but otherwise perfect, Lovely hotel in a central location with lovely little touches which make it special such as macaroons on arrival and a free afternoon tea and mini bar Friendly helpful staff and clean comfortable room perfect to relax in after a busy day sightseeing
73122,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, We only stayed for a one night If we planned to stay more we would ve definitely changed the hotel We had been upgraded to a bigger room which was so small I can t imagine what the other room would have been like The room had poor lighting too dark to put a makeup on, The staff was so friendly
73123,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, No complaints, The room decor was lovely the beds were super comfy the macaroons upon arrival complementary afternoon tea the staff were so helpful and the location could not have been better
73124,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, Way too small elevator and bathroom But acceptable since it is a hotel in paris , Small hotel but good quality Tea time and small sweets prepared at the reception were so nice and adorable Breakfast buffet as well was very small but in a good quality Super nice and kind staffs 
73125,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, The room was quite small Sufficient for our stay but would prefer a bigger space No restaurant or bar however you have the option to help yourself to an alcoholic drink out of hours and write to your room The breakfast was mostly the same each day , Very good location Only about 10 min walk to the closest metro and arc de triumph Staff were very friendly Absolute pleasure to deal with 
73126,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, Lots of descriptions including in this case the name of the hotel imply proximity to places which in reality tend to be a lot further away than one would assume So in this case the Champs d Elysee was actually a few streets away while not necessarily a big deal is useful to know before hand if you are not in fighting form Google maps is your friend , Chain run establishment old Parisian building done up nicely and in a modern style on the inside Very sweet staff 24hr coffee they do serve breakfast but we chose to buy fresh croissants and coffee at the local bakery which were great so cannot comment on the breakfast but people were certainly eating there Location is sort of mixed at a macro level its in a good area at a specific level it is a brisk walk from the metro but there are local buses that stop outside and taxis are plentiful as is Uber and to get to the Opera area etc its a bit of a hike on foot Rooms beds showers all great We got there at noon but couldn t get the room till official check in time so had to mark time but that s not unusual The view from our room looked like the first Bourne movie when Matt Damon goes to Paris wide streets with massive trees and classical buildings cars and bikes parked on both sides We would stay there again 
73127,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, We stayed on top floor where bathroom had slanted ceiling which would not suit a tall person though it was perfect for us if tall I d suggest a lower floor , Lovely boutique hotel in quiet location so close to Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysee plus within walking distance of so many infamous Parisian landmarks Bedroom was very spacious large comfy bed well sound proofed complimentary non alcohol mini bar kettle and safe at no extra charge bathroom very clean with bath shower etc All staff were exceptionally pleasant welcoming helpful and friendly such a lovely hotel to stay in 
73128,Hotel Champs Elys es Friedland by Happyculture, Our room was very well appointed but found that it was too warm and couldn t control the thermostat , We have stayed at this hotel previously and chose to return for a one night stay because of it s great location just off the Champs Elysee and because of the warm welcome and comfort that it offers
