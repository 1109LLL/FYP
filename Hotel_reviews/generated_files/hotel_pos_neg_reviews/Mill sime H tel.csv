55644,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Millesime was an excellent experience A very cute quaint hotel but the room and bathroom extremely spacious for a hotel The location is incredible walking distance to the Louvre and beautiful cafes and restaurants Very safe feeling area at night and the staff were wonderful Can t fault this experience 
55645,Mill sime H tel, I really do not have any complaints I would have loved it if breakfast had been included but that is not so common anymore in Paris , The hotel was terrific It is well located in the 6th arrondissement near the wonderful rue de Seine and rue de Buci The neighborhood is busy and lively but the hotel is on a quiet street the staff were all polite friendly and helpful The many extras like a welcome bottle of wine a gift upon departure heated towel bar in the bathroom and bedtime chocolates on the pillow were much appreciated It is an expensive hotel but worth it 
55646,Mill sime H tel, The room was a little small but more than adequate for two people , The staff was very helpful giving us directions There was a bottle of wine in the room when we arrived Macaroons another day We were a few blocks from the metro The Louve and Museo D orsay where in walking distance Restaurants and bars around the corner 
55647,Mill sime H tel, Missing bar area for social drinks with other residents perhaps, Staff extremely helpful nothing to much trouble Very clean food and drink prices better value than some local bars and cafe s
55648,Mill sime H tel, We stay in hotel for two nights with a week between these stays During first night my partner get ill and we needed to stay longer then 12 00 we stay until 16 00 it was really unfortunate situation hotel manager agreed we can stay longer but they charged us for whole next night I don t mind to pay some fee for not leaving room on time but paying whole next night is simple to much And what was funny next stay they act as we visited their hotel for first time They should track their visitors I didn t expect when I m returning to same hotel after week questions like Are you first time in Paris , location cleanness nice rooms
55649,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Very good location Though the room was small the air conditioned room was rather comfortable For those who wish to do the laundry themselves in a coin laundry shop there is one in the rue de Seine nearby Good breakfast in a charming breakfast room 
55650,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Very convenient location maybe a 7 minute walk from the St Germaine des Pres metro station Many nice restaurants and cafes nearby Few minutes walk to the Seine very modern and clean hotel Helpful front desk staff all spoke English 
55651,Mill sime H tel, Continental breakfast served in the room had a mediocre coffee and croissants I suggest such a nice place should give you better coffee and croissants common we are in Paris at the 6 arrondissment , Excellent location petite hotel de charme in one of the classiest locations in Paris very close to the best of Saint Germain Very nice room tasteful decor supercomfortable bed quiet Walking distance to museums restaurants stores movie theatres art galleries Delightful place to stay for visiting 
55652,Mill sime H tel, Nothing , Elegant wonderfully located delicious buffet breakfast well worth price excellent maid staff very helpful concierge And what could be better than starting our stay with complimentary bottle of chilled wine in our room Room was very quiet and had black out curtains always appreciated when you are jet lagged 
55653,Mill sime H tel, My only complaint is that it was a bit pricey But when in Paris eh , The staff was very nice helpful and attentive The staff helped us book our Moulin Rouge tickets at the front desk as well as our museum tickets Yes The bed was very comfortable which was a huge plus for us considering Paris was our first stop after a 11 hour flight The breakfast selection was so yummy too The location was incredible as well There were awesome bars within the area It was a super start to our honeymoon 
55654,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, I loved the service the room was perfect I loved how quiet the street room was along with the side of the room The staff was amazingly friendly helpful They definitely went the extra mile to make sure I enjoyed my stay I absolutely want to come back 
55655,Mill sime H tel, I have no complaints , The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and very willing to find whatever you need The hotel is beautifully and pleasantly recently renovated The neighborhood in St Germaine has everything Antiques restaurants famous cafes wonderful shopping a Metro Station a taxi station an overall Parisian Left Bank Ambiance 
55656,Mill sime H tel, Rooms on the street side can be noisy but the windows open wide and you get a good view of life on a real street , The hotel is in a wonderfully convenient location an easy walk to the Seine and many sites on the Left Bank The staff is personable and helpful The room was very comfortable quiet and nicely decorated It all functions well 
55657,Mill sime H tel, The cleaning lady didn t clean my room nor change my towels , The location of the hotel is very good Walking distance to all major sights And the surrounding area has many nice restaurants 
55658,Mill sime H tel, The room is comparatively small so everything looks quite compact but it s not a problem for me , Our stay in the Hotel Millesime was great Centrally located in the nice street Rue Jacob of Saint Germain des Pres where there are lots of bars boutiques and galleries The hotel is opened some 10 years ago with recently renovation done last year so it looks very new and cozy From its elegant lobby the garden and courtyard to room decorations all make us feel much comfort And especially its basement breakfast dinning room was superb my favorite part of which the lighting and interior design make the room very warm and comfy Staff are very friendly as well with careful sense of hospitality I would definitely recommend you to live in this property 
55659,Mill sime H tel, Nothing , The friendly professional staff the facilities and most importantly the kettle in the room The terrace was lovely Great location with everything you need just around the corner Would highly recommend 
55660,Mill sime H tel, More room for breakfast , We found the breakfast to be good but very crowded and so much so we missed breakfast one morning due to no room for us The staff was kind caring and so helpful in answering all our questions Great place to read an English newspaper and sip a glass of wine in the small but comfortable garden 
55661,Mill sime H tel, Nothing, Staff are exceptionally helpful in every way extremely professional and helpful The room and facilities were fantastic bathroom amazing The supplied Samsung phone to help with sightseeing shopping etc was a surprising addition Would definitely stay there again 
55662,Mill sime H tel, Be aware the check in is not on time It should be 2pm onwards but we could first check in after 4pm They even needed to change our room as otherwise we could have waited even longer Also mixed up the luggages that were given on hold , Clean fantastic location Very good value 
55663,Mill sime H tel, Breakfast cost 13 Euro but that is the only thing I could think of , The staff location and facility were nothing less than EXCELLENT This place felt luxury nestled in the posh St Germain neighborhood This is a SHORT walk to the Siene Louvre Pont Neuf and other attractions I would recommend this hotel to everyone great Wifi as well 
55664,Mill sime H tel, The room was on the ground floor It was rather small and the view was the courtyard lovely as it was not of Paris , The location in Paris is excellent for walking to the special places of interest The staff were wonderful friendly and very helpful 
55665,Mill sime H tel, Would have loved a bath tub to soak in after a day of walking around Paris but the shower was so lovely it made up for it , Staff were reallu helpful and very friendly Location was perfect We didn t need it as have French mobiles but I thought it was such a nice idea to provide each room with a working local mobile with unlimited Internet data to take with them around the city Couldn t fault our stay there and would definitely stay again 
55666,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The Hotel Staff was wonderful The location was superb We ordered room service roasted chicken and it was beyond delicious We were provided with a free cell phone so I was able to make calls home for free Could not be happier I usually never return to the same hotel however this will be my first choice when I return to Paris 
55667,Mill sime H tel, Breakfast was minimal and rather disappointing especially the irritating DIY egg boiling contraption and lukewarm coffee Not worth the extra charge , Loved the location Staff members were excellent The superior room was a good size and nice to be in for 3 nights 
55668,Mill sime H tel, We just wished the breakfast was included in the price, The staff were extremely friendly The hotel is located on a lovely and safe street in the centre of Paris 
55669,Mill sime H tel, If you want a hotel with a bar and choice of restaurants this is not for you , location was perfect the courtyard room we had was quiet and perfectly furnished the staff left you to enjoy you stay without fussing but nothing was too much trouble if you asked clean well presented I managed to book at a promotional price which made it amazing value for money 
55670,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, A beautiful Boutique hotel with excellent personal treat Elegant and clean rooms My Patio room was absolutely silent what is rare in Paris Highly recommendable also due to its nice shops around and proximity to Metro station 
55671,Mill sime H tel, Absolutely nothing Fabulous hotel , Gorgeous room lovely bathroom quiet street but just around the corner from lively St Germain the Latin Quarter They even provide a free to use smartphone Didn t have breakfast as it was a little pricey but even if they d offered it for free we will always have chosen to eat out You re in Paris grab a pastry and enjoy it by the river
55672,Mill sime H tel, Only 1 room has balcony and I did not a chance to stay in this room breakfast buffet can be better too simple , Very nice little hotel in the heart of Paris walking distance to the area where there are many shops and nice restaurants very convenience A lot of small touches even wine upon artival placed in the rokm which is a nice surprise staff is very helpful and friendly 
55673,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Great location close to many amenities and landmarks but on a quiet side street Friendly and helpful staff Loved the room overlooking Rue Jacob with a comfortable bed and small sitting area Many cafes and restaurants nearby and metro access round the corner Will recommend this to others 
55674,Mill sime H tel, Room was too gray for my taste very fifties sixties modern I gather they are all the same style Not cosy Very quiet on the one hand but room number five at least has no view and very dark Just Fine for one night for someone who knows Paris but would be very disappointing for the casual tourist I would think , Great location in the heart of Saint Germain and friendly staff with a modern and light lobby Comfortable bed and great bathroom Tea and coffee provided in the room 
55675,Mill sime H tel, Breakfast was too expensive in my opinion so we went to an excellent bakery called Paul down the road , A truly wonderful hotel Friendly very helpful staff a lovely welcome drink ice for our champagne on request a beautiful room in this smart little hotel is just what we needed It s a real gem quiet and pretty but 5 10 minutes from everything including the Louvre High ceilings perfectly clean rooms a lift for your luggage just perfect 
55676,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Very comfortable and clean room in an excellent hotel located very centrally in France The shower was fantastic and the bed was lovely Superb location very close to the metro in Saint German des Pres 10 15 minute walk from many top tourist attractions including the Louvre and Note Dame Free bottle of wine provided on arrival and a Samsung mobile phone to use during our time in Paris though we did not avail of this 
55677,Mill sime H tel, One day our tea and coffee wasn t replenished, Excellent location beautiful decor very comfortable and helpful staff On Valentine s Day we were left macaroons in the room which was a lovely touch 
55678,Mill sime H tel, Although the breakfast was of a high standard it was quite expensive for a buffet breakfast The dining area was also quite small and although not a problem on the day for me I can imagine at busy periods there would not be enough room if several quests arrived at a similar time , Excellent location very friendly staff and a lovely hotel for business or leisure Close to the Metro and good location for shops and restaurants 
55679,Mill sime H tel, Nil , Everything was exceptional Our French is limited and reception staff spoke English and were so helpful Property has tiny lift which was very helpful especially if you are above 2nd floor The room was spotless and extremely quiet and private and well heated We visited in January Shower large and great pressure Room had plenty of storage Loved this hotel 
55680,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The welcome bottle of wine set the scene for our stay at Mill sime The room is beautifully decorated quiet very comfortable All the modern comforts in a super location The concierge was helpful the fresh fruit sweets in the lobby macaroons in our room as a parting gift added to a fabulous 4 days in Paris Great recommendation from a friend great value for money We ll be back 
55681,Mill sime H tel, There is a room in the basement for breakfasts but the hotel doesn t do dinner other than via room service We had a very early pickup to the airport when leaving and would have liked to have dinner in the hotel the previous evening for convenience That said we did get the room service and it was fine , The hotel is in a fantastic location with major sites such as Notre Dame and the Louvre within a 10 15 minute walk Our room and the hotel in general was very clean and modern Bathroom was very nice We were there off peak times but the area was quiet at night Staff were very helpful and friendly Would recommend to others travelling to Paris 
55682,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The staff was wonderful so helpful and kind The hotel is on a quiet street yet still in a beautiful area full of shops and restaurants The rooms were spacious by Paris standards mattresses were comfortable and the room was very clean 
55683,Mill sime H tel, No parking available Didn t try the breakfast because I found it very expensive, Really helpful staff helped us a lot with sightseeing suggestions and booking restaurants
55684,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Very nicely decorated hotel friendly staff and spacious room and bathroom for Paris Also a decent bed suitable for two adults Located in a quiet street so we could even leave the windows open at night Staff were very helpful and efficient
55685,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, wonderfully informative helpful staff every day lovely room with special amenities and treats perfect location for blissful meandering as well as sightseeing 
55686,Mill sime H tel, Breakfast was 16 euros extra , The room was very comfortable and light Both the room and the bathroom had a great view and were very quiet The location is fantastic
55687,Mill sime H tel, Nothing not to like We ve not had breakfast there so can t comment Rooms are beautiful and clean Location is perfect and staff are competent and friendly Thank you , Second stay Lovely lovely place to stay 
55688,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Quiet and clean hotel in a central location close to restaurants and sights Nicely furnished Superior room was good size and bed was big and comfortable Staff was friendly 
55689,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Hotel is realy well placed in a charming area Not so many co visitors at the hotel l guess Never met anyone going in or out But that made the stay very carmfull ofcourse
55690,Mill sime H tel, I had to think hard to find something I didn t like but if I had to find a fault for others although it s not something that I would be bothered about is that the lift is small a snug three people lift which was more than adequate for me and the slightly patchy wifi , For me the 6th is the most convenient location as I can walk to most of the sites I want to visit It s a direct line from Gare du Nord A Carrefour is nearby if you want to pick up some fruit or yoghurt as well if you want a change from the petit dejeuner Lots of beautiful places to eat at at all levels of price points The staff were elegantly polite and spoke perfect English which was a help for me Very comfortable bed contemporary bathroom with rain shower and detached head over a bath and lots of power points around the room It s quiet apart from the occasional church chimes on rue Bonaparte Contemporary original artworks dotted around the room and staircase There is an option to take breakfast in the room or in the arched room but I didn t take up the option as I preferred to work up an appetite by walking before breakfast 
55691,Mill sime H tel, the only window of the room had a view on this tiny atrium that was right behind the reception so it felt like lack of privacy, I love the location and the coziness of the room
55692,Mill sime H tel, I have stayed here before often reserving directly w the hotel Thus the good marks I loved the lower price w Booking but unfortunately they gave me small room with access thru an exterior courtyard via a narrow little stairway and it was pouring rain , Service extraordinaire
55693,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Wonderful staff and location Within walking distance to Muse D Orsay the Louvre l Orangine Museum and many resturants and shops Comfortable rooms and beds 
55694,Mill sime H tel, Slightly better price The hotels in Rue Jacob is slowly becoming very expensive , Fantastic location Staff was extremely helpful and came with really good recommendations even for some one like me who visit Paris on a regular basis Reception was definitely 1st class 
55695,Mill sime H tel, Breakfast too expensive for the basic offering Eggs costs 4 euros extra , Th hotel is very well located on the Left Bank close to St Germain des Pres The hotel was ultra clean The staff were very friendly and helpful 
55696,Mill sime H tel, Room was not ready at 2 30 Concierge not that helpful I asked about charges made for using hotel phone and they couldn t give an answer, Quiet room and clean
55697,Mill sime H tel, The reception is not well equipped the printer is on the floor but working properly by the way It is just strange for this time of hotel The room is very small and the maintenance is poor Closet all scratched switcher falling apart , It was very well located and the decoration was new and beautiful 
55698,Mill sime H tel, The only complaint I had was more based on a misunderstanding between the staff that checked us in and who was there at night The night staff essentially checked us out without knowing we wanted to pay separately and in cash for the rooms This is a really minor dislike more of an inconvenience The wifi we were told did not work on the 3rd floor while we were there so we would have to use lobby but by the evening the wifi seemed to be operational , The location is superb close enough to walk to the Seine or St Germain but not so close you re on top of everyone The Louvre is approx 7 minutes walk across the bridge all other attractions in timed proximity to that The hotel is charming in the typical small euro elevator the wide winding staircases and the modern rooms dripping with comfort The staff were happy to recommend places to eat arrange airport shuttle for us 4 persons luggages we were at the end of our trip with luggage that gained weight mysteriously Otherwise the Metro is close by and lots of buses that run to the airport 
55699,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, A very modern hotel in a great location easy to get to all the main sights surrounded by restaurants and cafes Good size room large bathroom with a bath 
55700,Mill sime H tel, Nothing and with complimentary half bottle of wine in each room what is there not to like , We previously visited this hotel 4 years ago and since then the bedrooms have been refurbished and very nice bar reception area built We found improvements to be very tasteful modern but without losing its charm And breakfast in basement is still a wonderful experience with French continental breakfast Hotel is in great location easy walking distance to Louvre Notre Dame and many other sights museums We will certainly return again next time we are in Paris 
55701,Mill sime H tel, Nothing really , The hotel have been newly renovated in 2016 and the rooms are consequently nicely equiped with new furniture and a fresh bath room Hotel is perfectly located in the St Germain area with many restaurants and cafes close by The metro station is also close by and it is easy to reach other parts of this beautiful city Would also like to mention the very nice reception that we got from the receptionist we really felt welcome and well taken care of in this hotel 
55702,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The staff were amazing Super accommodating helpful and friendly Location is also great walking distance to all major sights metro stops and nightlife but just tucked away enough so it wasn t loud at night 
55703,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, It would have been good to know that the hotel was being refurbished Downstairs was a building site and so breakfast was in the basement I went out instead 
55704,Mill sime H tel, It was a shame that the bar area was being refurbished at the time of our stay, Very friendly staff bedroom very clean and modern furnishing Lovely breakfast
55705,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The hotel was lovely the room and ensuite were clean and comfortable It s perfectly located minutes away from The Louvre and St Germain de Pres metro station with direct links to Gare du Nord station for eurostar and there are some lovely restaurants nearby Highly recommend
55706,Mill sime H tel, Cleaning staff didn t leave enough toilet paper and facial paper in the bathroom after they cleaned the room, Very good Hotel with good location the receptionists at the desk were very helpful and knowledgeable about local restaurants and attractions
55707,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The rooms in the hotel are exceptionally clean all furniture is very new The location is brilliant and the staff of the hotel is very pleasant and helpful
55708,Mill sime H tel, I believe the lobby was being renovated Therefore the existing condition I found the entrance was not so ideal however the staff and how I was greeted made up for it , The location was perfect Upon entering in the lobby I was greeted with a warm welcome The room I was upgraded was very comfortable and was nicely decorated with modern touches I loved the men s fabric curtain it gave it a warm feel to the room and the bed was very comfortable 
55709,Mill sime H tel, Our room faced the street and when we arrived we could hear everything We were worried that we would hear noise from Rue Jacob throughout the night but the street was quiet after the shops below closed and was not noisy at all So we have no complaints , We loved the central location to everything we wanted to do and the hotel staff were so helpful and welcoming We would absolutely book with this hotel again 
55710,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, The staff were wonderful very helpful and friendly The room we had was really nice and the location was very central to the things we wanted to see 
55711,Mill sime H tel, That I had to leave , I really like the LOCATION as some of my favourite shops are on rue Jacob especially GIEN CASPARI LA MAISON IVRE I have been coming to this street for many years and have stayed in this lovely hotel more than once Will be back in March 
55712,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, We had an amazing stay here the location was fantastic close to all the main shops and restaurants in St Germain and also close to the metro and river The staff were extremely helpful particularly Louie who recommended some great restaurants and arranged for us to stay later on our day of check out at no extra cost His friendliness and helpfulness had a great impact on making our trip to Paris so enjoyable The room was spacious the bed very comfortable I slept very well there Overall a brilliant hotel with great staff in a great location Would definitely go back 
55713,Mill sime H tel, Really nothing It would be nitpicking to say the elevator was small , Wonderful location We liked the charm of this small hotel Our room was updated nicely It felt good to return to after a day out The bathroom was equipped with every amenity Linens were exceptional The staff was friendly and quite helpful We would absolutely stay here again 
55714,Mill sime H tel, While it was nice it just didn t have a lot of charm and character that some people look for in Paris especially for the neighborhood , Everyone at the front desk was very welcoming all the time We had a superior room and the bathroom was huge 
55715,Mill sime H tel, View from our window wasn t that great construction across the street , Great hotel in the heart of Paris Easy walking distances to all the sites especially all the great cafes and restaurants 
55716,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, Well designed immaculate comfortable rooms with helpful staff on a quiet street in an otherwise buzzing neighbourhood near the Seine and the Metro with a Ladur e just a few doors away We could even see the laser lights from the Eiffel Tower from our 4th floor room 
55717,Mill sime H tel,No Negative, All the staff was wonderful Louis and Matthieu were outstanding helping with tickets maps just everything They arranged a take away breakfast for us as we had to leave very early on a tour And everything was always CLEAN
