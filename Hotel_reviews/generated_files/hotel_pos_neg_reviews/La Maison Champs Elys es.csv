250710,La Maison Champs Elys es, Bad room looking forward to a hot bath afer a very cold day sightseeing Bath plug leaked and would not seal Complained immediately to reception who sent a handyman to try to fix disturbing us No bath When we went out for the evening and came back at about 11 pm Receptionist suggested we might like to use a bath in another room We complained when checking out next morning and asked for a reduction and were informed this was not possible as the room was booked through Booking com , Decor was good
250711,La Maison Champs Elys es, Rooms could have been a bit bigger for the price and the hotel s description They weren t small just a bit on the cosy side Room facilities also weren t special , Staff were exceptional Location was perfect Price was very reasonable for the location Did I mention the staff 
250712,La Maison Champs Elys es, I felt like I was in the Siberian annex with a strange passageway to get to elevator Also they closed their restaurant bar on a Friday holiday which seemed weird since it s a hotel Most everything else in Paris was open Rooms a little too minimal zero on the walls and bathroom didn t even have a towel rack so I couldn t be very earth friendly with wet towels Its not the end of the world but those little things count at their price point and for those who travel a lot , Very comfortable hotel and room with large bathroom Bed was super comfortable with great linens Very quiet with nice back view Staff is friendly and very helpful Great location if you need to be near Grand Palais etc Very chic attractive place I ll stay there again

250714,La Maison Champs Elys es,No Negative, Services provided by hotel staffs are professional level as I expected from this hotel which induced our high comfort level during our stay Also a small item such as shoe polish machine in front of elevator indicated that the hotel provided a consideration to customers since Paris had soil roads in some areas It was very useful We are very satisfied
