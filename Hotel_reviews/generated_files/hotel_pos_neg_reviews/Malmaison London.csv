73225,Malmaison London, There are few good choices to eat around this area after office hours and the WIFI is terrible The WIFI is via a website that drops out every minute and the capacity is third world and there is no 4G coverage either only 3G on the O2 network , Theprice was the main attraction for this property The location was a bit off the main areas and it was a 20 ride from Paddington Station where the 74 for 2 return Heathrow Express drops you from the airport So Barbican isn t the wisest choice if this is your destination from Heathrow The room had angles and posts in strage places taking up considerable space The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was satisfactory 
73226,Malmaison London, No marking with the shower choices and the temperature adjustment Bad for the business itself and inconvenient for customers , We upgraded our room It was fine 
73227,Malmaison London, The food and drink within the room appeared to be free but the prices were hidden behind the food and drink, We stayed here on our wedding night and they beautifully prepared the room with chocolate strawberries and rose petals and the option for breakfast in bed It was fabulous 
73228,Malmaison London, No problems at all, Staff very helpful Peaceful location overlooking the square Convenient for buses No 63 from Farringdon goes to Kings Cross about 13 mins Plenty of amenities nearby Tube is near too Would return Thanks to staff we had a lovely break 
73229,Malmaison London, The cook breakfast wasn t the best specially the horrible eggs , Room was excellent and quiet and Bed was so comfortable The hotel was very close to the underground good to move around 
73230,Malmaison London, We tried unsuccessfully to have a drink in the bar very slow service no draught beer ended up going elsewhere nearby , The room was comfortable had good amenities Lovely food good service in the restaurant 
73231,Malmaison London, The room was very small by the time we got our suitcases inside we could hardly move around in it The woman who checked us in also served as bell boy ,No Positive
73232,Malmaison London, We found everything very good, The very warm welcome from the staff and friendliness of the management The hotel was very quiet so we got a good night s sleep 
73233,Malmaison London, Breakfast could have been included , Amazing welcome when we arrived along with a complementary drink All of the staff were lovely and the room was great clean right temperature and good facilities 
73234,Malmaison London, We did have a bit of an issue with room service I requested two sandwiches on the Saturday night after a long day sight seeing It was 10 15pm so didn t want a big meal The restaurant manager refused this and informed us we could only have food off the Al La Carte menu This seem ridiculous that they would make us a full steak dinner but not a sandwich We expressed our dismay to the receptionist who totally agreed and rectified the situation We were served with fabulous sandwiches and fries They deducted the service delivery charge and 50 of the cost , The room was spacious and came with robes and fluffy towels The bed was extremely comfortable and pillows like sleeping on clouds Bar staff extremely willing to mix whatever cocktails you want Reception staff fabulous friendly and helpful I had mentioned we were visiting for my Daughters 21st birthday They had left her a beautiful decorated plate with her favourite chocolate brownie and a card A lovely touch 
73235,Malmaison London, Service in restaurant was a bit too slow considering it was not busy at all 3 4 other tables , Bed was excellent size and very comfortable club room Very nice decor and atmosphere 
73236,Malmaison London, Room needed a tiny bit of attention Carpet grip was exposed sink was blocked but when we mentioned it staff jumped on it straight away and we were compensated , Location rooms were lovely staff were great
73237,Malmaison London, We didn t get anythings as your description room space view from the room room decoration and etc It s just a 3 star tourist hotel Try to avoid it if your expected more than that , Nothings 
73238,Malmaison London, My room standard could have been a bit bigger But it is London and for one person it was ok, Great location nice decor Fantastic restsurant Lovely bathroom 
73239,Malmaison London,No Negative, The bed was extremely comfortable all of the facilities worked the staff were amazing and they put some honey and slices of lemon in to our room because they knew we had been to a concert and they knew we would have sore throats It was a very kind gesture and it made the stay extra special 
73240,Malmaison London, The rooms could have been a little bit cleaner around the edges , The Club Room was fantastic and the staff on Check In were amazing Came back after attending a concert to find ginger tea with honey and lemon and a note saying its to soothe the sore throat from all that singing Fab customer service 
73241,Malmaison London, Nothing The hotel and the trip was lovely all around , The rooms were beautifully decorated completely different to any malmaison ive stayed in before Staff on reception were very polite and let us check in 2 hours early without having to pay a fee 
73242,Malmaison London, Everything was excellent, We were greeted by one the most friendliest staff and quickly found out all the staff were amazingly friendly but this one young lady in particular made me fall in love with Paris She was attentive to our needs helped us in and around the city and was just a breath of fresh air to walk down to each morning The location of this boutique hotel is central to everything Metro is 200 mtrs away the best restaurants around are just around the corner The bedroom is a little small but the bathroom made up for that I mean for its location it is understandable I cannot recommend highly enough this accommodation and the staff fantastic it made our time in Paris truly memorable Thank you
73243,Malmaison London, I generally like this hotel mainly for its location and comfy beds but what I really don t like is all the banter plastered around almost every surface which I find slightly patronising and dated it s the sort of thing you expect on Virgin trains Dare to be Different on the bathroom mirror etc etc ugh Also the place could do with a lick of paint here and there otherwise it s nice , The hotel is in a good location Charterhouse Square is historic and attractive The beds and linen are good and it is quiet and you are a stones throw from Farringdon tube and the Barbican The staff sorted out a problem with my room quickly The food is fine and generally it has all the facilities of a proper hotel 
73244,Malmaison London, We liked everything, Bed super comfortable We upgraded to a suite which was fabulous the staff were really lovely We ate in the Bistrol on the Friday evening and it was faultless
73245,Malmaison London, Our air conditioning didn t work uncomfortable Upgraded room but to be honest I couldn t see the difference , Just a quirky place to stay Plus I loved all the quotes around the place room nice and everything on hand 
73246,Malmaison London, Staff were very poor took them a while to understand what we wanted at check in queues to check out delays in breakfast orders very rigid in relation to what we could order for breakfast ie you can only have the breakfast exactly as outlined in the menu rather than what the customer would actually like Bar staff cleaning up around you in the resident s bar did not make it feel comfortable or welcoming Expensive hotel for this level of service , Rooms are good funky design very comfortable bed 
73247,Malmaison London, The clarity on the Booking com website my booking says This is a non refundable booking which indicated to me that I had paid when I booked Nowhere in anything to do with my booking can I see that it says I need to take the card with me or that payment had not been taken I used a work card to book as it was a business trip and did not have the card with me of course I therefore have had to pay and will now have to seek a refund from my place of work This not only caused me embarrassment it was quite stressful as I did not have all my cards with me either I d like to know how I was supposed to know that payment had not been taken and that I would have needed the card to be with me please Thank you , Breakfast was ingenious and HUGE Loved it Bed was so comfortable I had the best night s sleep I d had in weeks The staff were all so helpful and even when I had an issue with something they were so polite and offered solutions I know I was hot and bothered but they were cool and calm and very polite 
73248,Malmaison London,No Negative, Ingus apologise if I ve spelt his name wrong the reception host was excellent he was very accommodating for me my partner and our 11 month old son Logan Breakfasts were excellent good size room great parking We Will come back to stay as we love the area the hotel was lovely and the staff also We stay at the Malmaison in Edinburgh and it s nice to know the standards are the same even when 400 miles apart Well done team Regards James Pearson Glenn India Baby Logan 
73249,Malmaison London, The price was outrageous 309 and without breakfast Did they make a mistake VAT was added not included , Ideal location for my business meeting in Smithfied Street And ideal location for a real ale pub The Fox only 100 yards away for beer supper and breakfast And a good quality hotel in general 
73250,Malmaison London, It was a short stay and I cannot recall anything to dislike , I particularly liked the reception staff from the very helpful and welcoming young man at our early check in to the warm and friendly young lady who checked us out and took the trouble to engage us in conversation about our current visit and possible future ones The human and welcoming aspect of our stay did so much to enhance our visit 
73251,Malmaison London, Housekeeping didn t remove empty bottles and used glasses from the room The smell in the lifts , Breakfast was great staff very helpful Comfortable room and bed and great bathroom
73252,Malmaison London,No Negative, A great location as we could walk everywhere The hotel was perfect unobtrusive service and a quick response to any requests We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return A wonderful place for our honeymoon 
73253,Malmaison London, The way into the hotel grounds was a little difficult for the taxi driver to find I think that there were a number of complimentary snacks in the room but it was difficult to tell perhaps if they can be clearer about this that would be helpful , A great location in London and a really lovely room We were newlyweds and they welcomed us with rose petals a card and chocolate dipped strawberries 
73254,Malmaison London, The cleaners are very noisy we could hear them from each day from side and above our room, We loved that we had a mini fridge this is quite important to us when we stay in hotels 
73255,Malmaison London, Took a taxi to Threadneedle st in the morning traffic was awful , Very pleasant and welcoming staff sorry busy weekend forgot the name of the young lady on reception but she was great Characterful pubs nearby Charter house next door fascinating 
73256,Malmaison London,No Negative, Location is great A comfortable hotel at a good discount price A number modestly priced restaurant within 10 minutes walking distance I would go back again if the price was right 
73257,Malmaison London, Nothing, I cannot rate the hotel and staff of Malmaison London highly enough My friend and I were in London for 2 days and had a fantastic time The room the Mal suite was stunning the view from our room on to Charterhouse square The Sunday lunch with unlimited proscecco extra 15 was bliss 
73258,Malmaison London, There was a funny smell in the room which we think was a grapefruit or some fruity room fragrance which wasn t to our taste smelt almost like cat wee Other than that is was pretty perfect , Great location to the Barbican which is what we wanted lovely extras for our anniversary on arrival which were a really nice touch 
73259,Malmaison London, Huge clock ticking really bugged my partner Room v compact for standard room zod knows how small the cosy one is Water to shower didnt go very warm Could turn off air con but there was still quite a noisy vent into the room , The staff were ultra friendly Pillows n duvet v luxurious Bed felt comfy but both got awful back pain Decor of room v modern and relaxing
73260,Malmaison London, Having to empty the contents of the fridge before I could put my own nibbles and drinks in , The bed had that feeling of luxury and was very comfy The room temperature I could manage very easily The staff couldn t have been more helpful 
73261,Malmaison London, They didnt allocate us rooms on the same floor even though we booked together The receptionist wrote the wrong number on my key ticket so after several attempts to get in the room and 2 visits to reception I finally got told that she had written the wrong number down Not a great start,No Positive
73262,Malmaison London, We had a small double room as we were out most of the time Despite there being 2 of us in the room we only had one set of towels in the bathroom Eventually found a second set in the wardrobe but every day they were returned to the wardrobe not left in the bathroom Also only 1 bathrobe which we didn t use anyway so only a minor niggle The tea coffee making tray only contained Green or Earl Gray tea and despite us asking for normal black tea this only happened once Also on 2 days we received tea leaves not teabags difficult without a teapot Also never enough milk for 2 people , Location was excellent close to tube station and within easy walking distance of lots of main London sights The staff were helpful and friendly Breakfast buffet was good Bed was really comfortable and shower really hot and powerful 
73263,Malmaison London, Whilst we were there a film crew were shooting a short film Under normal circumstances that would have been exciting However with all of the film equipment and crew being stationed right outside our room it made it very inconvenient and noisy The crew really didn t give much respect to the patrons of the hotel at all When mentioning this to the staff of the hotel they also really couldn t have given much concern to our complaint A little more training to all the foreign staff could go a long way , The Hotel is amazing Modern finishes amazing comfort a shower to die for and it has been finished off with a lot of thought and class The bed was the best of our entire 3 week Honeymoon The pillows not so great but in general we both had some well deserved sleep 
73264,Malmaison London, There was a movie being filmed at the hotel which delayed our checkout a bit but nothing major When asking to book a taxi you will get a private car service that doesn t accept credit cards When we asked to simply be ordered a normal taxi as we had not cash left on our last morning the lady at reception said that couldn t be done Obviously they get a kick back from the car company but frustrating the customer s needs didn t come first , The hotel is lovely and very well presented The restaurant serves stunning food and staff are highly trained and professional 
73265,Malmaison London, Booking com said the hotel had parking it doesnt they ask another property if they have any space and if so its an extra 30 a day so that was abit of a surprise , Room was lovely Athough asked for early check in at 12 got there by 1pm and the room was not ready so had to pay 25 for an upgrade Lovely hotel though very chic and very comfy bed 
73266,Malmaison London, The lighting in the bedroom not the best and was disappointed that there was no magnifying mirror in bathroom for use when applying make up , The bed was the best good size and very comfortable The Reception Bar and Restaurant staff were very polite and extremely helpful When coming to London again I would consider a return visit to MalMaisson The tube station was easily accessed only 2 mins from hotel the food in restaurant was excellent but we only visited once as were busy other nights 
73267,Malmaison London, We walked into a speed dating session in the bar There were no signs up indicating a private function was taking place, Bed and pillows very comfy All staff polite and smiling 
73268,Malmaison London, Nothing it was why I booked a Malmaison hotel over others It s special , When my wife and I booked in on the Friday afternoon my wife casually mentioned that we were down in London to see a show as it was her birthday that weekend You can imagine our supprise when we got back into our room late afternoon on the Saturday to find a slice of cake and a card from the hotel wishing my wife a happy birthday It was a lovely gesture and made my wife s day 
73269,Malmaison London, The cleaning staff did not provide enough towels or soap they treated it as single room occupancy , The reception staff were excellent and there nothing that they would not do 
73270,Malmaison London, Small thing really but the shampoo had definitely already been used and water and bubbles came out the cap when i opened it so it had obviously been used by people before , Check in process was smooth and got straight into room only had one set of towels in room although there was two of us requested additional set of towels which arrived quickly Close to Barbican underground quiet area 
73271,Malmaison London, Electric outlet in the bathroom didn t fit the 3 prong uk adapter or 2 prong Canadian 120v plug No biggie at all tho, Great attention to detail and very comfortable bedding
73272,Malmaison London, Nothing I can think of , The hotel is in a lovely quiet location although very close to great transport links The decor is quirky but really stylish The bed was really comfy and the duvet just divine The reception staff were especially friendly and helpful I ll be returning to Malmaison for my next London trip 
73273,Malmaison London, Breakfast was a disappointment service time waiting for breakfast was long was not told to help ourselves to cereal etc didn t know that the table was there as where we were seated it was hidden from our view , Style comfort luxury amenities
73274,Malmaison London, Had to ask for dishes and glasses for breakfast several times staff bit slow taking orders for breakfast, Staff very friendly and very welcoming a really good atmosphere
73275,Malmaison London, Room was very dusty Bathroom also not great Something in the toilet bowl and a dirty strip down the side of the bin Cleaning starts early and the cleaners like banging doors instead of using a door stop to keep open We are early risers so if you like a lie in with relative silence forget it , Comfy pillows and duvet Excellent Wi Fi service Superb location 
73276,Malmaison London, nothing all was great, Malmaison Club rooms are spacious clean and the bed is extremely comfortable great bathroom and shower Staff were friendly and helpful and Sunday lunch in the Brassiere was very nice 
73277,Malmaison London, There was a bad smell in the bathroom that I suspect came from drains I didn t notice it at first but it deteriorated as the night went on I was only there for one night so I didn t follow up I m sure it could have been sorted if I had spoken to them but I was too busy to do that Lighting in the bedroom was a little dim for writing and reading , Wi Fi was great for working Bed was super comfy Room was quiet no noise to prevent sleep The Location was super The staff were lovely I would definitely go back for these points
73278,Malmaison London, Nothing, The beds were really comfortable and the towels super soft The shower was perfect Charterhouse Square is an amazing location for the hotel and somewhere we would like to explore on another occasion 
73279,Malmaison London, We had two small bottles of water and biscuits on our first day but these weren t replenished Also there was only one English tea teabag for the whole 3 days we stayed there , Nice room and lovely bathroom Comfortable bed and soft fluffy towels Lighting in the room very good 
73280,Malmaison London, Had hoped for shampoo and conditioner there were only two large tubes of shower gel although it was very nice , Stylish large room with everything you need for a comfortable stay espresso machine kettle with quality tea bags reasonably priced and well stocked minibar decent sized safe for laptop 
73281,Malmaison London, Nothing really , Beds were comfortable and the pillows out of this world Waterfall feature on showers were awesomenonce you worked it out and the quirky messages on the toiletries etc were refreshing Great boutique hotel Breakfast also great 
73282,Malmaison London, Room had a blocked drain smell when we woke up in the morning which I reported to reception so they should action something, Room was nicely designed and comfortable Great Location near to St Pauls
73283,Malmaison London, The breakfast service was friendly but incredibly slow I waited almost 40 minutes for scrambled eggs , I loved the duvet on the bed and the shampoo which I stole 
73284,Malmaison London, Fire alarm practice at 6 15am In room wine was very expensive The bed was too soft and the duvet too small , Staff were very helpful Toiletries were great Room was small but luxurious 
73285,Malmaison London, Bed too firm and had to ask three times for extra duvet to pad it , Very helpful staff we asked to leave our luggage before check in time and were actually given a room
73286,Malmaison London, I paid for the club room In advance but my guests got it on the day fir extra 20 only go for normal room and ask on arrival about upgrade options , It was my wedding weekend and the staff went out of the way to be helpful and welcoming Really added to the experience 
73287,Malmaison London, Can t think of anything it was all good , Decor of the room was great Shower fantastic Pillows really good quality and so was the duvet Charles Eames chair for lounging on Very good location for buses and tube Not too far to walk to the heart of things either

73289,Malmaison London, Building work on the square prevented me from parking outside which is normally available, Helpful staff on reception restaurant on site offers dinner and breakfast room service which was great because I wanted to relax in my room best rain shower head ever in the bathroom very well stocked mini bar and snacks in separate dressing area just around the corner from Smithfield market and looks out on Charterhouse Square
73290,Malmaison London, Serving American grade steak in the restaurant when you have the most famous Smithfield meat market across the road Lack of knowledge of the young lady on restaurant reception Room size rather small compared to other Hotels in this class Rather club like decor in public area particularly restaurant ugh , Style of the room Very quiet Reception staff excellent Location is unusual and very interesting Good selection of local restaurants Outside of the building very attractive and historic Good selection of room nibbles 
73291,Malmaison London,No Negative, We were slightly underwhelmed by this hotel particularly after having stayed at Malmaison Oxford The room was smallish and the breakfast extra Not unusual perhaps but at 199 night this was a bit rich The staff were very good and friendly and the food good 
73292,Malmaison London, Shower was not very powerful Would have been nice to have free mineral water rather than part of the mini bar Only had one pack of biscuits to share between us But they were very nice biscuits Hot water was more warm water , Convenient location for transport links Quiet Late check out All the added extras such as tea coffee fridge etc
73293,Malmaison London, House keeping arrived at 9am on saturday morning Was not able to find a do not disturb sign for following night but thankfully they didn t arrive again , Room decor was really nice as with all Malmaisons 
73294,Malmaison London, Bad smell coming thru the bathroom Paying for the rooms upfront and not at check out time hotels normally take a credit cards swipe , The decor Good location Friendly staff
73295,Malmaison London, We requested an early check in which was actually confirmed by you in an email saying it HAD been agreed we got there for half 11 to check in for 12 to be told we couldn t until 3 so had to wait around Also there seems to be a lot of noise on a morning banging doors and building works going on right over the road, Food was superb
73296,Malmaison London, Air con was a bit noisy and we couldn t see how to turn it down in the middle of the night, Lovely large bed and a big room with plenty of hanging space for clothes A good coffee machine with great coffee not just a kettle 
73297,Malmaison London,No Negative, Superb hotel exceptional service and rooms that provides a unique experience It represented great value for more money It s location and ease of access and personal safety will make us want to return to this hotel 
73298,Malmaison London,No Negative, Extra comfortable bed Staff incredibly helpful and friendly Roadworks outside weren t expected but couldn t fault Malmaison Would definitely return 
73299,Malmaison London,No Negative, Found the room and facilities to be of a high standard quality room which you felt comfortable staying in and didn t feel the need to leave the room 
73300,Malmaison London, I wish it were a bit cheaper but it s in London so the price is to be expected , Location was great as there were quite a few eateries and pubs near the hotel As well it s very close to 2 tube stations Barbican and Farringdon We really enjoyed our stay here 
73301,Malmaison London, water from the shower went all over the room a very noisy clock was above the bed and made it hard for me sleep cleaning lady came in unannounced at 9 37 although it was my check out date and the check out time was 12 00 so she woke me up , Location style of room nice bar on the ground floor
73302,Malmaison London, Service charge added for 2 glasses of wine But it was Christmas Eve and the staff were working hard , Relaxed atmosphere and attentive and friendly staff Lovely spacious rooms and being able to open the window for fresh air 
73303,Malmaison London,No Negative, Myself and my husband spent Christmas Eve Christmas Day and Boxing Day here The hotel was fabulous great location friendly staff and very comfortable We will definitely return 
73304,Malmaison London, Nothing All good , Excellent location nice room and friendly staff I organised my wife s birthday lunch there and it was all really well done 
73305,Malmaison London, The uncomfortable beddding Not having a T V Remote Wasn t very good heating the room was rather cold Some of the paint had peeled off the wall and stains on the carpet in room , The decor in the Hotel itself and the bathroom in my room 
73306,Malmaison London, the room we stayed in was noisy and wasnt very big we asked to change rooms beacause of the extracter noise and found there were empty rooms much bigger and cleaner for the same price , breakfast was really tasty and fresh 
73307,Malmaison London, They forgot my room service order They weren t apologetic when the shower didn t work properly They charged me twice for breakfast I only realised when I got home The basin sprayed water all over the floor as the tap was too powerful for the shape The bathroom smelt of sewage The manager woman was charmless verging on rude about the shower problem, Very comfortable bed
73308,Malmaison London, The fact that the TV stations didn t correspond to the numbers on the most unhelpful Guide in the room , Everything Bar the TV instruction leaflet 
73309,Malmaison London, Constant issue with me is the fine details in hotels this is not a cheap hotel by any means bathroom was not as clean as it should be toilet was dirty and shower was not clean as it should be remember there are strangers sharing after each other cleanliness is therefor a huge pre requisite Oh and does 3 tiny little milk cartons provide a coffee I checked into my room early afternoon used the milk and when I returned and got up in the morning no milk ,No Positive
73310,Malmaison London, Cleanliness of the room was disappointing with stains on the floor duvet and pillows no duvet of pillow protectors under covers Not nice, The bed was comfy
73311,Malmaison London,No Negative, We stayed here at a great rate being a Sunday night and having booked a long while ago we stayed for a next day appointment at st Barts hospital so the location was perfect
73312,Malmaison London, The room was freezing when I arrived the bathroom was OK but the bed very comfortable The biggest disappointment was the lobby bar which lacked atmosphere so I made a quick exit to a more appealing local hostelry, Perfect welcome at reception very warm and cordial Location is great for some cool restaurants and bars not the hotel bar but I chose it for meetings nearby 
73313,Malmaison London, The price having been in similarly priced hotels the room was small by comparison the bathroom covered the bare essentials and it just felt overrated for what you got Sorry, The bed was comfy and the style of the hotel was modern and the staff were lovely
73314,Malmaison London, Freezing room and a cold water shower made for a grim stay This hotel is a little run through and requires some TLC No excuse for the heating not working though FInally jolted the staff into action to get me a portable heater The toilets smelled and the rooms are very dim which is annoying when you have work to do , Bed comfy enough and the iron was good quality 
73315,Malmaison London, liked everything, Club room very nice requested quiet room and we got it Breakfast good quality Meal in restaurant outstanding Nothing was cheap but you get what you pay for quality 
73316,Malmaison London, Building work opposite but can t do anything about that but to be fair no noise or mess, A very relaxing atmosphere with very attentive staff in all roles
73317,Malmaison London, I ordered room service food and unfortunately received a lobster risotto instead of the mushroom risotto I had ordered I am vegetarian and also have a food intolerance to seafood So I spent most of the night with an upset stomach and in the bathroom I informed the Reception twice of my predicament I was not offered any reduction on my food bill and I had to pay an extortionate amount for a lobster dish that I ate two spoonfuls of and that ruined my visit I have since attempted to contact the hotel three times once through email a second time through Booking com and a third time through email again I have not received a response to any of my communications Extremely poor customer service , The room was spacious 
73318,Malmaison London, There is building work going on opposite the hotel at the moment nothing that Mal can do about it but sometimes its a bit annoying I don t think there was on Sunday though which was good You could hear a little of what was going on upstairs but that only saturday night and people are always a little more clunky after a good night out , We stayed for our 10 year anniversary consequently a proposal which I knew nothing of The staff were lovely we had a congratulations card a chocolate torte for our 10 years as a couple waiting in our room When they found out our engagement the restaurant manager insisted that we have Champagne on them Lovely staff gorgeous hotel and a fantastic location The beds are massive so comfy you wont want to get up Farringdon tube station is round the corner and so is Barbican Gorgeous bars lots of places to eat close by We loved going back to the hotel to rest up before going back out for dinner St Paul s Catherdral is only a few minutes walk away is definitely worth it We barely went into Westminster and generally stayed away from the touristy places Loved our stay will definitely go back 
73319,Malmaison London,No Negative, Great room Staff were excellent But they were understaffed at breakfast no glasses for the juice had to go and ask for a cup and saucer and steal Stuff from other table settings Shame as otherwise excellent not the staffs fault they were working very hard 
73320,Malmaison London, Room service tray charge , Oscar was so helpful at reception I lost my charger and he let me borrow one the He helped with transport so so nice Lovely Scottish lady at reception in the morning was also really helpful
73321,Malmaison London, some of the restaurant staff did not understand English very well so when telling them what we wanted for breakfast Either had to tell them several times or they got the order wrong But we didn t complain as our stay on the whole was fab , Reception staff very helpful especially Oscar and I feel he should be praised for this 
73322,Malmaison London, No bedside lamp which was a pain and we found really odd in such a well thought out room so had to get out of bed to turn lights out Rooms drinks snacks were expensive , Feather pillows and quilt were a big win Huge flat screen tv Small but perfectly designed room with gorgeous decor and we did know that the room would be small Fresh filter coffee fluffy gowns and slippers added to the feeling of luxury Perfect for an anniversary treat Great location just a few minutes walk from Farringdon tube train station Nice places to eat within walking distance 
73323,Malmaison London, ordered the Parma ham and cheese toasted sandwich from the late night room service menu and there was no way it was Parma ham It was absolutely disgusting Plastic Asda value style ham Just because we were drunk doesn t mean you could make fools of us Massive rip off ,No Positive
73324,Malmaison London, Nothing everything was perfect , Loved the atmosphere here very calm and chilled Friendly helpful staff in all area s the restaurant was good value for money and food well presented and delicious We were offered an upgrade for a good price and took it the room was amazing comfortable clean massive bed and a huge walk in shower We will return In fact we have just booked for another Sunday night stay and we enjoy Sunday Lunch in the restaurant mm mm
73325,Malmaison London, Regarding cleanliness the bed linens and bathroom were very clean so this was not a problem at all But there were many stains on the carpet which seemed not to have been changed for quite some time I had booked a standard room I was offered an upgrade for about 30GBP It made the check in a very commercial process while I had room upgrades for free in many other hotel chains , The room was comfortable and I liked the location of the hotel 
73326,Malmaison London, blinding work going on across road noisy from 7 am can hear the workers talking etc also rooms are not soundproofed too well woke up twice in night I thought someone was in room not too easy to find, great decor lovely hotel comfy beds malmaison standard
73327,Malmaison London, For the price I paid I was expecting to have a foam mattress bed not spring topped with foam clean carpets ironed curtains I was also so surprised to see that the paid breakfast consisted only of cold eats like cereal pastries fruits and yogurts If you wanted a warm breakfast you had to pay extra Considering the sheer amount of 4 star hotels in London I d never go back to this one ,No Positive
73328,Malmaison London, Reception staff were very pleasant but seemed a little vague as though they were all trainees , Room was clean comfortable and spacious Noise from building work outside was intrusive 
73329,Malmaison London, just the price particularly breakfast but we are not used to London prices so it is probably good value, Everything about the hotel was great the staff the rooms etc 
73330,Malmaison London, Breakfast was included in our price but could not have it as our train home was at 8 30 and as it was Saturday breakfast only started at 8 need to make breakfast open earlier, Comfy beds
73331,Malmaison London, Having stayed at Malmaison London on two previous occasions I booked this confidently knowing that myself and my partner have always had a brilliant experience The extremely poor service from the front reception staff and duty manager during this stay has meant that I will never be returning With regards to the room it was extremely cramped and small and in need of some repairs as the curtain fixture was broken and the shower didn t work properly , The location
73332,Malmaison London, The neighborhood seems a little sketchy at first glance but it was fine The hallways seemed a little worn but clean No pool or gym but you re trading modern conveniences for some old world charm , It s a convenient location The bed and bedding were comfortable and the bathroom modern Iron was new lighting good 
73333,Malmaison London, Nightclub music in restaurant, Very friendly staff who are willing to assist Nice change to the usual London experience The bathroom accoutrements are very good 
73334,Malmaison London, The hotel could be a bit warm especially in the bathrooms but air conditioning helped maintain temperatures in the main room, Loved the room comfortable and clean staff were polite and welcoming 
73335,Malmaison London, The only downside was one staff person at the front desk We quickly learned that any time we called the front desk for assistance and reached her our issue would almost never get resolved despite her assurances But that s how we found out how great the Lady in Red was She never let us down , We really liked the location It was not in a touristy section so we weren t overwhelmed by crowds traffic and noise It was close to the metro which made it easy to get around but it was also walking distance to some good tourist sites if we preferred to walk There were several good pubs and restaurants steps away from our front door And the room was a good size By the way the hotel s Lady in Red was awesome She quickly resolved any issue we had during our stay My guess is she was the concierge but we never asked 
73336,Malmaison London, There was a bit of confusion about what to do with our car and the receptionist failed to tell us that we had to move it at 8am Charged 30 to park on the road then later I was told we could have left it where it was by then we had moved it to a NCP at further cost , The Hotel has been refurbished since we last went and all looks gorgeous The room was comfy and light with fab views Generous toiletries with instruction to steal I love the location in this historic square convenient for the Barbican Charterhouse Poirots flat in the square Generous with the cooked breakfast 
73337,Malmaison London, Although room was clean vent going from bedrooom to bathroom needed cleaning , Liked everything about the stay Food was good Staff were excellent nothing too much trouble Location for my stay was excellent 
73338,Malmaison London, Lots of noise in the morning from building work opposite can t be helped but would like to have been warned our room was to close to the lifts so heard people coming up to bed early hours Parking was a bit of a walk wiv luggage, The bed was spacious in the club room and lovely pillows 
73339,Malmaison London,No Negative, Got a great deal from Booking com Didn t have breakfast as we were having brunch with a wedding party at the Zetter House but I can t fault any of our stay Didn t have much interaction with staff but checking in was fine 
73340,Malmaison London, Breakfast was expensive , 2 members of staff Kylie and Julia went out of their way to be extra helpful We were attending a 2 30pm wedding and they made it possible for us to have early access to our room in order for us to prepare after a long journey 
73341,Malmaison London, Shower was cold our room window faced a brick wall no early checking and Kate checkout available, Room was lovely and lunch in Resturant was nice staff please
73342,Malmaison London, Breakfast buffet not luxurious after amazing evening meal but good choice Would like homemade granola and more mixed fresh fruit for yoghurt and cereal, Comfortable room and helpful reception staff Shame about the nearby building work but not hotel s fault Dinner staff very friendly and fun but not obtrusive 
73343,Malmaison London, Currently a bit of construction does make it a little less aesthetically pleasing but we didn t have any troubles with noise despite our room facing the construction zone , Great location in a quiet part of London that did not have a ton of tourists We found it to be very accessible to the Barbican underground station although that station does not have elevator access We were very pleased with our stay 
73344,Malmaison London, Nothing comes to mind , Staff extremely helpful I sent an email to customers service to praise after my return After a mix up with no booking for my room through booking com Alex on reception extremely helpful We had a lovely meal My son and his family also stayed with a 9 month old baby staff could not help enough I m just sorry my other son had to stay somewhere else due to the mix up as we were looking forward to a family weekend We were also attended a family wedding Thanks to all the staff 
73345,Malmaison London, A minor crib You had to register for the wifi it would have been better if it just worked , Creative and interesting decor in the room Fancy waterfall shower Comfy bed Espresso machine tea coffee minibar Staff very helpful efficient and friendly Great location

73347,Malmaison London, Shower took long time to heat up and not particularly good flow Telephones didn t work between rooms Toilets in basement not cleaned after Sat night Still grubby sun morning Breakfast service really slow inefficient and sausage not cooked through , Comfy bed and room good temperature
73348,Malmaison London, There were construction works near the hotel that closed the whole area As they will finish this place might becomea really nice area to stay , Very polite helpful and friendly staff Comfortable bed 
73349,Malmaison London, sadly due to building work directly opposite area is obscured by a building site workmen deliverys high level of early morning noise i have no doubt it will be beautiful when it is complete but did spoil our visit, staff facilities service all to a high standard could not fault sevice
73350,Malmaison London, Style over function in rooms very poor lighting so much so that you cannot read or put makeup on easily The restaurant was a big disappointment Limited menu little for veggies and we had to complain about the food that came The clue was being given a steak knife with which to a flatbread , The location is great if you need The City
73351,Malmaison London, The hotel was wonderful the staff not so Reception staff were not very helpful or friendly Bar staff poured double shots when we requested single then tried to charge us for the doubles Would expect better service from all staff for the money we paid , The shower was wonderful and the bedroom cosy Reception and bar areas were smart and modern 
73352,Malmaison London, Would have liked fresh milk for tea and coffee in room instead of long life and only 2 small milks given and very few sugars these were not topped up when room was cleaned during a weekend stay so had to ask and was given more then , Loved the modern deco Large bed Bedding Shower Room was just fab
73353,Malmaison London,No Negative, Maitre D in the restaurant Stefano absolutely excellent It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel left brownies in our room as a little treat Would definitely recommend this hotel 
73354,Malmaison London, Would have liked a bath not many hotels seem to do them now The shower required some figuring out but I got there Was clean but you could see where bits had been easily missed and I m only being picky because it is an otherwise very nice hotel , The location is excellent with loads of places to eat for tastes and budgets Convenient for Barbican or Farringdon stations Excellent building and a quiet oasis in the city 
73355,Malmaison London, Only one set of towels in room no tea or kettle just coffee machine in room had to wait 15 mins for a pot of tea at breakfast no tea spoon with boiled eggs seems petty to charge 2 extra for a cooked breakfast when paying 320 for room, Location brilliant room comfortable
73356,Malmaison London, Noise from 8am due to building work outside which we had not been pre warned about Failure to remove dirty plates from our room from the previous night Wanted room service No answer Hardly replenished any tea coffee toiletries next day had 2 night stay , Room size and decor was amazing
73357,Malmaison London, Requested earlier check in but no note was left on the booking so had to wait 1 5hrs in the lobby , Didn t require breakfast in this occasion but the smell from the restaurant was enticing Close to Barbican Tube
73358,Malmaison London, No complaints , The added effort the staff went to to ensure we had a lovely stay for our 1st wedding anniversary and my wife s birthday Two plates were in our room when we arrived One with Happy Birthday written in chocolate on the plate and the other with Happy Anniversary written on the other along with two very nice pieces of chocolate cake Tastefully presented and was a lovely gesture surprise Thank you 
73359,Malmaison London, Room got very hot and stuffy uncomfortable to sleep and staff at reception fobbed us off when advised following morning at checkout saying when temperature set low can cause the ac to turn off , Location and value
73360,Malmaison London, Check in was slightly strange as it took a long time to actually get the room key even though it was late afternoon early evening the reception staff gave the impression there was a problem but didn t provide any reassurance during the process ,No Positive
73361,Malmaison London,No Negative, We were staying on our wedding night and there were rose petals on the bed and a bottle of champagne on ice for us nice extra touches We checked in the day before and left luggage which made the arrival that much easier on the day All the staff were lovely and the room was very nice Shame we weren t staying longer 
73362,Malmaison London, Liked everything, The Staff were so friendly and helpful Room was superb Bed so large you could get lost in it Well stocked fridge Big TV 2 mins walk from Barbican Underground station Brilliant 
73363,Malmaison London, can not think about anything, bed super comfortable very quiet room great amenities location is excellent to explore the city great spot for foodies and light nightlife
73364,Malmaison London, Tried eating at the restaurant at half 5 ish but wasn t open yet tried having drinks in restaurant at about 11 30 was closed for staff meeting However other bar was open still so no problem, Bed was extremely comfy room was amazing Great location
73365,Malmaison London, The decor is odd the room service was delivered cold incorrect the room was dark the bathroom had an unpleasant odour the staff were disinterested Having stayed there numerous times over 10 years this was really disappointing, Great location
73366,Malmaison London, The position is currently impaired by the crossrail station being built next door and the consequent noise and dust dirt Not mentioned when booking ,No Positive
73367,Malmaison London, Breakfast not included and very expensive as was the mini bar and snacks 2 95 for a small pack of popcorn which costs 1 up the road in Tesco Shower temp set too low barely warm , Lovely hotel very friendly and helpful staff hotel is in a good location for what we wanted however building works going on outside Room at the back was lovely and quiet Room very comfortable huge TV and lots of nice toiletries Nice little extras such a books and plenty of wine if you want it Excellent staff which was the most enjoyable thing as you rarely get this these days Will definitely visit again 
73368,Malmaison London, The noise from outside was annoying All the building work should have been mentioned before the stay , The facilities and the cooked breakfast was lovely I also appreciated the Birthday cake 
73369,Malmaison London, Staff not very helpful or attentive our room keys didn t work each day after returning back to the hotel bathroom eminities were not replaced unless we requested it there was a lack of communication between staff members and requests had to be followed up Nothing big in the list but each problem was annoying and they added up by the end of the 4 night stay, Location room decor
73370,Malmaison London, The room was extremely warm almost unbearable at times We were provided with a small fan but it didn t cool the room as the air con would have , Good location very helpful staff high standards of cleanliness and good sized bed and room 
73371,Malmaison London, Being woken up at 2am by wedding party and then at 8am next morning by construction work Hotel should warn you about construction work before you book and wedding guests should be on lower floors so only disturb their party , Funky Mal interior
73372,Malmaison London, The room was small which is fair enough but the bathroom has a misted glass door on which is next to the bed and the toilet is just next to the door so about 3ft from the bed which makes going to the loo embarrassing if you are a new couple Also the poached eggs were cooked in that much vinegar that they lost their egg taste and tasted of vinegar Note to chef you don t need a gallon to bind them , The staff were really welcoming and lovely The room was small but we knew this anyway and it was clean and had everything you need The breakfast was great apart from the poached eggs Explained in the didn t like part 
73373,Malmaison London, Breakfast is overpriced We rated cleanliness so low due to the fact that just upon arrival we went to the bar which is also the restaurant for some cocktails and there was a mouse running all over the place The staff apologised and said that they would deal with it and we did not see it for breakfast However that is not according to the standards of a four star boutique hotel , Excellent location Friendly staff Nice comfortable and clean rooms 
73374,Malmaison London, There are building works outside but this didn t interfere with our stay in any way , The room was stylish and practical Staff were friendly and helpful Breakfast was delicious Cocktails were great and around 10 each Beautiful and comfy lounge We couldn t have asked for more I would highly recommend this hotel 
73375,Malmaison London,No Negative, We enjoyed our time here so much Very clean and modern room beautifully decorated comfortable huge bed Luxury hotel and when we booked 6 months earlier it was pretty cheap too With darkening curtains you could get the room very dark so it was very pleasant to sleep No noise Air conditioning worked really well which was a blessing cause it was 30 degrees outside Staff was very friendly and helpful they held our packbags the whole day when we checked out Location is good only 5 minute walk to the metro station 45 min walk to most of the turist attractions if you prefer walking like we did Warmly recommend this hotel for everyone Nothing bad to say 
73376,Malmaison London, There were works going on outside we weren t troubled by any noise but the view was ruined , The bed in our standard room was huge and very comfortable The staff were lovely especially the bartender The location was excellent it was easy to get around and we found lots of great places to eat and drink 
73377,Malmaison London, The shower thermostat was stuck so 1 of us ended up having a cold shower until maintenance fixed it , Breakfast and bubbles deal was very good value Great night s sleep in a comfy bed 
73378,Malmaison London,No Negative, Location was very good near to bars restaurants in Farringdon Easy walk to Kings Cross St Pauls Room was very comfortable well designed staff very pleasant Would happily stay again 
73379,Malmaison London, Nothing, Exactly what I was looking for in London a super comfortable hotel in s good location for what I wanted I got an excellent deal last minute on a Sunday and an upgrade to a club room The staff were great 
73380,Malmaison London, The room had a strange smell like cat urine We opened the window bit didn t seem to go it was wet on an area of the carpet that was foul smelling This would put me off staying again ,No Positive
73381,Malmaison London, Its a shame about the building work going on opposite the hotel despite this the inside of the hotel is just perfect, The hotel was really nice and the staff very friendly where nothing was too much trouble 
73382,Malmaison London,No Negative, Staff took great care of us and accommodated us to a top floor extra quiet room They arranged for a taxi to Heathrow made the beginning of a long journey home easy 
73383,Malmaison London, The room was a little hot upgraded air conditioning would be a bonus , The staff arranged for our room to be at the back of the hotel as there are major construction works on the building outside Beautiful room lovely view of a stunning building the shower was great and the bed so comfy It was my birthday and our wedding anniversary and a beautiful cake and little bottle of Veuve was in our room on arrival a really lovely and thoughtful surprise Thank you very much We always stay at the Malmaison Farringdon when we visit London as the hotel never disappoints 
73384,Malmaison London, Bathroom no exhaust and water spreads from shower to floor too easily, the vibe great feel location is good even better once the work going on around re cross rail etc is complete
73385,Malmaison London, Sounds stupid but the toilet roll holder is totally in the wrong place Also be careful about your bill at the end of your stay we got charged for a breakfast we never had on our second day Didn t think breakfast was worth the money was quite disappointed with it for 17 each Thought they might have done something a little special for my daughter when I told them our stay was for her birthday but nothing materialised disappointed for her as would have made it extra special, The hotel was absolutely wonderful and clerkenwell is a great area with a mix of branded shops restuarants and indepedent restuarants boutiques Staff were wonderful
73386,Malmaison London, The outside of the hotel was a building site which we were not informed about very embarrassing as it was booked for a special occasion Also I was under the impression I had booked bed and breakfast which we found out was not included on arrival the lady at the desk told us she would enquire and did not get back to us , Room was beautiful
73387,Malmaison London, Quite a bit of construction work in Charterhouse Square, Excellent service Comfortable rooms Good location Was a surprise weekend for my partner and reception staff helped keep it that way First class
73388,Malmaison London, Double bed The room was big enough to fit a king or queen bed yet only a double , Great quiet location Clean and tidy Modern Good bar Good food Great staff Handy on street parking
73389,Malmaison London, We didn t have any hot water in the shower our first morning the staff fixed the problem while we were out and changed the key access so we could not get back in our room when we returned expected us to wait on quite a long que behind other checking in to get our key fixed until we complained only fixed one of the keys air conditioner wasn t working and staff had to be called again problem was resolved,No Positive
73390,Malmaison London,No Negative, 1st night the bathroom fan would not turn off bad but the staff sorted the problem immediately the next day when I complained very good indeed The bed was comfortable and the room well equipped and very quiet for central London after the fan went off 
73391,Malmaison London,No Negative, Room modern and very comfortable Staff were excellent Friendly and really helpful hotel in great location just a few minutes walk to the tube station 
73392,Malmaison London, Breakfast not included stain on pillow case was off putting shampoo but no shower gel, Trendy decor parking outside albeit a bit expensive nice vibe
73393,Malmaison London, The front desk was inadequately staffed just one girl on duty despite there being a queue for check in Although bedrooms were well lit corridors are dark to a point of dingy, I love this location in real London its not far away from touristic zones yet is delightfully authentic with Smithfield Market on the doorstep and The City and Islington within walking distance There are local bars and restaurants to choose from and taking breakfast at one of the cafes used by the meat market workers is so much more enjoyable and half the price than eating in the hotel The hotel is stylish and accommodation is very comfortable with good space in both the bedroom and bathroom It also resists the temptation of some Malmaison s to over furnish the room and cover all surfaces with food and drink like a market stall A very good quality of stay 
73394,Malmaison London, Door Keycard mechanism broke at 02 30 and switched the lights on and off like a disco Unable to fix or provide an alternative room the hotel suggested I remove the card which meant I had no light in the room at all I finally got back to sleep at 04 00 The night porter couldn t find a torch and suggested I wait until the sun rose to navigate the pitch black room The Shower was the worst I have experienced in this country in years what s all that about At least I had a full refund ,No Positive
73395,Malmaison London, Too dark around mirror for doing my make up but that s a personal thing very very expensive in the restaurant and bar especially for the quality of food and drink the fillet steak was nice and that was it I appreciate London is more expensive and I don t mind paying that extra if it is outstanding and it wasn t , Comfy bed nice room very clean
73396,Malmaison London, I had the unfortunate experience of burning my hand as the hot water that came straight out the tap was scolding we reported it to reception who said they would get it looked at but no accident form filled in Our room was at the front of the hotel and on both nights we were kept awake by noise from nearby bars Shower was a nightmare and flooded the entire floor every time we used it , Hotel 5 minutes walk from barbican tube station so in a great location Room were modern and bed was very comfortable 
73397,Malmaison London, I didn t like the fact that I could only stay for one night next time I want to stay for longer , The staff couldn t do enough for us from the receptionists to the wonderful bar manager Obi excellent service happy to have a chat and made our stay memorable My husband had managed to break a cufflink and they also went out of their way to find a solution for him Thank you to everyone at Malmaison 
73398,Malmaison London, There was absolutely no airconditioning functioning in our room despite the description It was like a sauna They checked it and said it was working but it was not , The bar had awesome atmosphere
73399,Malmaison London, I don t know what a mature couple is but we are in our late 30s There was non stop loud pumping music in the lobby which we found annoying It s probably an occupational hazard for the receptionists noise pollution The penny pinching was a turn off since it s not a budget hotel For example they asked us to pay when we wanted a 30 minute late check out I think it would be much better for their reputation to say that the room was not available They also marked their shampoo as the best shampoo you re ever going to steal humor I don t get I found it cheap , The hotel was comfortable enough room was nice Location is excellent 
73400,Malmaison London, Was promised a queen bed Instead got 2 VERY uncomfortable singles Torn sheets dirty toilet rim mould in shower I booked via booking com at 330 per night A colleague of mine booked a second room on the same day as I booked he booked over the phone at 189 INCLUDING BREAKFAST , Location
73401,Malmaison London, Restaurant was lovely but overpriced Meals did not come with veg a basic steak with mash and 2 rounds of drinks cost 196 Australian Happy to pay good money for great food but it was underwhelming , Fabulous room beautiful hotel very upmarket and spacious Staff were friendly and helpful Plenty of places to eat nearby Close to public transport 
73402,Malmaison London, In a room close to the lift and the lift corridor noise in the morning was louder than I would have liked Could have an internal door within the room to create a sound barrier between the beds and the main door , The receptionists were very friendly helpful and proactive The food in the restaurant at dinner and at breakfast was of a very good quality 
73403,Malmaison London, There were some marks on the carpet which greeted you as you went in which don t look good However the rest of the room was lovely , Comfortable room well equipped loads of USB charging points A bathroom that you could actually move around in quite a feature for some London hotels 
73404,Malmaison London,No Negative, Nice quiet location away from the bustle of the city but easy to get around as located next to a central underground station Clean and presented to a high standard 
73405,Malmaison London, our room wasn t quite as meticulously prepared as I think it should have been , All the staff we encountered were wonderful and the hotel manager female was very impressive There were lots of nice touches I thought 
73406,Malmaison London, That everything had to be paid for separately instead of all at once and at one time , There was one particular bar man whom was very good at making cocktails and made us feal very welcome and liked to come over for a chat very good sense of humour All food and drinks were amazing 
73407,Malmaison London, The cost of the cooked breakfast should have been included in the cost of the room rather than having to pay a 2 per person surcharge , That shower Probably the best shower I ve ever had The decor of the room was very cool the bed was comfy and the breakfast was top notch 
73408,Malmaison London, although close to a tube not the most convenient location for sightseeing , very nice staff rooms are nice and spacious and comfortable located right around the corner of Barbican station in a quiet location would definately stay again 
73409,Malmaison London, Poor service from the barman prior to dinner had to fetch our cocktails Music was very loud in the bar could not have a nomal conversation had to shout The breakfast order for the room did not arrive had to call downstairs The location would have suited us if it was more central, The hotel was kovely staff were brilliant and the room comfortable Food was good and could not fault the hotel
73410,Malmaison London, The interior decor was bizarre and the room felt very ordinary to be honest as previously Malmaison hotels have always felt a bit special, Great location
73411,Malmaison London, I was woken up fairly early by the bin men and construction works outside however this is not the fault of the hotel I found the room a little hot and couldn t open the window much more than a crack , The room was very well decorated and very comfortable Small enough to be cosy but large enough to have space for all items we brought with us The staff were very helpful and friendly Asked for a message in the room as it was my girlfriends birthday and they had left a cake and a birthday card on arrival nice touch Really good location only a five minute walk to Barbican or Farringdon station which both happened to have engineering works when I stayed Still only a ten minute walk from Chancery Lane station though 
73412,Malmaison London, Location is good but the Barbican station was closed for the weekend while we were guests and it was a 25 minute walk to the next underground station Bed sheets had hair on them that were not ours which was troubling to start with The room we stayed in could do with a makeover , Big room with big screen t v 
73413,Malmaison London,No Negative, Location was great loved the area Hotel was very nice and got if for a great price as booked months in advance so reall good vfm Did not have breakfast included so can t comment Bed was dead Comfey Shower n bathroom was lush 
73414,Malmaison London,No Negative, The hotel upgraded us to a suite as it was our honeymoon and even had strawberry chocolates champagne and a handwritten card to welcome us What a lovely gesture The room was very tastefully designed modern and clean Very very comfortable we love it 
73415,Malmaison London, I think it is rather expensive for one night Service at breakfast wasn t great my partner has eaten his whole breakfast before mine was brought out and we had to ask twice about where mine was , The room was really lovely and the location 
73416,Malmaison London, Bar very pleasant but pricey Surprised to pay service charges on bar bill , Good value comfortable and smart Waiting staff very very friendly and helpful girl on reception a bit vague about public parking To be fair there is hotel parking at 30 a day 
73417,Malmaison London, Had to change first room allocated but this was done very professionally and with no fuss The key cards kept locking us out and had to go to reception every day to get them reset , The location was great easy access to tubes and walking distance to many attractions Room was comfortable although too hot but most hotel rooms are too warm Room had everything we needed mini bar tea making facilities plenty of wardrobe space etc Shower was good with plenty of hot water and good pressure I think what makes this hotel great is the very friendly helpful staff Obi in the bar was fantastic makes a mean Martini Espresso and has a great sense of humour The breakfast team were also very friendly and seemed genuinely interested in how our day was and what we had planned The Reception manager was a great help and swapped our room with no problem or fuss she was also very friendly and helpful All the staff we came into contact with were great and a credit to the hotel 
73418,Malmaison London, The area around the hotel included major construction site meat market with blood covered workers frequenting cafes in the evening and drunken revellers spilling out of numerous bars nearby from 6pm to 9am on weekends , Staff were professional and courteous
73419,Malmaison London, Charging for bottled water and at 2 for 330ml approx Weak rain forest shower Over heavy duvet, Quite and relaxed in interesting location for off the major tourist trail places to visit Expectation for us to take home bathroom products Bedroom decor Staff helpfulness
73420,Malmaison London, The breakfast service was a little casual , We were accidentally given the key to another guest s room but the situation was instantly resolved to our complete satisfaction Breakfast was fantastic gluten free bread was available very tasty 
73421,Malmaison London, Only a small thing but would have been nice to have had complimentary bottled water provided, Relaxed reception and bar area with friendly and welcoming staff Special thank you to Nicki for exceptional service throughout our stay Great shower and bathroom facilities and large screen television Overall a comfy good value for money London hotel
73422,Malmaison London, The room was quite dirty the loo rim was dark and hasn t been washed for a while there were foot print on the wall and the TV remote control hasn t been clean for a while ,No Positive
73423,Malmaison London, Fire alarm going of twice early in the morning Shower tray looked good but caused the bathroom to flood, Good hotel good location decent space in the room
73424,Malmaison London, There was nothing that we didn t like , Malmaison was spotlessly clean stylish and spacious The staff were friendly and helpful The facilities were excellent Whilst only a couple of minutes walk from Barbican tube station the hotel was in a quiet location 
73425,Malmaison London, Overal we felt that the pricing was excessive given the room size and quality of the breakfast , For our visit to London the proximity to St Bartholomews Hospital was ideal 
73426,Malmaison London, Expensive parking , The hotel was absolutely lovely Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom exceptional The location was brilliant and we couldn t have asked for better 
73427,Malmaison London,No Negative, Stayed here on our wedding night before flying out on honeymoon It was a brief stay but really nice place and location and they gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and straw berries Very nice touch 
73428,Malmaison London, Cigarette pack in cup Tap kept falling off Couldn t check in until 3pm, Very comfortable bed Nice freebies shampoo and shower gel Trendy decor Light up wardrobes Spacious room plus dressing coffee making area 
73429,Malmaison London, The cleaning staff were very quick to do their job the first morning we woke up we thought we heard someone knock the door at 8am and she kept knocking and walked straight in as doing so Honestly not giving you enough time to put your clothes on and clearly didn t hear us shout not to come in quite embarrassing for my husband and myself Was also quite suprised the hotel supplied the rooms with goose feathered pillows although many people would find this a luxury I suffer from allergies and asthmatic in which I react to if come into contact with It s quite common with goose or duck feathers it s not something I thought I would need to mention as most hotels to date will just supply hypo allergenic pillow and duvets to cover all types of allergies The hotel was kind enough to switch the duvet for me after I realised but by then it was to late I had reacted and I was uncomfortable the rest of the stay , The seductive and trendy feel to the hotel was very on point but still made the rooms and facilities comforting Fantastic 24 hour service and great location next to the bus tube services literally a 5 minute walk if that Hotel had a stylish restaurant but also surrounded by trendy bars and restaurants if wanted to eat out 
73430,Malmaison London, Bathroom was clean but there could have been a bit more attention to detail In room coffee facilities could have been better, The location of the room for London Theatres and the staff were very friendly and helpful
73431,Malmaison London, Breakfast on Sunday morning starts so late that we had to leave without having any Too far to most restaurants and pubs although there are a few close by , Wonderful staff very helpful and kind Our upgraded room looking into back side was so nice and quiet that we had some restful nights 
73432,Malmaison London, Bed was up against the wall and could only get in from one side Insufficient milk for drinks in the room Unable to get food from the bar when we got back after a gig If there s room service why not food in the bar Shame about the roadworks , The staff were very welcoming The room and the bed were comfortable The shower was awesome Very quiet room Lovely breakfast 
73433,Malmaison London, No instructions with the shower 3 taps for it couldn t work out which did which and hence flooded bathroom twice Only 3 tiny sachets of milk had been left with our kettle so had to ring reception for more The twin beds had dips in the middle so obviously well used For a hotel of this price I felt it was not up to the standard it pretended to be , The staff were extremely friendly and helpful
73434,Malmaison London, Fire alarm going off on two separate occasions on Saturday morning the 1st at 6am Better air conditioning was difficult to get the room a nice warm temperature , The bed was really comfortable Large tv in room with sky sports channels food was great in the restaurant
73435,Malmaison London, The music in the bar restaurant area is way too loud even just for a beer and I don t think I could eat in the restaurant for this reason , Extremely pleasant staff and a most comfortable spacious and quiet room Excellent shower A real welcome feeling at check in 
73436,Malmaison London, Dinner was very late the night before Breakfast was ok Chipped tea pot and broken coffee pot Bar staff upstairs were excellent though As there was work being done the view from the bedroom window was of a run down building , Room and bar staff

73439,Malmaison London, We went for a quiet few days away so it would have been good to know the building 10 yards in front was a building site while it is being redeveloped and the Jack hammers starting at 8 am was an extra bonus , Fantastic hotel the room was stunning as were the bar and restaurant in a excellent location

73447,Malmaison London, The staff were very friendly and offered all services of the hotel and made me feel very welcome However after going to the room I was initially booked in to I found two occupants already in there I obviously went back to reception and made the staff aware and they offered their apologies and sent me to another room The room itself was nice with well enough space for a single occupant as I was when I visited with a large comfortable bed and big television The floor however had quite a few hairs and bits of dust I only noticed because I was barefoot and the base of the shower had a VERY noticeable amount of limescale around the brim In the hotels defence this may have been because they weren t expecting anyone to be occupying the room that day Still I wasn t exactly pleased with the quality A small thing I noticed was there were two items missing from the minibar this was actually a little disappointing as I felt I wasn t offered everything available from the hotel The final cherry on top of my disappointment was the construction taking place right outside the building Obviously it is beyond the hotels control but still I had gone there to relax and was unable to without turning the volume up on my tv quite loud I am sure the hotel would have provided me with another room if I had asked but to be honest I just wanted to relax at that point after travelling all day , I didn t reserve enough time for myself to experience all the facilities of the hotel only room service However the room service I did order was excellent and very tasty as was prompt timing

73466,Malmaison London, first room we were offered was morelike a single fortunately manager agreed to move us staff in restaurant did not have very good english food orders were incorrect as result breakfast was expensive for what was available decor was shabby not usual Mal standard, room was very comfortable
73467,Malmaison London, I would much prefer to have a shower bath I really missed not being able to relax in a bath after a hard days work The food in the restaurant was disappointing , warm and cosy and felt safe as a solo traveller I liked having a restaurant on site The room was quiet

73471,Malmaison London, I ve stayed here a few times in the past and generally liked it However the recently renovated decor of the rooms is somewhat akin to a teenage boy s bedroom or bachelor flat And terribly dark Definitely not a romantic vibe at all all a bit too urban and try hard Awoke to building works right outside our window not such a great night s sleep , Cocktails and food excellent and service solid Easy location just around the corner from Barbican tube 
73472,Malmaison London, leaving , The staff were very friendly and happy which is lovely and makes you feel welcome The room was fabulous very comfortable beautifully finished Plus it was my daughter s 18th birthday and they had written a card and left a personal message on a plate with cake I love that touch Very convenient position

73477,Malmaison London, Having to come home , Everything The room the service the staff the food the quiet but central location It s all brilliant If your looking for a bit of luxury at a decent price this is the place to stay I stayed in room 107 which is classed as a standard room and to say it exceed all of my expectations is an understatement From the waterfall shower that s gigger than my bath to double bed that is blatantly bigger than a double to the breakfast being brought straight to your door It s all brilliant They knew we were there for our anniversary so on arrival had a cake and card waiting for us The food is amazing and the staff are so so lovely We are already booking to go back in August I would recommend to anybody 
73478,Malmaison London, A little overpriced especially breakfast Would be reasonable if breakfast had been included in room , Very nice setting Only a couple of minutes walk from the tube station 
73479,Malmaison London, Not applicable, Because I got a great deal for the accommodation I was delighted with the room we were given Very comfortable loved the bathroom 
73480,Malmaison London, Shower head loose the pillows covers had holes in which my wife pointed out bathroom door wouldn t close properly could of down with a touch of paint above air con unit little things which count for a lot when its classed as a very modern and uperclass hotel , Nice a peaceful very chilled and not like an oven like a lot of places 
73481,Malmaison London, Breakfast included would ve made our stay and the shower could ve been hotter , We had a fairly spacious room enough for a few days and a lovely sized very comfy bed Amazing nights sleep Lovely showeroom also with a waterfall type shower head The hotel was situated in a lovely quiet area with a tube station a 2 minute walk away 
73482,Malmaison London, Having to leave , Fantastic staff on reception nothing was too much trouble The room was spotlessly clean and very well furnished It was a pleasure to stay in and felt luxurious Extremely comfortable bed and slept right through which is a first for me in London as outside noise usually wakes me around 5 am Very impressive and will definitely return

73485,Malmaison London,No Negative, The staff are so friendly and helpful The food drinks rooms bar and restaurant are fabulous We will definately be staying here again Would recommend booking a full English on arrival and receive a free cocktail Really close to Barbican tube station so very easy to get to and from 
73486,Malmaison London, The shower however was terrible The water refused to get hot and the water pressure was almost non existent The staff on the whole were hilariously stuck up Whoever the guy on reception was he was so awful that my wife had to step away When you pay a fair amount of money to stay somewhere you expect the service to be great and on this count Malmaison have a lot to learn , The room was lovely A little quirky but we liked that It was clean well presented The breakfast was varied and well presented although the toast was stone cold 
73487,Malmaison London, The lighting and work facilities in the room are very poor small desk is too small to meaningfully work the chair is too casual and the lighting is not bright or focused enough, The hotel is very quiet overnight which is great 
73488,Malmaison London,No Negative, A Brilliant hotel luxurious with rooms filled with little extras Staff very helpful and very professional A superb place to stay in a great location to all the sights 
73489,Malmaison London, The only thing that made me uneasy about the location was the poor amount of street lighting out front As a solo female traveler that was a little disconcerting on my return from the theatre late at night , The staff were lovely and helpful I arrived early 1pm and my room was all ready and waiting for me which was most appreciated The room itself was ideal clean and had everything that I needed The location was perfect for my visit too being less than 10 minute walk to the Barbican Centre 
73490,Malmaison London, The mini bar stock was dusty and I would have liked the option of a bath , The location is lovely and easy access to the Barbican and tube station also the square has parking The staff were quick friendly and helpful Good price 
73491,Malmaison London, Style over function Very attractive but only large mirror was in the bathroom so no help with drying hair All subdued lighting with no option of bright light for reading or work Could not reach bedside table from bed Large bathroom but nowhere to keep towels nearby whilst in the shower to reach when needed Shower was like rinsing hair in a rain shower no power to it All looks lovely but designers should try staying in it for 24 hours and spot the drawbacks , Staff were very friendly and location was just where we wanted to be Very comfortable bed and bedding 
73492,Malmaison London,No Negative, Absolutely loved staying here from start to finish Much nicer than we originally expected mainly due to me not doing my research and just booking the cheapest hotel I could find on here turns out we had an AMAZING deal If you have time and have a chance please try their brasserie downstairs the food is absolutely to die for We were lucky enough to be able to have a Sunday brunch in the run up to Christmas so the value for money was second to none Starting with soup then a salad tapas buffet followed by a choice of mains we went for the prime rib of black angus beef expected a small portion received a big plate with a great portion of top quality food and followed by a choice of desserts All that for 25pp you simply cannot do better than that 
73493,Malmaison London, Overpriced bar unattended so had to keep looking for someone to serve us Breakfast over priced for what it was and slow service, Evening meal was good and great service

73495,Malmaison London, I asked about a twin room as if was friends sharing they wanted another 40 to upgrade , Location was great Hotel modern but cosy Easy for tube
73496,Malmaison London, The decor it only suits younger people Bathroom is not user friendly you have to stand in front of the toilet seat to use the mirror too far away to look at your face clearly also for a double room only providing one set of towels No shower gel have to use the hand soap for shower , It s near the tube station very easy to access 
73497,Malmaison London, Only thing that was a tiny thing was there is road works going on outside the hotel which meant taxis was dropping us like 5 10 minutes walk from the hotel because roads are blocked Not hotels fault but only little issue Minor though still book the hotel it s amazing and if you getting tubes then is fine , Loved how the staff cater for anything you need Very friendly and polite staff and even looked after our luggage after we check out while continuing with Xmas shopping Rooms are cosy and bed was cosy to giving me a good night sleep Tube station was close which is a bonus when carrying bags and bags of shopping plus luggage 
73498,Malmaison London, Due to illness we had to extend the room by 3 hours being the maximum time to extend and had to pay a fee of 45 If we had taken the room until 6pm I would have expected a fee but for an additional 3 hours and being a returning customer I would have thought the hotel would have waived the fee considering I was ill in the room and unable to depart by midday , Great room
73499,Malmaison London, Rude staff on reception the lack of information given prior to booking letting us know parking is 30 00 per night After many complaints to reception staff and them not dealing with this in the right way the assistant manager then sorted the issue for us Breakfast buffet wasn t to the standard expected , The room was to a very good standard 
73500,Malmaison London, I had difficulty locating the hotel on Google maps and no one locally knew of your existence I tried to telephone your central contact number and the staff did not know where Clerkenwell was suggesting Edinburgh Walking through a refuse bin area to gain access to the hotel was not very enticing , The staff were friendly cheerful and professional The room was very comfortable 
73501,Malmaison London, I didn t like the d cor at all and I didn t like the fact that I couldn t turn the reading light next to the bed on and off without getting out of bed Also no muesli for breakfast just horrible little packets and made up slimy granola which I don t like at all and no fresh bread just sliced brown toast , being close to the party I was attending and the quiet
73502,Malmaison London, Down side of the room was the bed It should never be 2 seperate mattresses Spent most of the night getting out of the grove It should be one mattress for maximum comfort , Amazimg stay lovely room
73503,Malmaison London, I would of liked some sugar or sweetener in the room to go with my morning coffee but i m sure if i had asked it would of been brought to the room , From the welcome at the reception to opening the room door was seamless the room was a good size modern and clean with a very comfortable bed

73506,Malmaison London, Two very minor things Sink would have been too shallow for an easy shave but luckily my Fiance had shaved before we arrived and we only stayed one night Crisps were open on our arrival and no replacement was possible because housekeeping was closed up We didn t need any but would the same have applied if we were missing a towel or similar , Staff were efficient and friendly Room was quiet and comfortable Amazing shower and toiletries and the most comfortable night s sleep I have ever had Bistro is open till quite late if you need it 
73507,Malmaison London, I liked the shower but didn t find it easy to work out the various functions on the taps I didn t like the suggestive marketing on the bathroom products and the laundry bag At odds with the elegance of the room But younger people might like it , The bedroom was beautiful Also fully equipped even an iron and an ironing board Loved the colour scheme and the butterflies on the head board 
73508,Malmaison London, Breakfast wasn t good value for money as we paid on arrival at reception for breakfast only to be told at the table in the morning that there was a extra charge for a cooked breakfast which seemed a bit of a con , Love this hotel gorgeous rooms great location well priced would definately stay again 
73509,Malmaison London,No Negative, Beautiful clean hotel Quick and efficient check in staff really polite and helpful even let me check in few hours earlier Room had everything we needed and the bed was the comfiest id ever slept in

73514,Malmaison London, Loud music in the bar and restaurant Had to resort to eating in my room Acceptable level for breakfast , Peaceful location in the midst of a very busy area Lovely room overlooking Charterhouse 
73515,Malmaison London, Room seemed to be planned by a man with men in mind No good lighting for putting on make up The only place was the mirror over the washbasin and you had to kneel on the loo seat cover to get close enough to see what you were doing hairdryer had to stretch for bathroom mirror , Very good location for the events I had to attend 
73516,Malmaison London, everything was amazing except the fact that there was a long pubic hair on the bedsheets Breakfast extortionately overpriced , The bed was really comfy and was great to have an ironing board inside the lovely light up wardrobes Bathroom was very stylish with nice toiletries 
73517,Malmaison London, Couldn t work out how to use shower not on the overhead setting The water pressure or temperature weren t great, Room was exactly as pictured on Booking com Would stay again

73524,Malmaison London,No Negative, My husband and I got married on the 10 October this year we chose the Malmaison Barbican hotel because it was a 5 minute drive to our wedding venue Even though the Malmaison is a chain the staff made us feel like part of their family from the moment we stepped foot into the hotel we were greeted with a glass of champagne and our bags taken straight to our room We found the staff to be very consensus at all times they went beyond their duty to make sure we had a good nights sleep before our special day Can t thank everyone enough x

73526,Malmaison London, Staff were disengaged unable to deal with issues The hotel seems poorly maintained causing problems with the smoke detector and air conditioning Staff responded with defensive argument instead of showing empathy for disturbed sleep Communication at the front desk was slow at times the staff couldn t understand English , This hotel is in a great location close to two underground station lots of cafes and eating options The room was well appointed and comfortable 
73527,Malmaison London, No Business Centre at the hotel but they would have assisted if you needed to print a page say a boarding pass from the internet , Staff were very friendly and provided good service Room was decent size for London and the shower was excellent and comfy bed Room had magazines and variety of interesting books as well Had an excellent deal for 16 pounds you purchased the night before for a cooked breakfast choice plus continental buffet breakfast plus a cocktail from the classic menu you could have at the bar at night Great hotel
