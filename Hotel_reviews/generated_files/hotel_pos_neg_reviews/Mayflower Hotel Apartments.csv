123383,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The ceiling fan was really loud and didn t look secure there was some dirt in the shower we had to clean out, The hotel is really close to transport and shops the view was nice
123384,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The facilities are quite dated and you could hear people moving through the walls in other rooms , Location is great on a nice street very near Earls Court tube station and good bars restaurants Breakfast is decent as well 
123385,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Didn t like the key holder i find it very heavy cumbersome to keep in the bag while touring the city Option was to leave it with the 24 hour reception which was ok , The location is perfect less than 2 mins walk to the underground Our room was very small but had everything we needed for a comfortable stay The toilet is modern clean and towels provided were of good quality very soft which i particularly liked Bed and pillows were comfy 
123386,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very very small The rooms are packed into a maze of tiny corridors No space in the dining room Chairs and elbows in your face Breakfast finished at 930 Food and drinks were immediately tidied away whilst we were still eating Bedroom was crammed with an oversized bed and little space to move around it , Location
123387,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We booked a room for two adults and two children thru Booking com The ages of the children was inadvertintly entered incorrectly while making the reservation The hotel refused to accommodate us because of that Booking com refused to help as well We were forced to pay for additional room and we had no choice since we couldn t cancel our original reservation Bad customer service both from the hotel and booking com The rooms were too small and barely would sleep two people Our room had a strong sewer type smell coming from the bathroom but luckily it was addressed promptly once we called in for service , Just the location
123388,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast was very simple and to be honest not my taste Would have expected a better breakfast for the amount of money I paid per night Very little choice and we didn t even bother on the second day with breakfast Room was small and staff not very welcoming The room was very dated and needs updating I do not class this hotel as a 4 star and is very expensive We were given the room at the lower level and we could hear the underground train which was constant The bed was so uncomfy The mattress was rock solid I could have got way better value for money Very disappointed and will not use this hotel again unless the price drops drastically No tea and coffee in the room just these little touches are missing as well I paid extra for the 4 poster bed room as it was my husbands birthday and thought this would be a nice touch don t waste your money ,No Positive
123389,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The shower basically in the toilet was an issue , Ramona at reception Excellent work ethic and willingness to assist with any issue Even changed our room 
123390,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I stayed with my parent but the room was quite small for two persons And the window was broken and unavailable to open So it will be better if I could get fresh air from window ,No Positive
123391,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very noisy trains and planes The staff were extremely noisy talking and laughing outside our window at 4am one night and in the early morning , Good bed and shower
123392,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The train noise but this can t be helped due to the amazing location, Loved how helpful and friendly all the staff were The hotel was perfect for our visit
123393,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Dinning room was very squashed and the breakfast could have had more variety , The location was excellent The size of the bedroom and bathroom was amazing 
123394,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bedroom was in the basement No light and ridiculously small To make matters worse the bed was super uncomfortable and made a lot of noise We checked in at 1 am then left by 5 am , Location was good right by earls court station
123395,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The noise at night made it impossible to sleep The one bedroom apartments are situated in quite a dodgy stretch of Warwick Road right next to it Our apartment had not been properly sound proofed so the traffic noise filtered directly into the apartment In fact it seemed to be amplified We tried everything closing the windows using noise cancelling apps and nothing worked There was also a regular thump from within the apartment when we used the air conditioning unit This unit was quite hard to adjust having one central control next to the door of the apartment some distance from the master bedroom We had a long flight the next day and were exhausted during our journey and even more so when we arrived We felt cheated because we wanted to stay in Kensington to rest before our journey and requested a quiet room In addition the location for the Mayflower Hotel on the map did not reflect the true location of the one bedroom apartments We have stayed in Kensington before and managed to get a quiet room which served our needs well So it is possible , The apartment was very close to a Tube station and was clean well fitted out and newly renovated 
123396,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was sort of like a really nice hostel There is no air conditioning and the free breakfast in the morning is awful , The room size is nice and the location is good 
123397,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, we chose single beds on booking com however they were not available the manager was not reachable on Saturday according to the welcome desk staff when i complained the next day the manager said that he can t control the content of a third party vendor i e booking com basically he disassociated himself from any promises that booking com makes on its site in terms of amenities of the hotel in general some of the staff were a little cold and reserved , good location close to the tube station
123398,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bed could have been a bit comfier but it was fine The tv often didn t work as the digital cable seemed to be jumbled Not a big deal , The staff was incredibly helpful I was thrilled to have my room ready when arrived tired after a long flight Was incredibly grateful for the room upgrade as I was staying for 6 nights The location connection to transport and proximity to the sites and restaurants all made this hotel a wonderful home away from home when travelling for work I would definitely come back 
123399,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, THE BED WAS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE THE PILLOWS NEEDED REPLACING THE ROOM WAS A SMALL DOUBLE BUT WOW WAS IT SMALL EVERY TIME YOU CAME OUT THE BEDROOM YOU HIT THE DOOR ON THE HOLDER FOR THE CASE THE KIND OF SMALL WHERE YOU SIT ON THE LOO AND YOUR IN DANGER OF HITTING YOUR HEAD ON THE SINK PARKING WAS 30 POUND FOR THE NIGHT ON SOMEONES DRIVE ABOUT 5 MINUTES AWAY NIGHT TIME HARD TO GET A GOOD SLEEP AS VERY NOISEY NEAR TRAIN STATION AND THERE WERE PLANES GOING OVER EVERY FEW MINUTES, THE BREAKFAST WAS REALLY NICE THE HOTEL WAS CLEAN THE BEDROOMS WINDOWS OPENED WIDE FOR AIR AND THERE WAS A ROTARY FAN IN THE ROOM LOCATION WAS REASONABLE AND THERE WERE LOTS OF PLACES TO EAT BUCKINHAM PALACE WAS 2 8 MILES AWAY A GOOD WALK IN THE EVENING
123400,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very very small room You get what you pay for not more , Close to public transport Ideal to from to Heathrow The continental breakfast was OK and included in room price 
123401,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room and bathroom were very small but then you don t stay there very long with all the great stuff on the doorstep , Great location Easy to get to from public transport Friendly staff Bed was comfortable which is the most important Great restaurants and breakfast places near 
123402,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No bar facility Couldn t even get ice I had prepaid but when I arrived at receptions and had to show my debit card which I had used to pay It was a new card as my previous card was out of date and destroyed They wouldn t accept my previous payment due to possible fraud I didn t understand their logic at all I had ID incl my passport also emails confirming my booking They wouldn t accept any of it I had to repay and they refunded me Couldn t believe it in this day and and age Also the lady who dealt with us was not particularly nice about the whole process Obviously we won t be back and I wouldn t recommend it to anyone We could hardly move in our room it was so tiny This is more B B standard Anne Belfast, It was clean
123403,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room size is ridiculous one could access the bed from 1 side only and the free side of the room had space for a suitcase So one had 2 options have the suitcase or pass through moving the suitcase away No A C just a ventilator 21 small TV radio with iPhone dock iPhone 4 however Fungus in the bathroom There was a chair in the room no idea what for as there was no space to sit on it I have stayed in many hotels in London even the more central have had bigger rooms The quiet side of the hotel was facing the train station so at night one could choose between the heat or loud noises from the trains I honestly cannot understand how this hotel can have a 4 rating No space to turn around in the room no AC no mini bar it would not have fitted anyways The pictures and other ratings are really deceiving , The Spanish girl at the front desk was very friendly and helpful
123404,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I had a single room on the top floor which was TINY And very hot but it was clean and well maintained My friends had a double room on the first floor they loved it , Very good location as we were going to a concert in Hyde Park Very clean and great breakfast Located in a quiet street with other top notch properties just around the corner from Earls a Court tube station Would book them again
123405,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, too small room almost like a larder or a small storage room But its price was crazy expensive for what you got , The only positive thing I can say about this hotel or at least about the single room I have was its location I have never seen such a small room and bathroom in my life before Now I understood how the 19th century painters and writers were feeling in Paris in the attic room
123406,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Possibly to have air conditioning in the rooms and the front breakfast room , We loved staying here It was our first time in London The rooms were spotless and the area was delightful as the tube was only just around the corner along with shops eateries and restaurants It was a great place to stay All the staff were extremely accommodating and the continental breakfast was fantastic 
123407,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Booked a room with two single beds as I was traveling with my elderly mother Once we saw our room it was a queen only they knew this but didn t mention it Went back to reception to ask they stated that it was a preference not a guarantee despite the booking confirmation stating it was two singles No refund available no rooms for us to change to I asked if they though they could have contacted us in the 5 days since we booked to inform us of the issue but apparently it s too difficult to do so via booking com a fact I know to be untrue Despite the bed issue the room smelt was on a busy noisy street and was poorly put together Terrible last night in London Never again , Coffee at breakfast was ok
123408,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Distance from main hotel was a bit of a pain going for breakfast and no sign on property letting you know it was the Mayflower, I was impressed with having a mobile phone for use whilst there Apartment was very comfy and well equiped
123409,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing I didn t really like Pleasant stay for the price I paid very hot in London at the moment so was glad there was a fan in the room , Really handy to buses and trains Nice restaurants in the area 
123410,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We had to climb 8 flights of stairs with the kids 80stairs We arrived on hottest day of summer However it was larger apartment than what we had paid for to be honest I had to work off all those croissants at breakfast , Croissants were to DIE for WIFI was strong Service was impeccable Porter was not at the door but reception was happy to help carry 20kg bag up 80 steps and then a pram with jet lagged sleeping 6 year old 
123411,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The rooms are unwelcoming the bathroom was at least clean and fairly modern The reception lulls you into a false sence of security and appears the the rest of the accommodation will be as tranquil It wasn t The breakfast continental choice was mediocre at best Tables very cramped and you almost feel your sitting on top of other guests ,No Positive
123412,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No aircon Room too small Very poor breakfast for an alleged 4 star hotel Would not use this hotel again , The staff were friendly The hotel was near to transport hubs 
123413,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, room is a little bit small but it is central London so it is understandable , very good location and the deal we got from booking com was really great 
123414,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Flooring and wooden bed frame that creaked and the dim energy saving lights in the bathroom which are so common in hotels these days Hey everyone they do make brighter energy saving light globes A simple cooked breakfast option included in the tariff and not extra would have been appreciated , The location just around the corner from Earl s Court Station was great Bought an Oyster card and caught the train everywhere even to Heathrow We were happy with the size of our room and the bathroom good to have a window that opened to let a cool breeze and fresh air inside Considering its closeness to a busy road the room was quiet even with the window opened We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor garden whilst killing a bit of time before leaving Comfortable pillows and good continental breakfast 
123415,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, When I first arrived a few staff was outside on the stairs in the sunshine maybe I interrupted the tanning The receptionist didn t even look me in the eye when we got to the desk it was like I was bothering her by checking in , The location of the Hotel Apartment was really good it was close to the tube and local amenities 
123416,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very small hall elevator and room, 3 minutes walk from tube station 2 minuts to a street full of various restaurants friendly staff good breakfast not too various but nice
123417,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The shower hot water went cold and hot at random intervals throghout ourstay Also the TV Signal was very poor , Much better than advertised or expected very comfortable and spacious
123418,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast finished at 9 30 bit too early for me Furnishings looked a bit aged and could do with updating , Ceiling fan in my room Liked the complementary shower gel 
123419,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Receptionist to begin with wasn t friendly I know he was new but still Bed was hard Apparently they offer a cooked breakfast if you pay but I wasn t offered to so this had the continental which was average , Room was large Clean Location easy to find Nice decor in room 
123420,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was in the basement There was a window with natural light so it s not as bad as it sounds but one never likes to stay in the basement , The hotel was great value for money and next to Earls Court tube station which made it possible to get a train very early the next morning to Heathrow Airport for an early flight 
123421,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room I stayed in made me jealous of Harry Potter s cupboard under the stairs at the Dursleys I know the booking stated it is a small double room but hey how small can a room get I would never call that a double even for one person it s below standards Me and my boyfriend literally couldn t turn around in the room and we re not fat or anything Not to mention the bathroom which is like the smallest bathroom I ve ever seen in my life I felt like I m on a boat trip staying in a cabin The hotel looks a lot better on pics than in reality The pics show only the nice rooms the one I stayed in didn t even come close One more thing breakfast Very very poor We ate croissants defrosted I presume with butter and jam for 4 days because there wasn t anything else to choose from Please work on it it s not such a big investment to offer a couple of things more e g more veggies selection of hams and cheeses eggs bacon more cereal better coffee tea etc , Staff was friendly the hotel is on a quiet quintessential English street The nearest tube station Earl s Court is literally round the corner which was very convenient Overall the greatest advantage of this hotel is its location 
123422,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I booked the luxury room and thought it has a small kitcen but they don t The rest is fine , Location Location and Location Only 2 mins to Tube Earl s court
123423,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The apartment was on basement level during the night I could sometimes people going on street and talking or rolling luggage Free breakfast was only cold food options bread cheese ham the warm options like eggs or porridge was additional 9 pounds , The place was quite nice near the Tube which made in really easy to travel around A lot of shops and cafe around also a great bonus 
123424,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room is not clean Fan in the room is never cleaned up Staff is rude and not helpful at all They need some training on their communication skills Especially the two in the evening shift on May 31 when we checked in Safe box cannot be opened even though I requested them doing something and they let me wait and wait and wait We checked June 3 They don t bother to fix it Room is noisy outside and inside Very bad Simply they don t offer much service , The only thing is their location near tube 
123425,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast selection was pretty limited yogurt cereals croissants and granola Would have liked more options , The hotel is so easy to get to it is right around the corner from Earl s Court tube station It takes less than a five minute walk between the two That makes it close to a huge selection of restaurants and pubs The decor is very modern and I liked that I could open my windows I loved the laundry service 
123426,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was maybe 10qm incl bathroom so super small one could barely turn around and super warm no AC Bfast is standard no extras and in the underground All in all ok for the price but will not go again, Quite a nice place traditional London hotel Fairly new bathroom all very clean 
123427,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Road and pedestrian noise coming through the windows and needed to use ear plugs to stay asleep a few more basic items to aid cooking would have been helpful i e condement saches salt pepper tin opener oven proof dish etc , The apartment did give the feel of home from home which was great There was plenty of space and the standard was good everything felt fresh and clean especially the kitchen and bathroom 
123428,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I was surprised it is rated a 4 star as no alcohol licence so the bar just has soft drinks No restaurant except for breakfast no room service Shampoo shower gel in the bathroom but no shower cap sanitary bag etc However the Main Street is less than two mins walk so everything available to buy but I d like to see the rooms about 25 a night cheaper than they are to reflect what is on offer , Lovely friendly staff I d go back on the strength of that alone The room was comfortable and quiet Only four tube stops from both Paddington and Victoria so easy from both Heathrow and Gatwick Breakfast was lovely Bars tube stop shops and restaurants within 2 5 mins walking distance and only a short tube ride to Leicester Square area 
123429,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very rude staff upon arrival Not greeted they just demanded payment card and ID We felt like we were not welcome when we walked in and it was as if she had to go out of her way just to deal with us Breakfast was poor bit can t moan too much seeing as it was free Rooms tiny but measurement are given in the description 4 poster bed made such a horrendous noise when we got on or off that it made it so we didnt dare move in fear of disturbing other guests With the fees they are charging I m sure they can afford to replace it as that nights sleep was very uncomfortable and disturbed due to it , Location
123430,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Poor air circulation inside the hotel but ceiling fan helped on warm nights , Good central location but quiet at night Close to many restaurants and the Earls Court Station Staff were friendly and helpful Room was lavishly decorated giving the room an oriental feel The room had everything we needed for our stay and the bed was comfortable 
123431,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room facilities were basic no bottled water tea only no coffee or bedside table for water Rear overlooked the tube so noisy if you sleep with an open window Breakfast was cleared at 9 30 sharp Tough if you appeared at 9 25 , Accommodating staff and an attractive cosy quiet room at the front 
123432,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The staff was not polite not flexible lost between computers angry a girl slow my name was even not spelled on the guest list was noted with one capital letter on the reception was usually nobody etc ,No Positive
123433,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was a nice size and clean with a very good modern bathroom but the mattress on the bed was very uncomfortable , Breakfast was grand standard cereal toast etc my room was on the ground floor so I thought it might be loud in the morning once breakfast started but that wasn t the case at all
123434,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was quite small and dark and the bed rather uncomfortable The layout also wasn t very user friendly For example there was no bedside table and you couldn t turn off the lights while lying in bed The week I stayed was extremely cold and the radiator in my room wasn t working so I had to have an electric heater which the staff was kind enough to provide running the entire night which isn t ideal , The hotel location was perfect for my purposes I was working close to Earl s Court and the hotel is just a few minutes from there which also makes it very convenient to get to from Heathrow Staff was friendly 
123435,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I just wish there was a lift after a long day of walking , Quiet facility The beds were comfy apartment was kept clean Washer but no dryer in our unit Hung the clothes to dry which worked just as well Warwick Road entrance to the tube right next door Continental breakfast is in the main part of the hotel about a 4 min walk 
123436,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room is a bit small and there s no shower door , Staff in general were extremely helpful Breakfast was good but it would be good to have some varieties Room was clean but a bit smaller than expected The location was excellent only 2 minute s walk to Earl Court subway station 
123437,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Lots of stairs up to top floor appartment no lift, Up grade to 3 bed appartment great breakfast lovelly appartments with everything you need 
123438,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, After lots of walking it would have been nice to have watched the TV from our bed but it could only be viewed from a small bench by the window, Good welcome from friendly helpful staff Tasty fresh breakfast but not enough ventilation in breaskfast room
123439,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I ask for a cot bed beforehand and it seems that it was lost in the process at least they managed to get one for us Even if we said that we were travelling with a baby and ask for a cot bed we got a really small room almost with no space for the bed , The rooms were comfy and recently renovated In general everything was in good condition and the breakfast was complete 
123440,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Besides butter there could be Flora for any one who doesn t like butter for instance Although it is a small hotel buffet breakfast could be helpful , The bed extra comfy
123441,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast is average and the breakfast room very crowded , The hotel is conveniently located with short travel times to Heathrow Airport and good subway connections to many places of interest in Central London Also the immediate vicinity of the hotel has many good restaurants The apartments this hotel offers are very spacious 
123442,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, The Croissants were indeed especially flaky While I got a deal this was excellent value for money better than in similar range hotels I have used in Earls Court 
123443,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Hard bed small room no side tables lighting in room very poor very had to see to put on make up bathroom very dark No ironing facilities in room Staff not particularly friendly except for the breakfast staff , Location and breakfast was ok
123444,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was far too small to have a four poster bed Shower was very weak Would never pay recommended price the price I paid 112 I wish I d gone to a holiday inn premier inn as it would have been better accommodation How this is 4 rated I don t know The breakfast was very average and you get kicked out at 9 30 even if you ve not finished Luckily we had much more important things theatre and great meal to do so hotel and room fortunately didn t ruin our day night , It s close to station 
123445,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The hotel is close to the tube That means it s super convenient but not totally quiet on a night It s hard to sleep past 5 30am when the trains are more regular The windows are not particularly soundproof The double room I was in consisted of two single beds pushed together which never makes for a deep sleep , The location is fabulous if you are looking for a place to lay your head There are a range of food chain options 100 yards away as well as Earl s Court station to get you into Central London The hotel was relatively modern but especially so in the reception area The bathroom was lovely a bit cramped but delighted to have a full sized bath in there 
123446,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Everything about our stay in the room was poor Nothing like the descriptions given and photos shown Dirty smelly and uncomfortable , They allowed free printing
123447,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast just OK no shelf in shower for shampoos but that is being hyper critical , Excellent stay great accommodation spacey clean comfortable
123448,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The walls of the hotel room is quite thin Every evening and night we could hear through the walls as well as the ceiling Also there was no shower curtain so the bathroom floor would always get wet , The staff was very friendly and helpful The breakfast was good The hotel is situated by a tube station as well as some good restaurants 
123449,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The most uncomfortable bed I ve ever slept in I may as well have sleep on the floor Pillows too were terrible The heating was constantly on even though it was warm outside I wouldn t stay again , Great location with friendly staff Easy for the tube and local restaurants 
123450,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast room in hotel very cramped and got Small tables Not a great choice for breakfast Apartment downstairs with no view, Large suite comfy bed great shower well equipped kitchen very close to tube station nice quiet street
123451,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I didn t like that we arrived late and the apartment wasn t in the main building we had to walk with a newborn on the streets Also I arrived with my own car and payed 30 for parking which was couple streets away from the main building which I found very odd to park in someone else s private parking area We agreed with the gentleman who escorted us to the parking are that we can leave next day the car at the car park while we visit the Embassy Next morning the receptionist was extremely rude telling us that we only payed from 2pm till next day 11am for parking and it was already 11 05 am so we are late and we have to pay additional 30 for parking if we want to leave the car there for few more hours Seriously What do you think how long is it takes to get out from the apartment and walk few streets with a newborn I had to move my car and park somewhere else for all day only for 17 I feel ripped off with the parking and for sure I won t stay again in this hotel because of the staff and their lack of communication Very disappointed , I like the apartment it was nicely cleaned and very quite location 
123452,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, they need to take the four poster bed out of the room It adds nothing and just takes up space its just a double bed with 4 wooden posts sticking up out the end and getting in the way , Location perfect to get around right next to earls court tube station and walking distance to Kensington park Alert hall
123453,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, You can hear EVERYTHING in the rooms next to you The walls a paper thin I knew the room was going to be small and it was tineh Thankfully I wasn t in the room very often The bathroom was compact as well , I enjoyed the complimentary breakfast Expect croissants coffee tea and juice some cereals and toast 
123454,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, The apartment we stayed in was great Lovely fresh large apartment with our own balcony The location was a couple of minutes walk from Earls Court tube station so was easy to get around Breakfast was served over the road at the Mayflower Hotel every morning Basic breakfast of toast jams croissants and cereals but was still nice to have before our days out I made full use of the fresh coffees and juices Overall a very pleasant stay 
123455,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing to comment on, We had the 4 poster suite which was fabulous value for money although this was a free upgrade to us We had rooms 54 55 directly opposite each other in a private corridor Cannot fault this accommodation at all 
123456,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The double bed was more like a large single The pillows had no support and should have been replaced years ago The shower needed to be descaled as it had poor enough pressure as it was Stronger fan needed in the bathroom Staff were very unhelpful towards a simple request we asked of them before we came , Very close to Earl s Court station for access Bathroom was well decorated 24 hour lobby to leave key when out for the day night 
123457,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room location we were upgraded to a basement room that had windows that you couldn t see out of and we were right next to the staff toilets Also I was kept awake for two hours by people talking outside the room, The beds were comfy and the staff were friendly
123458,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Top floor apartment on corner of Warwick Road with no lift Needed more bowls plates and glasses Only 2 of each and place set up for 4 , Great location Good transport links 
123459,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing much we could find at fault the only slight niggle was the bathroom was a bit small which might be annoying if you were staying a few nights The bathroom however was very modern and clean so not a real issue , This flat was superb we were a little concerned at check in when the reception desk at the hotel told us the flat was about a 4 minute walk away but it was literally no more walk than they said and the place was immaculate There was a fairly large kitchen diner lounge with a separate bedroom and ensuite bathroom Everything looked virtually brand new throughout and the bed was very comfortable It had everything you would need for a longer stay with washing machine dishwasher etc but unfortunately we were only there for the 1 night The flat was actually better than the photos on the website suggested which I don t think I ve ever come across before 
123460,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Front desk unwelcoming unhelpful coldly polite at best Seemed pained to ever look up from the computer Poor inadequate lighting in room and especially bathroom Bed not very comfortable , Breakfast good breakfast with nice selection of fresh and tasty items and an excellent wait staff in attendance Great location in nice neighborhood very close to Tube 
123461,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The tube station platforms can be seen and heard from rooms at the back of the hotel Could hear trains and platform announcements Not good for light sleepers request a room at the front of the hotel , Really good location round the corner from Earl s Court tube station Booked a small double for single occupancy It was fine but pleased I was on my own 
123462,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, You can here the tube station but it didn t bother me There wasn t a great deal of choice at breakfast , The rooms were well presented and spotlessly clean Exceptional value for money and excellent location for tube 
123463,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was small had to turn sideways to get down the side of the second bed and the floorboards creaked , Nice friendly staff lovely fresh fruit salad for breakfast 
123464,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, As above, Not much especially the breakfast it cost me 950 as I wanted a full English I wish I hadn t the sausages tasted like nothing I had before horrible the bacon that was meant to be was warmed up ham beans must have been the basic 5p a tin no taste the only thing nice on the plate was the 2 eggs but even one of them was hard Don t have the room across the road from the hotel You won t sleep noise all night from the hotel next door sounds like there in the same room as yourselves everyone who walked past the accomadation on the street you could hear there footsteps and them talking I had to get up numerous times to make sure all the windows were closed When we first got to the hotel I booked two single beds one for me and one for my sixteen year old daughter once in room it was a double bed and one of us had to sleep on the sofa at the end of the bed 
123465,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Large bed head took up way too much space it was unnecessary and made room hard to move around would have been just as nice and better without it, Location great room comfortable breakfast good
123466,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The customer facing staff are excellent but the management of this hotel need to show less contempt for the public I resent being forced to have a copy taken of a second credit card because I didn t have photo ID to prove I m a UK citizen I was told this was required by legislation which is false I have recently been the victim of credit card fraud and felt very uncomfortable about this procedure It seems the hotel doesn t trust its customers but expects us to trust it with our card details which should never be lying around as a photocopy I shall not stay there again I feel very sorry for the staff having to impose this policy They were very patient with this grumpy customer and they re very professional , Cozy feel 
123467,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Pleasantly surprised by how up to date and modern the hotel was Very closely located near Earls Court Station which was perfect Breakfast was basic continental but all I needed All staff were friendly Highly rated 
123468,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was small but the bathroom was great The location in the basement was fine except that the room was very warm and the window didn t open , Great location and very clean hotel Staff were friendly I had no problems during my stay 
123469,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Was not given much of a chance to walk into reception to be asked to pay soonest , Clean apartment ideally located for my need Facilities within the apt very good Found handy very useful and think it was a great help Breakfast ok 
123470,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, For a family of five the room was very small 3 adults and two children I ended up sleeping on the floor on their spare blankets not ideal considering the price The breakfast wasn t the best a small selection for a continental The toaster in the one side of the breakfast room only had one side working and it took forever how much does it cost for a toaster not much, The location was really close to Earl s Court station and the wifi was the best I have used in a hotel before The bathroom was nice size and shower was amazing 
123471,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast was very poor and although I was just booking the hotel because of the location you could hear the sound of a train in your room, The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom of the room was very nice
123472,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Property staying in was quite a bit further up the road than the hotel Had to go down steps to access front door lonely area when I left at 4am about 4 men loitering there Fire alarm went off at 2am in the morning , Room was lovely very clean and plenty of facilities 
123473,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I couldn t fault it , The staff were very friendly and helpful Especially Jessica on reception The whole place looks and smells beautiful Great west London location very close to Earl s Court station 
123474,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bedroom was very small and I could only get access from one side of the bed to get in it and had to climb on it to operate the far blind The ceiling fan did not work , Generally welcoming large reception area 
123475,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The corridors which was a sort of a maze was very narrow leading to the rooms Having stayed eight nights the breakfast was mediocre and monotonous , Location was ideal Very close to the underground and shops and eating places safe walk from and to the hotel from the underground Extra ordinery warm room dont know how that was but it was nice 
123476,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No air con in a very warm room meant I didn t sleep very well Breakfast could have had maybe a selection of teas and more options other than breads cereals so it encouraged us to go elsewhere for breakfast , The location was great
123477,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Although there were other local restaurants cafes etc it would have been convenient for meals to be available at the hotel , There was a good choice of food at breakfast 
123478,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, It was a nice place to stay very clean staff were very helpful Had no hot water one morning they sorted it out straight away Fantastic value for money would deffiently stay again 
123479,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Thin walls Kettle and cups in the room but no coffee tea milk Table space very limited and no bedside table , Excellent location for the different places I needed to be Clean warm room nicely done out 
123480,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Was a little noisy could hear people in corridor outside and upstairs but then we were right next to breakfast room so was to be expected I guess Also bathroom was a bit cold brrrr , The room was spotless Bed comfy and huge Perfect room for the price 
123481,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Amir mateen and no room service for 3 days of stay And i fainted in the room and no one came to help me out they detect 100GBP becoz i feel on the floor when i was fainted on the carpet and becoz of this this carpet get dirty which is really wrong instead of helping me out they take 100 just for cleaning the carpet, Size and one lady receptionist
123482,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Dining area very small and cramped, Excellent location hotel was lovely bedroom on the small side but perfect for a base breakfast was nice just always a que to be seated and seats very close together
123483,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The cigarette smoke coming in the closed windows from the garden down before I told reception but they said it s the people in the suite below The breakfast was pretty simple but nice enough The breakfast room was cramped and people had to wait to be seated Glass tabletops were very noisy which I found uncomfortable , Nice big windows and high ceilings in room 2 The staff were very welcoming and they put my suitcase in my room as I arrived early The four poster bed was nice and a huge tv screen if you like that Also there s a kettle in the room 
123484,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very nice hotel but too far out of central London for me and my 2 granddaughters expensive to get about Noisy beds , Very clean hotel breakfast adequate staff very helpful and friendly 
123485,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I personally think that hotel should not have stars because it is quite old eventhough nicely refurnbished but still not on the level of 4 stars hotels, The location is great very easy to get there and well conected with the city center
123486,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The electiy was down in my flat but d staff were not very hopeful it did get sorted out but I think it should have been chucked b4 my stay The breakfast room was so stuffy too small also wat was on offer was poor quality So I was happy overall but just reception staff and breakfast let it down abit , I like a locution and d space in d room and was happy with price
123487,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The doors of the rooms are very thin and everytime someone is in the corridor you can hear him her The same for the walls everytime they were talking in the next room we could hear practically everything ,No Positive
123488,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Four poster bed is not a four poster if there is no form of canopy room 53 The breakfast room was cramped over crowded the breakfast unexceptional Most London hotels at that price include a cooked breakfast in the price not as an extra 10 treat , Location close to underground good choice of reasonable places to eat Friendly helpful reception staff Nice shower in the bathroom 
123489,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The shower the lack of a shower door or curtain was inconvenient There was water over the floor after every shower, The staff was very friendly and the location was perfect
123490,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Our shower was cold and didn t warm up at all The bed is also quite hard so did not have the best nights sleep, loved the decor of the hotel the staff were really welcoming and the continental breakfast was great Bedroom was nice and location is perfect 
123491,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There are no lifts in the apartment It s difficult to go upstairs to 3rd floor Although breakfast is include if you are staying at the apartment you have to go to the hotel to have it It s about 5 minutes walk And it is difficult in winter days The alarm often rings without sense and there aren t people from the staff in the apartment to know what it is happening , Cleanliness Near tube station Supermarkets and restaurant near 
123492,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Everything My baby s travel cot broke and they didn t even provide a cot or allow us to upgrade Was absolutely disgusting and bed has given me a bad back Stay away, Nothing Was absolutely awful 
123493,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bed wasn t the most comfortable , Very good value for money in London Earls Court tube station is approximately a 5 minute walk which is good For a 1 night stay I would recommend any longer maybe somewhere with a larger room and more comfortable bed would be better 
123494,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We were slightly disappointed that the tv in the bathroom did not work and one of the receptionist was not very welcoming , In general our room was amazing and more than we expected 
123495,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Had a basement room absolutely stank in the corridors Lift is tiny only 2 people can fit No wifi in bedroom Stain on lamp Shower was awful bed was really uncomfortable Really loud as the walls are so thin Ended up being woken up really early and couldn t sleep due to noise A standard double bed in 130cm small double not a normal double No space in bedroom,No Positive
123496,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Hotel was a bit of a maze inside we were room 53 and had to go through what looked like another room to get to it very confusing Overall though the room was what we expected and private , Really helpfull staff at reception hotel is literally down the road from Earls Court tube station so excellent location for a trip to London to see the sights We missed breakfast we went down on the Saturday and there was a long que to get in so we went elsewhere Room was nice marbled shower room and toilet Shower was leaking at the top but overall pretty good We were able to leave our luggage at no extra cost on our last day so that was a bonus Pretty good hotel and not a bad price for London to be fair though I wouldn t pay over 200 to stay here again 
123497,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Compared to other Hotels in the zone this is way above the price and the room was supersmall Same prices offered average 110 room studio sized with better commodities , The location was good also the staff and the breakfast is fine 
123498,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Double room was small The room 26 in 2nd floor could be for 1 person I didn t have space to place my things or coffee It was really bad how we found the corridor outside of our room upon arrival The maid didn t manage to finish and clean the area the vacuum cleaner and the dirty linens were outside of my door and also the small store with chemical materials was open with everything outside Bed was okay but little moving Area was noisy at night because of the roads I didn t find water to drink but the reception said that from the sink was drinking water At the breakfast room it was very busy and many persons were waiting the others to finish and after to find a place to sit Very small area For the money that I paid I could have a bigger room for sure , Hotel location very good for tube but noisy road Really clean and tidy hotel Warm room good heating Staff was kind Breakfast options were okay 
123499,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, My notes I wrote down during our 1 week honeymoon stay Internet unstable Thin mattresses pillows hard as rocks Metal ceiling fan spun unevenly felt like it would come off and decapitate someone No iron or ironing board in room despite being listed called and got reply we have in reception There isn t room service you have to come get it It was broken Arguing staff Indifferent rude staff No ventilation anywhere Very small breakfast cramped breakfast room Small room bad layout Bad lighting placement of lights different lightbulbs everywhere Had to open window for fresh air which meant having to listen to the trains train station Random Loud pump electric noise had to switch room because of it Corridor maze to rooms doesn t have fresh air Thin walls Phone called 3 times 2 times 3 30 am once 7 am Doors are very difficult to unlock and open Fire alarm right over bed blinks really bright No toothpaste No fridge in deluxe double room 2 drinking glass 2 cups kettle no cutlery Doors don t autolock Bed was very squeaky slightest movement resulted in loud noise We payed for a deluxe double room at a 4 star hotel Seriously , Convenient location close to the tube The breakfast staff were pleasant and one receptionist called Jessica 
123500,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bed was two singles attached together and there was a noticeable gap when sleeping which made for an uncomfortable nights sleep It also wasn t what I thought I was booking they had no pictures of the apartment so I thought a suite was a large room won t have booked if I knew it was an apartment It was also 5 floors up with no lift and this was difficult with a sore back,No Positive
123501,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, When I arrived the women at the reception didn t give me a good feeling not really handsome not really talkative Then the room it says DeLuxe Room was way too small just 1 meter around the bed I travel with two suitcases and had no space to store them So I had to jump over it when leaving the room The chair for sitting at the table was too low and not useful for working with a pc So I had to work sitting on the bed The bathroom was even smaller with just a very small washbasin and fixed shower The bathroom had no exhaustion so all the smell and vapor goes into the room The bed creaked every time I turned around Also the old building has creaking wooden floors The breakfast was very standard but with yoghurt and fruit The breakfast room was smelling when I arrived due to bad ventilation This hotel with this room and breakfast is not worth it 100 euros per night , The Wife which I need for my work works perfect and is fast 
123502,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Unprofessional staff members we heard them slate other guests feedback in the hotel unhygienic apartment awful smell blood on the door of the bathroom bed was very uncomfortable sheets were filthy also breakfast area is very small and over crowded On the booking it said parking available but this is incorrect and no alternative was given , The location of the hotel is good 
123503,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Basement room was the noisiest room I ve ever stayed in The noise from upstairs all night was horrendous and in the morning when breakfast started it was even worse , Location Only a few minutes walk from the tubexperts 
123504,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We booked an executive double room which increased the price for added quality and found that our double bed was two single mattresses pushed together This was a shame especially for the added price both mattresses were very hard and uncomfortable which was disappointing The walls are quite thin so you can hear talking of people in the next room Also strange permanent bathroom smell , Good location and free breakfast makes the price for this place excellent 
123505,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There was no oxygen in the room it smelled really realy bad and it was too cold to keep the windows open at all time , Staff was very helpful and friendly
123506,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Great location just round the corner from the tube Nice double room with balcony and comfy bed Breakfast quite basic continental but fine for a quick breakfast Would use again on another visit to London
123507,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bedroom is very small for 4 people can be difficult to move Inside the room Breakfast room is small and sometimes you have to wait for your turn, Location is great very close to Earl s Court metro station Very elegant bar with nice parrot
123508,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Did not get much sleep due to noise from traffic on the Warwick road No instructions on how to work the AC system Shower could do with a curtain to prevent water spilling onto floor as it is not a wet room , Location to Earls Court tube station 
123509,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was tiny The 4 poster bed took up most of the room There wasn t even enough room either side to open a suitcase on the floor The room itself was nice and clean and relatively well equipped but the bed was a joke It squeeked and rattled constantly with little to no movement and the mattress was rock hard Also had a lot of trouble with the door to the room Was very hard to open with the key and sometimes would re open itself even when locked somehow Overall it wasn t a bad stay but there is a few things that should be addressed for me to give it a more positive review , The location was brilliant 
123510,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, On 4th floor was problem with shower , Nice cosy spot for a few days Easy access till tube only 200m From Earl s court underground station not far to Victoria station and easy reachable all central places Staff is friendly Room was clean 
123511,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Long distance to main hotel building where breakfast is served , Good location near Earls court tub station Breakfast ok but noting special Our apartment was kept very clean and had kitchen with even washing machine but the apartment was quite long away from the main hotel bulding where brekfast is served 
123512,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I ve no complaints, I loved the room The bed was the biggest and most comfortable bed I ve ever seen breakfast was lovely every morning and there was a massive selection of food There s a tube station 2minutes around the corner that can get you anywhere you want to go
123513,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing could have been better It was a wonderful experience and I simply can not wait to go back there again , Everything was just perfect The location the design of the hotel room corridors and reception was just soo warming and welcoming Staff were soo friendly and literally after talking to them for two minutes it felt like you been friends for years It honestly was a wonderful experience in everything and can not wait to go back there soon I can t say I have a complaint about anything The rooms were lovely the staff were fabulous train station was only a few minutes round the corner Breakfast was nice too self service though and reminded me of a harvester continental breakfast which is great because I love the option of croissants cereals toast or fruit and unlimited tea coffee and orange juice first thing in the morning 
123514,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, You had to run the shower for a while for the water to get hot The sink was very unclean I cleaned it myself before I used it The bed was very uncomfortable I stayed for three nights had a rubbish sleep each night No air condition the hotel was very very stuffy hot The breakfast was very poor the only hot food you could have was toast came free with the room and a cooked breakfast that you have to pay for 9 50 didn t state that in the booking I know the cleaners have to clean rooms and change bedding etc but everytime I went into the hall way there was always bedding and towels in the way We had to moved a big orange bag with used bedding or towels in before we could get into our room with our suitcases I won t be returning to this hotel again ,No Positive
123515,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, If you need a room I guess is ok but I had an appartment unfortunatly it was extremelly noisy I felt like the bed was sitting in the middle of the street NOISY Too bad because the place was nice , the situation is great Clean spacious appartment 
123516,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bed was two single short put together had to sleep between them to cuddle my wife Stale cigarette smell in the bathroom Shower water pressure was very low and water not very hot, Staff were amazing
123517,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Hard boiled eggs would be a nice addition to the breakfast Room was a bit of a maze to get to Foot of bed very close to wall , Hotel was clean and in good repair morning papers in the lounge were a nice touch Staff were very friendly and helpful Keys were super adorable For less than 110 CAD night what a deal Very cute little neighbourhood and less than 2 minute walk to an Underground station that will get you anywhere you want to go 45mins from Heathrow and 25 minutes from Tower Hill 
123518,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bit of noise in the night but people were soon told of by staff , Breakfast was lovely Rooms were a good size Excellent location very near to Earls Court underground Staff were very helpful 
123519,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very old hotel No late check out Breakfast little choice no novelties even in new year matress old bad for back no slippers noisy no extras , Location
123520,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Cracked tiles In the bathroom expanding foam exposed in the kitchen area General cleanliness was not great paid extra for use petals everywhere and only got a heart on the bed Paid for parking and had to park 5 minutes walk back to hotel All round not massively impressed , The location was very good
123521,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Everything Harry Potter experience , Leaving very small room with wornout smelly sinks and rats walking around Had to pay upfront a health warning should be in place 
123522,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Everything was very good There was no window in the room but considering the location and structure it was okay The location was perfect Despite located on one of the main shopping streets the room was quite quiet and the staff tried very hard to make sure i stay comfortably Breakfast was also good including standard menu main menus are cooked based on my selection and there are always local sweets along with fruits Travel desk was also very helpful Spa on the top floor was also nice I would definitely stay there next time 
123523,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There were overcrowding when I just popped in basement room for breakfast There were almost fully seaters at the table when arrival , Lovely atmosphere when arrival 
123524,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff not friendly as we arrived the lady at reception South American didn t even say hello just asked us our name w out a smile and we could barely understand her directions to the apartment as she spoke so quickly there was no hot water the 2nd day management arranged to fix it straight away but staff acted as if it was our fault apartment on 4th floor with no lift 2nd bedroom bed is under sloping ceiling so you can t sit up bathroom is miniscule guess it is London but rest of apartment quite spacious, Earl s Court is a nice location with good restaurants cute pubs and grocery stores nearby the actual street is v pretty close to Natural History Museum and V A and the tube big apartment with 2 bedrooms we booked a 1 bedroom so we must have been upgraded very comfortable beds breakfast is not bad esp the fresh fruit
123525,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Noises from creaking floor boards as guests in room above walk around I felt reception staff appeared to be a bit bland and on the aloof side A welcoming smile upon checking in checking out would not have gone amiss Old fashioned large key ring fob and key which needed to be handed back at reception every time you leave the hotel , Tastefully refurbished and decorated Boutique hotel well kept and exceptionally clean I stayed in a luxury suite really sumptuous Three minutes walk to underground station public transport local shops and eating places Size of room great in room facilities and excellent fast free Wi Fi throughout hotel Good breakfast even though only continental 
123526,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Despite what I just said this room was a little tight for two people but I d do it again for the value , I go to London to mostly be out and about doing theatre and museums When I am in the room I am usually sleeping so overall accommodations aren t that important to me Plus Earls Court is a great location with three tube lines 
123527,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast was medicore at best , Thickest fluffiest towels I have ever used in my life Pretty room nice and clean great location and easy to find 
123528,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bed was uncomfortable and creaky Room 32 next to the linen cupboard which was very noisy from early morning No gluten free options for breakfast , Location 3 mins from Earls Court tube
123529,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, This little apartment right next to the railway station in Earls Court was a great place to stay on a budget in London It was easy to get into the heart of London via a bus or the train and took about 20 minutes A good supermarket bakery and coffee shop are just a few minutes walk so self catering was really easy The apartment had everything we needed was warm and quiet 
123530,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Teabags loose and not in individual packets Sometimes rolls ran out and we re not replenished , The fresh fruit option was lovely Choice of cheeses with croissants rolls or bread toast Overall a great hotel which is very clean and comfortable 
123531,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There were red stains on one of the cushions The chair was really old and worn to the point where you feel like you re going to fall through the chair Curtains didn t close properly but they did have old fashioned wooden blinds as well so had to use those as well as the curtains Some bulbs were blone on the chandelier in the bedroom Had to move furniture around just to reach the plug to turn the bedside lamp on You can also hear the trains go past quite clearly Though the trains do stop after a certain time at night but start again quite early in the morning , Comfortable beautiful room 
123532,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The heat way too much of it and wasteful as everyone at breakfast mentioned it and the need to keep windows open There could also be more light in the room the tiny desk lamp wasn t adequate for the space , Free WiFi and included continental breakfast The room was small but perfectly adequate for my needs Bed was very comfortable Bathroom immaculate and plenty of hot water 
123533,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The Hotel needed to see the bank card I had paid with in order to confirm the booking which I didn t have so they had to refund the money to the card I then had to get someone else to pay all the money on their card This was initially booked months ago Not a great system This needs clarification before travelling ,No Positive
123534,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Rooms at the back of the hotel overlook the Earls Court tube station which can be a little noisy even through the double glazing But I always travel with ear plugs so no problem , Small double room was cosy but modern with great shower room Good continental breakfast with really nice croissant and friendly staff 
123535,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The sink in kitchen is too small and no folk and spoon No shower curtains The WiFi in the apartment building was not functioning One of the staff stop my friend s speak rudely I don t know want u say she said How could a person living in a modern city don t know what is WiFi I don t think she had a suitable manner to customer , The apartment building is about five minutes walk to the hotel which is closer to the exit of the tube station We have plenty of space to open 2 suitcases Room is clean tidy Surprisingly there is a washing machine and a free Cell phone was provided Breakfast is healthy and good 
123536,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing really but a towel rail or hooks in the bathroom would have been useful Stairs are quite tricky with luggage but didn t worry us that much, We stayed in a one bedroom apartment and it was better than a home from home Beautifully furnished spacious especially for London fully equipped kitchenette air con and very clean Great location next to tube station but no noise from tube
123537,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very hoy temperature at night at least in room 35 , Excellent location Modest quality Small rooms Friendly staff Clean rooms The 4 stars are not justified according to Spanish standards but the overall opinion attending to the relation quality price and the excellent location 1 minute to the underground and central location is positive 
123538,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, For the price I paid I expected a much bigger room this was a booking for a room above standard and I was very very disappointed with the fact there was little room to move there were no bedside tables there simply was not room for them at the side of the bed which helps explain the pokiness of this room if there is two of you forget it you will be tripping over each other , The room was very well decorated and very nice looking
123539,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff were very efficient Maybe a few more smiles wouldnt have gone astray, The Mayflower was well situated close to Earls Court tube Room was spacious and well presented We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London
123540,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The double room booked was quite small as well as the bathroom which looked a lot larger on the pictures Showering was a challenge as the water pressure was low and there was no shower curtain or glass door so water would sprinkle everywhere , Clean rooms friendly personnel and always clean sheets as well as daily replacement of towels etc Continental Breakfast was good and tasty however could have included a larger range of selection 
123541,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The cereal was stale the staff rude and having to sit to close to other patrons Having to pay 30 per day for a car park which was no more than a drive 10 minutes walk from hotel with the space for 2 cars they wanted to squeeze 4 cars into it, Leaving
123542,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Shower head blocked so water flow poor also light bulb out in shower area so quite dark Told Staff But Nothing Done Whilst Staying , Clean well appointed room
123543,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The staff made were rude and our apparent was double instead of twins and not located within the hotel Breakfast was manic and not worth the money , Location was good
123544,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The staff are not friendly For what we paid they originally gave us a small room in the attic location on 4th We had to pull our luggage without any help to our room which included stairs the receptionist relocated us to another room and didn t even offer to help with the luggage even when he could see we were struggling They do not offer extras like most hotels such as shaving kits or toothbrush They rarely come to your room to give you something when you ask for it they request you go to reception for it The walls are thin and you can hear people walking around the other floors above you , The location of the hotel is next to the station which is great for getting around London 
123545,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Double bedroom more like twin room pushed together one matress was hard other was soft trying to get comfortable was impossible The lights were awful for some silly reason you would turn the lights off and they would still glow energy saving bulbs wouldnt have minded if it was only a few minutes but no 4 hours later still glowing so 3 in the morning i had to unscrew all the bulbs to actually make the room dark Pieces missing of tap handles the cups for tea and coffee were tiny had to make two for a decent drink Only other problem anyone on same floor and corridor as you if they shut their door yours would rattle and bang from the wind of other peoples doors , Clean and cheap if you are looking for a one night stay no problem 
123546,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The young woman on front desk when we arrived was not at all pleasant Thereafter other staff was very friendly Didn t particularly like lugging baggage up 3 flights 54 steps to the apt But the apartment space we enjoyed once we got there Also cleaners forgot toilet paper so we had to choose between walking to the store or around to the main hotel both of which were inconvenient , Dining facilities and staff were very pleasant and so was breakfast Good selection of breakfast choices and again the staff in the restaurant were very pleasant and accommodating 
123547,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The rooms are rather small I was travelling with my parents and we have got two double beds with a small space between both beds The windows are not well sealed there was some freezing air comming in from the outside and you can feel it because the bed was close by the window room 15 The breakfast room is small and they only have 4 or so tables for 3 4 people we have had to wait a lot and finally have had breakfast sepparated I have ordered with advance we will be needing soy milk but they didn t have it Some details of the rooms should be renovated doors furniture etc , The location of the hotel is good and is close by the metro stop Earl s Court 2 minutes walking The neighborhood is secure and you can find plenty of restaurants bars and supermarkets there 
123548,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Was given a nice twin room but paid for an executive suite This wasn t a executive space It was a very small room with twin beds put together that were not confitbale at all It felt like we were on twin beds and not an executive double bed , In a very good location clean welcoming staff 
123549,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Poor value for money In addition there are hidden costs If you want an English breakfast you have to pay about 9 pound per person But I had a satisfying continantal breakfast which was included in the rate There are other hptels in better locations at least one of them should be a better option to stay in , Cleanliness 
123550,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Walls quite thin so can hear shower etc next door TV came on by itself in middle of the night Might be worth checking why, Comfy bed Good shower and breakfast Nice decor
123551,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The floor in the room was noisily and the tap of sink make a noise when open it I have heard the same noises of the side room , Continental breakfast reasonable however this is a standard for this category of hotel The mattress was good 
123552,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Check in arrangements could be better this time as needed to wait for some time even specially requested during booking and reminded onwards , With my previous experience stays hotel management arranged the room of preference again Thanks for their concern 
123553,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Rooms a little on the small side and finding some of them is a bit complicated but adequate as you don t spend your visit in the hotel A shower cap would be appreciated as well , Lovely little hotel Included continental breakfast was more than adequate but would have appreciated a vegan option for my daughter 
123554,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Coffee was not of good quality at breakfast Rooms are very tiny I paid for an executive room but didn t see any difference between that and a small bedroom Shower a fixed head and not very powerful , Comfy bed
123555,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast was poor room noisy as it backed out onto tube station culdnt hear announcements trains but wasnt a problem from late evening small bed room very bright due to blinds no curtains, Great location shops places to eat right beside tube nice room ensuite Staff helpful but not very friendly
123556,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was very cosy small lighting wasn t good for getting ready for a night out the towels left us with fluff everywhere and the breakfast wasn t very good , Great location and nice staff The rooms are nicely furnished 
123557,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, It wasn t clear when I booked that the apartment was not at the premises of the mayflower hotel so the breakfast included was not useful or an advantage for us so it became more expensive Towel rails are need in apartment notthing to hang a towel on at all , The apartment was clean equipped 
123558,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Whilst it was clean and tidy and the staff friendly I am amazed it gets a 4 star rating No real facilitied to spak of just a room overlooking Earls court underground and a very basic basement to get a very basic continental breakfast , near earls court
123559,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We booked and paid for the room on a corporate credit card and the hotel insisted on seeing this card and photo ID for the card owner which wasn t me So a lot of issues to sort out so I didn t have to pay again Not great and needs sorting out by Booking com, Location was perfect
123560,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Unfortunately the most unfriendy personal i ve ever seen Poor standard breakfast Very cold air through closed window although super hot heaters between bed and window Caution So hot you should nt it with skin i put a towel over it Shower has no glass or curtain so the whole bathroomfoor is full of water , The images of the Hotel on the Website are very nice London is a lovely city 
123561,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, We were able to check In early which was much appreciated after a long flight The room was comfortable and the bed was great Lovely picture windows looking into the garden 
123562,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bed Four post Wasn t comfy and it made a noise everytime you moved a mm Definitely worth investing in a new one Room 22, Great location Friendly staff Nice breakfast 
123563,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Booked executive double Was upgraded to luxury double on arrival However room was tiniest I ve ever seen website photos misleading and the luxury bed was rickety and uncomfortable Door lock temperamental and we had to ask for staff assistance on several occasions even they couldn t open door Also breakfast buffet was chaotic Had to keep asking staff to replenish coffee juice pastries etc , Good location within easy walk of tube 
123564,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Hard beds and we were In an executive room Also the sound proofing between the rooms was terrible so over all I had a poor nights sleep The breakfast was rather lacking in choice as well with no hot options what so ever which in the winter was rather disappointing , Great location
123565,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I received a room upgrade which I really appreciated but the room was just in front of the tube station Initially I thought it would have been an issue but we eventually did sleep well The room though was too small The breakfast was disappointing and the staff removed all the food at 9 55 on Sunday it was up to 10 00 They should guarantee to the people who get there before the service stops to finish their breakfast without any rush we have been invited to take as much food as possible before they took everything away which is not very nice , The location is just great 3 minutes walking distance to Earl s Court station The hotel in general and the room are really clean and the staff is always smiling and helpful 
123566,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No phone signal in basement room Quite dark so had to have lights all the time No fridge Sockets behind bedside tables so difficult to plug in phone charger hairdryer etc, The staff were welcoming breakfast was good for me as I love continental style Option to have cooked breakfast for additional cost Huge bathroom with lovely walk in shower Very comfy bed 
123567,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, To much noice from adjacent rooms Hard bed No reading light above bed Safety deposit box didn t work Average and boring breakfast , Nice location 
123568,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was very small Bed against the wall but ok for 1 night , Great location less than 5 minute walk to Earls Court station Friendly staff and allowed early check in which was great Third time staying here 
123569,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Our room overlooked the train station therefore noisy The bed was a three quarter size not a full double and pushed up against the wall Not told about the train and only found out about the bed when booking done Customer service friendly but no help at all, Location was quite good for getting to places
123570,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Our bed had two single beds pushed together There was a dip in the middle were they met and it was very uncomfortable There was also an outage with the hot water our first morning there The member of staff wasn t very helpful when my husband enquired about it Obviously these things happen but a spot of empathy would have been nice The rest of the staff were lovely so top marks for the rest of them , It was very clean and beautifully decorated Most of the staff were very friendly 
123571,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Not being put in a room backing on to Earl s Court train station It just happened to be the hottest day of the year so you had to have the window open and the noise from the trains was relentless only managed a few hours sleep ,No Positive
123572,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Cold shower one morning and staff response was pretty indifferent no attempt to compensate for something that was so inconvenient and uncomfortable , Very convenient and clean
123573,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We had breakfast just once cos the breakfast room which is located in the hotel about 5 minutes away is too small and gets crowded and stuffy, Nice studio apartment 20 steps away from Earl s court underground station Daily cleaning included large and powerful shower Little kitchen nicely furnished with everything you might need to heat cook dinner We had to switch on AC because being on the top floor under the roof the studio was a bit hot but it was comfortable 
123574,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff unfriendly although not all of them dark room TV above the closet alarm in the middle of the night due to other hotel guests having a steam bath in their room loud doors , Shower
123575,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room very small water in shower very poor and water not hot enough Not enough sound proofing as could hear all noise from above and to the side Not enough sockets, It was very clean towels were plentiful and soft 
123576,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room way too small even for solo traveller problems with credit card needed the same card reservation was booked with which wasnt stated when booking Breakfast v basic and unappealing, Room clean and nice bathroom
123577,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room are extremely small and tiny It s not suitable at all for human being It can only hold pets I don t recommend this hotel all all to any one , Location 
123578,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bfast room was over capacity at all times and practically unnavigable room was next to a private residence that was so loud and staff reacted unapologetically and w o offer for a room change Manager contact was suggested but then made difficult by staff stating unknown scheduling of when the manager would be in and the biz cards they had only listed the hotel phone number Lightbulbs were burned out Bathroom lighting was impossible when in front of the vanity mirror , Location
123579,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff are not friendly Service attitude of front desk staff is far from being excellent , Excellent location walking distance to Earls Court Continental breakfast was good 
123580,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Tea and coffee in the rooms would be a nice addition , Excellent location near tube station loads of restaurants and shops nearby tasty continental breakfast included and comfy well appointed bedrooms All in all it s a great place to stay in London 
123581,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, myself and my boyfriend are coffee drinkers so the only constructive criticism i can offer is not only provide tea cups but also mugs please , The apartment was a fabulous surprise I have never stayed in such a wonderful apartment in the centre of London The bedroom was divine comfy bed plenty of storage the decor was modern The bathroom spacious wonderful mirrors Kitchen lounge GORGEOUS I was so sad to leave honestly I will be back and I would strongly recommend this hotel The windows are double glazed and believe me I am a light sleeper and I could hear the tubes Oh and there is air con Before I booked this apartment I read nearly all of the reviews and for those who moan about scaffolding you must see this as a positive they are really improving this property and I am excited to come back in a few months time to see how it has developed 
123582,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The continental breakfast was good but the tables were a little bit squashed together Unfortunately on our second night the fan in the next room was on all night and it was very loud and disturbing We did inform the desk , Location was very convenient Room was comfortable plenty of wardrobe space The shower was easy to use and water hot The fluffy towels were a treat too 
123583,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was exceptionally warm even with fan and windows open bed was very small , Close to tube station plenty of bars and restaurants in walking distance 
123584,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bed was small Very noisy too eveytime you moved there was a creaking noise , The location was perfect round the corner from the tube station The staff was friendly 
123585,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast area was very cramped , The apartment was large and very cool in the summer with the air conditioning The staff let us leave our bags and carried them to the apartment for us 
123586,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We had to go through the process to get us moved, They fixed our room after giving us to single beds pushed together not zipped they moved us to a room with one bed 
123587,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The quilt bedding had two stains on when i went to reception the did give me another cover leaving me to change the bedding The rooms didn t have air conditioning which we knew about when booking The fan left in our room was no use and the room was like a sauna which wouldn t of been so bad if our window wasn t level with the garden seating so everyone could see in meaning we couldn t really leave the curtains and windows open to deal with the heat issue The floor in the room was incredibly creaky so it made it impossible to get up in the night to go to the bathroom without waking your partner up The hallway flooring was also very creaky also so you could hear people walking past our room to get to theirs , Location is brilliant near tube station and cheap for london free wifi The place overall presented very clean and smart 
123588,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The only thing I can Moan about was that the apartment only had a mirror in the bathroom there was no sockets in there for use of a hairdryer so had to rely on my reflection in a picture to get ready , We liked everything we will always book there when ever we re in London Like home from 
123589,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was too small and the view from the window horrible we were in a basement and the window was overlooking a washing machine cleaning stuff and a stiarcase , I liked the variety of the breakfast items the outside garden and the location of the hotel It s placed in a nice quite alley but close to restaurants shops and public transport 
123590,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Had a basement room Walls doors are paper thin starting at 6 AM I could hear the staff rummaging in the breakfast dining area and in the hallway ,No Positive
123591,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, We were lucky enough to be given an upgrade The studio apartment was lovely The staff were very attentive friendly and helpful Superb location for the tube station and exploring London Just wish we had booked to stay for longer Will definitely be back 
123592,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Expected more space in the room for the price paid Family room had 2 king sized beds instead of a double amd 2 singles which would have been better No air conditioning meant the room was really hot Could have done with a cooked English breakfast for the price paid, Staff were excellent rooms cleaned every day to a high standard
123593,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Although the room had a bath there was no plug so I couldn t enjoy it sadly , I stayed in a luxury suite in the Mayflower which was a real treat The bed was really comfy and I liked the layout of the room which ensured I had a good sleep This particular room even had private use of a little garden which was a nice surprise 
123594,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was very small 3 4 bed Room advertised as stadard double I d describe as single Problem with wifi on first night which was also irritating , Clean
123595,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, With busy lives and children we only get away together very very occasionally and do spend time choosing hotels where we are going to feel aesthetically comfortable as both of us work in the arts On the booking com website the deluxe double rooms looked lovely What we got we are sure was not a Deluxe Double Room with Four Poster Bed it did have a four poster but it seemed we were given a room in the un refurbished part of the hotel perhaps a standard double I d even looked through the 4 photo examples of deuxe rooms provided on Booking com and contacted the hotel when I booked asking if it were possible to have a particular room not always possible but worth the ask SO essentially I booked this hotel going on the photos provided on the website our room was nothing like those shown and that was very disappointing considering that I could have found this standard of room anywhere VERY disappointed and wouldn t return or recommend anyone UNLESS I was guaranteed one of the rooms shown on the website To be quite honest I feel we were misled by the photos on the website , clean bathroom but very very tiny Nothing Deluxe about it Beautifully laundered bed linen
123596,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We were awoken by major plumbing pumps which were starting and stopping at random from 7 00 am onwards They were obviously very close by It sounded like they were in our room Also the lounge bar is alcohol free which wasn t mentioned on the description ,No Positive
123597,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Wifi heating breakfast rooms are way to small and cramped, I m sorry but we were not happy with our stay here We were moved to a sister boutique around the corner on check in I would like to add that the lady on check in was very sweet and lovely However when we got to our room it was in the basement and seemed very cramped It did smell a little damp and it was very cold We did have to ask for an extra heater The wifi just did not work in the basement and this was a problem as I work from my laptop The breakfast was nothing great To be honest we travel alot and this was not up to scratch on many levels and I think it is hugely overpriced They do offer tea and coffe which is reasonable but we will not stay here again 
123598,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room small Mattresses on beds felt a bit worn out and saggy Noise from the underground and view from window not great No options at breakfast for special dietary needs such as alternative to cows milk or herbal teas Room rather tired could do with updating , Location for our planned activities was excellent Staff were pleasant and helpful Breakfast generous 
123599,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We rented an apartment across the road from the actual hotel which had all the facilities you would expect but there was no elevator to our top floor apartment 4th floor which was a real pain We had to carry everything that goes along with being out for the day with our 1 and 5 year old up and down the 4 flights of stairs every morning , It was almost next door to Earl s Court train station so it was extremely easy to get around to see all the major sites particularly as we were travelling with a pram as well as a 5 year old not too muck walking 
123600,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, It would have been nice to have a bath and there was a faint smoky smell in the room as if someone had been smoking in there recently not something we felt that needed reporting but it was noticeable , Great location great price the staff at reception and at breakfast were very friendly they looked after our bags the day we checked out so we got an extra day in London the room size was good the bed was great the kitchen was very big there were two showers in the shower so that was good for me and my girlfriend Overall it was a great trip and great experience

123612,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The sheets had too much detergent in them making the sheets and pillow somewhat toxic to breathing , The welcome is always genuine and the breakfast first class
123613,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Hotel need to make it clear whether they need to see photo ID off of all guests prior to arrival we were made to feel very uncomfortable on check in as passports or driver licence was requested even though we had the credit card that room was booked with and are from UK Not impressed with their customer service receptionist patronised us by making a comparison with airport security , Location

123620,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast wasn t great Paid an extra 9 50 for a full English No sausages left and a potato waffle instead of a hash brown Restaurant was also extremely hot , I had booked a twin room and the booking was accepted However there were no twin rooms available Not a huge issue but annoying I should have been told at the point of booking that they couldn t accommodate us as we wanted to be 
123621,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The mezzanine ceiling was so low The bathroom floor was cracked The entrance was awful The TV didn t work and we spent the night awake because of an incident with crazy person screaming outside with police sirens etc Breakfast ended at 10am on a Sunday , Cleanish Not much else 
123622,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast was adequate but repetitive so we mostly ate in the flat There was also no telephone in the apartment so even for local calls we had to call long distance or skype , This hotel is ideally located with all major attractions easily accessible from the nearby underground We needed flexibility with meals so we stayed in a one bedroom flat with a full kitchen and loved it There s a 24 hour grocery store within walking distance The flat was small but cozy clean and nicely updated Unlike a private rental we also had access to the services from the main hotel room cleaning breakfast and a front desk for any emergencies I would definitely stay here again

123626,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The bedroom and bathroom is too small even for a single room It is way too expensive for the room charge, Great location Close to Earls Court Station Wifi is great
123627,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We had a nice room in the basement however unfortunately we were woken up very early by staff arriving for work soon after 6 30 by their talking laughing and slamming doors very close to our room, Good continental breakfast
123628,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, First room we where given Size of the room for 3 adults not great at all Shower didn t work no where to unpack your clothes for 3 adults, They could move us to a bigger room which was better but if this room was booked we would have had a problem
123629,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The location This hotel is located right next to the underground station You can basicallu hear the announcements in the station The walls are also thin So in addition you can hear every noise in the hotel The staff were rude when we came down for breakfast It was a Monday but it was a public holiday so according to their hotel rules breakfast ran for longer The staff were unaware of this i guess And were rude to us Due to the noise i woke up everyday with a headache The bed we slept on was two singles put together and there was always an uncomfortable gap in the bed , The rooms were always clean 
123630,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The lift was very tiny and was difficult to get all our luggage into it , Our room was upgraded free of charge which was perfect They were able to look after all of our things as well so we could look around London some more

123637,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, They don t specify that if you take the flat for the breakfast you have to walk 5 mins to the hotel It would have been better to pay less without breakfast or at least say that the flat is not in the same building and not even in the same street , The flat was big and nicely cleaned and fully stuffed The position is good 
123638,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Down side was the comfort of the bed And also no aircon just a ceiling fan which doesn t produce much circulation in the room The option for breakfast could ve been a bit of a wider variety we felt Facial flannels toiletry stock and a fridge could ve made life easier in the hotel , The hotel was conveniently located right around the corner of Earls Court underground station with access to hired bicycles and buses too Lots of pubs cafes and restaurants around the area too The Piccadilly line and District line make it easy to get to central london in no time The value you for money was incredible for it s location and if you are happy to have a continental breakfast in the morning this is the place for you The staff were very friendly also And remembered their guests faces very well 
123639,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Cooked breakfast is extra but there many coffee shops and pubs such as the Troubadour that do great breakfasts, Location is great on picas illy and district lines so easy access to Heathrow airport and central London close walking distance to musuems high street Kensignton Scarsdale Pub Michaels Barber and lots of shops including Londons largest Tesco not far from where Freddie Mercury once lived
123640,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Double glazing on the Windows Our room overlooked the station and we could here the trains an station announcements Although it didn t stop us sleeping it could be a problem for people perhaps a little more noise sensitive , We were very pleased with the hotel The complimentary breakfast was more than sufficient with good quality foods Our room a 4 poster suite was well fitted out and the bath towels were big thick and good quality Excellent location

123646,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The rooms were very small The original room layout of the building had been altered to squeeze in more rooms , Continental breakfast was good especially the croissants Bed was very comfortable room was very clean and quiet The shower room was small but perfectly formed and imaculately clean Staff were pleasant and helpful Everything seemed very well organised The only downside was that the rooms were small we were glad that we had opted to upgrade However we were out all day and only used the rooms for sleeping so their small size was not too much of a problem We stored our luggage on our day of departure and it was quickly retrieved when we returned to collect it Location was very good a mere 2 or 3 minute walk to Earls Court tube station 
123647,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bed too high Should have air conditioning Bar more choice but was under refurbishment suppose but think you should still take this into consideration compensate somehow We had to walk to shop just to get a drink in the evening whilst getting ready to go out , Good breakfast polite staff

123650,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Service was not friendly and not customer oriented This experience was really awful and it ruined our vacation mood On Wednesday morning we received a phone call from reception to ask us for checkout Sunddenly my husband and I realized that we only booked for three nights that was one night less than we scheduled We made a mistake and felt very anxious and got worried We explained our situation to the reception lady and asked for another night stay with better price as we booked for the previous days but without any negotiations we got direct negative answer and the price we paid was almost doubled We didn t have any other better choice and had to accept it At the same time the reception lady threatened us to pack our luggage immediately within ten minutes and change to another room otherwise we would get fined around 10 pounds You can imagine how embarrassing it was when we were still on bed at that time We totally understood it was kind of hotel policy but the service was really not freindly and not customer oriented This experience was awful and it ruined our vacation mood By the way the room is very crowded and close to traffic road The breakfast is with limited selection and not tasteful at all The only good thing is the location which is about 5 minutes walk to underground station ,No Positive
123651,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Great location from the tube just round the corner nice couple of restaurants close by And the rooms were very nice and very clean Would stay there again

123654,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Joint balcony The sitting area was on the next room side of the balcony I didnt want to walk to their side of the balcony MINOR DISCONVENIENCE, Everything was good Upgrade to Luxury room with the balcony was very nice thanks to the staff Regular breakast Bad sound proofing Tight stairs maybe Overall a nice experience Will visit again 
123655,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Thin walls noise from other rooms Wooden floors so lots of noise from other rooms especially above Back rooms are almost on top of Tube station noisy No swipe cards for rooms big key and handle with GBP 100 fine if lost, Location Interesting room decor Lovely bathrooms Pleasant helpful staff
123656,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Wooden floors which meant huge amounts of noise from above Thin walls so noisy neighbours kept me awake last 2 nights of stay Very basic breakfast I only ate 1 out of 5 breakfasts because choices so limited, Location Style of room furnishings Fabulous bathrooms Very pleasant helpful staff
123657,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff could be more friendly and helpful It feels like they are robotic and very abrupt both the indian man and the Eastern European woman The woman who checked us in was the most helpful but the rest were so flat not friendly at all I spoke to reception the day before that we may check out only 30 minutes late and there was this indian man who came in harrassing us to get out of our flat when we were only 20 minutes He later told us that it wasn t communicated to him but the abrupt and rash attitude was NOT helpful and turned off not only me but my wife who is more understanding in these situations but was put off by this We had two mcflurries in our freezer which didn t belong to us but found out later on before we checked out as we didn t really need to use the freezer up until we had to quick chill a bottle of wine The cross trainer in the room was a nice touch however one of the steps were broken , We stayed at an apartment which was actually across the street of this hotel We had alot of space which made it comfortable They just renovated last year so the apartments do not look like the ones on the photos they actually did a great job with the renovations The powerful though noisy rain shower made a long day worth the relaxing shower Location was fantastic very close to the train station and a grocery is nearby too The main road had alot of restaurants too Advise is to stay away from the Indian restaurant called Masala Zone which was overpriced for the portions and flavour Breakfast was an ordinary continental nothing special The very small two rooms for breakfast made us feel like we were in a very small cafe in Paris Get in early to avoid the pack of people and the very annoyed and stressed staff If you want hot food you need to shell out at least 9GBP There are not enough healthy options at this hotel which made us use our apartment more for breakfast Value for money would have been great if only staff were better more friendlier Not going back though after the staff experience When one is on a holiday specially celebrating my wife s birthday you wouldn t want to get stressed right 
123658,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, This can not be rated AS a 4 star hotel It was small unpro staff bad breakfast Also got an apartment across the streat with no connection to the hotel private persons living in the same building Apartment was ok but overall not worth the money ,No Positive
123659,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room 46 really too small It is on the station so if you don t have a deep sleep you might find it noising Rooms on the quiet street should be much better , Location is just 100 mt from Earl s Court station Kind staff Clean for London 
123660,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Finish in bedroom and bathroom Corners were cut Speaking of standard twin room here And 1 of the beds uncomfortable in room 41 However very clean on arrival and housekeeping excellent , Excellent welcome on arrival Location spot on for conference at Olympia which can be reached by pleasant 15 min walk mainly through residential streets or by C1 bus along busy Warwick road C1 also brings you efficiently from Victoria station to Warwick Road and then a 2 min walk to hotel if you get off at junction with trebovir road Street pleasant and feels safe at night Plenty of mostly chain eating options on earls court road GBK Nandos 1 min walk away Franco Manca Zizzi 2 mins independent French brasserie style restaurant 4 mins etc etc No 9 bus along Kensington high street takes you past Kensington Hyde parks right to aldwych earls court tube 2 mins from hotel Get Oyster card online before arrival for best prices Small supermarkets large tesco all at hand In short great location to live for a bit Continental Breakfast included fresh fruit good quality natural yoghurt

123662,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bed and pillows I found uncomfortable Rooms need soundproofing as I could easily here people above and next door moving around and talking could also hear any cars or bikes on the road Lift was very small could only just fit 2 people and bags in Had to leave key behind whenever you left the hotel Was extremely disappointed with the breakfast Breakfast included in room fare is just 3 choices of cereal toast plain croissants little fruit and that was about it Could get full English for 9 50 which came with very little Wasn t happy with the pre authorisation of my money didn t go out of my account until after a few days when we paid Wasn t helpful with knowing what money I could spend The Fan in the room was off centre and looked like it was about to fall off Not many plugs if you need to charge anything overnight Bins weren t emptied at all through out our stay , The location was great as it was just round the corner from Earls Court tube station Staff were friendly and polite Room looked very nice WiFi was free and fairly fast Had a nice balcony but wasn t able to get out to it Was a good price for London Plenty of restaurants nearby 
123663,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was slightly dusty around the edges think the wrong kind of cleaner had been used on the wood floor so it was slightly sticky in places These are only very small critiscms though , The apartment was huge the location was amazing staff were very friendly and helpful breakfast was nice with really fresh fruit and a big enough selection 
123664,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room size was extremely small There was hardly a space to stand in the room , The location is excellent right at the Earl s court station and easy access to busses

123666,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The cutlery was has hard to find as we are not tall folk and it was in a high cupboard , The apartment was in an ideal location Warm and cosy Had everything we needed Very clean and the beds were comfy 
123667,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing really , A great budget for a short stay in London My room is actually a flat 5 mins from the hotel main building The facilities are very new 
123668,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, you could only use the bath for a shower heating was always on as we were in the basement you can hear the tubes underground not too noisy though I still managed to get a good night sleep, Very stylish room space our own garden kitchen comfortable bed location is perfect facilities are good also hotel is clean amazing value for money
123669,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The initial room we were given was very small and the bed wasn t big enough for two people so we had to pay 20 extra to move to a different room which was more spacious Quite noisy as right next to the underground station Tea and coffee facilities not up to scratch not enough for 2 people and instead of tea spoons you get plastic sticks Boiler in the room to add to the noise from the underground Breakfast very very basic , Location very close to the underground right next door Staff accommodated our request for another room even though it was at a cost The bathroom in the more expensive rooms are very nicely done 
123670,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Got a basement level room Very little light felt a bit claustrophobic Was fine for a night but not for longer , Good sized room Whole property is well maintained and cleaned nicely decorated 
123671,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I was asked to relocate rooms after my first night stay without explanation and was then provided with a much smaller room I was requested to re pack all of my clothing on the very day I needed to attend a wedding function The elevators were not working which I was not told about in advance , The location was excellent for access to transport and restaurants The staff were friendly and the hotel was reasonably clean with the exception of tools and debris due to elevator maintenance

123673,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very small room and walls are very thin We could here the people in the room beside us talking all the time, Location was great very clean good for a weekend in London 
123674,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The standard double room was a bit on the small side and you could probably get something bigger for your money The noise from Earl s Court tube station is quite noticeable and the walls aren t very sound proof as a young couple in our 30 s they weren t major issues but might be off putting for senior couples I d be inclined to stay again but hopefully pay a little less if the option was available I d remove the breakfast continental wasn t suitable for us I d prefer to have breakfast out you can get a good cooked English breakfast from as little as 100 metres away in one the many pubs restaurants on the high street for under 10 The hotel is an excellent location , Clean and friendly 
123675,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Lift was out of order The room not easy to find and no indication where it was Had to call staff to show , The four bed post very comfortable Will definitely stay there another time
123676,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very small room The shower tiles were very slippery which is a high risk for slipping and getting injured We had to throw a towel on the shower floor to prevent slipping , Location
123677,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing excellent hotel and apartments would thoroughly recommend, Excellent location next to earls court train station shops close by safe area clean facilities apartment had own washing machine which is very useful when travelling Staff were friendly and hard working all appliances were working
123678,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Being rushed at breakfast time Breakfast was 7 30am 9 30am but by 9 20am the staff were clearing things away , The bedroom was very clean and a decent sized one for a budget hotel in London The bathroom was super 
123679,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, 3rd floor overlooking train station yard tiny bathroom broken fittings creaking bed no alcohol of any kind on sale door would bash the bed if it were not for the stubbing toe hazard on the floor where the door stop is fitted next to the bed Paper thin walls and a maze to reach the stairs , Reception staff cleanliness
123680,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Very clean and comfortable rooms Nice decor and lovely rooms although a little small perfect for our stay Fantastic location The breakfast which was included was good 
123681,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Although the breakfast was of a very high quality the option to have a cooked breakfast was available at a extra cost I feel that this possibly could be made available as part of the cost The lift was not working but we was told this in advance I would put this down to bad luck on my part more than the hotels fault, Perfect location near Earl s Court underground station Situated in what looked and felt like a very safe road with plenty of restaurants nearby The staff were all very polite and helpful and the room was impeccably clean Breakfast was also top quality
123682,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room was clean but small like all London hotels Definitely needs a sofa or at least a couple of chairs There shud also be an end table beside the bed, The location is superb and the staff friendly and cooperative Lacks facilities like a proper restaurant a bar or a comfortable work area Elevators were not working and we were told are being replaced and will take a month to function Unacceptable 
123683,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The window either open or closed no facility to secure in a semi open position for ventilation without compromising security , cleanliness lovely bathroom comfortable bed and decent pillows No need to worry about what you get for your money Good breakfast included in the price 
123684,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There was a horrible smell of drains in the toilet The bed kept squeeking really loud even when just changing position Lift was so dangerous when we needed to arrive to our room we had to step up from the lift unto the ground No tea and coffee facilities There was a kettle but no sugar tea or coffee , Room was very clean They gave little shampoos and soap which was nice Location was excellent 
123685,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The apartment was rather cramped when the fold out bed was set up like on our arrival we were unable to all sit comfortably around the table due to the confined space , Location was ideal for us to explore London Everything we needed was inside the apartment 
123686,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The lift was out of order and we had to walk 3 flights of stairs with young children They could have tried to fix it asap or give us alternative accomodation on lower floor , Staff were friendly and the hotel was close to the tube station
123687,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Quite a difference between photos and the real room we ve got No lift stairway mazes Very small breakfast room, Close to underground station 
123688,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, leaky windows big noise from outside room in fact was different than the pictures on website small and non comfortable bathroom horrible shower some lights doesnt work, breakfast simply but good bed on mezzanine thats was great 
123689,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Staff in the evening were rude abrupt but the lady in the morning was very nice and helpful After coming from the US it s a bit of a shock but that s London for you , Huge bed free breakfast great location nice bathroom 
123690,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The lift was out of order so the climb up narrow staircase with bags was cumbersome and a real workout after being in the basement for breakfast , Bed was comfy although the room was small and the floorboards creaky The sound of the tube station we were in one of the back rooms didn t really bother us although the plumbing sounds early in the morning were annoying 
123691,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bed was very uncomfortable to sleep , First expression was clean and presentable room with nice balcony Its good place for short stay couple of days 
123692,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The wifi connection was temporary unavailable The breakfast was very simple tosted bread and cheese slices , Extremely good location Very nice clean modern apartament located in the basement 
123693,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Lift was out of order a lot of stairs to climb but did offer the services of a porter Felt rude asking him to carry me up the stairs though , Nice quality fixtures and fittings Location very good and staff helpful when needed 
123694,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room had everything and very comfortable bed but just a wee bit too small Narrow steep stairs so a good thing lift is being repaired , ample breakfast 
123695,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Proximity to the station only meant our room was noisy but it did mean only 2 minute walk to Earls Court station, Location couldn t have been better and staff were so helpful
123696,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast wasn t good for us as we are both vegans it was dry toast with tomatoes and cucumber for us Hotel in general was cramped the floor level changes and we kept tripping over in corridors When rooms are being serviced big bags are left all over the corridors and tops of stairs which you have to step over bit of a hazard The lift wasn t working we were on third floor , Our room was lovely nice and warm and clean 
123697,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, It was down as family room but it seemed as though an extra double bed was just popped in there to get more people in We where literally tripping over each other and constantly walking into the beds The bathroom door could only open half way due to the bed being too close The room was baking even with window open but with kids this was not safe being 3 stories high and the fan was too noisy preventing sleep very frustrating It looked nice on walking in but needs some TLC, friendly staff good location value for location food was fresh pretty wide choice bed comfy and clean
123698,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Not happy with the fact we were probably given the crappiest room in the hotel the one literally right next to the breakfast room in the basement Was not able to open suitcase in the room anywhere else but on the bed as not enough space in the room Be wary when booking the genious offer on here as they will give you a room that looks nothing like the photos above , Very happy the breakfast and wifi were included Around the corner from Earl s Court tube stop which was excellent 
123699,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, In a basement room which meant noise levels from 6 30am were extremely loud and our room was located near the breakfast room so from very early people were clattering cutlery etc , Great location
123700,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There was a little bit of draft in the room where we were staying although the window was closed , Great little hotel in the great location Would definitely recommend a stay there
123701,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, When we arrived we checked in at the hotel and a member of staff was instructed to take us to the apparent he was on his phone and never offered to help when we were clearly struggling with our bags He was on his phone and went off at such a pace that we thought we d lost him as he was so far ahead he was out of sight He was in such a rush that we had to chase him back onto the street as he forget to leave the keys for us, It was very clean and comfortable
123702,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The whole place , Rooms are very small staff very rude refused to refund money only upgraded to another room after several phone calls with booking agent then it was still no better Only difference was the bed size still couldn t open my suitcase unless I put it on the bed Photos are of somewhere else or they have been altered 
123703,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Although breakfast was included in the price we still had to pay 10 pounds extra for English breakfast namely for something salty , The hotel was very clean and the location good I also liked the decoration of the room 
123704,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, With the room being described as a suite it would have been even better if there was a sofa or comfortable seating in addition to the table chairs but it was still great value and much nicer than just a characterless hotel room , Ideally situated in close 2 minute walking distance from Earls Court underground station Discounted offer making it excellent value for money in Central London Suite room with four poster bed making it feel more luxurious Patio doors out onto private patio area would be perfect in summer months The decor and homely touches like book shelves lamps ornaments added to the appeal
123705,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, This is definitely not 4 stars hotel 1 Breakfast Not full continental breakfast 2 Room was so old small and ugly furniture unlike what i saw on booking com 3 Room key was so old and huge like a hammer Not sure how 4 stars hotel in London does but i stayed in 3 stars hotel in london just around the corner from this hotel I got better room better service and definitely did not lock the main door I stayed for 7 nights Everytime i got back to hotel They always locked the main door I need to ring or knock the door so hard before someone came out to open for me I never experienced in any others 3 or 4 stars hotel in london locked the main door of the hotel at night This made me felt like stay in Hostel even other hostel doesn t lock the door Oh and such a warm greeting at night from the staff who was telling me with the annoying and angry voice You were intoxicated 2 days ago Definitely not 4 stars hotel , The day shift staffs at reception breakfast and housekeepers were great Location was perfect Near tube station 
123706,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Acoustics of the room were shocking could hear next door and upstairs which woke us up many times at night Plenty of banging all around , Location was great close to the tube which allowed us to get anywhere with ease 
123707,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, but to get an omlette we had to pay 8 more i thought that was outrageous and the heater did not work most of the time , i really liked the location just 2 min walk from the underground friendly staff
123708,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast was poor for the overall standard Only bread as a type of pastry plus few commercial cereals And the waiting staff started taking away food and drinks from the shelves 15 10 min before the end A bit disappointing Also the lift was not working ok Scary , Excellent location great customer service and really clean Great care of the interior style And having the balcony is a priceless experience in London 
123709,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I LIKED EVERYTHING, I have stayed here 4 times and am booking a 5th time in March This is a quality operation I stayed in the apt and it s great Great t location 2 min from Earls Court Station
123710,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room wasn t the biggest but with only stopping for one night wasn t an issue, Excellent cleanliness of the hotel Great location as only 2 min walk from earls court station Hotel staff very polite
123711,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There were very bright lights flashing on a smoke alarm in the room which was annoying at night It would be great if the lights were covered up or the alarm replaced with a different one , Lovely continental breakfast nice bedroom and bathroom Great location Overall had a good stay 
123712,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, A bit dusty in places around the bed , Nice hotel in a good area of London Close to restaurants bars and the underground Good value for money as we got a genius deal 
123713,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The heat was too high forcing us to open the patio doors and use a fan There is a bath with only a shower attachment no faucets Running a bath takes ages It was a surprise to open the curtains in the and see several men smoking outside my room , The suite we stayed in was clean spacious and well presented For the price you would be hard pressed to find better value The staff were nice 
123714,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, When we first entered the room there was a sweeter folded on the bed Reception didn t apologise properly and instead said it was the cleaner s who probably forgot it They were doing refurbishments on the room next to us They were starting drilling and working from 8am One of the clean towels had a really ugly brown stain Breakfast was OK in taste but with really limited selection Walls are paper thin you can hear everyone and they can hear you The bed was noisy , Earl s Court station is less than 5 minutes away with access to both Piccadilly and District Circle lines Lots of restaurants and cafes are located near the hotel They had no issues with keeping our bags after check out other hotels in London do so or they may charge you a small fee Complimentary tea coffee was available and restock daily in the room The bathroom was quite spacy odd thing for London in my experience The room basic cheap one was a bit larger than what I expected Probably as big as Kensington Holiday s Inn s executive rooms 
123715,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Room quite small, Hotel was very well located barely 5 mins from Earls Court tube station hotel very well appointed good decor nice fluffy towels Excellent cooked breakfast 
123716,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Nothing to complain about , I originally was booked for a studio apartment but upon arrival I was upgraded to a 2bd apartment for free I even stayed 3 extra nights for a total of 7 nights because it was so nice They let me keep my upgraded room for the extra 3 nights at the original price The staff is helpful and knowledgeable The breakfast was enough for my needs they served a variety of breads rolls croissants cheeses meats fresh fruit Greek and flavored yogurts 3 types of cereals juices milk water coffee tea and jams The apartment was clean and HUGE Way more than what I needed it had 2bds 3 couches in the living room a fully functioning kitchen very nice tv washing machine and a bathroom The facilities are a bit worn but this is London You will be hard pressed to find a brand new apartment for this price anywhere The location was the best part it was a 3 minute walk to the Earl s Court Underground access to the District and Picadilly Lines 3 very nice grocery stores restaurants post office gym and so many more little shops and places to eat 
123717,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We did not like the way we had to enter our room through different doors and stairs as the hotel was actually two different buildings at one Breakfast was toooooo poor and really was no value for money Most of the times we preferred not to eat our breakfast at the hotel Also they had a different option for English breakfast with charge Consider that the first day we asked from the waitress for boiled eggs and she told us that the cost for 2 eggs would have been 3 5 while afterwards we saw that the cost per egg was 1 5 We have paid for an executive room and we had the boiler for hot water inside the room and it made noise during night Even though we had the boiler inside our room we had problem with hot water in the douche as not all the times we had hot water We could not open any windows to take some fresh air when we needed We had to get out of the hotel We had to close the door with the key even when we were inside as it was half broken and if we did not lock with a key the door would open on its own the floor made noise in every step , We liked the location of the hotel however this was not really nice till midnight as you could listen the metro The bathroom was really nice and generally the decoration of the room 
123718,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I had requested for a quiet room not facing the road or located next to the lift lobby I was given a room facing the road and right across from the main access door to the wing The room has an old latch window when it s shut you can still feel the cold air from outside seeping into the room and all the noise from the road outside It s a reasonable stay for one night , Great location Although the room was small it was clean 
123719,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No help fixing broken intercom in the apartment for a whole week , Perfect location for a week in London Lots of public transport links and decent restaurants nearby
123720,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Just two small concerns the bed was quite hard I travel a lot and this wasn t a firm mattress it was hard My wife likened it to sleeping on a board Secondly bit cramped in the dining room we stayed on a weekday I can imagine at the weekend it would be even more crowded Also a cooked breakfast is available for an extra cost something we would have gone for if we were made aware of it We were halfway through our continental breakfast before we found out that this option was available, Location good for West End as Earls Court Tube Station is very close Hotel very clean staff helpful We stayed in an executive double room which was a good size with a modern bathroom Although our room was at the front road noise etc from outside the building was not too noticeable 
123721,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Rooms are a little bit small but if you spend most of day outside the hotel then it is not a big problem , Very riendly staff excellent location just in couple steps from Earl s Court station 
123722,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I didn t like how they told me on the day I was arriving that I owed them more money for the accommodations I had booked We booked a superior 1 bedroom apartment for 2 adults 2 children months in advance I even sent them a note asking for 2 separate twin beds for the kids It was not until I contacted them via email to let them know our flight was delayed did they inform me that I owe them an additional 20 pounds day for the additional child At that point in time I had no choice but to pay it as it was too late to find alternative accommodations In my opinion this was very sneaky and unfortunately it left me with a very negative feeling If you check the booking site it clearly shows the apartment can accommodate 2 adults 2 children , Whatever I had that was nice to say has been overshadowed by their sneaky rip off tactics 
123723,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, We stayed one week in a very nice apartment in the upper floor next door to the hotel The apartment was clean and the continental breakfast was sufficient with enough assortments 
123724,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Comfortable bed and best night sleep I ve had when staying over in London Hotel rooms are modern and clean with nice bathrooms I have stayed in many similar priced hotels in Earls Court and this one is the best It is now my regular for my one night a week stopover in London 
123725,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room we paid extra to have a larger room with a four poster bed The pictures of this type of room were lovely with drapes on the bed posts I was expecting lots of oohs and ahs but in fact the room was tiny and the four poster bed was just bits of wood awkwardly sticking in the air at each corner Also the breakfast could have been better quality but for the price paid it wasn t bad , Hotel is in a great location only a few minutes from Earl s Court tube station The staff were friendly and accommodating and the bed was comfy Free Wi Fi too 
123726,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Very creaky bed even the floor made noise when you walked on it We were above the reception and on both nights we stayed I was woken by the night staff either shouting or singing Our room was on the first floor by the lift were the housekeeper left her equipment throughout the morning this meant each time she returned to gather further supplies she was right outside our door The toilet and shower area was very small however it was kept very clean We were booked in for 3 nights but returned home after two , Reasonable price for the area and hotel based on London prices Room kept clean 
123727,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast every morning was not a pleasant experience the room was very small and very hot even in winter staff were reluctant to open the second room unless really pressed with guests the girls working at breakfast could do with a few lessons in manners as they made being at breakfast quite unpleasant A smile doesn t cost anything The lift could also do with an upgrade as it was slow and tedious to move luggage , Great location comfortable rooms although on the small side
123728,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Once at th ebreakfast it had no orangejuice and the room was small , Near the trainstation earls court top connections to the city center clean room friendly personal breakfast was fine Recommended for stays up to 5 days We were very satisfied 
123729,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Went down to have breakfast at 9 and there was a queue of about 20 people ending up leaving and eating elsewhere, Suite was Amazing more than expected for the price paid
123730,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Great for an overnight theatre trip Hotel close to tube station then short ride to west end Luxury double was fine and OK for size Regular double might be a tad small Did for us tho and spot on for the price Have paid treble for smaller rooms in London before 
123731,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room was noisy due to the tube next to it and no double glazing The staff was not particularly friendly There seem to be very stressed , The room was spacious comfortable and clean Close to Earl s Court tube station
123732,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The Continental breakfast was lovely and would have been even nicer with a boiled egg , Loved our room from the online photo then received an even nicer upgrade to an apartment on arrival the kitchen was nicer than my own flat They actually provided a kettle plus coffee and tea and milk Great central location to theater district Borough St Market high street shopping and everything Thames River Local restaurants also good and well priced Multilingual staff was very helpful and made us feel welcome Would definitely stay here again and heartily recommend 
123733,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast staff were rude and made our stay feel rushed and stressed Disappointed as the management are lovely and welcoming, Good hotel with nice facility and nice owners
123734,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, So we got to the hotel and found the room is not at all like the pictures they provides We found out the room is very dirty and the bed cannot fit my legs and we complain about it to the receptionist and her response was you can cut them , None
123735,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Poor ironing boards Some finishes are a bit tired but for the price this is not important e g Shower bath tap cover broken but still worked fine , friendly staff and comfortable bed spacious bathroom not much noise great location for tube
123736,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I can t find one thing It was perfect for our two day visit to London, We had a lovely room in the basement with a little outside area Clean tidy well decorated and although we were awoken early which was fine we slept well The breakfast room is in the basement and people arrive early 
123737,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Only very very slight gripe the breakfast room is really small with the tables being very close together , Gorgeous studio apartment really lovely location and staff very pleasant Extremely clean and tidy Really close to Earl s Court tube station 
123738,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Quite a lot Staff seem fairly incompetent although pleasant Messed up our booking and then stuck us in the basement in an extremely noisy room with no air conditioning The bed was two beds pushed together with a sheet over to conceal that this was the case Extremely small bathroom and I was showed that the room had an outdoor area underground which was disgusting Also don t be fooled by the parking Seriously don t go here really tarnished a nice getaway , Location was very good
123739,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We didn t realise the apartment was up so many flights of stairs with a couple of people in their 60 s in our group it was difficult for them and took a long time to get to the apartment , The apartment was excellent for what we needed their was lots of space it was clean comfortable and quiet We bought our own food in to have a meal in the evening which was great after a day of site seeing around London 
123740,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We didn t like the small room with a four poster bed No fridge but for the price and location you can t expect great luxuries, Great location 
123741,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I asked to move and preferably to a room with bath The new room had a bath but no TAPS So I couldn t use it , Location is great but the hotel is generally very noisy there are no carpets in the rooms or in the room hallways so the echo from people coming and going is emphasised The basement level has a lot of noise also from the underground system 
123742,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, We made our booking last minute on booking com When we arrived at the hotel they assigned us a room in the back of the building in the basement It didn t look anything like the pictures shown on the website That it was small was no problem for us we are familiar with the size of London hotel rooms however the dirt we didn t expect The window was blocked by a vacuum cleaner on the outside There was no fresh air in the room On top of the radiator which the bed was pushed against and was about 5 cm away from the pillows there was a thick layer of dust it obviously hadn t been cleaned in ages When we came up to reception to complain the staff was very rude and would not help us at all unless we paid 40 pounds extra for another room type and on top of that we would have to move rooms during our stay This was completely unacceptable to us since the room was dirty We decided we wanted to leave the hotel since the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable by the treatment from the staff The hotel then informed us that they would only refund 50 of our 3 day stay We only were inside the room for 15 minutes We didn t use or touch anything they could easily resell the room to another victim if they wanted to This room is more like a storage space then a hotel room they should be forbidden to sell it at such a price at all Any normal service providing hotel would let their guests leave if they are this unhappy with the room and refund them the entire amount We travel a lot for work and never had such an awful experience in any hotel around the world Besides the room being dirty the staff is very rude and unprofessional they ve never heard of customer service Instead of trying to resolve the situation at one point the lady at reception told us you are so stupid and stop talking and walked away to the other room ,No Positive
123743,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Smoke alarm came off all night Couldn t sleep well it wasn t the hotels fault it was a guest fault I believe , Location was great Next to earls court train station and restaurants 
123744,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Found the room to be very disappointing The room was nothing like the pictures and for what we paid I don t feel it was worth it , Great location Staff on reception were lovely but staff at breakfast were quite cold 
123745,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I didn t like that it was no fridge available in the room I didn t like that the full english breakfast was not included in the breakfast but you had to pay extra My bedsheets had holes but i ask them to change them and they did , The hotel is 2 min away from earls court station I liked the decor of my room The heating it was on and the shower facilities excellent Staff were polite Excellent stay 
123746,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, COLD the temperature in the room was very low and there was no way to increase it the fire alarm that started ringing around 1 am was turned off after 20 min but in the morning it started ringing again The shower did not work very well , great location the building in which the apartment is situated is very nice kitchen well equipped the room was clean bigger apartment than I have expected helpful staff 
123747,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Need to sort out the fire alarm as having to evacuate young child twice late in the evening spoilt what could have been a comfortable stay Breakfast area cramped and smells awful Rest of place good it has good potential going to waste in details not attended to 
123748,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Access to the rooms were with a tiny lift that was very slow and the corridors were narrow and confusing, Good location with easy access to all public transport
123749,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, every thing is horrible, they charge high price but gave me dark dirty basement room with our window when I report the reply was very unreasonable and not polite not helpful they sound not claim 4 stars only look good is reception horrible experience I worry they take my money as they keep my credit card data 
123750,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I booked through a company card and although money was taken I was told on arrival that i needed the card and ID of company which i didn t have and caused frustration The apartment was OK off site and in basement The bathroom smelt bad damp stale foul smelling Would not chose again would recommend the superior double bedroom to anyone over apartment , This was my second visit to the hotel Both times the beds and pillows have been AMAZING Bathroom are great except smell in apartment Breakfast is average but fine Great location and quiet street 
123751,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast was very weak As the hotel is close to the tube station it is easy to hear the trains If you get disturbed about that you better stay away from the basement , Location cleanliness staff all were positive I have stayed at the basement but room was good Wi fi was decent even in my room I stayed only at nights so dont know daytime experience 
123752,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Bathroom had some clear glass as well as some frosted glass which made it visible to others in the room A bit awkward , Good location Nice decor Comfortable Good breakfast 
123753,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There was virtually no hot water The staircase was a bit long but manageable , The location was excellent right next to Earl s Court station and the studio was a huge space with two bedrooms and a huge sitting room and kitchen 
123754,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast room was very small and crowded Limited choice you re better off getting breakfast somewhere else Staff was not very friendly and more busy with chatting among themselves than providing good customer service Small TV and very small shower Luckily we are both not tall or wide but if you are good luck , Great location in a quiet street Just around the corner is Earl s Court Underground and a busy street with lots of shops and restaurant Twin room on 2nd floor had a nice design We paid approx 55 euros per person per night for a twin room which is really cheap for London If we paid more we would have not been happy For what we paid we were content 
123755,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The apartment was on the 4th floor and no lift but this was made clear at the time of booking and a porter was on hand to help with our luggage if needed , We appreciated the friendly and efficient staff We stayed in an apartment attached to the hotel and were very impressed with all the extra facilities included we would definately stay here again 
123756,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The apartment has no direct communication with the main hotel 2 blocks away and we had a couple of problems in communicating The breakfast is a little dull and the meats are low level , We stayed on an apartment with lot of space The location sis very good close to the subway and to many attractions 
123757,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Everything about the hotel was small and claustrophobic From the stairway to the lift to the room the feeling of Breakfast was also bland and not worth the money , Hotel was quite close to Earls Court train station Also many grocery and eateries closeby 
123758,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, This hotel is in a great location very close to the tube station We also requested a room change and staff were extremely helpful in accomodating for us The breakfast was also delicious
123759,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, Construction in the building and wasn t informed They should have offered a discount Too far from reception Alarm sounded response was considerable Traffic noise not great Good to have a kitchen but didn t need it for short stay Bed on wheels not ideal 
123760,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room next door was extremely loud they might as well have been sat in my room They were loud till 2am so no sleep and there s no sound proofing in the rooms I booked 2 rooms a standard one for my son and an executive room The rooms were both very small Could do with some rules on keeping the noise down after a certain time at night and also maybe a bar area downstairs that s open in the evening to encourage people to have a little drink down in the bar rather than in their rooms , The staff were friendly Close to all amenities in Earls Court Close to tube station Breakfast was adequate Good for a quick over night stay 
123761,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I can hear the train from my room couldn t sleep Room and bathroom are extremely ridiculously small Breakfast is so bad only toast and cereals and the drinks and coffee tasted awful Extremely NOT worth the price, Location is great It is 2 minutes walk to Earl s Court Station and there are lots of good restaurants around 
123762,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I liked everything I m very fussy but could not fault this place The staff at reception were also exceptionally friendly and helpful, Great location I had one bed apt very comfortable will defiantly book in future 
123763,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The breakfast room was a little cramped which made it somewhat uncomfortable and the cost of our stay was a bit more than we expected to pay , The location was perfect being close to the tube the staff were extremely helpful and the room was both clean and comfortable We have stayed there before so we knew what to expect 
123764,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The single room I had was very small and you could hear the trains and announcements but that s to be expected as it is very close to Earl s Court station platform , Good location nice helpful staff lovely clean and pretty hotel The bed was comfortable and the the shower was hot 
123765,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, I wasn t very happy about having the boiler 3 feet away from me while I slept as it would come on and wake us up, Very friendly staff amazingly comfy bed and shower was the cher ry on top
123766,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, No power point near a mirror for hairdryer Could have done with coffee mugs as well as tea cups No other complaints , Great location Very handy for tube M S food very close by Kitchen well equipped Bed very comfy Apartment very clean 
123767,Mayflower Hotel Apartments,No Negative, The apartment was very spacious compared to others ive stayed in London Excellent location 2 minute walk from Earl s Court tube and less than 10 minute walk from huge tesco Excellent value for money and spotlessly clean 
123768,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The rooms are exceeding small and not suitable for 2 pax staying In terms of value for money the room rates are priced too high owing to its location and not competitive , The hotel is a stone throw away from the underground station Splendid The breakfast is simple but food is fresh Good There are restaurants and dining options nearby Hotel can let you store luggage there for a couple of days at reasonable rates 
123769,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Stayed in b5 next to the breakfast hall so from 5am onwards constant noise could hear everyone going for breakfast doors slamming noise from neighbours didn t have any sleep at all Also heating came on and off all night so again restless sleep and then woke up with a sore throat Reception did not ask me how my stay was the following morning so felt I could not provide feedback , Lovely smell when you walk into the hotel welcoming staff comfy bed 
123770,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast was very average for a hotel which claims to be a 4 stars Staff was quite cold , Bed very comfortable room was very quiet despite being close to the tube station and location very convenient 
123771,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, the reception is in different building there is no phone in the room to contact the room service or the reception of the hotel, large space apartment private garden in general private place near to bus and metro stations safe location delicious breakfast
123772,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, When I checked in the staff who working that day she is very helpful but when I checked out the staff who s on duty that morning he is not helping and don t care at all, The location is convenience and the apartment is very clean
123773,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There was work being done to the apartment next to us outside and it was very noisy early morning making it hard to sleep especially as we had come away for a break as a treat , Whole apartment had just been done which was brilliant Also the lady who checked us in was very helpful and polite 
123774,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Rooms too small Hallway Lift not easy to move luggage around No air conditioning fans are inadequate in summer , The location is excellent for accessing London etc Staff friendly and helpful 
123775,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The rooms are incredibly small very different from what one sees in the photos on the website There was also a noisy boiler in my room which went on and off the whole night and I could barely sleep , Nothing much really 
123776,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, listed as a 4 star on bookings com and this is misleading looking at other review sites this is rated as 2 5 star by customers Issues are too many to mention pics on the website is not a reflection of the majority of their rooms Very small rooms beds not good Safes not practical management have excuses for everything, nothing
123777,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The floor is creeking as you walk Using the water in the toilet creates strange noises The elevator shakes , The location is just perfect 
123778,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, 1 The room did NOT correspond at all to the pictures advertised on the website nor did it comply with the basic standards of a room of that category The mattress was broken The available space for walking storing luggage was minimal say extremely limited making it nearly impossible to reach the bathroom without stumbling on something Bed crammed in a box only one side was accessible 2 The level of noise early morning activities made it impossible to benefit from a good night s sleep Laundry washing machine next door washing machine was leaning on the window activated early in the morning around 8 AM during the weekend unacceptable Noises and banging doors from the nearby breakfast room started as early as 7 AM again unacceptable , Location room was clean bathroom and toiletries were the only plus 
123779,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Not really a bad experience but in the apartment it was a bit dated But still clean and comfortable , I stayed in the apartments and in a small room Both were clean and well kept The staff was very accommodating 
123780,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The room executive king was tiny no place to put our luggage Luckily we were staying 4 nights so we unpacked and placed our belongings on the shelves of the closet The room was very hot it would be fine when we retired for the night and about 2 3 am it would zoom to 85 degrees for no apparent reason the radiators were not on Bed was a bit hard , This hotel is very close to the Earl s Court tube station which is one of the few on the west side that has a lift The hotel also has a lift The staff here are excellent The room was very clean The room was very quiet 
123781,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Even though the booking com website stated that the room had 2 beds upon arrival we were told that was only a preference not a certainty , Great location right next to Earl s court location Very spacious apartment considering the size of London s accommodation The apartment is offsite to the main hotel but you still got all the great features of the hotel but without the noise factor 
123782,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, The tiny bed creaked every time I turned over The staff contradicted one another over the car parking facilities rules and regulations A drunk man took me to park my car The receptionist was brash, The location
123783,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, There is no elevator to this apartment we had to climb 72 steps to the apartment with heavy luggage stay away from the 4th floor, The Apartment was comfortable
123784,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, Breakfast basic but was ok you could upgrade to english breakfast i think for 9, staff were nice looked after our bags after checkout we even had a little terrace from our rooms very central and close tubes

123787,Mayflower Hotel Apartments, the hairdryer was wired into the socket and had a short lead next to the bed near the floor so it couldn t be moved and was no where near the mirror which was on the wardrobe door on the other side of the room making it virtually impossible to use the hairdryer effectively i had to kneel on the floor by the side of the bed in the corner of the room to use the hairdryer and prop a small mirror that i d brought with me up against the lamp on the bedside table so i could see what i was doing the free wifi didn t work with my phone there was a cracked floor tile in the kitchen area which was dangerously sharp the water from the shower wasn t very powerful which made it difficult to wash properly , the bed was comfortable the shower cubicle was huge the air conditioning unit was a wonderful addition to the room the hairdryer was a decent size and of good power
