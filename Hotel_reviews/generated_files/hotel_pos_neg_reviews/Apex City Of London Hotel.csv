387956,Apex City Of London Hotel, Two front desk staff gave us uninformed info re travel to Gatwick from the hotel It was 1 5 hours and 180 pounds They estimate 1 hour and 90 pounds , Great location great service great room great food 
387957,Apex City Of London Hotel, Although bathroom was lovely shower could have been cleaner seal around edges very dirty Breakfast too expensive , Staff were courteous and helpful especially Katya on reception Rooms were lovely and spacious and had all we needed Bath was huge and really relaxing 
387958,Apex City Of London Hotel, Bigger choice of pillows Reception generally very friendly but check in not handled well, Good size room well soundproofed Modern finishes big shower Kettle in room
387959,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Hotel staff were extremely friendly Rooms and hotel were extremely clean room was spacious and very comfortable and we were excellently situate for our trip We were recommended to you by Middle Temple as my accommodation there was unavailable and we are very glad that the Inn recommended this alternative
387960,Apex City Of London Hotel, Construction work made it less welcoming The breakfast room looked temporary un un inviting It was essentially a very expensive basic hotel , Location was ideal for where we were visiting 
387961,Apex City Of London Hotel, Renovation underway so dining room closed Breakfast buffet pricey , Coffee maker with free biscuits tea hot cocoa and coffee Comfy beds and linens Nice bathroom with tub and separate large shower 
387962,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Amazing customer service I booked the most basic room for my boyfriend s birthday and when checking in they upgraded us so our room included a large private balcony The room was very clean and they were very accommodating with my pre stay requests Room service is really pricey but the food drinks are great Hotel bar is open late The location is very central London in walking distance of great landmarks Really enjoyed our stay Highly recommend 
387963,Apex City Of London Hotel, Pillows were very soft I guess we are too used to our latex pillows at home , Junior Suite upgrade Incredible room and size pillows were a bit annoying to sleep though Great place in Lomdon
387964,Apex City Of London Hotel, 1 Hotel screwed up upon check in of our two rooms which were reserved on same floor in close proximity when we signed in upon check in One room was not yet ready and when we returned in the evening this room was given to someone else 2 Heavy renovation is ongoing about which we were not informed upfront Breakfast was served in some hallway and in meeting rooms and the kitchen struggled on day 1 to produce 2 fried eggs within 30 despite the fact that there were not so many guests at breakfast Day 2 was better day 3 we skipped , Beds are ok Hotel screwed up on a few things and offered complimentary breakfast on two days for our family 5 people 
387965,Apex City Of London Hotel, Nothing really breakfasts were a little pricey but it was London, Staff were excellent as always moved us to a better upgrade room which was much better and we thourghly enjoyed our stay
387966,Apex City Of London Hotel, There are about 7 balconies in a row with a view of Tower Bridge but they need some true privacy dividers rather then just the planter that currently keeps them separate It was awkward when guests on either side were either out in their robes or when they were smoking Also the way out to the balcony is a large door sized window Unfortunately we had to keep it open in order to hear our son and be sure he was sleeping the wind caught the window a lot and since there s no way to secure it my husband got nailed with it in the arm several times A little resistance added to the window that s usable from the outside would be great , Our Deluxe king room with balcony 716 was a tight fit for the portable crib for our son but otherwise a wonderful room The staff multiple times told us that milk for our son was complimentary and to just ask We also had great help with getting our luggage to and from the room The location is right next to the entrance to the Tower of London and Tower bridge is just a short 5 8 minute walk down along the river Thames There s also a Tesco only a short distance away for grocery basics There hotel is undergoing construction but the noise wasn t an issue in our room Finding the hotel seemed to be a challenge for some Uber drivers and the airport service due to a left lane closure that forced drivers around the block 
387967,Apex City Of London Hotel, The staff were indifferent and could not answer some of our basic travel needs I expected more from them , The hotel was in a quiet location The bed was very comfortable and the shower was excellent
387968,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, We arrived at the hotel at 8 30am after an early flight and were delighted that a room was available and we could check in immediately The reception staff were cheerfull and helpful as was the doorman Our room 414 was very spacious with a sofa and coffee table Large walk in shower in the en suite and a large bath 
387969,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Friendly staff quit and good located hotel near london tower excellent room service and good restaurants nearby For breakfast we recommand pret manger near London Tower Terrace and good breakfast fresh juice m sli croissant cappuccino fruit for 10 per person 
387970,Apex City Of London Hotel, The concierge told me the Tower Hill tube was closed causing me to walk out of my way to another station I found out it was in fact not closed and lost an hour of my day visiting attractions A Concierge should strive for accuracy this was very disappointing for me and spoiled my day and view of location , For the price the room was lovely and comfortable air conditioning was cold and water pressure great Quiet 
387971,Apex City Of London Hotel, I had to be picky to find fault They had great blackout curtains but the glass door to the bathroom let in light To pull down the blind in the bathroom necessitated climbing in the bath unless I was missing something The bed was on small legs so I think things could roll under Maybe why I found a crisp package not ours underneath Missed by cleaners This is not a con for us but be warned there is not much in the area at night or weekends if you like buzz , Great bed and pillows Separate bath and shower Although it was the basic room it was large enough for us and huge suitcases and had all the amenities of a more superior room It wasn t necessary to upgrade to get all the mod cons Good quiet area Hotel staff very helpful with great suggestions for restaurants We had a wonderful breakfast at their suggestion overlooking the Thames and Tower Marc was especially charming I don t know what the views are elsewhere but LOVED mine We overlooked St Olaves Church A tiny place but Samuel Pepys is buried there I am a history lover so was thrilled There is a small garden between the hotel and the church to which we took our morning coffee and admired the plants and old stones Depending on what you want to do it is an amazing location Just a minutes walk from the Train station underground station and Tower of London Just by the Tower is the ticket office to go up and down the river by boat Just like taking the bus but on the water We took the boat to Shakespeare s Globe and then walked back down the South Bank past all the buskers to Borough Market which has AMAZING food stalls 
387972,Apex City Of London Hotel, The bed was a little too hard for my liking , Staff were wonderful We were welcomed and staff couldn t do enough to make our stay special Loved the wet room shower very stylish and good control over it 
387973,Apex City Of London Hotel, Wouldn t pay twenty quid for breakfast especially as you can walk a few yards down the road and get a very tasty full English at All Bar One for seven pound fifty, Excellent hotel would highly recommend it
387974,Apex City Of London Hotel, Disappointed that we were not told that the restaurant and bar were closed for refurbishment prior to booking Only reason for mark down on facilities As will all hotels these days breakfast is way over priced , Location was 5mins from London tower Breakfast served hot food fresh none of that buffet rubbish Staff very helpful and friendly Similar to 5 star service 
387975,Apex City Of London Hotel, I honestly can t think of a single thing, The location is excellent just 5 minutes walk from the Tower of London Underground and DLR stations The staff are friendly and very helpful for example they arrange a taxi back from a late show for us at very short notice The hotel itself has a clean modern look with comfortable rooms that match the photos The rubber duck in the bathroom and chocolates in the room on arrival were a nice touch
387976,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Amazing place right by the Tower Bridge and Tower of London Lots of local pubs around for entertainment as well as great food Very close to Tower Hill metro station so can get to any part of the city needed in under half an hour The staff was probably the best part everyone smiled and told you good morning They were super helpful when we needed to find something and our room was one of the nicer ones I ve stayed in Do yourself a favor and book this place if there is a room available

387979,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Location was perfect the room was very tiny and no light in the room as the small window was on a courtyard For the rest it is clean and bed was good

387981,Apex City Of London Hotel, Breakfast deal too expensive to bother though lots of more reasonable options nearby, Very comfortable bed big towels super friendly helpful staff
387982,Apex City Of London Hotel, when we checked in we were told that as we had paid for the hotel and everything already we would have to pay for anything we had drinks etc there straight away so we didn t bother going to the bar as we felt a bit awkward it would have been nice to just add it on another tab if we had wanted , we liked the location also it was very quiet on night so we slept well just thought the price of the hotel was quite expensive and it didn t include a breakfast but I guess thats London for you We asked for a nice view on the e mail request box but the person at the check in desk had us down for a high floor request very amusing lovely time there though 
387983,Apex City Of London Hotel, They had an overbooking problem and during the British Airways System autage the rooms were double booked I wonder why , We had an overbooking problem and the cocierge helped us to get a new hotel They were lovely and caring Many thanks again

387987,Apex City Of London Hotel, I had stayed in October 2016 with a friend and the room was amazing i was slightly disappointed with the room this time when i had my husband with me The room was a lot smaller and the bathroom was a bit cramped i may not have noticed this if i had not stayed in october , The staff found out the reason for our visit and sent us chocolates 
387988,Apex City Of London Hotel,No Negative, Can t fault this hotel Just a few minutes walk from Tower Hill tube station in a quiet clean street just around the corner from the Tower of London Gorgeous spacious room which was sparkling Cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in Really quiet Staff lovely So happy with our stay here just wish we were there for longer to appreciate it more

387995,Apex City Of London Hotel, The establishment seems to have an old wing and a new one While the price is the same the rooms are not of the same size and comfort We had to ask to change the rooms which the receptionist gladly helped us with the pillows are not that comfortable too soft and the shower ventilation was full of dust and didn t seem to work properly anymore Other than these few details our stay was great , I liked the personal attention of the staff to the guests The receptionists were very helpful even when we had to change rooms and solution oriented the room was refreshed daily including bed linen and sheets amenities restocked on a daily basis quiet rooms with good lighting and equipment and the location of the establishment is ideal close to main attractions business offices and public transportation 
387996,Apex City Of London Hotel, hotel has been under renovation for about months and although they have made every effort to camouflage the areas under construction its a bit annoying and price of rooms aren t any cheaper due to the construction , staff was extremely helpful and quality of food at dinner was a nice surprise

388009,Apex City Of London Hotel, I ve been offered basement room at first No window just a small opening on the ceiling which lets no light in Smells terribly noisy air conditioning klostrophobic These rooms shouldn t be used as guest rooms considering the 250GBP per night price tag Good thing is that the Night Manager was able to accommodate me in another room which was the last available room and way decent then the basement one I m afraid I may not choice this hotel again just because of the risk I may be given the basement room and without an option to change it next time , The bed was big and very comfortable Cleaning is very good Sky TV is a nice bonus Staff is attentive and caring Location is very good for the people who has business in the City area

388086,Apex City Of London Hotel, The staff of the restaurant is bad as there is no system in place it seems for taking orders and serving the meals My dinner was served too cold and I had to send it back When it finally came back my girlfriend finished hers and my side dishes were not reheated they had forgotten this even though they took it to reheat so I had to eat alone The breakfast the morning after had pieces of PLASTIC IN THE FOOD and again my girlfriend and I were therefore eating apart from each other Something is really off in this restaurant Even though we got a 1000 apologies this experience really spoiled it for us and we would not go back to the Apex hotels again as it seems to be a trend in not being able to deliver a good experience Plenty of hotels in London which can do better , Location and rooms are just nice We had a room on the eighth floor which was very spacious and the bed was good The room was clean We had some issues with the restaurant which were dealt with in a proper way by the front desk staff even though our experience was spoiled for our special occasion

388093,Apex City Of London Hotel, We splashed out on a pretty expensive hotel but found that in one of the rooms the air con was not working properly and tv was not working properly either That s poor for a 200 a night hotel , Location of hotel was very good for our visit as we had planned a trip to the tower of london
388094,Apex City Of London Hotel, The breakfast tea was awful and I mean really awful The one thing I wanted after a long journey was a decent cuppa and it wasn t They were extremely tight with the amount of tea sugar and milk considering we were staying for 2 almost 3 day s ended up buying my own milk The snacks could of been better too for the amount of money we paid for the room 1 packet of biscuits with 3 small biscuits inside 1 packet of jellybeans and a small pot of crisps none of which i eat The fridge was completely empty , I liked the fact that we could smoke out on the balcony 
388095,Apex City Of London Hotel, We only had breakfast no other meals but the food quality was awful and overpriced The pancakes were dry the crispy American style bacon was not in the slightest bit crispy and the substitution for parts of the full English breakfast didn t even come We also had to ask twice again for the toast we had ordered Definitely not worth the high price and although we would definitely stay here again we d go for breakfast somewhere else , The room bed etc was comfortable clean and temp was easily adapted to suit The water pressure made for a very powerful shower There s nothing worse than a trickle of a shower in a hotel Also we were given a free upgrade to a superior suite which was lovely

388097,Apex City Of London Hotel, Our son had an accident as small kids sometimes do an peed the bed overnight The hotel was prepared with a barrier sheet installed but they put the dirty sheets back on the bed after we stripped them off In the end I think it was a communication problem and it was promptly and courteously resolved They also took advantage of our request for extending our stay by offering a significantly higher rate However they did reduce the cost and I am confident all other hotels in the popular area would do the same , The location is excellent and the family room is perfect for a family with one or two small children The entire hotel feels above average We actually extended our stay unexpectedly because the experience overall was so much better than staying at the Hilton G Inn near the airport We did

388117,Apex City Of London Hotel, Pillows were awful and so soft the kids and our heads fell right through to the bed underneath Some staff were good but I found a couple of them to be very alouf rather than happy and helpful A smile goes a long way and some of the staff mainly the male ones to the honest could do with a slap with a happy stick The room whilst on the top floor was incredibly noisy you could hear every single drunk person early hours of the morning as though they were in our room And the smashing of bottles from the bins being loaded from various pubs and hotels around was so loud it woke us all at midnight and the early hours of the morning Also a lot of construction going on around the hotel so if you want complete peace this is not the place they really needed to double glaze the windows and the seals better for an inner city hotel , Great location and kids bed was perfect in the room unusual for the standard small city hotel rooms the rooms were a great size They even gave them rubber ducks on arrival on their bed super super cute and made them feel a part of the experience too Fantastic bathrooms

388121,Apex City Of London Hotel, The only thing that made this experience short from perfect was when I had to pay a 25 night deposit despite clearly stating no deposit was required on my booking I d suggest that the Apex establishment should review bookings and stick to agreements they ve made with customers , The staff were very friendly and helpful rooms are spacious and with plenty of access to natural light big window clean rooms amenities are made available and renewed daily clean bathroom and the location is unbeatable

388329,Apex City Of London Hotel, My son is allergic to nuts Staff were very helpful finding safe bread for him However the hotel policy itself seemed more concerned with issuing disclaimers we cannot guarantee anything any of the food might have been in contact with nuts than with practical constructive help for their allergic customers Basically an it s you problem approach , very clean quiet good location

388347,Apex City Of London Hotel, We were given a basement room despite requesting a room higher up with a view The room which while was comfortable clean spacious and quiet still felt very detached from the rest of the hotel Importantly there was a need to get a lift which was always busy just to get from reception to the basement one level There were no stairs which raised a question of evacuation in the event of a fire , The staff very friendly in a quite natural way rather than a corporate ubiquitous friendly of many London hotels 
388348,Apex City Of London Hotel, Bathrooms are horrendous Absolutely filthy Grime and dirt just disgusting We had a deluxe room with a patio with a partial view of Tower Bridge and I didn t see anything deluxe about the room I will not return nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone , Location is pretty close to a tube station

388353,Apex City Of London Hotel, The hotel is like a maze of stairs and lifts no really friendly for carrying bags the AC in the room made impossible to sleep As is controled centrally have to keep standing up to turn it ofeagain and again thr noise was too much plus quite hot when off but windows don t open for the price o expected a bit more of comfort , The location
388354,Apex City Of London Hotel, We ate four times in the restaurant and literally every piece of meat we both had was overcooked Even the kippers A kipper is hot smoked and so already cooked It does not need to be grilled to within an inch of becoming a crisp in order to prepare it I did get the cost of my kipper deducted from my bill but I would have preferred a moist tasty kipper for my breakfast During our stay we also had the turkey escalope rib eye steak and Barnsley lamb chop all of these were seriously over cooked leaving them tough and dry The starters and deserts we tried were good but rather lacking in imagination with very little variety from the deserts In all what I am saying is that the hotel and its staff at front of house were good and very enjoyable but if we had stayed more than two nights I definitely would not have dinned in the restaurant again , The staff that we met were all very friendly helpful and professional These qualities always make a good hotel even better
