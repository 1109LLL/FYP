218428,Hazlitt s, the only thing would be an unto date TV and maybe tea and coffee facilities , rooms were traditional welcoming and cosy Felt you were in your own home 
218429,Hazlitt s, The price reflects that this hotel is something special but it has to be said that it is expensive , Friendly staff secluded feeling beautiful interior
218430,Hazlitt s, The property needs refreshing We appreciate it wants to retain its original features but that is no excuse for shabbiness Have stayed in similar period properties which have a luxurious feel and are well appointed Hazlitt s is not ,No Positive
218431,Hazlitt s, The very noisy drunks in the bars opposite No sleep until 2 to 3am Very bad side of location which is not sufficiently mentioned on the booking Especially if you have a street view room , Bacon sandwich in the morning breakfast in bed was amazing in comfortable old four poster bed 
218432,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Wonderful rooms with beautiful bathrooms All in taste like staying there in 1900 The owners did a great job It has so much caracter it could be a privat house you are staying in Not overdone just spot on job Check out the floors the house seems to be sinking in some areas So you aren t drunk if you walk a beeline 
218433,Hazlitt s, Very very noisy from laneway at the back of hotel fights and screaming both nights we were there, Lovely room with comfy bed good location for walking around london
218434,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The Staff was extremely accommodating My travel plans changed and I arrived two days early The web site said it was fully booked but when I contacted them directly a room was available From that moment on the service was just top notch My first room was extremely comfortable in the old English manor style and I can t say enough about the beds Super comfortable My second room was the Teresa Suite OMG was it fantastic I felt like the Lord of the Manor I could not have been happier with my choice of Hotel Close to everything 
218435,Hazlitt s, few non bread choices I asked for a substitution for the bagel with the salmon ie greens or fruit but it wasn t provided in the end No possibility to order an egg sandwich instead of a bacon sandwich would be nice if they contracted with a local place to offer a better breakfast or worked out an egg option But the place is so terrific otherwise I will definitely stay there again , they deliver your breakfast to your room Nice tea tray Presentation is very good 
218436,Hazlitt s, My only critique was that the street noise was intense at night but I was on the back side so I was grateful for that Also the mattresses are quite firm compared to what I am used to at home since most are antique beds there aren t box springs I slept fine but had to get used to it , The charm of this place along with the delightful staff make it hard to beat I design houses so the spirit of this former private residence speaks to my aesthetic sensibilities I have stayed in two types of rooms and I would recommend booking larger rooms if you want more space though both were charming The morning breakfast of smoked salmon and tea was a great start to the day I would say choose a room on the back side as the street while quiet by day is a bit loud at night due to the many pubs and theaters nearby 
218437,Hazlitt s, Sloping floors in our room and low pressure water from the handheld nozzle in the bathtub we had a lovely bath but difficult to have a quick wash, Beautiful atmosphere and unique design Attentive and friendly staff Lovely experience And four poster bed 
218438,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The hotel was perfect the staff were really nice and helpful The best location ever In walking distance from everything The breakfast was just right and eating in the special rooms library wardrobe or living room was lovely If I could give 100 stars I would 
218439,Hazlitt s,No Negative, This is comfortable welcoming and stylish It s a haven of peace in busy Soho Utterly timeless the service is excellent decor beautiful and in their small way this little chain of hotels put most others to shame 
218440,Hazlitt s, The street is quiet for the neighbourhood but Soho does have a nightlife If you are a light sleeper ask for a quiet room I slept just fine , My room was exceptional Quality breakfasts Excellent WIFI Thoughtful and attentive staff I loved the location and would book again in a moment I felt part of history and pampered I couldn t have enjoyed my stay more 
218441,Hazlitt s, Can get loud late night but knew that before booking , Location in the heart of SOHO very vert busy close to everything Clean quaint boutique British charm Everyone on the staff were very friendly and helpful 
218442,Hazlitt s, I feel for this type of hotel and cost complimentary tea coffee making facilities should have been made available in every room , The decor was superb The staff were very friendly and efficient The room and property was spotlessly clean The wifi was good and consistent The location was excellent 
218443,Hazlitt s, Room was a little small and the shower wasn t very powerful but that s honestly just being persnickety , Bed was superb Great night s sleep Staff were welcoming and friendly I usually hate the awkward small talk exchanges at the counter in hotels but these guys were pros and the ice was broken immediately We forgot a toothbrush and the reception had one brought up to us with a pot of tea in less than 10 minutes 
218444,Hazlitt s,No Negative, A warm welcome when we arrived It felt very private even though it s in the heart of Soho The room was stylish with a gorgeous old bathroom and the bed very comfortable Romantic and private 
218445,Hazlitt s, Plumbing could do with checking and maintaining out toilet flush stopped working , Very welcoming accommodation More like staying in someone s house than a hotel An antidote to the normal chains 
218446,Hazlitt s, in room No tea coffee making facilities in room No complimentary drinks Overpriced , Character building Good quiet convenient central location 
218447,Hazlitt s, The breakfast is quite pricey for quite a basic breakfast though it was all very tasty and nicely presented Would have liked a proper full length mirror in the room other than just the one located inside the wardrobe door which is built in to the alcove It wasn t really in a good position for me to be able to blow dry my hair comfortably Also could have done with a better lit mirror somewhere to do my makeup as had to lean over the sink which was quite awkward unless you are really tall , We stayed here for two nights in the Madam Kennedy room 1st floor celebrating our 30th anniversary It is a very special hotel steeped in history which we both loved The huge bed was really comfortable even though it was very high to get up on to I m 5 6 a shorter person would find it a big problem it had a firm mattress which was great as I suffer with a bad back The shower and bath were great very powerful shower over the bath Friendly helpful staff who were always on hand if needed We were offered complimentary tea coffee and beautiful tasty florentin biscuits when we arrived and were seated in the cosy lounge room very atmospheric as is the whole hotel Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to anyone who needs a great place to stay in this fab location 
218448,Hazlitt s, Not one thing to mention here , The building itself is incredible I felt like I was in a different world The staff were so friendly easy to talk to and very funny Can t wait to stay again 
218449,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The room was boutique cosy the bed was very comfy we slept better than we do at home very friendly staff amazing location we will definitely be going back
218450,Hazlitt s, I appreciated the double pane glass of the windows in my sleeping room but it would have been nice to have the same in the bathroom Frith Street and the bar across the street can become a bit noisy at night Shutting the door to the bath was a good solution but I found the air in the bath a bit too cool for my liking in the morning Not a particularly negative thing more of a suggestion to consider , From start to finish each person I had the opportunity of meeting at Hazlitt s was exceptionally friendly and helpful Even the workers that were doing a bit of remodeling during the day could not have been more polite I was allowed to check into my room a bit earlier than expected but while I waited for that confirmation I was treated to the most delicious cappuccino and biscuits I feel the necessity of mentioning my housekeeping maid Mary by name She was absolutely delightful to chat with and kept my room in an impeccable state Upon my checkout she was so thorough that before I had even left the property she had opened a drawer next to the bed and discovered that I had left one of my phones behind Scurrying downstairs she made sure I had it in my hands before my taxi even had time to arrive I couldn t be more grateful and I had the feeling from everyone else working at Hazlitt s that I would have received the exact courtesy no matter what my need The front desk staff in particular were absolutely lovely in every instance Particularly kind to my friends who had the good fortune to visit me at the hotel during my stay Everything about my recent stay exceeded my expectations and I will be sure to return Hopefully much more soon than later My most sincere thanks to all who were so friendly and welcoming 
218451,Hazlitt s, Nothing, Comfortable bed Excellent service Beautiful characterful hotel a little gem Location I loved the quirky bathroom with Victorian features and the sloping floors It was a real pleasure to stay in this hotel 
218452,Hazlitt s,No Negative, I often stay at the Hazlitt s and I m always happy with the great service and nice atmosphere The room was very comfortable in every way and the staff is very helpful I will certainly be staying here again 
218453,Hazlitt s, There were a couple of other peoples pubes in the bath tub the windows didn t mask the noise outside you couldn t lock yourself in to the room all the staff would need is a key to get in I heard someone trying to get into my room that is when I realised how insecure it was There was no breakfast room you would eat your breakfast in your room , The breakfast was brilliant food The staff were really accommodating The location was ideal for theatre visits The d cor was good 
218454,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Beautiful historic old hotel which feels like walking into a cosy home and has maintained all the original features Walking into the rooms it s like stepping back in time but with modern amenities They are very homely and comfortable The staff are all helpful and welcoming A gem in a modern and fast paced city 
218455,Hazlitt s, The price But in central London for the style and size of the room it s only to be expected No dearer than similar hotels , Roomier than expected and very comfortable Quiet too considering the location 
218456,Hazlitt s, All good, Great location lovely intimate atmosphere and real quirky boutique hotel definitely recommend to anyone visiting London and wanting to sample something different to the usual mainstream hotels
218457,Hazlitt s, Carpets curtains and book shelves certainly add to the charm but perhaps less suitable for those who suffer from allergies , Great location very friendly staff good wifi charming place Breakfast served in the room was punctual Quick check out 
218458,Hazlitt s, No tea coffee facilities in room Breakfast not included For price of stay would at least expect these things, Location was perfect Staff were friendly and efficient Place was very clean
218459,Hazlitt s, You can hear some noise from the street which is to be expected when staying in the middle of Soho , Very nice boutique hotel We had a top floor apartment with free kettle Friendly staff and we really appreciated the three sitting rooms where you can relax and read a book The honesty bar was also a find 
218460,Hazlitt s, The room was very small nowhere to hang your clothes the sink had taps that you couldn t put your hands under and the breakfast was over priced along with the room , The location was good and the room was clean 
218461,Hazlitt s, Oddly some of the lights couldn t be switched off in the suite This wasn t too much of a problem since they could be dimmed low or were hidden as cupboard lights It s a shame the place doesn t have a quiet bar it does have a self serving honesty bar Also the room looked over the back alley that led to some early morning noise from people leaving clubs , Remarkable ambiance in the suite and house itself Some fantastically indulgent fittings in our suite leant it an atmospheric and rare experience The location is superb Smack in the heart of Soho so it s within easy reach of all the restaurants pubs or swanky bars Front of house staff were wonderful too really helpful and friendly 
218462,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Great location They offer limited catering but I think that explains why the rooms are such good value We have now been 4 or 5 times and would always choose Hazlitt s for a luxury 1 night stay
218463,Hazlitt s,No Negative, I loved the style of the hotel really felt cosy and British in the heart of London The location of this hotel was amazing few minutes walk from Carnaby Street Piccadilly Circus Covent Garden and the closest tube station Leicester only 400 meters away 
218464,Hazlitt s, Unfortunately there was no stand up shower in our room could be easily remedied with a curtain around the bath tub and a hook for the shower mixer It did say on the website that not all rooms had a stand up shower so it was expected , The location of the hotel is brilliant just off soho square and very close to Shaftesbury avenue 3mins walk to the palace theatre The hotel is very cute loads of antique furniture Staff were lovely and it s very clean 
218465,Hazlitt s, The basement room had little daylight and no aspect it was almost claustrophic The over bath shower was problematic the in the round shower curtain and position of controls caused us to flood the floor with water unfortunately using the bath would have been easier Noises from the plumbing were also interesting The lack of an upstairs breakfast room was a pity as it would have been nice to have enjoyed some of the interiors however tea and coffee delivered to our room in the morning was nice and enjoyable , The location is exceptional with atmospheric interiors The bed was very comfortable with great linen but was a small double 
218466,Hazlitt s, I could have done with the facility of a a kettle in my room to make my own cup of tea , The room had character with the copper shower surround and wooden carved headboard 
218467,Hazlitt s, Not much Room was small but comfortable , Hotel with character in fantastic location Room was small but extremely comfortable Great for short stay in London would definitely stay again 
218468,Hazlitt s, Loved it just be aware that to reach the top floor you need to climb some stairs , Perfect location lovely old very charming hotel Slept in a single room on the top floor and felt being in a nice Charles Dickens story 
218469,Hazlitt s,No Negative, A beautiful hotel with fantastic period rooms full of character and charm The room was clean comfortable and met all our requirements Will definitely stay again 
218470,Hazlitt s, The hotel is very dated no lift elevator or onsite restaurant The room was either to hot or too cold when A C was activated the shower was quirky to use Could not use the electrical outlets to charge my cell phone despite having an appropriate wall plug adapter had to use the USB port on the TV which took forever Finally the cost per night 320 was excessive for this property , The location is ideal close to many pubs restaurants and the tube station as well 
218471,Hazlitt s, Air con was freezing but a member of staff helped to adjust it to a more comfortable level , Stayed mid August Great location in Soho Very Quiet but close enough to walk everywhere Quirky boutique type hotel Spacious room and large comfy bed Great walk in shower There is an elevator lift in this hotel contrary to other reviewers comments Small and quirky but an elevator all the same Great restaurants and bars close by and within walking distance of Picadilly Leicester Square China Town Covent Garden and West End Theatres 2 tube stations close by Would definitely stay again 
218472,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Quirky hotel with a friendly welcoming atmosphere Looks small from the outside but delightfully large inside like the tardis We thought our room was luxurious and surprisingly large but were astounded by the en suite Would definitely again and have already booked
218473,Hazlitt s, Nothing I can think of, Perfect in the middle of Soho Helpful friendly people and wonderful breakfast We have been there before and will definitely go there again 
218474,Hazlitt s, The facility is too old and the room is really tiny the shower in bath is not convenient to use , The location is perfect close to everything and the staff are very nice feel like home 
218475,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The location was excellent for walking to all the major attractions Lots of restaurants and bars close by Staff was very friendly and quite helpful The atmosphere and period of the hotel exceeded our expectations The accommodations were very comfortable The breakfast delivered to our room was the cherry on top Thanks to all 
218476,Hazlitt s, Can t think of anything , The staff bent over backwards to make everything convenient and smooth Loved 24 hour room service Location was perfect for getting on the underground and going to shows in the West End 
218477,Hazlitt s, A little more soundproofing on the room door But I only noticed people outside my door when they walked past to get to their own room The soundproofing between the walls of rooms was excellent , Being a boutique hotel The gorgeous plush unique rooms And fabulous service 
218478,Hazlitt s, Current problems with Crossrail working mean street closures and more traffic in Frith St than normal as it is one of the few streets out of Soho Square that is open , Very comfortable room in 18th century building in an excellent location Have been twice before 
218479,Hazlitt s, Rooms are very small with just enough room to squeeze past bed this was somewhat expected, I m a lover of older properties and found this old quirky building fantastic
218480,Hazlitt s, They booked us a black cab to the airport rather than with a firm so it was very over priced If they had told us it would be a black cab we would have made our own arrangements I m a Londoner and you know you never book black cabs for airport runs , The room was amazing so many little details Incredibly clean and well stocked bar We had dinner which was lovely Staff were helpful We felt at home as soon as we checked in Great location 
218481,Hazlitt s, Our greeting on arrival bordered on rude and not welcoming at all We hadn t realised until the night before we checked out that guests are normally given a tour on arrival so we were unaware of the lovely sitting room with wines drinks etc We enjoyed it on the last night of 5 nights thanks to the very helpful staff working that night , Location excellent to underground Westend show and to get around London Great cafes close by for breakfast Rooms quaint authentic In general most staff were nice The lady who went out of her way to look up overland train schedule for us represented Hazlitts beautifully 
218482,Hazlitt s, a handle on the wall by the bath tub will be much appreciated our room is a bit small, perfect location friendly staff fantastic bath tub antique style I love it 
218483,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The staff were friendly and very helpful The hotel and rooms were very cute and clean Location is brilliant however if you don t like to be in the midst of it i recommend you don t stay in Soho I honestly cant say anything negative about this place 
218484,Hazlitt s, Nothing , The staff were extremely helpful and were able to fulfill each request we had Each room was unique and we loved the quirkiness of the room and the hotel as a whole It was a fairly easy walk to many of the places we wanted to see located in a lively neighborhood Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance The hotel was secure Our room was small but well appointed If you like big and impersonal hotels this is not for you But if you prefer unique and personal we highly recommend 
218485,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Charm charm charm Warm welcome Tea tray brought to the room on arrival Public rooms for guests to entertain The bathtub and REN products Best pillows ever I ordered them when I got home Soho Square park at the corner Great neighborhood for restaurants 
218486,Hazlitt s, We have stayed at Hazlitt s many times but for the first time we had a problem getting a taxi on the last morning Staff were not good at advising us that the taxi wasn t going to turn up and we had to walk to a main road in the end almost missing our train I felt they should have advised us better , Always very clean always enjoy the peace and quiet of the hotel and access to good restaurants was the same as always Always enjoy staying here 
218487,Hazlitt s, The staff are less friendly than they used to be The room service costs are ridiculous given the vast array of eating options within a few paces from the hotel Hazlitts should bear this in mind particularly with respect to breakfast , D cor is lovely as always although after this my 7th or 8th visit I notice it is looking a little tired 
218488,Hazlitt s, Didn t realise you get get tea and coffee in your room maybe there should of been a card in room to let you know , Very friendly and helpful great location Comfortable 
218489,Hazlitt s, Nothing to dislike They are very old buildings with their own inherited construction materials This needs to be understood the floors will be uneven the ceilings low and there will be creaks , Everything a mixture of the old new atmospheric staff so very courteous and attentive 
218490,Hazlitt s, The only thing we mentioned was the curtains on the four poster bed it would have been nice if they stretched all the way to the end of the bed , Staff were lovely Bedroom was stunning Bed was very comfy
218491,Hazlitt s, The particular room I was in had air conditioning issues but when I mentioned it to them the next morning they seemed genuinely concerned , I love the character of this property
218492,Hazlitt s,No Negative, We have stayed at Hazlitt s for over 30 years It s not a hotel its a home The service is consistently outstanding and the location for the West End is superb 
218493,Hazlitt s, Very expensive for what it is Not even coffer making facilities in room Tap in bathroom loose and not a proper shower you have to hold the shower head in your hand , Good location
218494,Hazlitt s, Would have been good to have been provided with more info on the property only realised there was a guest lounge with honesty bar by reading other customers reviews , Lovely hotel with super welcoming staff
218495,Hazlitt s,No Negative, We only stayed in the Teresa Cornelys suite for 2 nights but it was so peaceful and plush we felt like we had been away for ages What a special place 
218496,Hazlitt s, Staff weren t offering the friendliness and service that suited a 300 a night stay they could and definitely should do better Maybe after 3 visits here it s time to move on , Rooms are amazeing location is fantastic for our visit are third time at this hotel 
218497,Hazlitt s, Room at the front Madam Kennedy a little noisy with the noise from street outside kept Windows and double glazing closed and air con on most of the night but the air con is pretty noisy too , So much character to this hotel full of beautiful paintings and books and very comfy homely feeling staff were very welcoming Very central location 
218498,Hazlitt s, Breakfast was expensive served in the room which is fine but between 10 and 15 for a bread basket or a bacon roll No tea making facilities in the room Complimentary bottled water would have been appreciated this is the first hotel we ve ever stayed at where none was provided except at 3 95 for a small bottle Very comfortable bed but rather small , Lovely decor cosy and comfortable really nice staff fantastic location 
218499,Hazlitt s, Honestly it was a wonderful stay on all counts the attention to detail makes it hard to find fault , The hotel itself is unique and charming Sumptuous bed linen and bathroom was pure luxury with claw foot tub Library for drinks and relaxing all made for quiet and relaxing stay in centre of London Yet the real gem was the staff warm helpful and very genuine no hint of commercial customer service 
218500,Hazlitt s, Coffee and tea making facilities in the room and a lift although I know we were in a Grade II listed building , The antique furniture and general quirkiness plus the location was particular convenient for Threatreland Despite its central location the hotel was surprisingly quiet 
218501,Hazlitt s, can t really fault it didn t have breakfast so can t give an option on that , Beautiful room great location lovely staff quality period hotel which felt more like a home than a hotel loved it 
218502,Hazlitt s, I would like a tea and coffee tray in the room as standard you can ring down for one , Have stayed here before love it fantastic period property honesty bar in the library even the hotel ginger cat is friendly Superior double room was a good size with huge very comfy bed and luxury bed linen 
218503,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Stayed for my husband s birthday Excellent location as we spent the evening and the following day in Soho and Covent Garden We had a buck fizz breakfast and the complimentary birthday cupcake was lovely We loved the fact that hotel has a very long interesting history behind it and It felt like we were sleeping in a room of a museum 
218504,Hazlitt s, No complaints, Fantastic location pleasant staff lovely breakfast delivered to room The Dr John Snow was was perfect both room bathroom And very quiet esp given the hotel is right in the middle of Soho Highly recommended 
218505,Hazlitt s, loos too low quaint circular shower caused water overspill on bathroom flow domain for email and website needs to be the same coveys the wrong business compency image if not , staff friendly helpful location historical period feel of hotel
218506,Hazlitt s, The only thing less than perfect was a somewhat lumpy sofa and limited TV reception , Lovely decor huge bath Couldn t wish for a better location The staff were lovely and the upgrade was very welcome 
218507,Hazlitt s, It was all great , Hazlitts is a beautiful boutique hotel with warm comfortable rooms filled with period features Superb central location at the quiet end of the street with a great restaurant just opposite Breakfast in bed was superb 
218508,Hazlitt s, Only offered a shower facility in room with child we asked to be moved to get a bath Shampoo not topped up after first night only I small bottle for 3 people from Fri to Sun Socket not working in bedroom meant unplugging charging phone to dry hair No bathroom light at mirror difficult to put make up on No bar facility apart from self service corner in library with very limited stock for example you could not get a glass of wine unless you bought a half bottle or breakfast room Essentially no where to retreat to with a kid in the early evening , Great location Great pillows 
218509,Hazlitt s, If you get a room in the lower part of the building be prepared to have a dark place , Nice and stylish rooms Excellent staff Sunny if higher floors Very clean 
218510,Hazlitt s, Could not find any fault wonderful, Access to the whole of the West end of London The style of the rooms interior and ambiance was fantastic Highly recommended 
218511,Hazlitt s, Only thing I didn t like was the fact we could only stay for one night , Amazing location The concierge at reception didn t catch his name couldn t have been more friendly and helpful Free upgrades are always appreciated but the suite we were given was awesome Will definitely stay again 
218512,Hazlitt s, It would be nice to be able to make some tea in the room , The atmosphere was incredible was like living in the past very comfortable bed location of course look forward to going again 
218513,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Very charming hotel If you want to feel like king or queen for a bit that s the place to go The staff are all pearls A very kind lady brings your breakfast to the room Step out of the hotel and 100 m to your left is one of the best jazz clubs in the world ronnie scotts 
218514,Hazlitt s, Heating source in bathroom didn t work but they fixed us up with a space heater , The hotel is completely charming Built in 1718 Staff couldn t be more helpful Felt like home if home was In London and was a perfectly kept Mansion full of antiques 
218515,Hazlitt s, Nothing , I liked the sense of peace inside and the discreetly tasteful style of the place We received a warm welcome The room was quiet the bathroom spacious and the breakfast was very good 
218516,Hazlitt s, I ve stayed many times and they always give you a brief as if it s the first time I know the welcome back mr X we have out you in your favourite room type thing can be corny but it does have the air of professionalism to it , One of my favourite places to stay in London so central but intimate A favourite with authors over the years and it s not hard to see why each room has its own character Many with writers desks There is the privacy of in room dining only that gives the place a feeling far removed from a large international chain 
218517,Hazlitt s, Nothing It was all very lovely, The whole hotel is welcoming from the staff to the interiors The rooms are luxurious and well equipped The staff are very helpful but also discreet The whole experience feels relaxed and more like a home than an hotel
218518,Hazlitt s, Although the bathroom looked great it was not practical Shower water splashed all over the shelf of the bath as it was very deep The lighting in the room was bad one of the lights did not work No tea or coffee and toiletries in the room , The hotel looked beautiful well decorated Loved the historical background and related room names Staff friendly and efficient I left my phone charger behind and it was posted back to me by the next day 
218519,Hazlitt s, Not really a complaint but the mild weather twinned with the thick sheets made far an uncomfortably warm night , Classic features and fantastic location 
218520,Hazlitt s,No Negative, Hazlitts is the antidote to a corporate business hotel Don t expect an efficient working desk power showers or bright make up mirrors instead expect dark wood creaky floors cast iron baths and personal service 
218521,Hazlitt s, A bar would have been an advantage , The quaintness such a contrast to modern purpose built hotels The history The calm provided in the middle of Soho The central location Breakfast in our bedroom
218522,Hazlitt s, No tea coffee making facility in room awful soft pillows really uncomfortable, Perfect location for Ronnie Scott s beautiful hotel to stay very quiet rooms beautifully done
218523,Hazlitt s, For the price a valet parking service should be available plus a waiting bay by the front entrance I nearly got a ticket whilst unloading my bags Noisy unreliable air conditioning Breakfast was too ordinary , Intimate style great period decor good service 
218524,Hazlitt s, There was supposed to be a complimentary bottle of bubbly but apparently this was a different offer I think I saw the offer on their website but it wasn t availble to booking com customers, Beautiful building and great location 
218525,Hazlitt s, Breakfast served in room only but location is great so not an issue as plenty of places to breakfast down the road if you don t want room service , Rooms with Character great staff
218526,Hazlitt s, Nothing bad However this would not be a good choice for people who cannot tolerate or understand historic properties with all their indiosyncrasies and minor inconveniences Can hear foot treads from floors above No amenities other than room unless you count a library in the hall to your room in hotel, Excellent central location in Soho Terrific walking access to the theaters and restaurants of the West End Great Tube access to all areas Amazing location basically But not for those who are afraid of people out in the streets at night or couples regardless of orientation 
218527,Hazlitt s, Room and en suit a little small Breakfast menu minimal Breakfast tray minimal , Location perfect Decor tasteful Staff all polite Everything is of nice quality 
218528,Hazlitt s,No Negative, The best location for people who want to be in the heart of Soho A feeling of an old traditional English house with a great old library hidden sitting rooms and fire place and above all serving
218529,Hazlitt s, Nothing I can thing of , The atmosphere of the hotel room The style of the hotel is particular and it s special for whom appreciates historical venues 
218530,Hazlitt s, nothing at all negative all positive, A nice change from the big hotel groups Lovely Georgian building lovingly restored With just 30 rooms great place to stay if you are taking in a show Relaxed atmosphere and very friendly staff 
218531,Hazlitt s, Wifi was spotty and went out entirely for one day but the staff worked very hard to fix it for us , The location right in Soho was absolutely perfect Thriving nightlife and dining scene 
218532,Hazlitt s, I couldn t fault the hotel , Amazing location Quaint decor rooms were small but took you back in time romantic and cosy Staff were very helpful and friendly 
218533,Hazlitt s, Was not aware that the bathroom would only have a tub not a shower , Location and quality for the price
