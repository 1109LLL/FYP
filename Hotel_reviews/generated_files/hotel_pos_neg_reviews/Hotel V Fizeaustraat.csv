324016,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, It d have been better if there s an iron board available in the room and a manual safety lock on the door inside , The location is very cozy neighborhood make sure to detour around the area while walking towards the Amstel station The room size is pretty satisfying A selection of tea and coffee is great The bed is very comfy I got the view of the canal at the back of the hotel right in front of a big tree so a little privacy from pedestrians No noisy AC very much satisfied because I m a very light sleeper but the walls are a bit thin The breakfast ordered is taken at the seat from 7 11am Great portion and good taste Had egg Benedict French toast with strawberry jam and English breakfast The staffs are very welcoming Hotel s deco is unique with a lot of accents Overall it made my impression of Amsterdam very memorable 
324017,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Being charged more than I had with booking com although I believe a weakness and lack of transparency of booking com , Great style very clean The room was excellent and done with taste and very clean Really enjoyed the top breakfast with service and fresh food unlike so many 4 and 5 star hotels that serve buffet like a canteen with poor ingredients 
324018,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Our only suggestion is to please change the bathroom mirror It s small and high and for anyone under 5 5 my wife you can t really see yourself very well She is not a big makeup person but it really didn t work for her , When we first arrived at this hotel we were concerned as it was out of town and seemed very plain from the outside But after staying there for 5 nights we would never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam The room was clean quiet and very comfortable The complimentary breakfasts are amazing We also ate dinner at the restaurant two nights and the food is fantastic Also the location turned out to be just fine as it s just a long block walk to the Amstel station where you can catch trains the Metro trams and buses Finally the best part of the hotel is the staff they would do anything for us They explained public transportation and recommended fantastic restaurants where they made us reservations 
324019,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Asked the reception twice to fix something in the room The answer was positive but the issue was not fixed during our stay, The restaurant service is outstanding Excellent food prices ok for the quality you get overall experience is certainly something to remember about the trip in Amsterdam Modern decoration very pleasant atmosphere comfortable room Breakfast is ok but a la carte for a busy hotel does not feel as the right decision for customers
324020,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, No negatives , The breakfast was absolutely superb and you can order as much food and as many drinks as you want The pancakes with banana bacon and maple syrup were delectable 
324021,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Wouldn t accommodate a late checkout even by half an hour, Excellent Breakfast Fairly sized room and large bathroom as compared to others in Europe 
324022,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Wished we had booked in for a few more days , Food absolutely superb Chef willing to accommodate any changes to dishes to end result complete customer satisfaction Staff so amazing 
324023,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The hotel is very stylish We have enjoyed restaurant and bar located in the hotel Staff is very helpful Hotel is located in a nice quite area near a metro station so you can easily get to the city centre of Amsterdam within 10 minutes by metro 
324024,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, It was near to the public transport and away from the city center so you can relax at the hotel area and with 10 15 minutes can get to the city centre The people at the hotel are amazingly friendly and easy to talk with actually all the people we met in Amsterdam were friendly helpful and everybody speaks fluently english The breakfast was also perfect the orders were taken from the table The hotel itself has an intresting design that is worth seeing We definitely recommend Hotel V to other visitors Thank You 
324025,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, It is not a downtown hotel so if you are looking for a place where you can walk out the door and find yourself in Dam Platz this is not for you But that is clear when you book it , The furnishing and the style of the hotel are very nice kind of industrial contemporary designed the restaurant is quite famous it means you need to reserve a table even on a monday night breakfast is la carte and delicious The hotel is not very close to the city center but if you are in Amsterdam for business and don t need to go there is absolutely perfect Good wifi connection nice bathroom complimentary water bottles and Nespresso coffee the real deal not the watery coffee normally served outside of Italy 
324026,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We have selected this hotel because we came by car and it had underground parking It costs 20e night the same as hotels in the city center During rush time Uber costs 22e to the main station and takes almost 40min traffic By rush time I mean also Saturday afternoon It is simply very poorly located For this reason we are not coming back Also a la carte breakfast is nice but the restaurant is too small to serve all the guests It took us no joking almost 2h to order and eat Good we didn t travel for business , Big and comfy bed very nice bathroom Mid century decor is fab but it has also some fishy finishing 
324027,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Some may not like the location in residential area outside the city I felt it enhanced our city break though as it was relaxing and not noisy Cycle in was simple and fun , brilliantly helpful staff good breakfasts bike hire was inexpensive and decent quality Peaceful after the bustle of the city 
324028,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The location of the hotel is not in the city center if you care about that It s about 25 minutes by metro or 1 hour walking , Everything was awesome The room the sleep quality and the fantastic breakfast 
324029,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Poorest decor I have ever seen Warehouse like concrete ceiling which the staff insisted was interior design Broken bed that the staff very efficiently detected and offered a change of room , Convenient location excellent and secure parking facility and good breakfast 
324030,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The smell of the carpets in the corridors , Great hotel with great style Staff is nice and welcoming Breakfast is amazing Even though location is not central neighborhood is charming and convenient to reach the city center 
324031,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, staff members were ALL exceptionally helpful friendly polite and knowledgeable Food was excellent decor great and service attentive and swift Would highly recommend 
324032,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, price I paid was a bit too high given that the hotel is a bit far from the city center there were no restaurants or shops around the hotel except those in the Amstel train station 11am check out is a bit early if you want to enjoy their breakfast there s no gym or swimming pool in the hotel, very friendly and helpful staff location is not far from the Amstel metro station breakfast is not big and lacks variety but is quite tasty cleaning ladies leave clean towels water in front of your room if you have the do not disturb sign in front of your door for the whole day free recent movies for free in the hotel TV which is big in size 
324033,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The staff is outstanding All dedicated people attentive to our needs Location was perfect for us quiet neighborhood 8 min walk to the metro Amstel Station and 10 min from the Centraal Station two trams to get to Leidseplein museums and one to go to Jordaan The hotel is spacious with a nice design very modern and functional typical Dutch Breakfast was excellent We enjoyed every aspect of our five days at this hotel 
324034,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Just the location not ideal but you know this , Professional and courteous service throughout Restaurant staff very highly trained attentive to detail and friendly
324035,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The messy seats at breakfast time we stayed at the hotel for half a week and every morning at breakfast the seats had crumbs all over them , Loved The bed the friendly staff the design the complementary breakfast room cleanliness first impressions overall feel of the place our complementary room upgrade
324036,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The breakfast was the best I ve ever ever had at a hotel You get to choose a savoury and a sweet breakfast and it s just so delicious The staff are attentive friendly and lovely We even got a bottle of champagne to mark our anniversary 
324037,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The facilities are the only negative of the hotel Actually besides the awesome restaurant and of course the room there was not much to do in the hotel No gym no pool no sauna Do you need it Maybe not so much due to the awesome restaurant , Incredible styling and atmosphere throughout the hotel Wonderfull high ceilings in the rooms which renders them super spacious Nice strong hot showers Best staff in the world And to save the best for lasts the breakfast was really impressively good We have been to 5 stars hotels not offering this quality food and quick and friendly service 
324038,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, So it s a bit distant from Amsterdam Central which was the main focus for me this trip By distant I mean it s not a walking distance so for me who planned to walk every where I had to take a tram to the heart of Amsterdam However I would stay here again, Breakfast was awesome Best hotel breakfast EVER The staff were super cool and helpful answered all my stupid questions with a twinkle in their eyes My room was nice I liked it I actually would stay here again if I come to Amsterdam for business
324039,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, To be honest everything was perfect It well worth the money , The location was good in a quiet place and very close to public transport The breakfast was great in term of quality and service The bedroom was cosy quiet and spacious enough I m used to travel a lot for both work and leisure and I can say it s one of best hotel I ve been if not the best 
324040,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Fabulous decor great location irrespective of it being outside the Dam the metro service close by is amazingly quick and so frequent The staff are so friendly and helpful and the room cleanliness is above satisfaction Great smelling toiletries in the bathroom and towels changed everyday Definitely worth every penny 
324041,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, 1 A bit dusty curtains 2 No washing machines Laundry is located in the 30 minutes walking long distance laundry service in the hotel is taken with an extra charge I stayed there for 6 nights and the a single issue is the laundry related one, 1 Well decorated designed hotel with a decent restaurant bar LOBBY 2 The window to be opened 3 All kinds of public transportation with a five minute long walk 4 A very quiet residentional area 5 Water included 6 Recent released movies available on the movie channel by TV 7 The fluency of speaking English all workers there 8 One of breakfast menus a grilled sandwich I enjoyed a lot Breakfast is served to each not buffet style one which is a quality of food
324042,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The facilities were excellent The breakfast more than lived up to expectations If you are hesitant on the location don t be The train stop is a very short walk and is into the centre in five minutes The tickets are cheap and tge stop is easy to navigate Alternatively you can rent bikes Again an easy ride along a dedicated bike path for aboutin 15 mins The restaurant staff value and comfort of the hotel make the location worth the effort 
324043,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The only thing is the location Getting there from the airport with public transport we arrived late at night is not easy We used UBER for 25 euros The amstel station is 10 min walk biking is 20 minutes from center I would recommend this place for anyone who is re visiting amsterdam but not for anyone who is visiting for the first time A note to the housekeeping Everyday we grabbed the coke from the mini bar and everyday they refilled one single bottle of coke If you see a guest is enjoying the coke why not fill the mini bar with more coke bottles Just a thought , Oh wow this place The details of the design anywhere from the toilets to the wall decorations all the way to the candles in the restaurant Whoever designed this place is a genius The hotel has a luxurious boutique feel to it 50 s style retro vintage in the room and public areas Amazing high speed wifi at all places great biked to ridem good firm bed good size room we stayed at the most basic double and it was perfect You also get a robe with flipflops two bottles of water per day coffee tablets for the espresso machine and more Soap shampoo and lotions are of great quality with a lovely wooden spicy odor Breakfast is served per person not a buffet we really liked it They made us a special vegan option every morning which was highly appreciated The hotel restaurant is very successful and always packed with beautiful people 
324044,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Check out time can be a bit later or a bit more flexible, Best hotel i stayed in in Amsterdam The staff give it a great vibe and the design makes it stand out Very pleaseant to be in
324045,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The Hotel is conveniently located about 7 10 min to metro station and 3 stops from the center The service is absolutely stunning We got everything we needed in our room without even asking bathrobe slippers teapot hairdryer etc The reception and room service are very attentive to a guest s any request The breakfasts are amazingly delicious the first time in our trips we woke up earlier just not to miss it 
324046,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Everything was perfect, We loved the hotel so much It was our favorite one out of all our stay in Europe The beds are so comfy We ve never met hotel staff that are this nice Amazing hotel great people Breakfast is so good as well as lunch and dinner We went around different restaurants in Amsterdam but The Lobbh restaurant at the hotel was too good We would love to come back 
324047,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The Hotel has a restaurant but has no other alternative restaurants in the neighborhood This limits the freedom of the guests at the hotel Unfortunately the Hotel restaurant which is reputedly good insists of reservation of tables even for the guests of the Hotel which may be denied as it happened in our case inspite of a table request 5 hours in advance the facility was denied claiming already booked We had to change our plans of the day to go out to the town specially for the dinner And another issue is the limited options for vegetarian guests Only three items are available And Yes the Breakfast is not a buffet spread so options are limited here too , Everything about the hotel is good and whatever are the shortcomings are made up by the excellent staff 
324048,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Nothing, The location was great next to a big public transport station called amstel station 8 min away from city center by public transportation Breakfast was awesome at the restaurant the lobby great place for drinks And dinner
324049,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, We liked everything Location is great green quiet corner easy access to public transportation but zero noise Room was spacious everything was clean and tidy Service was exceptional fast polite responsive and one can feel that personal is proud of their hotel and their city And of course the restaurant excellent innovative cuisine not only in the evening but breakfasts as well Bottom line next time we ll be in Amsterdam we will certainly stay here once more 
324050,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, No late night room service But that s not much of a deal breaker , Unique and memorable interiors quiet surrounds far but not too far from hustle and bustle of the city and a cute cat lounging in the lobby 
324051,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Amazing hotel It is beautiful clean excellent service stylish funky design amazing dinner and great breakfast Location is not good but the hotel is so nice that you don t really care

324053,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Only complaint staff leaning across the front of you to serve others at the table , Location near Amstel station made access to Amsterdam public transport system very easy Recently opened hotel with retro theme Wonderful staff especially Daisy on reception 
324054,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, there is a narrow corridor between the bathrooms and the bed breakfest was good you can choose something sweet and main the only problems withit is when you stay for five night as we did it is a bit boring, freindly staff and very helpfull the design of hotel as mention other reviews is different rooms are the room was very clean nice bathroom the hotel is located not in the center but this is so ok
324055,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Air conditioning in room did not really cool the room down but I don t think I ve stayed in a hotel room where this works really well , Superb interior design with the most helpful accomodating staff Superb food in the restaurant with wines available to taste one of the nicest breakfasts I ve ever eaten 
324056,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The only thing we didn t like was leaving , The Hotel was amazing from the minute we arrived to the minute we left We arrived early so the room wasn t ready we left our bags and used the toilets in the reception what a wow when we walked into the toilets we knew from that moment we had chosen the right hotel 
324057,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Room service arrived to the room cold Parking is 20 per day Toiletries were not replaced and room was not cleaned while we were out in the morning of the second day when we arrived back in the evening the housekeeping knocked but we were already in and so only had the bathroom lightly cleaned , The restaurant food was excellent Staff were super friendly and helpful location was pretty good and hotel design is cool 
324058,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Comfy beds great food the bar and restaurant was extremely good Location is OK but you need to consider that it s a short car ride train ride from the center

324061,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The only negative thing was that there occasionally appeared to be a shortage of waitressing staff , Hotel close to Amstel station so very easy to get into the centre and at the end of the day you can return to the relative peacefulness of where the hotel is situated The rooms are large industrial minimalist but have everything you need As has previously been stated the breakfasts are incredible you won t need anything else until the evening The hotel reception staff are amazing so very helpful and nothing is too much trouble 
324062,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, V Minor would have liked a more powerful shower in the wet room and onsite gym pool , Relaxed unstuffy quality hotel Loved the modern style blended with comfort Room was very spacious which became a home from home Staff were very friendly and generally excellent Breakfast and evening snacks in the Lobby restaurant were very tasty and well presented A little out of the centre but this was great for a quiet haven Amstel station and trams are close by for hoping into the centre or stadium Will go back

324068,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Even though is very close to Amstelstation so tram and train and metro widely available the hotel is not close to anything else of interest So if location is important to you maybe you should try their other locations But keep in mind that it is great cost benefit transportation is really easy in Amsterdam so totally worth it and I will stay again in the near future , Breakfast was included and it is amazing Actually the restaurant is pretty cool a bit on the expensive side The bed is very comfortable the decor is charming and contemporary not even a little bit noisy the amenities are great and it is super clean They were very accomodating with my needs to early check in and late check out It is already one of my favorite hotels in the city 
324069,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Good shower excellent tap water for drinking Breakfast was excellent and service was fantastic Staff very friendly and helpful Nespresso pods and water complimentary 
324070,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Direct neighbourhood is a residential area without any special appeal but in walking distance to Amstel river and well accessible with both public transport or car , Very stylish redo of an existing building in every aspect and with much tastefull attention to detail Together with the hospitable and attentive staff one of the best places I have ever been 
324071,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The staff in the restaurant some are attentive to your needs others simply don t care and you can wait a bit for your coffee , The bedroom and the breakfast were very good Excellent location Just 5 min walking from train tram and bus station Very good meal at the restaurant in the hotel Residential area in the neighborhood very quiet 
324072,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Sound isolation was lacking and tge location could be too quite for tourists, They converted a rather boring building into a very stylish hotel loved Breakfast was ala carte and wonderfull
324073,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, I thought it was closer to the city center but it was a short ride nonetheless, The breakfast here is the best And the staffs are very friendly and helpful 
324074,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The restaurant meals are very good BUT depend on the waiters for one to have his her needs met , The hotel is 5 8 minutes walking from train tram bus station and in a quiet area Very good bedrooms Excellent food Great coffee bar Parking is very good at the property only a bit expensive 
324075,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, nothing, The staff was welcoming very friendly and helpful The room was spacious stylish and clean The hotel is in a quiet area just few minutes walk from the metro and train station Delicious breakfast vaste choice We ll definitely stay there again when we ll go back to Amsterdam

324077,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We have to pay for the rental bikes There are few shops or restaurants around it , The hotel is well decorated and the staff is great The nuts taste great We love the bar and the glass hut

324081,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, I loved the hard wood floors funky design and that every convenience was considered A lovely range of teas and coffee available in the rooms and fabulous bathroom products
324082,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Perhaps a bit remote from the center but the city isn t very big so it didn t bother us much Had an issue one morning at breakfast We ordered pancakes with maple syrup but what we got was dry When we asked about it the waiter didn t seem to care saying Maybe they ran out of maple syrup without really checking It s not a big deal and it was the only negative experience we had at the hotel , The best breakfast I had at a hotel The presentation and the taste were both amazing A bit more variety could have been nice but I thoroughly enjoyed every breakfast I had during the stay They had some of the best staff I encountered in any European countries too Very friendly helpful and professional The room was spacious and clean with a touch of their unique design One of very few hotels that well deserve 4 star rating

324101,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Housekeeping wasnt the best did not visit room until 5 tea coffee not refilled daily under the beds 1cm of dust easily can be seen as you enter the room like no ever touched since the building was built , interior design and comfort heating of rooms breakfast was delicious bathroom was also well equipped and spacious 
324102,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Maybe would say that only down size would be portion size in the restaurant Even if you take 5 meal course menu written more courses smaller portions Unfortunately we needed to go out to eat more as my man was still hungry Fine dining , We booked as a last minute idea Wasn t even supposed to come to Amsterdam Read reviews and though will try It was absolutely amazing Extended or 2 days to 4 Staff was so nice and felt like they done extra mile for us atmosphere is relaxing and wonderful Food so delicious Even location wise pergect It s a bit out of busy part which I saw as a positive thing as not so loud 7 min with underground to town or an hour slow walk which we so enjoyed too 
324103,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Nothing, Breakfast is amazing the Restaurant is a must one of the best I did in Amsterdam The room was big and confortable The lobby is a nice place to relax and have a drink outstanding decoration You can park your car for 15 day and rent bicycle directly at the reception City center is only 10 to 15mn by bicycle easy and nice trip along the Amstel river I will come back in this hotel next time 
324104,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, When booking there was a choice of twin or double room I specifically chose a double but we just had two singles pushed together Always uncomfortable with that gap in the middle , The public area bar restaurant are really welcoming Breakfast is great Staff are lovely 
324105,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We were a little further from the city centre than we would have hoped Luckily the hotel provide bikes for rental to travel around , Breakfast was amazing The interior and decor was perfect to a T Interesting curation of books in the room Felt like we were in a cosy lodge in the winter 
324106,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Orange juice I am freeak about that but it was horrible , Breakfast really nice but horrible orange juice Quiet rooms On site restaurant needed booking even for hotel guests 
324107,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Location is not near the centre which is good to avoid the rush with parking under the hotel but quite a trek to get into town, Breakfast excellent and a la carte Rooms are great and restaurant superb
324108,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, my only issue was getting to the hotel from the airport The connection is straightforward once you figure out though that you ll need a train from Schipohl to Amsterdam Zuid and then a tram bus But once out of the airport not much of signs are in English Just a minor point though , Very nice and helpful staff awesome room blazing fast stable wifi excellent breakfast great lounge to just relax parking garage etc all in all can t blame much really We had an excellent stay 
324109,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, I can not think about one thing that I did not like Everything was great , This Hotel is from now of on my favorite The styling is insanely good They reception guys where so lovely and very easy going Everything you see on the pictures is exactly the same no maybe even better The breakfast was delicious the room was awesome and a shout out to the cleaning staff Everyone that passed by said good morning and was very nice Also I was totally surprised in a good way that we had booked a late check out but around 12 o clock we decided to leave so the receptionist was so kind to return the extra costs for the late check out I would love to stay in this hotel again

324113,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The breakfast was amazing the beds are really confortable and the hotel is beautiful Metro station is 5 minutes walking and only 5 stations from the Central Station So even it s not located in the center it s pretty easy to get there in 20 minutes 
324114,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Room service could be better at cleaning the room floors obviously were not properly vacuumed , Modern style unconventional a bit outside of the main historical area but it is a minor issue main station is conviniently located nearby Good size room Everything looks new 
324115,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, nothing, What a gem of a hotel for an excellent price This could be a 5 star hotel given the attention to detail and the facilities Beautiful comfortable rooms but the icing on the cake has to be the incredible restaurant Fantastic breakfast and amazing dinners

324122,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The location is good close to metro station but it is not so central 3 4 stations from city center However it would be almost impossible to have these amazing facilities on the city center so it is a fair trade off , Everything was great with great staff modern design facilities and an amazing breakfast I will definitely come back 
324123,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, There s a perfect decorated rooms I love the style All hotel looks very modern Breakfast was excellent Thanks for all personal for help and assistance Love this place See you guys next time

324126,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Nothing , A new well designed and clean hotel with cosy rooms and spacious bathroom shower What I liked the most is the hospitality and friendliness of the staff Without exaggeration you will feel welcomed from each and every one starting from the front desk staff to the housekeepers The amazing hospitality is their top value while dealing with their customers Thank you Hotel V staff and keep up the spirit 
324127,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Although a distance from the centre with a 5 minute walk you have access to the metro and tram lines which are very useful , Pleasently suprised with how nice this hotel was Great value The decor of the hotel was much different to others but very nice Bed was amazing would have stayed longer for the bed alone We had dinner one night in the restaurant which had a great buzz food was very nice Breakfast was amazing options were very good Great hotel and would return 
324128,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Hotel has wonderful interiors and very attentive staff Breakfast had a lot of choice from croissants to eggs to healthy options Highly recommended Location is a little out of the way but a quick uber will get you into town in about 10mins 
324129,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Heating just the room which was turned on late at night and turned off early morning Although the hotel staff gave us a small electric heater , Beautifully designed secure hotel near Amestel metro and train station easy access to downtown and airport staff politeness and smiling Excellent breakfast very good atmosphere and silence room 
324130,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Nothing really , The staff incredibly helpful The room with outstanding decoration and comfort the organic products in the bathroom with an inspiring text on the bottle the amazing breakfast 
324131,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Windows at room can not be opened The light is not bright making the experience not that perfectly cozy Some servants at the breakfast bar are somehow a bit oblivious forgetting things The location is ok Not quite central but still near the station Honestly the price quality condition is not fully met , Nice nap everything in regard of beds and relax is great Helpful staff Nice breakfast but not a large choice to make 
324132,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The outside could be a bit nicer to look at the building kind of resembles an old hospital , Staff were extremely friendly and helpful The place was neat and decorated with very good taste 
324133,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Only a slight niggle but I found the cleaning wasn t always top standard e g the stairs leading to the rooms had big dust clumps , The breakfast was included and it was proper table service Really really good food The room was great very stylish The staff were really friendly and had amazing local knowledge 
324134,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, I would recommend to serve fresh sqeezed orange juice with breakfast It would make it great Unfortunate that no rooms with a bath are available, Everything Great staff Cosy hotel Excellent breakfast and restaurant
324135,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We found that the mattress was slightly hard though we informed the reception about it and a few hours later they installed toppers on our bed which made it much more comfortable , The hotel is amazing The staff couldn t be more helpful and nice concerning all kinds of demands They offered my girlfriend and I some champagne at breakfast as it was her birthday Talking about breakfast theirs is exceptional you have everything you could expect in a great brunch The decoration is impressive and the rooms are spacy as well as the bathroom which is really beautiful 
324136,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The hotel was fantastic such friendly staff a lovely room and delicious breakfast Could not be more happy with our stay Location was actually really good only a few minutes from Amstel station with regular metro and trams to all parts of the city which were reasonably priced 
324137,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Bed rock hard In the morning they told us you can ask for a topper and girl behind desk did not even bother to appologise Strange noises above my room for many hours in the night as builders were working porter went to have a look and after 1 hour the noise ended Parking should be free RE booking site but we had to pay 15 euros Breakfast is a la cart funny but very heavy though , Location is good
324138,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Loved the cool design throughout the hotel Breakfast was great and staff very friendly Liked the location as you got to see a bit of the outer city on the stroll into the city centre 
324139,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The double bed was two single mattresses together , Excellent delicious breakfast Great bar and restaurant on ground floor Friendly helpful and intelligent staff Good room facilities and location 
324140,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Liked everything, Bed very comfy lovely bathroom Tea and coffee facilities in room Breakfast great and served to your table Didn t notice any shops close by but there are cafes and mini market in Amsterdam station which is around 6 minutes walk Easy to get to centre and airport from station From airport to hotel either catch train to Amstel zuid then metro toAmstel or travel to Amsterdam central and then catch metro to Amstel so easy 
324141,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, I cannot thing of anything even though I am trying very hard , These guys are amazing The hotel is brand new the receptionist spoke perfect english the rooms were decorated with good taste and very clean the cosmetics from the hotel were smelling very nice The breakfast is the best of all until now because they have a chef that cooks and not a free buffet The hotel is close to a metro station and you can buy permits from the reception They have their own underground guarded parking and it costs only 15 euros per day 
324142,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The only point I can critize is the lack of 24h room service That s easy to fix and after that I really can t think of any critical point worth mentioning , The style the rooms the atmosphere the service the restaurant the value for money simply outstanding Having stayed at 100 s of hotels all over the world I can confidently say that Hotel V is a rare gem one of the very best hotels I have stayed at When you add to that extremely fair rates this hotel is easyli in the top 3 for my very favorite hotels and without doubt the best value for money I ve experienced 
324143,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Service in the restaurant was far too slow Had to wait for ages for someone to attend to me not once but the three times I ate there , Funky decor large rooms and bathrooms friendly and accommodating staff 
324144,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Everything was perfect The room was very comfortable clean and tastefully decorated The breakfast was excellent The staff was very helpful As we planned we were able to park our car in the garage and use the public transport easily tickets were available in the reception 
324145,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Everything was perfect The hotel was beautifully decorated the staff was nice and the breakfast was fabulous This is definitely where I will stay when I get to Amsterdam next time 
324146,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The staff was rude and also seemed unaware of most things They didnt know when restaurant was close The policy shows a 30 EUR chsrge but they charged me 45 Told me oh sorry the policy sheet will be updated someday but it costs more now Meanwhile I was called twice to leave my room even after paying the charge Communication is clearly a mess at this place Also don t be fooled This location sucks , The room was unique cool looking Aesthetic of entire hotel was really fun Food was decent and free breakfast concept was unique 
324147,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Noisy aircon heating One instance where staff at restaurant had basic English skills and brought us twice the intended order I blame it more on the confusing menu , Floor to ceiling windows extra friendly staff beautiful indoor design great breakfast fast internet green surroundings 
324148,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The thought of breakfast included was great however although the breakfast menu choice sounded great it seems that things are made in advance not to order so it was all a little dry and only just warm not nice and hot and fresh Shame , The hotel was very good very quiet lovely food very trendy The robes and slippers in the room were very welcome and the toiletries very nice 
324149,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Breakfast it s maybe the best service they offer to the guest But I think also that a small buffet with some excellent pastry and biscuits would complete the breakfast experience 
324150,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The hotel is beautifully designed and the rooms are very nice The service staff was really helpful We had our car broken into downtown Amsterdam don t leave anything visible in your car in AMS and the staff really went out of their way to help us getting things sorted The breakfast was simply the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel perfect poached eggs and pancakes Will visit again 
324151,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, As resident in the evening we couldn t eat in the restaurant because it was fully booked by non residents There were no other places to eat close by The bar menu and room service was very small The rooms were like sleeping in a garage because of the unfinished d cor bare concrete In a word it was depressing I would not recommend the hotel to friends , It was quiet and the staff were the most helpful and friendliest of any hotel that I have stayed in
324152,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The choice of breakfast is a bit limited and the dishes of the main course dinner were quite small for the price you pay , Location close to the Amstel station was great The hotel room was very comfortable and contained a fridge and safe deposit box 
324153,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Design is very nice staff is more that volunteer to help you have a nice stay Despite being not in the centrum metro and tram are 5 minutes walking away and it takes 10 min to join center of the city with metro until 1AM to come back Breakfast is very good 
324154,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The hotel was some distance from the town centre but to be fair there was a metro station nearby , The reception staff were exceptionally nice and the options at breakfast were very good The room was spacious with everything we needed There was a nice walk along the river into town We were given the choice of and chose a quiet room which was very peaceful 
324155,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, The staff was very friendly the spaces impeccably styled while still managing to be cozy The room was spacious and had all necessary amenities and was incredibly quiet The hotel is just outside Amsterdam city centre but very well connected adding to the respite Would highly recommend it to anyone 
324156,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Breakfast was incredible rooms really comfortable and the hotel very well located in a quiet area with good transport links to the city centre Also the staff were very helpful with a really warm welcome on arrival and a few good tips about getting around the city 
324157,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Only a couple of minor things our key cards stopped working the second day and toothpaste wasn t available in the room only on request Also our bed had been moved and was really off centre to the wall hangings and tv so seemed a bit odd when first entering the room but definitely no big complaints and all easily fixed without fuss I would like there to be a few better veggie dinner options for room service but what we did order was lovely , The staff were all very kind very good hosting and nice relaxed atmosphere Amazing mid century decor and furnishings and very spacious rooms Very pleased with the price we paid for the quality of the hotel experience and found the location easily accessible to our favourite parts of Amsterdam Also shout out to Martyn Damen hope I got your name right really welcoming and friendly guy who gave us some nice tips of where to eat around the city I would highly recommend staying here if you re visiting the city 
324158,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Breakfast phenomenal Staff very helpful and knowledgable Room spotless great location to centre and arena Easy to transfer from and to airport Would return again
324159,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The hotel should work a bit on breakfast offer Although the chef does a great job the choice is limited If you are vegetarian vegan or not an egg person there is not much to choose from The combination of a buffet with choice of cooked meals would be great , The room is excellent with lots of light The bed is very comfortable 
324160,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Modern design of entire hotel big bathroom with very nice aroma toiletries bed was supercomfortable from frame to matrace and the size And yes breakfast is a special story nice personalized concept with great food Perfectly connected to the centre and airport located in a nice environment 
324161,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We had a double room booked however only had two single beds pushed together ended up falling down the middle in the first night and ended up sleeping in seperately beds for the rest of the holiday A shame when we were celebrating our engagement Beds were comfy and it is such a lovely hotel and staff hence not marking it down on this It didn t affect our sleep at all just if I had one pick something , Breakfast choice had been superb only place I have been where you can order two and they are of a usual size portion Staff all seemed happy to be there and truthful when saying they enjoyed working there Mateo was an excellent bar host informing us of novel things in the area the hotel is lucky to have him 
324162,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Got woken up at 9am on both mornings we were there with a knock on the door by the cleaner which was a bit early for our liking as we had been out late the night before She was very apologetic but then did exactly the same thing the following morning I would normally expect cleaners to wait until closer to checkout time to do their rounds Location wise there didn t seem to be a whole lot to see or do around the area but as I said it is really easy to get to pretty much anywhere in Amsterdam from Amstel station , Beautifully decorated hotel lovely breakfast friendly helpfull staff bed was incredibly comfortable and the curtains don t let any light in so we slept like babies Around 5min walk from Amstel station so very easy to get anywhere in Amsterdam by either tram bus or metro Highly recommended 
324163,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Everything was beyond expectations, It is extremely easy to get anywhere from the Hotel since the Amstel Station is literally 4 5 min walk From there you can take the train metro tram bus It takes 6 min to get to the city center by metro and it is easy to get to the airport as well The area is beautiful quiet with lots of trees and green the staff is extremely polite and helpful from the Front desk to the waiters The restaurant the Lobby is a must open kitchen set up and everything we tried was exquisite Make sure you have a reservation because it tends to get busy The breakfast is free served from 7 until 11 in the morning and it is delicious You get to choose one savory and one sweet dish in addition to any coffee juice you want The decor is to die for a mix of industrial with glam 70 s vibe The room we stayed in was spacious and clean Would definitely stay here when i visit Amsterdam again 
324164,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Service at breakfast chaotic Kept getting things wrong Key cards kept not working so had to have replaced several times , Food at Breakfast atmosphere in bar Helpful reception

324169,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, There wasn t anything that I didn t like but a few more vegetarian dinner options would have been nice but was available was tasty , The food was great the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was quiet and clean Initially I thought it would be inconvenient to explore Amsterdam from this hotel as it s not within the canal ring however it is very quick easy and cheap to reach other parts of Amsterdam using public transport and or walking

324173,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, A lot of the savoury breakfast options contain egg so this could be varies more , Really lovely hotel Staff very friendly We stayed here for 7 nights Great choice for breakfast Restaurant in hotel is also excellent standard well above most hotel restaurants Hotel room was really nice also 
324174,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The cost of drink in the bar needs to be looked at , This hotel opened recently and the staff all were so helpful and kind nothing was too much The hotel was perfect in terms of a short distance 10 mins by train to the centre of Amsterdam It was perfectly clean and staff were always cleaning The cost of a glass of wine in the bar was a little high but not too much The quality of food was fantastic in particular the breakfast Both my wife and I look forward to returning 
324175,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Strange smell on the hallway leading to the rooms ground floor not enough food for us on the a la carte breakfast we like to eat a lot in the morning , The thing we loved the most about our stay here was the room large great design comfy bed the canal right below the wall sized windows The hotel is located in a nice quiet area walking distance from the Amstel metro station has underground safe parking extra charge to be expected in Amsterdam helpful staff good wifi signal The breakfast was good have an espresso too 
324176,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Need to take the metro only a couple of blocks from the hotel to get to amsterdam s central station Doesn t take long but not conducive to dropping things off at your hotel during the day , This is a brand new hotel super clean great bathrooms wonderful breakfasts and an amazing staff willing to take time to help Rooms are soundproof so very restful after an overseas flight

324184,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, When you check in you need to leave a credit card or 200 euros which we did not know about we did not know about this I think it should be made more clear before you get there by booking com, Staff was really helpful and friendly breakfast was amazing 
324185,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, Only a bit of more polish on the room cleaning but nothing major Bike rental is a bit expensive Should offer 1 or 2 complimentary bottles of water Location is a bit out but you can rent bike and get metro tram , Excellent spacious room Great decoration Friendly staff Beautiful hotel Bikes for rent One of the best breakfasts I ever had A steal for the price in Amsterdam the hotel is only 1 month old run to there while the price is still good

324189,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The 1 2 bottle of wine in the room could be of a better quality for 15 Apart from that no complaints , The staff were extremely helpful friendly and professional Particular mentions for Kieran at reception apologies if your version of the name is spelled differently Monika at the bar in The Lobby Restaurant and a waiter from New Zealand whose name I didn t get but who was very helpful in showing us some alternative areas and sites to visit I ll echo what others have already said about the breakfast menu it s absolutely brilliant and I love that everything is freshly cooked to order

324193,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, left suitcase open in the room and didn take everything out as I was only staying a few days when I got home found some new clothes very wet with a strange orange powder staining them nothing in suitcase to cause this while cleaning our room maybe something happened very strange returned to hotel to rest one afternoon about 5pm and still cleaning the room after eventually getting into room another guy comes along knocks once then opens the door This I didn t like I says he was checking if room had been cleaned However all other services perfect , New hotel ten minute walk to Amstel station and then 10 minute metro ride to the centre very easy to reach also from the airport breakfast was fine reception staff very helpful 
324194,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, location far from city center we book a room with a big bed and they placed two joined bed bikes are more expensive than in city center, Excellent atention delicious breakfast good enviroment
324195,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, This hotel has immaculate style and presentation They have obviously spent a lot of money on the fit out and design You get to choose a sweet AND savoury option for the included breakfast served with great coffee juice Didn t eat dinner there but the menu looked fantastic All staff restaurant reception housekeeping were happy informative friendly The bed pillows were super comfy and rooms well stocked with lovely toiletries I needed an iron and reception organised for one to be delivered to my room within minutes 
324196,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, The staff left the tray with cups near of the curtains When you are closing the curtains you can easily break the glasses in the tray It s a small detail Instead of putting it near of the windows to look good leave it somewhere else Checkout it s too early but the staff were very nice and allowed me to leave a bit later than 11AM , Excellent bed Excellent furniture Excellent breakfast All very nice The price was very good considering everything I ll be staying here for sure 
324197,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, A five star hotel Incredible rooms decorations breakfast staff As my job is hotel management I was thrilled by the overall hotel concept the breakfast quality and by the staff in general Congratulations to the initial designer as well as to the ones who had the idea of the hotel concept And many sincere congratulations to all the staff with no exceptions Polite professional helpful smiling Congratulations
324198,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We only got one room key so whenever my husband went out for a smoke I was left in the darkness you need the card for both floor access and light in the room There is only one elevator and it got stuck once so we were advised to take the stairs not much of a problem but my husband s injured leg was hurting and we had really heavy bags The location is okay but there are no grocery shops or caf s close by and the hotel restaurant is pricey if you re traveling on a budget so better grab something on the way back from the town , Great design friendly staff and a lovely refined atmosphere Comfy beds Nice breakfast la carte coffee is rather watery for my taste though The book of fairy tales in the room is a nice touch The hotel is rather far from the center but has good transport connections 
324199,Hotel V Fizeaustraat,No Negative, Breakfast was amazing and very big The hotel was just renovated and everything was new We rented bikes from the hotel they were new and very good Hotel is within a walking distance from Amstel station but I recommend renting bikes it is easier and cheaper to see the city

324203,Hotel V Fizeaustraat, We didn t like the fact that we had to leave The ONLY thing we could find that needed improvement was that we felt divided at night sleeping on two single beds put together as a double , The hotel staff was so friendly and welcoming They treated us like long lost friends family The atmosphere and decor of the hotel is very classy yet relaxing One could find a cozy nook or private lounge area to enjoy meals or drinks very romantic The food was exquisite and abundant I have never had better breakfast then what they gave us each day we were there We became friends quickly with the wait staff and it was always a treat to see them for breakfast We felt like family We will definitely make it our mission to come back to visit Hotel V again what a great place
