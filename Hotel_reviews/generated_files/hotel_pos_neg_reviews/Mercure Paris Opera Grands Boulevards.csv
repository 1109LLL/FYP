188607,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, The rooms were fairly small but not a problem , The breakfast was nice Good selection of foods to choose from Staff were welcoming and helpful The room was clean and comfortable 
188608,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, The room was extremely hot and the aircon not at all effective in fact I m not sure it was working at all The bed was very uncomfortable , Room was nicely decorated very clean and quite modern Bathroom was very modern and fresh The hotel was very quiet and in a side street which meant limited traffic Plenty of lovely restaurants within 5 minutes walk 
188609,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Reception team was amazing and responsive They are clearly on top of their work unlike the Novotel Les Halles which I stayed in which was incredibly disorganised 
188610,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Room was small but very comfortable , The staff were very friendly and helpful My room was very quiet and there was no extra charge for having breakfast in bed 
188611,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, the air conditioning was barely working they told me that paris never experiences outdoor temperatures like those 35C which is a total lie the motor was simply inadequate opening the window to get some fresh air from the outside instead was impossible because of the people on the street and in the bars enjoying themselves There are no ironing facilities in the room i went downstairs to get an iron and the guy had to run across the street to get one the rooms are small i was on the top floor and even if i m only 175cm i could barely fit my head under the shower paying all that money and having so little comfort is unacceptable , very close to gare du nord lots of restaurants and bars nearby
188612,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, What we didn t like was nothing to do with the hotel but that we were robbed on the streets as we arrived on the first day That was down to our foolishness to trust strangers But as you can imagine it made us have rather low spirits at the start but your hotel staff were very kind and that helped a great deal , We found your hotel fine for our purpose and value for money and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
188613,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Disappointed in the drinks facility as we had a proper coffee machine in Bordeaux A couple of biscuits may have been offered Proper tea and milk would also have been a bonus, The room was very well decorated and we asked for a quiet room and got one whch is amazing in Paris
188614,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, I thought the street presentation of the hotel was lacking in that I found it difficult to see when I was on the street walking back to it after dining out I did not have too much wine , The hotel is very on trend if you like jazz and the room was decorated accordingly 
188615,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, small quantity of shampoo and shower gel products in the bathroom, The room was quiet clean and comfortable The location is good and the staff was perfect Best value for money 
188616,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, little too noizy for my taste from the street and from other room very light sound isolated , super comfy bed and pillow cozy and great sleep For Paris standard super continental breakfast 
188617,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Very narrow lift reception looks very basic and doesn t really represent 4 star hotel, The memory foam pillows in the privilege room were very comfortable
188618,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, the hotel room temperature was so warm we both found it difficult to sleep and did not have a great nights sleep on either night we turned the heating off along with the radiator but it was still very warm it was just unfortunate the street noise was quite high or we could have opened the window , the hotel was very clean and staff very attentive the location was also fantastic for both the sights and the train station even though we had issues with the room temp we would almost definitely stay again 
188619,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Don t stay on the 6th floor If they put you there ask for another floor The ceiling cuts into the shower and you can t stand in the shower without hitting your head I literally had to shower on my knees They didn t seem to really care when I mentioned it either , Great location very convenient for walking to EVERYTHING in Paris Tons of shops and restaurants nearby 
188620,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Wifi wasn t good as kept disconnecting every time I locked my phone Surrounding area is not the friendliest either , Loved the breakfast Everything you could want before going off into Paris So close to metro station which got us into Paris quickly Staff were helpful and room was good enough for us 
188621,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Building work on the hotel kept us awake on the last morning , Amazing location So close to the metro and lots of lovely restaurants yet it was quite during the night as it s off the main road 
188622,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, on breakfast buffet write if there is lactose or gluten in things , AMAZING HOTEL very friendly staff very helpful muy buen hotel hotel tr s bien Molto bene fridge in room was very convenient very good breakfast buffet 
188623,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, lift was sooooooo small but it was ok , great little cosy hotel in a central location close to everything breakfast was fantastic id stay again no question
188624,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, The water wouldn t turn hot or even warm in the shower It was very frustrating to take a cold shower The room was not completely sound proof and I could hear the people in the room next to me a bit , The room was very neat clean quite big and the bed comfortable Big bathroom Everything renovated and for the money it s a very good room 
188625,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, almost everything noise elevator was out of service and you have to carry your luggage for 5 stories staff was not cooperative and the price is extremely high, NOTHING except the wall decoration inside room
188626,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, The beds could have been comfier they were very hard and it was 2 single beds pushed together , Breakfast was great Definitely worth the money Location was handy to everything and only a few minutes walk to the closest metro 
188627,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Paris prices if you are on a budget you need to shop around to find the more reasonably priced bars restaurants , Really good Hotel great location close to Gard De Nord Station we travelled there by Eurostar and its only about 10 minute walk to the Hotel with easy access to Metro Buses and onto the attractions throughout Paris Room was very clean and quiet and the Hotel staff were very helpful and professional Paris is wonderful Recommended 
188628,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Let me think No loved it all, All the staff were very helpful and welcoming The executive room was fantastic great shower My husband was very pleased to get a cooked breakfast the buffet was excellent This was our first visit to Paris and we would stay at this hotel again 
188629,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, But the shower is so tight that when I get in I cannot close the door My waist size is 36inches and I see no reason why it should be constructed like that The AC in the room did not cool the room properly , The hotel location is good It is close to shops and Gare De Nord train station which makes it easier to move around and get to the airport quickly The room I stayed in is quiet The room is very clean and the bed very comfortable The staff are nice too 
188630,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, the location is not very ideal a little far away from metro , Thanks to receptionist Marcel we have a very nice stay in Paris by the way the room is colourful and cozy 
188631,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, No room service no food other than breakfast room too small for 3 adults bathroom had only towels n soap worst room I stayed ever too expensive for what it is only one person at reception otherwise you ring a bell n wait , Mmm nothing really 
188632,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, We weren t told that the items in the bar fridge in the room were complimentary that would have been nice as we stayed there for 4 nights , Location was Ok Very good breakfast Rooms size for the 3 of us was OK 
188633,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Staff came across quite rude at times , Hotel was lovely and quiet perfect for a business trip Facilities were spot on so was the location and the room was spotless 
188634,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Our room was not ready when we arrived for check in and had to wait for a long time after what was a very tiring journey , Rooms are small but were comfortable 
188635,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards,No Negative, We found the location excellent with plenty of bars and restaurants It was also very near the metro for touring Paris The staff were particularly friendly and the breakfast was sourced with delicious local ingredients Would highly recommend it and would love to stay there again 
188636,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Quiet modern hotel We had a room on the sixth upper floor which was very quiet and quite spacious Modern look also with a modern bathroom Good bed Good shower Friendly personnel speaks English Excellent breakfast buffet Good location to Gare du Nord and metro plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby

188639,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards,No Negative, Barely had such a wonderful helping and especially child friendly staff ever Big congrats And the location is heaven with 3 different metros round the corner and almost every 10 meters a great restaurant to discover 
188640,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, The room was very small for a 4 star hotel but I guess this is something common in Paris The sound proofing needs immediate improvement though The description states that the rooms are soundproofed but they were definitely not , The Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards offered us an excellent value for money ratio especially considering the fact that our stay was during the Easter weekend and that our tariff included breakfast The staff was courteous and helpful and we were very satisfied by the cleanliness of our room At walking distance from sights such as the Louvre museum and the Sacre Coeur Basilica but the real upside of the location is that just 100m from the hotel rue de Chateau d Eau you can find some really vivid restaurant bars where mainly locals go 
188641,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Nothing really it was quiet well serviced and the room was characterful and comfortable , Felt like the hotel was hidden away but actually very well located for so much We arrived from Gare Du Nord on foot after a ten minute walk and then walked everywhere we wanted to with ease Notre Dame Centre Pompidou etc There is a great restaurant and bar literally outside the front door Try the Bronco for lovely surroundings and perfect French cuisine 
188642,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Room took time to get warm, The staff nadia victor were great felt right at home Any problems or directions they would help as much as they could 
188643,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Too far from all metro stations in a city like Paris Rooms and beds are small Lobby is very small for groups There are only four seats available There s no possibility to sit and make short meetings with the groups Shower was leaking after taking shower bathroom was floating all over , Check in was fast and smooth Bastien welcomed us and was friendly and helpful Check out was easy with Marcel Other staff was also friendly and helpful Hotel was clean and neat overall There are good restaurants and cafes around 
188644,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, Maybe lack of Paris view But we liked the neighbors and the street life , Pretty much everything The location is great with three metro lines in 5 minute walking distance The staff were marvelous welcoming and ready to assist you in every manner We like to say one huge thanks to Nadia she made our check in out process smooth ad easy A great value for the money 
188645,Mercure Paris Opera Grands Boulevards, We arrived from la Gare du Nord and then took the Metro to the suggested station in Hotel s page Chateau D Eau Walking in the neighborhood from there to the Hotel was quite disgusting , Small but clean rooms and excellent bed
