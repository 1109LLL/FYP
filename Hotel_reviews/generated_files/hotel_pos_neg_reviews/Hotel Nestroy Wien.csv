435729,Hotel Nestroy Wien, There was another building in front of the main hotel that we guided there This old building was good enough for our stay but was not lux as it was shown We must carry our heavy suitcases about 10 steps from elevators to floors , The hotel facilities meet all standards that it should have 
435730,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The breakfast is a little bit expensive , The location is great the room is clean and nice and you can find parking up to 9 00 am in the streets around if you do not want to use the hotel parking The staff in the front desk is excellent very halpfull 
435731,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, Good Value for money Property very clean and maintained throughout Room comfortable bathroom big very clean all facilities working properly No problems with WiFi login process speed connection anywhere on the property Very good buffet breakfast starts fairly early 6 30am Good location near city center and public transport Staff informative and helpful fast and seamless check in around midnight 
435732,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, The location is quite nice and exactly between two Metro stations as well as the Hop on hop off bus so easy to reach any destination within the city Some of the rooms are really great and spacious but some of them are quite small and have windows towards backyard with a house in front of it so watch out which room you are asking for and which one you will get 
435733,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The shower temperature was very difficult to regulate , We had a spacious well appointed corner room with a door to a rooftop terrace and everything we could require for our stay The staff were all very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English The hotel is very conveniently situated a few minutes from two underground stations an excellent bar and a twenty minute walk to the river 
435734,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, The hotel is very near a Metro station and one line takes you into the centre of Vienna What I particularly liked about this hotel is that it is not in the centre amongst a million other tourist hotels and tourists but is in a neighbourhood where real people live So you get a sense of the city from a more authentic angle Pleasant enough neighbourhood too although there are not many Viennese restaurants around The best I found was Leopold Essen Trinken which is quite near and has an outdoor eating area beside a church My room was also nice and quiet which I appreciated Hire a bike and cycle through the lovely long island park between the Danube and the canal 
435735,Hotel Nestroy Wien, I found black hair on toilet seat and shower siphon drain seems to be little bit clogged Overall those are the normal things that can happen , Location of the hotel is great it takes 15 20 min walking to the Centre Hotel also have garage across the street but decently priced I didn t use sauna because of the nature of my visit to Vienna but next time if I visit Vienna I d like to stay in the same hotel Lady receptionist Carina was very kind 
435736,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Nothing, Breakfast variety of choice the best breakfast buffet ever gluten free range if you request worth every penny Wifi Excellent experience staff Great gym and sauna with free towels slippers and bathrobe Coffee and tea machine Shaving kit for free at reception desk Welcome drink and late check out for genius members 2 minutes from metro or 10 15 min walking to city center Safe and quiet area Late check out option till 6pm Organic soap and shampoo Pure white clean towels and bed sheets We couldn t ask for more 
435737,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, Room was clean well equipped Love the towel bathrobes slippers Great to have coffee in room Would have liked separate soap shampoo conditioner rather than squeeze bottle in shower 
435738,Hotel Nestroy Wien, No full restaurant facilities no complimentary watter or biscuits No milk for tea Poor ventilation in room as aircon not effective , Good bed and reasonable sized room Very clean and excellent shower 
435739,Hotel Nestroy Wien, I am a little bit dissapointed I forgot my sunglaces and wallplate at the room When I mentoined this I turn to the hotel They try to ask and find and I got answer that there was nothing in our room But I know where this things stay and where So sorry but it is not goos experience , All was very ok I suggest to visit sauna also good poosibility to relax 
435740,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Hard to locate especially by car No swimming pool or or bath My room was on the ground floor but with full glass window Near to the restaurant it was bit noisy, Its near to public transportation smily n helpful staff 
435741,Hotel Nestroy Wien, No lactose free products for breakfast like yoghurt butter cheese and so on , A coffee maschine in the room with coffee capsules spacious bathroom and room 
435742,Hotel Nestroy Wien, We were put in a noisy room at front of hotel on first night Woke up by builders at 4 30am Next morning they changed our room to the back no problem , convenient location for us Staff were very helpful and friendly room was comfortable 
435743,Hotel Nestroy Wien, They fool me and charged me and gave a wrong stinky dirty room The room I booked was bigger and with a double bed but they gave me an attic with 2 single beds next to each other Nobody was responsible for they mistake and I had to pay for one night to cancel and leave the hotel because of their fault Booking com was also not responsible because what I read before booking about room was different with the room I got and nobody helped to get the room which I payed already I m not satisfied with booking com too And U lost 2 of ur costumers who booked hotels every week , Nothing
435744,Hotel Nestroy Wien, We had a few issues with rhe check in procedure and with our room I travelled with my family me my wife and our 1 year child Such as our daughter is too yang I reserved and paid for a double room as usual it was in many other hotels in another cities and countries where we were with our little daughter Moreover during my reservation I mentioned that we don t need any additional bed breakfast and etc for a child But after I paid for the double room the receptionist sent to me a e mail with info that there are max 2 persons possible you need to change to a family room 30 supplement per night Next during the check in procedure the receptionist forced us to paid these additional 30 per night for the family room it was 60 for 2 nights Next when we were in our family room there was a bed for a kidult but not for a little baby and we could not use this staff anyway Also there were a shower cabine instead of a bath as was in a picture for a double room and we could not to give our 1 year old daughter a bath Moreover there were a current of air from the window that is not good for a child and family room Finaly It seems the family room that was provided actually was not an appropriate family room Moreover I gues the hotel is oriented on their own rules but not on the customers requirements e g as I mentioned above Also there were problems with water supply temperature And the water closet lid was broken in the room, REALLY awesome breakfast not so far away from the old town
435745,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The reception staff could be nicer after a 5 hour long drive the receptionist wasn t the friendliest Also my name was missing from the reservation and only the guest accompanying me had this name in the reservation No toileteries , Room was very nice big and clean Walkable 20 min distance from old town 
435746,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Nothing to complain about just would have been better if the location was closer to popular destinations in Vienna , We had to take public transport to most destinations but they were not far 
435747,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The beds were hard the pillows terrible they offered no support or comfort The Hotel wasn t close to the main attractions of Vienna it was a good 25 to 30 min walk to see main attractions , The Hotel rooms were large it had a good gym sauna area 
435748,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Be careful at check in and check out as my card was charged extra for currency exchange even though I stated that the card was in Euros and that I wanted to be charged in Euros A mistake from staff which made me pay more that I should Contacted a manager afterwards but he was of no help , Nice hotel in a good location 
435749,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Although it was a four star reservation it felt more like 3 Nothing exceptional about the accommodation In the second morning there were some workers drilling 7 30 in the morning The two beds stuck together were a little uncomfortable because of the space between them and the bathtub could do with a little maintenance , The reservation was all set up on time and no problems Friendly staff who speak proper english
435750,Hotel Nestroy Wien, English news channel available but could include one English movie channel , The hotel is very clean lots of amenities and close 2 minute walk to bus tram and subway 
435751,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The breakfast is quite expensive even if it is very good and plenty of choices, Very nice Hotel in strategic position 2 different station are near and on different lines Comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast
435752,Hotel Nestroy Wien, We had an attic room on the other side of the street It was pretty small cold we asked for extra blankets and accomodations were not worth a 4 stars hotel rather a 2 3 stars I guess the rooms in the main building are a lot nicer It seems like there are 2 categories of room in this hotel we didn t know about , Very close to U Bahn Taborstrasse station Rooms are clean Main building is nice My advice ask for a room in the main building if possible 
435753,Hotel Nestroy Wien, It was too hot in the room we didnt figure out how to turn the heating down, Was cool everything clean which was the most important quiet comfy bed friendly stuff
435754,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Room didn t seem too clean and for a 4 star hotel we would have appreciated some little touches We were in the building opposite the main entrance and made the use of facilities in the main building a bit difficult, Very good location room was spacious though not very big Bed was very comfortable 
435755,Hotel Nestroy Wien, We booked a price offer which I appreciate but the room we were given was facing a wall which was never stated or implied On top it was at a building across the street from the main one of the hotel which had no reception So the feeling is a bit weird a bit like a hostel perhaps I think customers should be made aware and be given the chance Other than that all good , We only stayed for 2 nights so can t say I have a thorough view but it is an easy going place clean professional good size room and bathroom comfortable bed Breakfast was above average too I think All was in good working order and staff was very polite 
435756,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Our room had a shared inner balcony which was often used as a shortcut by guests from surrounding rooms It was pretty uncomfortable to either have the curtains closed all the time or be seen by the children running outside in the morning Some sort of fence or hurdle would improve privacy IMO , Location of the hotel is excellent just few steps from the very city center while keeping nois level pretty low
435757,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The bed was supposed to be for a couple but they are two single beds next to each other and separate half size blankets so you are essentially in two separate beds You fall into the crack in the middle of the bed when you try to sleep together , Great location modern clean and nice hotel As an American it was very similar to hotels there and I was very comfortable The rooms were nice and the bed was comfortable 
435758,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Parking for 22 night is a bit on the pricey side, Very nice staff uncomplicated check in out located near the city center Wifi very good Did not check out the Sauna Spa area 
435759,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The toilet seat had some brown marks when we lifted it up but the receptionist came up and sorted it out really quickly One of the lights didn t work in our bathroom but it was eventually fixed Also the cleaning staff didn t leave us a new set of toiletries the next day , Most of the staff were so friendly and really made the effort to make our stay pleasant Rather than waiting for us to ask questions they very welcoming and approachable The sauna was lovely location was great and so easy to access Also there is life at night time and it is not stark silent outside too 
435760,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, Good Value for money The room was standard but comfortable bathroom was nice everything cleaned up properly good location and the staff was also nice We had no problem at all 
435761,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The AC did not work at all We also ended up waiting around a while to check in because even though check in begins at 2 they didn t have our room ready till 2 30 , The location was great for the price and the rooms were very nice clean and comfortable 
435762,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The bed was not comfortable The wifi did not work out last night The cable did not work on the second tv the entire 3 nights we stayed And we got talked into an upgrade for a fee but it was the only room they had for us in the first place so we shouldn t have had to pay , It was clean Close to the underground Decent price for ammenities 
435763,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, Parking is very convenient just across the street and in a secure garage The parking is not cheap but seems about average for Vienna Our room was large and comfortable and also fairly quiet considering how good the location is 
435764,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Location is good if you decide to use underground system to get around Otherwise you are a good 15 20 minute walk from most major attractions, Clean quiet and newly renovated room Windows opened onto a courtyard permitting fresh air without street noise 
435765,Hotel Nestroy Wien,No Negative, The employee were very helpful The room was gorgeous spacious clean tidy The gym was good as well which I never expected All in all my experience was great
435766,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The parking price 22euro night it s a bit to much therefore because I arrived at 8pm the car was parked on street so I only had to pay 2euro h until 10pm cause after it was free until next day at 8am, I did liked Location Helpful staff Room size
435767,Hotel Nestroy Wien, Wi fi Because of i couldnt use some apps I shoulded download vpn for open them , Hotel really deserve more points Room is clean staff are friendly Coctails are yummy Special thanks to MIRI She was helpful and lovely 
435768,Hotel Nestroy Wien, The WiFi was really bad in my room I had to go to the reception in order to get something done 18 euros per person per day for breakfast is way too much Instead I just went to a nice Viennese cafe for breakfast , The room was quite good and clean and I am very happy for the money I paid The staff was nice not friendly like in a hostel but better than the usual cold staff hotels have The location is not bad at all It is in Leopoldstadt which is still old Vienna and a 15 walk takes you to the historical centre 
435769,Hotel Nestroy Wien, We booked a Junior Supirior Suite The 2nd double bed was a sleeping couch This was very small for 2 adults and not so flat , Value for money was great Nice big bathroom with bath Spacious room
