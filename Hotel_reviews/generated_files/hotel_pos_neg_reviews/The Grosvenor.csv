26350,The Grosvenor, My room wasn t ready until close to 5pm and we had arrived around noon and had asked for early check in so that was disappointing Check in time was 3pm , Staff was very helpful with any requests we made Recommend the executive level for the extra s provided to the guests The room was clean and wasn t just a hotel room had a den feel so that was nice Location of hotel was perfect for our needs 
26351,The Grosvenor, Shower was mouldy Room was dusty Bedside light not working vanity mirror in bathroom broken Two other lights in room not working Tv screen was to dark and couldn t adjust table in Grosvenor Arms was wonky the staff in the Arms were miserable and the food menu was too limited , Bed was great
26352,The Grosvenor, Took a long time to check in and also when we ordered breakfast vouchers at the desk it seemed to take a long time There was a lack of drawer space in the bedroom ,No Positive
26353,The Grosvenor, Could use a ramp to get our suitcases up to the lobby It d be hard for older people and those with little kids with strollers to manage, The cantonese restaurant was a nice place to have dinner We ve missed eating asian foods by the time we got to Grosvenor and was happy to find this restaurant 
26354,The Grosvenor, I would have appreciated option of an early check in even for a fee after arriving off an overnight flight, Staff were helpful and hotel location was great
26355,The Grosvenor, Good visit other than the alarm in the evening Hotel evacuation due to fire alarm and the alarm in the room didn t go off and i was left asleep Very disappointing that this could happen Wheres the safety in this ,No Positive
26356,The Grosvenor, Calling reception or the Concierge the phone would just ring and ring but if you called in on the external line you were answered immediately , The location is fantastic and would definitely stay there again 
26357,The Grosvenor, Overall a bit grubby Had to ask for bathroom to be cleaned when I arrived Had asked for a quiet room and was given a room backing on to the very noisy train station Hotel is two interconnected buildings with a lot of stairs to climb Not suitable for those unable to walk a lot and climb stairs , Good location and friendly staff Nice lobby area Good sized room Wifi was fine 
26358,The Grosvenor, The tiny bedroom bathroom I could hardly move in the bathroom There were only 3 channels available on TV There was no index on the phone or in a folder so I could not ring reception or anyone else I needed to No fire escape plan on the door etc etc , Location
26359,The Grosvenor, Furnitures are old with scratches and debts Flight of stairs up to lobby had to carry luggage by self TV is old remote not working Air conditioner needed maintenance man to get it working Staff doesn t answer phone rang 6 times before got an answer Rubbish not emptied out from room no water bottles replenish , Maintenance and room service staff very helpful once able to contact them 
26360,The Grosvenor, I have never stayed at a hotel with rooms so small It is disgusting Felt so claustrophobic I cannot believe it , It was clean and tidy and location was good for where we needed to be Although the noise from the train station next door was loud 
26361,The Grosvenor, I wish that I had known that the hotel was not only near Victoria Station but actually connects to it , Amazing location connects right to Victoria Station So beautiful and a grand entrance gorgeous lobby Rooms were nice and clean and roomier than expected Breakfast was delicious 
26362,The Grosvenor, The curtains didn t meet in the room so very light and very noisy from the train station had a awful nights sleep Bar closed very early so only cocktail bar available very expensive and sat for20 minutes and didn t get served so went to the pub over the road instead, The hotel is very well positioned for convenience to local attractions and very grand entrance lobby
26363,The Grosvenor, Hotel is little rundown Lighting is poor Reception area is poor and small No front gate concierge service For the price it was disappointing Example they didn t have a spare bottle opener to leave in the room , Tube access from within hotel 
26364,The Grosvenor, bathroom was very small even though there was only me in the room There is ongoing reconstruction work in the Victoria area until 2018 doesn t really affect the hotel but congestion at the moment is very bad particularly if one is in taxis around the area the delay pushes the taxi cost up , bed was very comfortable pillows could do with at least one being firm very handy to get a range of transport to other places as the train coach and daily bus service and taxis are all on the hotel doorstep One can if fit walk to many points of interest such as the Palaces Westminster Abbey Cathedral London Eye and much more There are 2 theatres just across the road from the hotel
26365,The Grosvenor, There was a small flood in the bathroom and the green light for service required was turned on in the afternoon but no one attended the room there were durty trays with dirty dishes in the corridor near our room but whole day no one attended the left overs in front of other guests room front desk employee was acting not really professional about accomodating us in the room before we actually pay for the room so we stayed for 2 hours in the lobby of the hotel in order to solve the card limit issue instead of doing it in the room , 
26366,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Excellent location beside Victoria train station and the Apollo theatre also a short walk to Buckingham Palace Trafalgar Square within walking distance too 
26367,The Grosvenor, Miss the hot full English breakfast they used to serve in the Executive lounge when we stayed before , Lovely atmosphere excellent staff in executive lounge
26368,The Grosvenor, Absolutely unresponsive staff Air conditioner in my room was not working For the consecutive days they didn t corrected it When things become our of control they put a pedestal fan instead of changing the room or correcting the ac Any call to room service would talk even days to service So little options in breakfast and absolutely nil options for vegetarians Overall very bad experience, Location is the only selling point fir this hotel
26369,The Grosvenor, We were on the 7th floor this involved using two different lifts and along walk Not easy when you have luggage and walking difficulties We were not told when we booked in what the distance to the room was If we had we would have asked for a different room , Comfy bed very helpful staff
26370,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The room had obviously been refurbished recently and was very Nice The bathroom although small had all one required and was elegant Was very impressed With the staff in reception They were extemely friendly and polite and were keen to give their guests the best service possible all in all would recommend this hotel and will recommend it to friends 
26371,The Grosvenor, The staff were barely able to grasp English and had poor customer service attitudes At 10 30pm our table were advised that we had to eat up as they needed to clear away to prepare for breakfast Having just arrived from Italy where the serving staff could not have been more accommodating helpful and friendly the attitudes exhibited by The Grosvenor staff was poor and unwelcoming An example the concierge staff looked on as our party struggled up the entrance stairs and through the doors both on arrival and exit No offer of assistance was made nor was any offer to take our luggage up to our rooms For a hotel aspiring to be 4 5 stars the service was poor and the food and drinks over priced This is a large hotel and the breakfast self serving area is very small The lack of attentiveness by waiting staff continued to breakfast time where consistently we had to go and ask for coffee refills , Nothing
26372,The Grosvenor, The odour of damp in the underground toilet facilities needs to be addressed also there were no anticepic wipes to clean machines after use in the gym which I found most unusual our friends room was very small and we found the access between the two building blocks very confusing and complicated,No Positive
26373,The Grosvenor, The 2nd floor executive lounge , Room 428 has squeaky floors and the bedroom floor is slightly slanted so with the bed orientation the way it is we found the head pillows lower than the foot even with 2 pillows We didn t get our cookies the second night and we almost ran out of toilet paper 
26374,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The hotel was fantastic friendly staff and it was very comfortable We will return when we are next in London My 7 year old said This hotel is TOO posh Mummy 
26375,The Grosvenor, Breakfast was appalling , The room was excellent however I paid 300 and a few weeks later booking Com offered 53 discount of which I was unable to take advantage of 
26376,The Grosvenor, bathroom very small due to my disabilities i need a walk in shower , bed very comfortable room was spacious back door of hotel goes in to the Victoria train station which has lots of stores cafes excellent location for transport and tourist sightseeing
26377,The Grosvenor,No Negative, My 4th time staying here best hotel in London Staff is serviceminded rooms are luxurious and the location is golden I will return next time I come to London 
26378,The Grosvenor, Very poor access for disabled There was no ramp and my wife who travels in a wheelchair but can walk a few steps had to climb about 8 steps up to the front door Once inside there was lift access to our room There was a notice outside the hotel requesting disabled people to ring for access But the bell had been removed as had any previous lift or ramp , The room was well appointed I think we were upgraded because of our difficulties with access 
26379,The Grosvenor, Finding room, Clean comfortable bed and shower facilities the best and no fuss Only minus was looking for room on 7th floor where a change of lift was necessary but only there for 1 night so got the hang of it when we left Room was very quiet considering next to train station
26380,The Grosvenor, Breakfast service was indifferent Waited a long time to be seated and the staff were not very friendly We had to ask for our Tea 3 times Quite a few things had run out, The staff were very helpful
26381,The Grosvenor, Do not stay if 1 You have luggage there is no place for your car to stop on the road and our request for someone to help us with the luggage up the stairs was ignored Your car will have to park opposite the hotel in a side road and you will have to push your luggage across a busy road and thronging sidewalks whereupon you then have the further privilege of carrying luggage up the stairs on your own Request for assistance will be ignored Same applies when you check out 2 You have children who watch television the television channels do not work They did offer to change us to a room with working television channels if extra amounts were paid 3 You watch the news for the same reasons cited above Television is an extra cost that you have to pay for 4 Travel with companions only one set of towels was provided despite a family booking A request for extra sets was met with a direction to look in the cupboard We found one extra set therein which after our hunt was still insufficient 5 You want a normal bed beds were set on wheels and moved away from the headboard as the night passed I would have liked to give a score of zero if possible , It was connected to Victoria station so could be useful when coming in from Gatwick BUT the lift for luggage was not working and there is no one to help with the luggage 
26382,The Grosvenor,No Negative, After a 5 day tour of UK this was our last stop for the night it is a fabulous hotel very comfy beds and great bar for refreshments It is in a great location near to many restaurants and tourist attractions 
26383,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Much more than I anticipated this hotel is very elegant but also welcoming The staff are all so approachable and helpful and the rooms are very spacious and extremely comfortable 
26384,The Grosvenor, Having to justify my booking Being provided a room with faulty air conditioning Having to endure a full night in a very uncomfortable room , We had difficulties with our accommodation initially upon arrival but hotel staff did as much as possible to placate our concerns Our main concerns related to faulty air conditioning and poor signage related to wing rooming Despite booking well in advance we were informed that the hotel was full when we arrived at the hotel We were required to prove our booking as the hotel records appeared to have no information at all Restaurant meals at the hotel were excellent and hotel staff were extremely attentive and sympathetic concerning isssues 
26385,The Grosvenor, Hair and strain on bedding they had to be replaced I enquire about bf then gave a voucher which we didn t use to be told we still had to pay im still awaiting the money to leave the bank and find out the correct amount or not, Comfortable
26386,The Grosvenor,No Negative, We stayed in a suite which offers you access to their executive lounges Complimentary breakfast in the morning and happy hour from 5 8 every evening This was definitely a bonus we hadn t counted on We are booked again on our return stay after our cruise finishes 
26387,The Grosvenor, The rooms are old and let the hotel down The bathroom needs updating very tired looking old 2 3 bathroom in a supposedly 4 hotel , Location was very good 
26388,The Grosvenor, The only marginal complaint was the sofabed The frame was not good so the bed was more like a V than flat , The location at Victoria Station was a plus for us as we were travelling via Gatwick airport and the express train made it easy to get too The proximity to Buckingham palace Parliament Westminster Abbey and other tourist attractions was great for evening walks Plenty of food choices in the area Room was clean and the master bed was comfortable 
26389,The Grosvenor, Semen on the bed cover Dirty bath room too small had to move the bed to be able to move around better and the carpet beneath was vile Overall a fantastic building in a great location let down by poor cleaning and out dated facilities The kettle had insects in it too Old ones , I have mobility issues and owing to the location of the original room allocation it was changer without question which is nice 
26390,The Grosvenor, Room was a little on the small side but being central London I think that is the norm Didn t take the breakfast option at 30 each we tried different cafes each morning instead plenty around, Comfortable clean and affordable for such a great location access to transport was easy you are right at Victoria Station The Grosvenor is a nice classic London style hotel and I would stay there again the foyer is amazing 
26391,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Great venue can arrive via plane and Gatwick express can leave bag while doing other business in city or visit to dentist etc Taxi at door helpful staff always stay here 
26392,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Bar staff were very friendly and the bar didn t shut to early Also room service was excellent On top of everything else the location was amazing with a train station next door you had access to the whole city
26393,The Grosvenor, There was nothing not to like A suggestion if the hotel had a casual eatery coffee shop open all hours we would have used that too We booked room only and did have a drink in the bar The hotel manages to maintain a certain calm despite being next to the station and all the tourist mayhem , Location x 3 There is also a hotel entrance direct from the station concourse Ideal place if you are coming to London from Gatwick and want to minimize the time figuring out where to leave your luggage how long to leave for travelling between hotel and airport etc Plus Victoria Station has lots of surprising shops that are represented around the concourse M guessing these are for busy weekday commuters These are quieter at the weekend We also squeezed in a trip to Brighton and back on Sunday afternoon Yes it s really possible An hour each way travel time We extended our stay at the hotel to cover our whole London trip This was our first time staying in a Victoria hotel I see the advantages of doing so again 
26394,The Grosvenor, The TV had very poor fuzzy picture The iPod dock only connected to pre lightning cable apple products with no aux to connect anything else The photo of the room was clearly taken with a wide angle lenses as it was much smaller than photographed the photo attached shows true size , The bedding was very high thread count incredibly soft and luxurious The staff were lovely polite and helpful
26395,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Well maintained classic old hotel right next to Victoria Station and had excellent price for fantastic executive suite with huge sitting room bathroom in addition to bedroom 
26396,The Grosvenor, For a deluxe room it wasn t very deluxe Very small and no view and on the 6th floor where only one of the elevators would go, The building was gorgeous and all the staff very helpful We visited the Grosvenor arms and had some wine and cocktails which were very much enjoyed
26397,The Grosvenor, Some of the reception staff were unable to understand requests in English , Concierge was fab we travelled with my niece who became ill during a trip out to a restaurant near the hotel the concierge lent up a wheelchair to get her back to the hotel such a great help 
26398,The Grosvenor, the first room we were offered had no windows in either the bath or bedrooms , We paid extra and were upgraded the room we stayed in was the height of luxury complete with claw foot bath and double aspect full length windows 
26399,The Grosvenor, The receptionist had such a strong accent east european that I couldn t understand what she was saying The room had no direct access from the elevator so we had to carry our luggage stroller and baby up stairs The bathroom shower didn t have functioning cold water The mirror in the bathroom was cracked The bed was old and uncomfortable and the white curtains were almost black , The entrance to the hotel is impressive 
26400,The Grosvenor, Our room was as we expected but in the bathroom the shower curtain was missing plus the pedal bin had not be emptied from the previous occupants This was rectified when the room was serviced the next day , The property was in the ideal area for our short break We were booked on a day trip with Belmond and an exit at the Hotel leads straight on to Victoria Station from where the Belmond train departed 
26401,The Grosvenor, Cramped room on 7th floor of Wing Block was it a single room with a large bed We ll never know just wish UK hotels all put room grades charges in each rooms like they do in some other EU countries Bars are dated Baths impossible for an elderly person to get into or out of why not walk in showers , Good for Victoria station ground floor is quite impressive but the long corridors upstairs are a throw back to the mid 20th century 
26402,The Grosvenor, there was a really strange noise going on for the whole night which was pretty loud I can still hear it even with my ear plugs on and the shower has broken down , perfect location
26403,The Grosvenor, Only 5 tv channels no movies indifferent staff and too few in the pathetic restaurant Not worth the high price , The bed was very comfortable And it was handy being so close to Victoria station for getting around and for fast food 
26404,The Grosvenor, Nothing really There were no staff to assist with luggage carrying stuff but I guess most European hotels are like that , Staff very friendly Location superb Room spacious compared to other hotels of the same level The entrance lobby are really majestic it felt like a palace 
26405,The Grosvenor, Smalllest room ever for 2 persons Two different elevators and lots av walking within the hotel corrido by corridor to reach the room 663 Had to back in the room because of idiotic door construction Will not recommend You can have a similar room for half the price 75 steps away , Location Initial view and first attitude Classical music in lobby Great calming Quiet room in the night 
26406,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Slight problem with our reservation Brilliantly handled by both receptionist and Booking Com thank you to both Good atmosphere and wonderful surroundings 
26407,The Grosvenor, Nothing could have made our stay any better, The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble The room was comfortable clean and we loved the comfort of the bed 
26408,The Grosvenor, 20 upgrade was a joke as room and bed were small Adjoining door to next room was unlocked Carpet in 155 was stained and breakfast tasted as if it had been cooked for 3 days Woken next morning to the sound of the station announcements Check in for two rooms already booked took far too long , Historic old building which public rooms looked very nice 
26409,The Grosvenor, I couldn t eat breakfast and paid on room number I had to go to the room for the money and pay breakfast there not at the end of staying in hotel I felt like untrust guest, Hotel s ambient
26410,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The room was small but comfortable The bed was very comfortable Fantastic place to stay for our trip on the Orient Express from the station the following day Loved the fact that they have an entrance inside Victoria station 
26411,The Grosvenor, The room was just ok Not nearly as grand or elegant as what you d expect from the looks of the lobby It lacked charm but was fine for what we needed as we only stayed one night , The hotel lobby is gorgeous The location is ideal as we were traveling to Gatwick airport the following morning and Victoria station is literally next store Absolutely the best location for us We walked to Hyde Park and the Chelsea neighborhood from here it was lovely weather and we really enjoyed being able to explore on foot 
26412,The Grosvenor, 250 for 1 night in a standard double room Been in bigger rooms in an ibis or travel lodge for a 1 3 of the price The room was noisy heard every announcement from the train station tannoy Also heard the very loud noise from the Wetherspoons inside the station might as well been at the pub myself not trying to get a good night s sleep comoletely ruined our romantic night away , 
26413,The Grosvenor, The hotel and the rooms in particular are looking rather tired The room I was initially given was very small and whilst the second room was better they are not as advertised there is no docking station for example in the rooms This should not be stated as a facility in the room if it is not in fact available , Comfortable beds and staff were helpful
26414,The Grosvenor, Room facilities did not work TV only channels 1 5 and most were not tuned in Kettle had to be moved across room to be plugged in Room extremely noisey All night long absoloutley no sleep and reception customer services uninterested on check out Only feed back we had was a copy and pasted generic response Couldn t even be bothered to fix font or colour to disguise the fact it was indeed copied and pasted , Check in was welcoming concierge friendly and helpful Room size decor and cleanliness was lovely Breakfast nice 
26415,The Grosvenor, My bedroom was over the restaurant so the smell of the extractor fan was rather unpleasant , The staff were very friendly and helpful The hotel is impressive and the room comfortable and clean 
26416,The Grosvenor, Slightly confusing lights configuration switch control , Had a room on the front of the hotel and the windows were well insulated so traffic noise wasn t an issue Room service was fast and reasonable value Wifi was quick and bathroom was well appointed Bed was comfortable and slept very well 
26417,The Grosvenor, Hi Ive stayed here many times but this last time was awful I ended up staying in room 611 which proved to be a nightmare due to outside noises that started from 4am The noise was so bad that I couldn t sleep and had to change rooms during the early hours of the morning Imagine roaming the halls of a hotel in your sleepwear to find a new room and I wasn t offered any apologies at all which was disappointing , Handy location to Victoria Station
26418,The Grosvenor, When the air con wasn t on the room and bathroom got hot fast , Beautiful hotel at an affordable price friendly and helpful staff clean and luxurious rooms great easy access to Victoria Station and Underground 
26419,The Grosvenor, The bar was unnecessarily expensive 11 45 for a G T , We ve stayed here before and love this hotel The location is spot on and the staff are great 
26420,The Grosvenor, When it comes to the check in I cannot been ask for a passport check if I am living in the UK under a special standard of forces agreement Moreover I booked via a UK debit card therefore I am recognized like the other UK citizenship So telly poor preparation of the staff You need to be careful when you ask I d check to certain officials,No Positive
26421,The Grosvenor, I requested a accessible room for my Mum and was given a room located by the lifts however we were given a shower over a bath which wasn t ideal Staff aren t really friendly and especially in Chinese restaurant where I was made to feel uncomfortable about the putting the bill on my room and was given the gluten free menu but items weren t gluten free and when I informed the staff of this they said it needed updating This is very bad and could result in someone being very ill Also found the prices very expensive with a small bottle of water charged at 4 40 , Location
26422,The Grosvenor, Beds could have been more comfortable , Lovely big room we did have a family of 3 though fantastic location as we could walk to the ANZAC Dawn Service at Hyde Park Corner Location also fabulous with regard to Victoria Train Station which we never heard any noise from Would definitely stay again if we return to London 
26423,The Grosvenor, After the extravagant entrance lobby and the high ceilings on each level you reach your room to realise that it is average at best with modern hotels putting there bathrooms before the bedroom thus allowing for a sound barrier from the hall to the sleeping area reducing noise pollution this is not the case at the grosvenor your bed is 6 feet from the door and the noise of the hallway the grand original sash windows single glazed which looked great but provide no protection from the noise of the city below with the sounds as if the window where open at times the bathroom is small with an even smaller narrow corridor to get to it The shower in the bathroom is set over a narrow bath and to get the full affect of the shower head a person has to stand with one foot on the bend of the bath and lean in where it starts to curve really no need for baths on these premises I would opt for a walk in shower which would give more space lastly the television in the room had very poor signal and picture the channel list set on the television by the grosvenor which lets you know which channel to expect with each number has several channels that are not available as advertised , Great location attached to Victoria station easy access to the tube rail links taxis and buses 
26424,The Grosvenor, We had to wait an hour for our room was not ready though we turned up half an hour after the check in time Though the guest relations officer offered us free breakfast for our stay in lieu the room allotted was dingy and musty my son who is allergic to dust started coughing immediately Overall the staff had smiles on their faces but didn t seem particularly interested in us or maybe they were too busy looking after other guests I would not rate this place value for money I would rate it one star for the convenient location , The only redeeming quality is the location 
26425,The Grosvenor, Room was very rough around the edges especially the bathroom Lots of dust on top of headboards etc We found pieces of rubbish on the carpet Ironing board was very difficult to operate Lighting in the room was not great , Beds were very comfortable We had a family room which was had lots of space Staff were really nice Location was fantastic Lots of
26426,The Grosvenor, Television was completely old fashioned with about 10 networks not working Having Russia Today as the only news channel is not really acceptable We signalled the issue to the personnel without satisfactory solution being implemented Bathroom would deserve serious update , Location style and hotel architecture is worth the visit Room was quiet despite proximity with Victoria station 
26427,The Grosvenor, The configuration of the hotel was complicated and we seemed to walk along way up and down stairs with our bag Needs better explanation Breakfast is expensive , It was very handy for our evening function The access to the station was good 
26428,The Grosvenor, Was told couldn t use Gourmet Society card for meal but when referred could that is the only negative about the hotel everything else excellent, Size of room and cleanliness
26429,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The Concierge and hotel staff are friendly and helpful The beds and bedding are excellent You can t beat the location an easy walk to many famous sites 
26430,The Grosvenor, Nothing, The rooms and layout food was good staff was very help full location great right next to victory station Prices of room was good couldn t fault hotel or staff We would definitely stay again
26431,The Grosvenor, There was nothing I disliked specifically about the hotel , Booked for London Marathon Location was ideal near finish and Victoria station Had lovely stay staff very helpful and room good size clean and comfortable family room Staff were very friendly and helping throughout my 3 day stay They even left me a note wishing me luck in the marathon Would stay here again 
26432,The Grosvenor, We prefer a walk in shower rather than one over a bath and this one had a panel which allowed water to escape onto the floor , Our initial meeting with the receptionist from Bulgaria was very friendly and welcoming The room was extremely comfortable and spacious and the use of the executive lounge was very pleasant 
26433,The Grosvenor, Next time yes would stay there again would ask if they had a room with walk in shower, The staff very friendly and they moved us to another room where we did not have to walk up and down stairs all good
26434,The Grosvenor,No Negative, This was a weekend break with my 7yr old daughter and couldn t have picked a better place to stay We upgraded on arrival so made the stay extra special There was a little treat and note in our room on arrival which was such a lovely touch Room was beautiful Overall a fab stay
26435,The Grosvenor, I booked a triple Executive room and it should have had a sofa bed in the room Instead we were given a small room with no sofa and a folding bed was crammed in to the room Very disappointing We weren t offered an alternative to this no other room or discount for the inferior room , The main bed was really comfy Room very clean and quiet 
26436,The Grosvenor, We arrived at 2pm Checkin time is 3pm At 3pm they said the room was not ready because the previous occupier had left their luggage in it Tired we lay around until 4 10pm before being able to enter our room and lay down We stayed 8 nights and could not get BBC 24hr News on our TV They offered to change our room but the new one had the same problem They then offered an upgrade at 70 pound a night in effect just to see BBC 24hr News They said it was to do with changing from analogue to digital If so it did not occur in the time we were there and they will have to change over at some time why the delay We did not have Wifi for over a 24hr period and after being fixed one had to keep reconnecting all the time and often unsuccessfully , The staff especially Sean and Lawrence made up for the problems with the Wifi and TV The Executive Lounge was excellent both for food and service The position alongside Victoria Station has great advantages for travelling by Train Undeground Bus Coach Taxi or just walking A walk in Medical Centre is 30 metres away but costs 78 pound sterling by card for an overseas visitor for a 15 min consult 
26437,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Hi I booked one night at the Grosvenor Hotel between April 13 and 14 2017 This stay was a gift for my mum and 8 year old daughter They went to Harry Potter Studios on the 13th and were due to return to London Centre late that evening I cannot tell you how amazing the staff at the Grosvenor were They answered all my questions and ensure that my mum and daughter had a wonderful time They provided them with a beautiful room on the 4th floor and a very delicious breakfast I am grateful to the staff for making an extra effort for my family and making their experience a memorable one My mum does not speak English but someone at the hotel that speaks Spanish was there to help her stay easier Thank you for all the little details that made a difference in their stay and in my peace of mind Whether you will visit the Grosvenor for a special occasion or wish to surprise a love one I can assure you this is an excellent choice 
26438,The Grosvenor, Couldn t work out the air con Room was very warm no matter what temp I set couldn t find an instruction sheet Only had a short stay just put up with it Our room was in the wing next to Victoria station so we heard announcements they stopped about 9pm Didn t start again until 7am so no big deal us we were up at 7 to go sight seeing , Close to Buckingham palace Right next to Victoria Station Clean rooms
26439,The Grosvenor, No parking facilities or defined drop off zone Hot water system was a bit unclear to operate resulted in a few cool showers, Beautiful hotel great staff and service that far exceeded our expectations
26440,The Grosvenor, Hot breakfast in the executive lounge would be nice used to serve full English but no longer Also one tiny issue for me would like a saucer with my cup both in room and lounge which I thought would be normal in a four star hotel , Great location very pleasant helpful staff always stay at this hotel when in London Good choice of bars and restaurants to suit my needs 
26441,The Grosvenor, NO dislikes at all Our first stay during this trip we had some luggage issues waiting for it to be brought to the room took a long while so we went down to get them ourselves due to needing to dress for an event but out second stay was perfect no complaints so guessing the luggage issue was isolated maybe just a busy check in time , LOVED this place will re book for summer trip We stated here at the beginning of our trip before going on to Glasgow for a few nights and then had 2 last nights back in London with another Hotel for the last two nights but after 1 night at the other location which was nice but not comfortable temperature bed service wise we booked the last night back here had to pay extra for the room last minute but was provided a room that was a bit larger thought in our same room category Sean checked us in and he was super helpful friendly and funny The rooms are spacious beds are super comfortable better than mine at home and the AC worked like a dream The in room amenities were great and they have a lovely room service menu for that late night snack wonderful location you can reach it from inside the Victoria Station Beautiful property location and rooms After 8 years of coming to London 2 or 3 times a year this property is not the most inexpensive I ve stayed but for all the Amenities and location its well worth the slight extra price We come to London a few times a year and will look no further than Grosvenor Hotel in the future 
26442,The Grosvenor, A large king sized bed mentioned was in fact two single beds put together which was not great Main Shopping areas were not in walking distance Breakfast was Ok but same everyday Room was ok for a couple but not enough for a family with children , Location was ok close to metro and bus station but not so close to shopping district Staff was good special thanks to Vishruta and Sean 
26443,The Grosvenor, Very short staffed at breakfast Only managed one cup of tea as no staff free to ask for top up No small platest and had to ask for eggs , Very friendly staff who were helpful
26444,The Grosvenor, the shower shield in the bathroom is very small and thus almost impossible not to spill out water while showering room 302 , executive lounge location spacious room
26445,The Grosvenor, Someone to bring up the bags when we got into the room we waited but after 20 minutes just went down ourselves to find where thtley stored our luggage So we could change for dinner and the theater , Room was spacious clean and lovely all around Large for any city especially for London Nice bath and located right outside if Victoria train and tube stop so easy to get around to other parts of the city 
26446,The Grosvenor, On arrival was given a double room that was actually 2 single beds pushed together which inevitably separated constantly After complaining was moved to a real double room Like a lot of UK hotels the quality of the room does not come close to those of a similar price overseas The in room TV choice is appalling and there was no TV remote control in the room until requested The bed was comfy but the provided pillows are next to useless The shower was distinctly average and housed in an overly small bathroom Overall I have had far better rooms in less costly hotels and I would be reluctant to to recommend this hotel , The hotel staff were all very professional and courteous as you would expect from a hotel of this supposed quality The location and convenience for Victoria station was excellent The breakfast delivered to the room was also excellent 
26447,The Grosvenor, There could have been more informational brochures on London available such as tour information Also more variety of food selections , The location was great and staff helpful Our room was quiet and very clean 
26448,The Grosvenor, Better access in entrance and rooms for people with disability and for those who are wheelchair bound , My wife had to attend hospital for a day procedure in London as we live in Eastbourne that is why we chose The Grosvenor Hotel for its entrance which is in Victoria station There was no wheelchair access into bathroom in the first allocated room We were then moved to the 7th floor into a small suite which was nice but could hardly get the wheelchair into the toilet and also no wall seat in the shower so could not shower I am an amputee of the right leg and because of where the room was situated i had to stay in the room most of the time as it was difficult with hand propelled wheelchair to navigate the corridors as needed to take two lifts one from the 7th floor to the 6th floor and then to the ground floor HO HUM Not the best place 7th floor to put a wheelchair bound amputee If an emergency had arisen on my stay I probably would have been forgotten when this was booked we did request wheelchair access and also contacted the Grosvenor to confirm the day before to make sure this would be OK I also need to mention that the wheelchair lift at the Victoria station entrance was not working properly as i was suspended on it half way up the stairs until an engineer was called to work on it with me in it Laughable i know but not funny at the time as could have caused a terrible accident if it had have broken off from the rail This hotel needs to be specific regarding what it offers in the way of wheelchair access for people with a disability 
26449,The Grosvenor, Need to stock bacardi in there bars popular drink none available, The staff were amazing a guy called Franco one of the managers everyday took the trouble to greet and help us the imperial restaurant within the hotel Rebecca and all staff brill so all in all wonderful staff 
26450,The Grosvenor, We couldn t fault anything , The bed and pillows were very comfy Attention to detail was superb The staff were multi cultural and English wasn t their first language but their English was excellent and they were lovely to deal with nothing was too much trouble The location of the hotel is excellent for Buckingham Palace and the Apollo Victoria theatre and Victoria Station We visited for a friend s special birthday and somehow they found out Champagne a card and cupcakes were waiting for us in our room We would definitely stay here again 
26451,The Grosvenor, System to obtain lighting in room i e key cards not explained by receptionist TV not plugged in had to move TV to reach plug Single room booked but it was extremely small compared to other chain hotels , Comfortable bed and quiet room Menus not very good for vegetarians 
26452,The Grosvenor, The room we were allocated was 646 and it was very small definitely couldn t stay there more then one night , Staff were very friendly absolutely brilliant so helpful Thank you
26453,The Grosvenor, I didn t like that the front desk told me I could order from the complete room service menu and that I had time left before midnight but when I called with two minutes to spare the room service people would not accept my order , The staff was helpful
26454,The Grosvenor, opening the room door you are in front of a wall was more clever to open the door with a different push the hair dryer is hidden carpet on the floor, very quite
26455,The Grosvenor, Over priced 280 for one night was over priced for the quality of the room and 16 71 for three average Cappuccino coffees the next morning was unjustifiably expensive , The bed was very comfy and the location excellent
26456,The Grosvenor, I didn t like that my limo could not park in front of the hotel and had to find a side street on which to park If there was another place there should have been a sign , I liked that there was so much activity around the hotel I felt safe even late at night 
26457,The Grosvenor, That breakfast wasn t included as part of the 225 that we paid per room , The shower was AMAZING And you wouldn t have known you were staying in attached to Victoria station 
26458,The Grosvenor, The knock on the door at 12 00 to see when we were leaving just as in fact we were leaving seemed a little unnecessary , The room and the room service were excellent The reception staff were also superb and very polite We also enjoyed the beautiful cocktail bar 
26459,The Grosvenor, What wasn t to like , The experience was out of this world we spent only 1 night in an executive suite which was for us seeing how the other half lives all the staff were very friendly and couldn t do more every inch of the hotel exudes opulence and this creates a special atmosphere to make the guests fortunately not at home but somewhere exquisitely unique 
26460,The Grosvenor, bar staff were beyond rude they were downright ignorant and there customer care was no better I d of had better service at fawltey towers certainly not what I would of expected seriously go elsewhere there s much better value in same area, location was ok
26461,The Grosvenor, Welcome desk no reservation The overall hotel staff decoration look really tired and lousy Room so small Breakfast not what we expected from an English breakfast at all the room where it is served is dull no flowers no decoration Check out my credit card was debited when i thought it was just given as guarantee etc Never ever again It was a mistake next time we ll go to Grosvenor House this is our place ,No Positive
26462,The Grosvenor, Are room was tiny and the furniture was chipped there was only one plug socket in the room that was not near the bed there was a music speaker in the room that did not work and the TV reception was awful It was not very good for the money we paid and I would not stay here again , The staff were very friendly and smiley The Breakfast was Lovely a little expensive but very nice 
26463,The Grosvenor, Television picture and sound poor Some channels especially news channels not working Shower each time turn on the shower head sprays part of the floor with water which we had to dry ourselves for fear of slipping , Room Bed comfort 
26464,The Grosvenor,No Negative, It s centrally located to most things in London It was next to the underground which makes life easy Little pricy but that s London Definitely would stay there again 
26465,The Grosvenor, We were literally ignored twice by the bar staff even though they took our order for 2 halfs of Guinness both occasions After 15 mins we left without having a drink to go to somewhere we would be served Not good for 2 ladies on a theatre break , The beds were comfy the room was compact but nice The breakfast was good and reception staff were lovely The proximity to Victoria station and Victoria theatre was excellent 
26466,The Grosvenor, Having to leave , Perfect location for travel and the theatre Beautiful room so many little perks that made our stay just that little more special The complimentary bottle of prosecco was a particular surprise when we arrived back at our suite 
26467,The Grosvenor, Room was on the small side my son and husband stayed here the night after Storm Doris when they were stranded because of cancelled trains Rooms were filling up fast that night , My husband and son both said they had a good nights sleep The staff were friendly helpful and efficient 
26468,The Grosvenor, No Prices for mini bar or was it free V busy just outside hotel but it is by a train and bus station so to be expected, Location was v central and encouraged us to walk most places although tube is just next door Suite was great with additional lounge Access to the executive lounge was a bonus with free breakfast and early evening drinks before going out Good choice of restaurants nearby All staff were really friendly and welcoming whilst still be efficient
26469,The Grosvenor, The distance to the room but it s a big hotel and I didn t mind the walk The staff were excellent providing directions and the need to change elevators The little card they provided that illustrated this was also very helpful , The location was excellent and the bathroom was very clean 
26470,The Grosvenor, Only five TV channels whereof none a dedicated news channel According to front desk the hotel is still not prepared for digital TV distribution Hence the VERY slim channel menu , Very strategic location for London touristing Coming in from Gatwick it is extremely convenient with the hotel right at Victoria station Taxis everywhere and buses and subway right at your doorstep Great real hotel atmosphere and great service Inhouse bars restaurants and afternoon tea makes the stay complete even without leaving the hotel an odd evening 
26471,The Grosvenor, Not enough time spent in the hotel because of sightseeing in London , Today s newspaper served with two biscuits every day Very nice and helpful staff Great quality desserts delivered by room service professional and humorous delivery 
26472,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The staff were extremely friendly and we were able to book in early which was fantastic The staff also left a cake in our room as the trio was for my mum s birthday 
26473,The Grosvenor, Only flaw was our experience in the executive lounge for happy hour We sat for 25 minutes completely ignored We said hello to each of the two staff in the room and still received no service We walked out and back to our room I complained to the front desk they refunded the room upgrade and provided a 4 99 bottle of red wine sent to the room as well as a bottle of juice for our son , Very nice accommodations Fancy clean and well kept 
26474,The Grosvenor, There is a very slight odour in room 208 which seems to diminish when the aircon is active Slight chaos in the breakfast area , The building and the staff 
26475,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The hotel is the perfect location for doing the tourist thing Amazing staff especially Corina front desk so helpful The rooms are quite basic and cute if you get offered a cheap upgrade and want a bit of luxury go for it but we got an amazing deal for the centre of London and the hotel is really beautiful and grand We peaked too soon on cocktails in the locals bars so decided to try the Chinese restaurant down stairs and so glad we did The food was AMAZING literally best Chinese food ever Can t recommend this hotel more Such a great price and with the underground literally two seconds away it s perfect to get around to see everything 
26476,The Grosvenor, As the room on the 4th floor faced a busy road the noise at night was considerable Earplugs were promptly brought on request Individually packaged little toiletries produce an awful amount of plastic waste why not supply wall dispensers like many European hotels , We were given a complementary upgrade as it was a special birthday and the cake was a lovely touch Loved the splendour of the entrance hall the bathroom was very nice and clean with thick towels and the bed a great size and comfortable Staff were all extremely friendly 
26477,The Grosvenor, Food in the Executive lounge could have been bit bitter for snacks Also tv in the bedroom wasn t great due to changing from analogue to digital Nothing else to improve , Lovely friendly hotel staff were very conscious that you enjoy your stay Very helpful willing to hold conversation Rooms were clean and tidy Location was excellent Local amenities were also great Special thank you to two staff members Meliha and Emmanuella very welcoming and service was A 
26478,The Grosvenor, Room which the receptionist said had upgraded us was small and overlooked all the air conditioning units of the hotel so fairly noisy however overall was very nice and great location if you are going to see Wicked , Bed was really comfy 
26479,The Grosvenor, Some cleanliness issues signs unpolished dust and dirt in the stair wells which otherwise were spectacular The room was an executive king room at 550 for 2 nights the room was dirty dusty the coffee facilities hadn t been refilled the tv didn t work and we had to call reception several times to get somebody to do something as simple as change the remote The minibar was empty Worst of all when staying Ina high end hotel and paying a lot of money for a good room the bed should be good and as advertised a king size bed In our case the bed was 2 single beds pushed together which we discovered when falling down the middle in the early hours Very very poor situation made harder to rake when on checking in it was made apparent that the room scheduled to be ours wasn t ready so we d been moved downgraded to this other dirty room , Very aesthetically pleasing premises communal areas reasonably well maintained
26480,The Grosvenor, Small room At arrival they told us we had only one room reserved because one of the two rooms booked was cancelled by whom Nobody knows So we had to wait more than hour without apologises from hotel ,No Positive
26481,The Grosvenor, Breakfast service could have been better for the price service not the best but ok a smile would be nice and also on the buffet the food was not always available so only get half of what you want , Hotel was great if you drive in and park over night its cheaper than the transport due to the refund given by the hotel Very clean and staff were great Overall was a top night away 
26482,The Grosvenor, The water wasn t very warm and neither was the room It was my partners 50th birthday which I mentioned to staff several times but no one wished him a happy birthday Didn t like the addition of a service charge Very embarrassing to ask for it to be removed and an additional 20 added to our meal Also we paid for breakfast by purchasing vouchers however my partner was extremely unwell and didn t eat anything from the buffet I was told bluntly no refunds This seemed harsh and upsetting , The deluxe double was tiny and after complaining I was offered a complimentary upgrade Thank you 
26483,The Grosvenor, Room was freezing when we arrived We have stayed there four times now each time the room gets smaller could be in a cupboard next time , Polite helpful staff Excellent location 
26484,The Grosvenor, The wifi was HORRIBLE Not good for business travelers like myself There were no robe or bed slippers in the room I had to call and had them delivered Not what I expect from the Grosvenor , Emmanuella at the check in counter was superb She was very pleasant professional friendly and helpful In room dining was also good Salmon was tasty Bell man was very helpful I don t remember his name but he is Polish

26487,The Grosvenor, The hot breakfast was very cold and the speed of food service in the Grosvenor Arms was extremely slow but waitress service was good , Bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean and well presented 
26488,The Grosvenor, It did not have the Boose as stated I paid for delux but apparently this means you get Boose sound which we didn t and use of the gym I didn t use this as it wasn t shown on booking and didn t really want it anyway so in the end I just paid extra for the word deluxe My only other criticism is we were given a map to our wing the dirrctions she wrote on it were totally wrong so hard to find room in a hard to navigate building Was a bit of fun finding it but 25 mins after a journey , Location excellent cleanliness very good staff all excellent 
26489,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Excellent rooms with very comfortable beds Having executive suites most certainly enhanced the experience Very nice continental breakfast in the exec lounge Service provided by all staff especially Eirini in the Lounge was excellent both friendly and professional A warm welcome from reception staff was also worth noting 
26490,The Grosvenor, Restaurant was branded and only one type of food Italian I think but as it is London lots of other choices nearby , Location and service were very good Initial room was not suitable and front desk moved us to a more suitable room Overall a pleasant stay
26491,The Grosvenor, Very old scratched up desk in room Some mould in bathroom , Lovely staff Really comfortable bed Excellent cantonese restaurant Right on Victoria station 
26492,The Grosvenor, The poached eggs at breakfast arrived cold like they had been sitting ready for a while before they were brought out , Loved that there was an entrance to the hotel straight from Victoria Station 
26493,The Grosvenor, Failed on so many fronts Cocktail bar service extremely poor Had to request nuts crisps with drinks Staff were not attentive Happy hour Executive bar had a very poor selection of drinks , Location
26494,The Grosvenor, The man that come to our room at 245 am telling he could smell smoke from a cigarette we are botth non smokers and the way he spoke to my partner was disgraceful because of the way he acted I d rather stay in a cardboard box outside Victoria station , The staff was very rude lucky I didn t punch him in the throat
26495,The Grosvenor, Noise of loudspeaker in room 744 from station but helpful staff changed room Table next to window in Cocktail Bar was so cold we moved further in Uncomfortable saggy cushion on seat of armchair for Afternoon Tea , All staff were very friendly polite and helpful Kettle in room for morning and arrival cup of tea 
26496,The Grosvenor, Only fault was the fixtures in bathroom 602 were loose toilet roll holder ring light mirror minor faults that did not affect our stay , Overall we were so pleased with our stay and the way we were treated in this hotel 100 would love to come back again in the future 
26497,The Grosvenor, Being woken up By security bangin on the room door at 1am then again at 2am then orderd to stand aside while security came in to see who was smoking Afraid I m a non smoker and no one was smoking you have the wrong room lots off apologies from the staff who said someone on the floor was and it was a mix up but I d never go back again,No Positive
26498,The Grosvenor, The wifi would not connect for our phones or laptops which was unfortunate and very poor tv quality, Excellent location staff were lovely very helpful and welcoming and quick to answer any questions we had The gym was very well equipped We were also upgraded to an executive suite that was very spacious
26499,The Grosvenor, the room looked very outdated and in the bathroom there were all black parts Picture of TV was crap as well , Perfect location you have tube trains and buses right in front of the hotel
26500,The Grosvenor, The staff could be more helpful with our situation we put wrong date for stayed and have been charged and now I have to stay somewhere else for extra money me and my girl were looking forward to celebrate our birthdays in style and close to the venue, Nothing
26501,The Grosvenor, No issues whatsoever , The staff were amazing and it felt like we had five star treatment We were at the Grovesnor for our 40th wedding anniversary and we were upgraded to a Palace Suite plus bottle of Champagne It was such a lovely surprise This was our second stay at this fabulous hotel Its beautifully maintained and has a lovely cocktail bar plus excellent restaurants which we will be sure to try on a future visit Even without the complimentary upgrade the hotel is a great place to stay Its without doubt our hotel of choice for those weekend visits to London 
26502,The Grosvenor, Breakfast was pretty poor food was luke warm sausages were awful and spanish omlette was like eating rubber 11 is a lot of money and didn t get value for that , Room was brilliant bed in particular was extemely comfortable Location perfect for Apollo Victoria Theatre Cocktails were absolutely amazing in the Reunion Bar 
26503,The Grosvenor, Pillows could have been more fluffy they were too thin , Black out curtains amazing The staff friendly and helpful The lobby look amazing my room was nice and comfy 
26504,The Grosvenor, Shower water was cold and staff seemed strange about which bar you could go into in the evening They were all over us about what we wanted exactly and were watchful of us which made us a bit uncomfortable we were a mixed group of ages and not a wild looking bunch We thought the bar closed very early too , The reception area is impressive on arrival
26505,The Grosvenor, A coupon system for b fast is a bit last century They should upgrade their processes , Adequate no frills hotel in a great location next to Victoria station Would recommend for a value option in this area 
26506,The Grosvenor, The room was small and the bathroom ridiculously small You couldn t swing a cat in it , The location was excellent and the staff very helpful very nice atmosphere

26508,The Grosvenor, Nothing, The staff were excellent friendly and helpful They upgraded us to a better room and allowed us to check in early The location was superb with the convenience of the tube on your doorstep Hotel was fantastic
26509,The Grosvenor, Bath tube not holding water and was making it difficult to use a bath bomb for my girlfriend , We stayed in a suite the room was very clean and decorated to a high standard the hotel is elegant the main entrance is pleasing on the eye The bed very comfortable We was left a complimentary bottle of champagne which we found was a nice touch we found the staff professional and friendly The atmosphere of the reunion bar was bubbly and the interior exceptional 
26510,The Grosvenor, Wing lift didn t work so had to take the long way round every time Didn t appreciate the blind not closing fully at night , We really liked the Reunion bar great atmosphere to relax in after we got back to the hotel Staff were really nice

26513,The Grosvenor, I upgraded the room several weeks before and on arrival it was not ready and the receptionist was unaware of it We had to wait in the lounge and have coffee The coffee machine was broken and we had to settle for instant Poor start, When the room was ready there was a bottle of red wine and a note wishing my husband a happy birthday Room was clean and well appointed 
26514,The Grosvenor, We were in hurry to catch the flight at gatwick airport but the staff give us wrong advice to take taxi than gatwick express Too many trafic light and trafic jam a long the way to airport so we missed the flight , Location
26515,The Grosvenor, Upgraded room was spacious and on the highest floor but we would not recommend it due to vicinity of Gym and morning noise, Location public areas and professionalism of Mr Nabil Nahdi Front Office member and Ms Maria Arms Restaurant staff member 
26516,The Grosvenor, The gentleman at our check in didn t know what a cot was when I asked him to check that one had been put in one if our rooms Also we had to swap rooms with my son and his family as we could not get the baby buggie through the doors ,No Positive
26517,The Grosvenor, No parking a 20 mins walk to carpark which costs and extra 42 a day staff very unhelpful the rooms were tiny and the breakfast was rubbish, Location good that s about all I can say about it
26518,The Grosvenor, Bathroom was a little dated , The concierge and front desk were incredibly helpful and even helped me book a reservation at another hotel for an upcoming trip 
26519,The Grosvenor, While the young lady who tended the front when I arrived was perfectly lovely she was the sole bright spot during my stay She readily and happily allowed me to leave my bag until check in time since i arrived at 11 a m One would have thought the bag would have made its way to my room when the room was ready It did not Further the surly sour puss who was at the front when I returned couldn t locate my bag gave me haphazard direction to my room which was in the wing and required going to the second floor following nonexistent signs going up a small set of steps for a 3rd story room The room needed maitenance a good cleaning and the lighting was horrible The view was over an ugly rooftop Lastly you are warned that no outside food and drink are allowed presumably to hold you hostage to their own restaurant and bar , Very near the train The hotel is literally around the corner from the Victoria Station 
26520,The Grosvenor, 1 hotel is not handicapped or chidren stroller friendly hotel entrance has some steps if the consurge is not around you have to take laguge by ur self up there if on wheel chair or has child stroller you have been fall in trouble they told me there is like an elevator on the steps near station entrance but surprisingly was looked by locker 2 room in winter needs portable heater not practical if you have a kid rooms has no warming system , Nothing spicific every other thing is in usual range
26521,The Grosvenor, Bathroom was a little small and the walk to the wing lifts was quite long , The family room was a great size and very well decorated It had everything we needed The location was brilliant 
26522,The Grosvenor, The noise in the restaurant was intolerable If I pay hundreds of pounds for a family I at least expect to hear what the people on either side of me are saying ,No Positive
26523,The Grosvenor, Everything was great so no dislikes , Great location comfortable room and friendly staff Fantastic entrance area which was nicely decorated for Christmas 
26524,The Grosvenor, Room and bathroom ridiculously small Unable to sit at desk to work as bed too big for the room leaving no room for chair Shower door smashes against the toilet in bathroom ,No Positive
26525,The Grosvenor, Problem no ramps outside must carry luggage up the outside steps Problem bus stop on corner many travelers with luggage on sidewalk to navigate through , Hotel interior access to Victoria Rail Station with short walk to Victoria Underground Short walk to Buckingham Palace 
26526,The Grosvenor, The windows were a bit dirty on the outside I couldn t really see out but not a major problem , The bed was so comfy The room was lovely There was a bath so my 9 year old didn t have to shower which she hates The staff were lovely they even left a cake and Birthday card for my daughter 
26527,The Grosvenor, Service in all restaurants and bar was very slow Quality of breakfast and lunch in main restaurant was adequate to poor Food in the Chinese was very good Trying to find our room was extremely difficult we went round in circles five times as signs kept taking back to the start A maid also tried and had the same problem Door cards kept demagnetising if they even went near a phone for a second Room noisy at night , Room comfortable Good facilities good location
26528,The Grosvenor, The rooms were VERY small The view was disastrous From 7 am till 9 pm you can hear announcements made from the station Very annoying , The location is nice Right next to the victoria station 
26529,The Grosvenor, Very noisy room men working till nearly 2am Katya on reception very helpful Found us another room which was very dark no hot water for shower very poor tv signal Nearly 600 for 3 nights expected better for the price we paid , Clean room and comfy bed 
26530,The Grosvenor, Despite my having asked for a deluxe room I was shown to a tiny room and had a bit of a hassle until I received a room I found adequate for the standard I had booked There did not seem to be a doorman so on arriving I had to juggle getting my luggage off the sidewalk pay the taxi and then get my luggage inside the hotel not what I expected of such a hotel , In general the hotel was agreeable I liked the Chinese restaurant located in the hotel and ate there several times 
26531,The Grosvenor, We were quite getting into our room however we realise changeover if busy can be a problem, We found the location for our stay perfect and the staff were very professional
26532,The Grosvenor, We didn t sleep at all on the first night due to a dreadfully noisy Air Con unit it was actually the room next doors and made the worst noise ever we complained and got moved above the train station only to then hear every announcement Needless to say we were grumpy and tired when we complained again and were moved to a larger room for our second night , The room we eventually ended up in was lovely big and luxurious
26533,The Grosvenor, Everything was perfect , It was my daughter s 5th birthday and the hotel made a lovely fuss of her and the staff could not have been nicer in every interaction we had with them Location is outstanding and the hotel itself is really nice 
26534,The Grosvenor, Clearer understanding on the room service, It was my son s birthday and they pulled out all the stops to make it extra special Thanks to the all the staff that made it happen
26535,The Grosvenor, The rooms in the wing are really far from the lobby Some of the elevators weren t working and it was difficult to get oriented in all those stairs and corridors in the building The heating system was broken in our room and we were freezing the first night and cold other nights even though we were provided emergency heater It wasn t our first time in the Grosvenor but we used to go there to rest and have a great time This time it was really disappointing and we will reconsider our next visit This time it was very poor value for money , Breakfast beautiful lobby staff was very helpful and friendly 
26536,The Grosvenor, Unfortunately because of the position of the room there was a lot of street noise and noise from the aircon heater The room became very hot at night Bed a little too soft but that s just personal preference , The room was lovely and a good size Staff very friendly and helpful Lovely food both in the restaurant and room service There was a mix up with the rooms on arrival We were provided with a double room for a family of three and no bed for my daughter This was quickly rectified and we were upgraded to a larger room No problem for the staff at all extremely helpful 
26537,The Grosvenor, I felt that although the outer bed linen itself was fresh the inner pillows and duvets needed to be renewed which made me feel uncomfortable , The location is excelling for business needs and leisure access 
26538,The Grosvenor, In general I like a lot of things in the hotel but two things annoyed me the first there are only two old elevators serving the hotel one of them was out of order at that time maybe there is more even though they re not easy to reach In addition the long distance to reach to the room Its look like a hospital corridors , Many things such as the location Imagine that you can use many transportation to reche to the hotel like the underground trains coachs buss and of course Taxis It is also well organized from many perspective I liked the welcoming and goodbye in the check in and check out Furthermore the cleanliness is wonderful they have a well trained staff Finally the integrity of the house keeper I deliberately thrown some things precious and did not lose anything 
26539,The Grosvenor, The room wasnt ready until 5pm peoples room service from the night before in the hallways until the next night the rooms as good as travellodge the toilet didnt flush properly and the bath was veerryyy slow to empty when having a shower stood in an inch or two of water finally they couldnt find my case when left in storage i had to go round to the back rooms and find it myself with a member of staff not worth the money, The luxurious entrance hall and staff were lovely and in a great location
26540,The Grosvenor, The rooms were very small for what you pay for but in saying that we didn t spend much time in the hotel Coming in from Victoria station I think they should have a lift to the lobby especially when u have heavy cases , The smell of the hotel was lovely whatever fragrance that was coming from the air conditioning The staff were very polite and helpful and the beds were amazing 
26541,The Grosvenor, The bedrooms in the annexe were functional but comfortable , Perfect location next to Victoria Station Lovely grand entrance Friendly and helpful staff 
26542,The Grosvenor, There appeared to be problems with staffing I noticed bullying of a young waitress and was not impressed The way you treat your staff does matter to me It did impact the service and hence my opinion of service quality in your lounge , Beautiful place and lovely room 
26543,The Grosvenor, For GBP 260 per night this hotel is totally out of step with its peers The decor is tired old fashioned and dated Low quality bed linens pillows and duvet scratchy hard cottons and no feathered duvet just those thick cotton fillings that sit rigidly above your body and do not fall around you Very loud rattling noise from the air conditioning unit and since the windows don t open no option but to keep it switched on So your choice therefore is to bake in a boiling hot room and not sleep or have the air con on and struggle to sleep above the noise Breakfast is nothing to write home about and served in a rather dingy room though again the Christmas decorations at least were nicely done It is winter and yet only 1 thin towel each provided in the bathroom and no bathrobes We were moved to a suite for our second night and yet sadly even in there the decor was terribly dull It was such a poor use of space as well a large living room with a sofa two armchairs coffee table and a cupboard in it Simply no atmosphere at all For an extra GBP 100 a night we could have stayed somewhere like Hazlitts or the W which is where we usually stay and stayed here only for ease of connection to Victoria Gatwick We will never stay here again , Location is excellent for tourists Lobby area is lovely music very traditionally British beautiful Christmas tree Some of the staff were professional and courteous 
26544,The Grosvenor, Few options in the mini bar and no hair dryer , The staff is very friendly and polite and were able to give us the specific room which we had requested on the top floor 6th There is a private entrance in the lobby of the hotel to Victoria station where you can find several shops to buy a sim card or snacks 
26545,The Grosvenor, Eva in the bar was very rude and refused to serve us drinks as she was cleaning On the other hand Another male employee came along and served us Eva told him to grow up once she saw him pouring our drinks ,No Positive
26546,The Grosvenor, Staff unfriendly upon arrival Questions about breakfast and making prints not welcomed Also a tray with the last guest s room service food left overs outside the door to our room when checking in ,No Positive
26547,The Grosvenor, We stayed on 7 th floor got to room and key didn t work so had to go back to reception Heating didn t work in the room so was cold in the night You are paying for location not so much quality, Location good
26548,The Grosvenor, Long queues to check in Blocked money on my card without asking me First room was dirty and smelly they changed it after I complained Expensive , Great location direct access to the Victoria Station Comfy beds Posh looking
26549,The Grosvenor, Room was a little noisy but it does overlook the busy terminus , Perfect location for the Belmond Pullman as the hotel has an exit onto the concourse at Victoria Station Very friendly and helpful staff lovely large room executive 436 with comfortable bed claw foot bath and rain shower Nice toiletries Penhaligons and under floor heating in tiled bathroom just right for a cold morning Pleasant d cor Delighted to have a kind gift from the hotel to celebrate my husband s birthday They really couldn t do enough for us 
26550,The Grosvenor, Unable to get a drink in the Champagne Bar on return from theatre at 11 40 though it is supposed to be open until midnight We were told they were closing , Refurbishment has been very good Reception staff were excellent 
26551,The Grosvenor, Couldn t open the window for a breath of fresh air , There is a secret entrance to Victoria station The entrance hall is stunning The room was very quiet considering the noisy neighborhood 
26552,The Grosvenor, The room was smaller than hoped 2 single beds and the door stupidly opened into a wall restricting the entrance way into the room A wing room is a small trek to reach so wouldn t be ideal for anyone of restricted mobility , Lovely hotel for a long weekend in London The decor really gives the hotel a wonderfully grand feel With a entrance exit straight into Victoria station this hotel couldn t have a better location All staff were very friendly and professional addressing guests when they passed in the corridors
26553,The Grosvenor, No lift to floor room was cold the curtains didn t fit so let light in The dining room staff didn t pay enough attention to the details of service ie the milk was always empty and the coffee was never refilled or we had to ask for the coffee Small details but it adds up,No Positive
26554,The Grosvenor, Rain shower could have been a bit more powerful or did I just not realise how to use it The lobby smells heavily perfumed don t need so much of this I think , The hotel is very grand and very comfortable The bed was very spacious In fact the whole room was very comfortable and I really enjoyed staying there In particular the staff were very helpful and generous I ll definitely choose to stay here again 
26555,The Grosvenor, Just about everything The room was advertised as double deluxe but was tiny There was only 12 inches between the bed and the walls hardly any surface space Two people would find it completely unmanageable even one average size man would not be comfortable I arrived at 2330 hours just wanted a cup of tea and sleep Kettle not working 40 minutes 2 phone calls later a very rude staff person arrived with a pot of hot water I had to argue for a working kettle hardly an extra in a 4 star hotel Was offered a marginally larger room but the view was bleak and depressing Wifi slow and annoying had to access through hotel portal every time and often restart computer Housekeeping poor no soap one day no biscuits the next insufficient milk room not vacuumed Air conditioning had a rattling noise Specifically asked for London black cab to airport and got company car instead Definitely not value for money , The location and the view from my room 
26556,The Grosvenor, Reception staff not very helpful We weren t given any information on the hotel not told about restaurants meal times whether we had breakfast included despite confirming on check in it was first time staying there We were handed a key card and that was it We assumed our room would be on floor 5 but the rooms only go as far as 530 asked housekeeping staff where the room was he didn t know either Asked another staff member who also didn t know but checked with someone who told us it was on the 4th floor We discovered by chance an entrance from the train station into hotel another feature not pointed out on arrival Lifts slow room small tv reception not great Expected more for the price and star rating especially as the hotel was recommended , Location
26557,The Grosvenor, Disappointed with the restaurants for such a hotel Shower in the bathroom dripped all night which was annoying , Eccellent location Very comfortable and clean 
26558,The Grosvenor, TV screen was a bit fuzzy , Excellent location Was able to access the hotel from Victoria Station without going outside Nice clean and very classy hotel 
26559,The Grosvenor, Furniture in room was worn including damaged missing desk drawers Breakfast was good but had to wait for bacon and eggs to be restocked , Good location convenient for all major sights
26560,The Grosvenor, Personnel disposition and quick turn around location excellent, Personnel excellent Room they had to change my room because there was no heat and the shower did not work properly in the room I was given originally
26561,The Grosvenor, Tried to get us to buy vouchers for breakfast for next day preferred to add to our Bill if breakfast needed at the time Told this was acceptable and just to give room number and sign at the time Advised in front of other diners that we couldn t have breakfast as we didn t have a voucher After we advised that it had been agreed the day before they agreed to accept room number and signature Not happy with situation at the time and vouchers for breakfast seem cheap and tacky approach for a hotel , Bed was comfy room temperature good 
26562,The Grosvenor, The TV was not ok Not good quality RTL was not working , Everyone was so kind polite and friendly Much more than 10 points for the hole staff 
26563,The Grosvenor, Even tho the bed was comfy could of done with an extra pillow Shower water was a little temperamental , Stunning hotel beautiful decorations and the chandeliers made the place even more luxurious 
26564,The Grosvenor, That we can t come every weekend, Staff lovely bed so comfy breakfast really nice Thankyou for our free breakfast as it was our 11th anniversary that was so kind
26565,The Grosvenor, Staff were extremely rude on multiple occasions I Reception Bar we weren t checked in properly our room service order was wrong and stone cold dressing gown is 50 no turndown service overall bad experience , Only good this is the location and the room facilities are of an okay ish standard 
26566,The Grosvenor, nespresso machine wasn t working in the room may have been discontinued as there was also no coffee capsules available the hotel decor very brown and dark but that seems to be the modern way, The Grand imperial Restaurant was very good the food was excellent and very reasonably priced very pleasant staff I had been on the Brighton belle and the entrance from Victoria directly into the hotel was great
26567,The Grosvenor, Nothing, Great location Easy access to London Victoria station with an entrance into the station Rooms were big spacious and clean with comfortable beds 
26568,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The location was fab close to major tourist spots Bed was very comfy and staff helpful friendly 2nd time I ve stayed at this hotel and I would recommend highly and return again 
26569,The Grosvenor, Terrible service Hotel staff did not offer to help when we were carrying a lot of luggages Did not even open the door for us when both hands were carrying luggages No proper place to drop off luggages from the car as well Called the hotel to ask for help and they were not helpful , Convenient location 
26570,The Grosvenor, If you re looking for personal touches this is not for you , Arrived Victoria station 5 30pm hotel perfectly located to avoid travelling through London My wife was taken ill shortly after arriving necessitating an ambulance Staff were helpful during our wait for its arrival 
26571,The Grosvenor, The children s beds were in a sorry state The TVs in our room kept freezing, The receptionist upgraded our room to a larger one added on the executive lounge for an added 60 She was very kind courteous added an extra bed to our room when I requested this She also gave my twins little teddy bears which was a lovely gesture
26572,The Grosvenor, The room was in the wing which meant two lifts and an unexpected walk to get from reception The shower ran very cold for longer than you d expect TV reception poor and WiFi remarkably slow , The bed was comfortable and warm The location is ideal for both coach and train stations the underground and buses Room clean and well fitted fair value for money 
26573,The Grosvenor, Room dark and not a very nice Very small mouldy bathroom No spare electric plugs Nothing in the mini bar except 2 free water bottles Noise from Victoria train station and building work Some rude staff General feel that the hotel is trading off past glories with a bunch of seasonal staff 3 star hotel at best , The hotel has a nice lobby The beds are comfy 2 free water bottles in room fridge 
26574,The Grosvenor, Room not kept to a high standard smelly shower curtain dusty bedspead and throw pillows My room was in a far corner of hotel requiring two lifts and no one around to assist you with directions Busy hotel with lots of tourists milling about , Good location and access to the Tube 
26575,The Grosvenor, The bed was ok but not great , The location could not be better Short walk to Parliament and Big Ben Westminster Pier Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace with brilliant access to Victoria station trains and tube 
26576,The Grosvenor, Drawers fall out television small and no cnn or sports channels including U K Sports channels Food hors d ouvres in exec lounge always the same, Location size of room executive lounge and friendly staff
26577,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Excellent location in fact has its own entrance directly from London Victoria station into the hotel so if you are coming off the train from Gatwick it is the handiest hotel you could ever find Also being right in Victoria it is on the circle line on the underground so perfect to get anywhere you need to get to around London
26578,The Grosvenor, Staff in the Grosvenor Arms were only interested in setting up for breakfast served some customers and not others they also turned customers away long before closing time Tiny Bathrooms, Really liked the location and ambiance of the Hotel reception and cocktail bar Victoria Station Theatres and Buckingham Palace nearby
26579,The Grosvenor, Big screen Sky TV at breakfast Tacky and cheap Why No one is watching it and the sound is off At least the leftovers slop bucket wasn t on view this time That was the worst thing about my last visit , Good location Beautiful building exterior Nice quiet part of the hotel despite the distance from reception We liked the view over the station Friendly staff especially in the champagne bar 
26580,The Grosvenor, Lounge where is it Asked for a cup of tea at the end of our evening on return to the hotel and was told that the coffee machine was out of order When asked if we could sit in the lounge was told that it was closed This was about 11 30pm I didn t know that hotel lounges closed at all We were told to have a cup of tea in our room which was a pokey room with one chair to sit on There were two of us Swing a cat You couldn t swing a ladybird in there Couldn t walk around the bed comfortably Mini bar was a fridge on the floor almost touching the bed Contained 2 bottles of water What was the point of it Ended up having a drink in the bar Very artistically decorated but like the rest of the hotel ok if you like black and very little light Visited the loos just standard not posh in any way Disappointing on so many levels , Breakfast was good less expensive than I expected and choice was good Restaurant crowded and not enough room to move between tables to buffet Still have to make your own toast I would rather go without Staff were polite and courteous 
26581,The Grosvenor, The Chinese dinner less then average, The room expresso coffee machine friendliness of the staff When they learned it was my husband s birthday a bottle of wine was delivered to the room
26582,The Grosvenor, Size of room Attitude of staff in grosvenor arms bar Overcharged for drinks and had to advise of etrorexpe, Room 745 very small not very good value for money
26583,The Grosvenor, Small room with an anoying AC sound that woke us up several times during the night Breakfast was boring and not worth 11 pounds and staff was generally not very well trained coached seemed like they did t care , Good location right next to Victoria Station where Cirkle line and Victoria line goes from as well as the express train direct to Gatwick 
26584,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The staff went out of their way to ensure the stay was memorable and pleasant I would not hesitate in recommending this impressive hotel Our room was spacious and very comfortable we didn t want to leave 
26585,The Grosvenor, My daughter was classed as an adult at age 12 for breakfast so had to pay adult price but was then told she was too young to sit in the bar So which is it She is either a child or adult not both Windows in the bedroom would not open and there was no AC Bedroom hot at night , The overall feel of the hotel was fabulous It felt really expensive and luxurious Rooms were nice and bed comfy It had a very grand feel and there were options of where to eat and drink without leaving the hotel I loved the 12pm check out ant 10 30 breakfast Amazing as you normally get thrown out at 11 Staff were fantastic 
26586,The Grosvenor, Our flights were cancelled so we stayed another night but at a much higher rate The hotel charged 432 for a few phone calls to the airline that were on a freecall number , The family room had plenty of space
26587,The Grosvenor, Not a lot of cafes to walk to not as pretty for walking more the nature of London being spread out , Beautiful old hotel nicely decorated great breakfast Very convenient to the underground as well as bus short walk to Buckingham Paace 
26588,The Grosvenor, Too much noise as overlooking main road although we requested a quite room Hotel is on a main street whete traffic doesn t stop day and night So woke up several times during the night, Nice size room and confortable bed Very convenient near victoria station and easy access to various locations in London and Gatwick airport
26589,The Grosvenor, Service was surprisingly average for a grand hotel in a great location Rooms are small Need some world class hotel management to honor such a property , Great location when going to and from Gatwick Airport However a short taxi ride gets you to better locations and hotels 
26590,The Grosvenor, I had booked for my daughter and I but even though I had the proof of this I had to pay an additional 20 00 as they had booked us in to a single room The TV also had a poor picture which was unfortunate as I had to spend the evening in the room with my seven year old daughter without being able to watch anything , Concierge was very helpful 
26591,The Grosvenor, The room was very ordinary for the price bathroom fittings unstable TV kept breaking down had to call Maintenance twice , The cocktail bar was lovely at night Staff at welcome desk and Concierge very good and helpful 
26592,The Grosvenor, The room a Deluxe Double was actually very small there was nothing deluxe about it The bathroom was tiny to the point where the toilet would be very uncomfortable for a larger guest The iPod docking station did not work and the reception picture quality on the television was very poor Perhaps the most concerning feature however was the spots of mould we found on the bed sheets , It was a very grand hotel with a good location right beside London Victoria station The bed was comfortable 
26593,The Grosvenor, My busband Gregory Iverson and I have been staying there since 1980 and the only fault we can find is that we like to read in bed and the lighting in the rooms is not conducive to that The last time we both stayed in August 2016 the staff very kindly located a lamp and extension cord but it was very awkward We are staying again on Nov 3 4 2016 and if you could arrange something it would be greatly appreciated , Very comfy room and well stocked Helpful staff good food excellent facilities 
26594,The Grosvenor, Room smaller than expected could have been any hotel anywhere in the world lacked individuality Took two calls and well over half an our to get some toothpaste that we forgot to pack , Well situated near station clean 
26595,The Grosvenor, Disappointed with size of room bathroom ridiculously small burnt my leg on radiator as it was too near toilet Staff in bar ignorant waiting twenty minutes to be served and then only happened when forced barman to acknowledge us, Bed comfy location excellent
26596,The Grosvenor, the rooms need updating the first room had a dirty throw on the bed did not even get in it and also the bathroom had plumbing problems Second room broken chair plug sockets to turn off lights behind bed big chips in the bath Third room ok still marks in the bath , the staff very helpful and willing to please
26597,The Grosvenor, My room was very small It was a standard single but about half the size of my father s standard single that was next to it Slightly strange that we paid the same , Beautiful decor efficient staff great location 
26598,The Grosvenor, The smell going down to the main toilets The wardrobe was a bit damaged and the shower head was scaled up , The lobby was lovely and the room was good and very comfortable for a standard room Staff were very helpful and courteous Excellent value at 144 for the night for such a great location
26599,The Grosvenor, It was my girlfriends birthday they got the name wrong on the bday card and addressed it to me We had a bottle of wine sent up which the waiter broke and still served to us we then found broken glass on the floor in our room We had tea and coffee in the room but no kettle for hot water so could not have a hot drink , The decor and most staff were lovely 
26600,The Grosvenor, A little noise from the train station intercom, Excellent location Beautiful hotel with lovely staff Just around the corner from the Apollo theatre for wicked 
26601,The Grosvenor,No Negative, I loved the fact there were a few desks to go to upon entrance and exit and the staff were very attentive The room was gorgeous comfy and quiet Breakfast came to the room and it was still hot and fresh Thank you 
26602,The Grosvenor, Two times the room service team got my orders wrong But they tried their best to make it up which was nice , The property was very up market 5 Star cleanliness 
26603,The Grosvenor, The first room we were given was very disappointing it was meant to be a deluxe double but certainly wasn t , We requested a room change and were moved to a wonderful room in the same category which was what we were expecting having stayed at the hotel before 
26604,The Grosvenor, The twin beds were horrible I got the worst backache our last night in London the mattresses sunk in the middle and were more like a cot than a decent bed The staff at the check in desk and in the dining room were not fluent in English The dinner menu was extremely limited and expensive And there was no British beer available , The buffet breakfasts were delicious every morning the baggage concierge was helpful location is on Buckingham Palace Road and backs onto Victoria Train Station which is convenient to Boots and WHSmith for newspapers magazines Rooms are extremely tiny and the bathrooms are teeny as well but very clean 
26605,The Grosvenor, Bathroom outdated and a bit dark Obstructed window very little light in the room , Location beautiful lobby bar restaurant Train and underground station downstairs Great paces to eat close by 
26606,The Grosvenor, The tea room over price tea scone 26 00 no cream tea was cold complained but nothing was done Staff not helpful in the hotel, Location for the palace was excellent Bed very comfy 
26607,The Grosvenor, The beds were like cots with a comforter thrown on top The beds sunk in the middle The shower tub was 2 feet high difficult to climb into no rubber bathmat there were handrails to use Room was quiet but TV did not work air conditioning worked quietly Upon arrival 10am we could not check in to room until 3pm quite tired Staff did not speak English well and we were not told about the special vouchers costing 11 pounds vs what we ended paying were 15 pounds for morning breakfast buffets Breakfast was delicious dinners were very limited and poor selection of British beers and no French wines The desk staff checking us in and out were limited in English ability and did not offer additional help courtesies , My husband and I have stayed at The Grosvenor beginning in 1982 present at least 5 or 6 different times and the quality of the rooms beds food and management staff at the hotel have diminished considerably over 34 years Concierge who handled baggage was very helpful and polite 
26608,The Grosvenor, The breakfast was so expensive We travelled with friends who had pre booked breakfast On arrival I asked to see how much breakfast was to add to the room and was told 16 88 which we assumed was good value for the two of us no idea on why such a specific amount and then when we looked at the menu in the bedroom it say 17 50 each Our friends went down for the meal in the morning and we went to get some breakfast elsewhere which was 12 00 for a Full English right next door and they both said we would have been so upset and disappointed with the continental breakfast if we had have paid for it I do think that the price for the room was a little pricey in comparison to the room size when you compare it to a Premier Inn where there is much more room , The blacked out curtains were amazing Lovely lie in on Sunday even though it was only until 8 30 
26609,The Grosvenor, could have done with a mini cab booking than a black cab that cost me nearly 3 times as much and which cost me more than my flight return ticket cost and even more than my hotel night s cost That put me out of pocket and consequently put me off quite a bit early in the morning, Staff very courteous with directions and convenience while booking a cab to the airport early morning
26610,The Grosvenor, The family room was not up to Standard at all lots of dirty marks on walls mirrors the windows were filthy This room was advertised at the normal rate of 500 If I had paid that price I would have wanted my money back , The hotel has the wow factor when you walk in Restaurants bar area also welcoming 
26611,The Grosvenor, The shower head as well as the water temperature adjustment for the shower is inadequate Room service is slow and the telephone did not work in the beginning The writing pad is empty and the pen did not write The quality of the television is sub standard , The location The historical nature and decor of the building 
26612,The Grosvenor, Things in the hotel were not very well sign posted such as the executive lounge Stairways were quite confusing also , Excellent location great looking hotel Staff were extremely helpful 
26613,The Grosvenor, The staff directions to locations were not always good We also had trouble charging items to the room after we pre authorized our cards for the charges Our rooms were difficult to reach We needed 2 lifts in different wings or had to take a lift and 2 sets of stairs to get there Give yourself extra time to get from your room to the lobby if you have to be downstairs at a specific time The hotel bar is good but closes fairly early for a bar , The hotel was in a fantastic location for walking catching the buses trains and for dining The staff was friendly The rooms were comfortable and it was nice to have air conditioning in the room The food choices quality for both dinner and breakfast was superb The hotel gym near our rooms was very modern well equipped The bathrooms very modern and large 
26614,The Grosvenor, Clearing of finished room service plates from the corridor should be speedier and sometimes the room service is at about 4 30 5 pm which can be nuisance if you are preparing to go out , If you need Victoria Rail Station this is the place as you can walk straight onto the concourse The meals are filling and tasty and surprisingly not all that expensive The concierge is great for our requests even better than the railway staff 
26615,The Grosvenor, Only fault great gym on 7th floor but missed a pool that s not much to complain about , The hotel is in a fantastic location it s so grand and very comfortable the staff from front of house to last who was cleaning the loo were so nice and so efficent We had lunch in the bar on arrival and it was lovely great place will return again and again 
26616,The Grosvenor, I booked a delux room for a single person for 357 pounds the room was so tiny I was disgusted and embarrassed for that BIG WAY making complaint to the hotel also its really bad that we had to make a disabled person take steps from the front of the hotel The ramp is located on the other side of the hotel really embarrassing and equality for disable people is not met or at least is made very difficult , everything apart from the room allocation for my colleague 
26617,The Grosvenor, A little pricy But then again you re in the heart of it all I stayed at another hotel near by for the same price I have to admit the Grosvenor was by far the better choice , This hotel is within walking distance of many major attractions Buckingham palace Westminster Abbey London Eye Parliament Big Ben It is very comfortable the rooms are updated I recommend the family room which was not much more but provided much more space There are many local pubs and other great places to eat close by You just have to be willing to explore Another great plus is that the hotel sits above a major tube train station as well as a bus depot right outside You can get anywhere from here I took the tube from the airport and walked upstairs to my hotel Nothing more convenient than that
26618,The Grosvenor, Hotel is outdated water pressure unsatisfactory Quite a long walk to the elevators we stayed at the wings section , Excellent location right in the center of London Spacious room family room 
26619,The Grosvenor, We have stayed before but this time our bathroom within the room was awkward you had to squeeze in by the sink then shut the door to be able to access the toilet very squashed but on previous occasions rooms were fantastic so don t let this put you off , The location next to Victoria train station with its own entrance in the station save you having to walk round to the main one We had booked Buckingham palace tour so this was a ten minute walk from the hotel Easy access to underground tubes Hotel has a bar and a more relaxed cocktail lounge but plenty of cafe coffee shops in Victoria station to use Rooms are comfortable and quiet you wouldn t know you re next to a busy London station Staff at check in very pleasant and concierge were very friendly and helpful 
26620,The Grosvenor, Only one lift working No signage informing of such but after 5mins of waiting it became pretty obvious There is a plaque stating that On this site London s 1st lift was installed A synic might add it was still there o Things break down I accept but perhaps a We are attending to this would have made the wait more enjoyable No porter facility available at point of booking in Seemed somewhat characterless overall but this is a major city and that s not unheard of worldwide , Classic hotel lovely decor and established icon in the City If you are travelling from Victoria Station you are 100m from the platforms but you will not hear a sound The resturant is lovely the food superb 
26621,The Grosvenor, It cannot be helped but the floor numberings are a bit confusing as the hotel is apparently made up from connecting at least 2 different buildings to form one , Excellent location with direct access to and from Victoria Station making for weatherproof transfers to and from the Gatwick Express Well run hotel clean quiet rooms excellent bar on the 2nd floor 
26622,The Grosvenor, Our room was in a side wing it took 2 elevators or 2 sets of stairs 1 elevator to reach it , Location of the hotel was great and they had great food We were walking distance from the Palace several museums The gym had nice machines for working out 
26623,The Grosvenor, I wish the bar stayed open a bit later at night Some people arrive late some people come back late after a day out , The fish and chips in the bar are excellent and excellent value The staff are and always have been extremely pleasant and friendly The porters too are always quick off the mark to help Reception No no complaints at all Housekeeping very efficient 
26624,The Grosvenor, Only 1 small lift which took ages to come down to ground floor and always a queue Air con in room wasn t very effective and being on the sixth floor with windows that didn t open it was very warm when trying to sleep Ended up requesting a fan for the room which was provided instantly , Location was excellent 
26625,The Grosvenor, Room was small even though we had upgraded to a deluxe one, Convenient for underground yet only a short walk away from a good variety of cafes and quiet restaurants 
26626,The Grosvenor, Cold poached eggs for breakfast in room and fruit and yoghurt Not an option for room service breakfast, Exceedingly Friendly and helpful staff at reception and concierge clean And comfortable room 
26627,The Grosvenor, Aircon not operating in room Having to carry heavy bags up steps from taxi no one watching to help , Entrance from Victoria Station History Elegance Good Breakfast at reasonable price
26628,The Grosvenor, I booked a deluxe room but it wasn t so big comparing with my last year one But when I asked them to change my room into a bigger one they immediately welcomed and did at the next day The bad thing I saw there was the breakfast girls stuff Some of them were angry most of the time , It s my second time being in this hotel with my family where I had been there last summer and I ve booked 3 rooms as well as this year I like the location and the facilities around The cleanness and the friendly stuff 
26629,The Grosvenor, The air con didn t work so well but window opens enuf to let a bit of cool thru Rooms are small when two large suitcases are needed to be fitted in, The convenience of being so close to walking to the attractions that interest us is why we continue to book this Hotel Victoria Station is close by Bus service also for homeward journey to Heathrow Surrounding Eateries in the Station foods area proved to be great places to visit again but look forward to the restaurant in Grosvenor being open next visit The refurbishment since our last visit is very up to date 
26630,The Grosvenor, The Shower curtain in the shower was a bit short plus the spray was sideways on facing the narrower part of the shower shower when it might have been better at one end of the longer shower space and so taking a shower got the floor of the bathroom a bit drippy which I took care to dry up so as not to walk wet onto the carpetting of the room , I was provided for a reasonable sum of money with a continental breakfast in my room at the time I requested The original cost of the room excluded meals 
26631,The Grosvenor, All of the rooms en suites have maserators connected to the plumbing including the toilet bath and wash hand basin The maserator makes the most horrendous noise which actually makes the whole room vibrate Believe me I am not exaggerating in the slightest It happens when you drain any water from the basin bath or flush the toilet This noise goes on all night as other rooms use water I cannot believe they have installed such a system which must spoil everyone s stay Breakfast was quite a shock I m not a stranger to staying in very many hotel grades of hotels from the very best to the worst The breakfast is self service This is quite common these days but they usually have Cornflakes and Weetabix not just muesli and Rice Crispies When I asked for Weetabix they told me they don t serve it They had cranberry juice which was warm and when I asked if they had any chilled fruit juice they said put ice in it I asked for the sugar shaker to be filled as it was empty and he returned 5 minutes later and I poured it over my muesli only to find he had filled it with SALT He apologised and brought sachets of sugar On the servery no beans but hard fried rubber eggs Plates so hot that nobody could hold them as there were no serviettes available I had to go to the bar to get some At the table no spoons The toaster required the bread to be put through 3 times to get browned No butter for the toast All in all the very worst breakfast experience I ve had in 50 years of staying at hotels This is not a cheap hotel but it felt like it Very disappointed and I will never stay again and don t recommend it to anyone who values an unbroken nights sleep and a hearty breakfast , The foyer is magnificent 
26632,The Grosvenor, our room was in the wing far too small for a double bed and 2 people It was on the 7th floor and only 1 lift was working for our entire stay The reception staff spoke poor English , good location entrance splendid
26633,The Grosvenor, Had to take 2 separate elevators walk down 3 long hallways to get to the smallest room I have ever been in You could barely walk around the bed No room to open a suitcase , Not much
26634,The Grosvenor, A few details missing on room service but were quickly corrected Check in not terribly smooth but service recovery including a stuffed bear for my daughter was excellent , Room service was fantastic and the room was comfortable and very clean 
26635,The Grosvenor, room is very small hotel needs more lifts there is only one lift in this hotel and always long queue waiting for the lift , bed is good breakfast is excellent and impressive 
26636,The Grosvenor, The room was absolutely tiny as was the bathroom Manouvering from one side of the room to the other with two people was near impossible without one of us climbing onto the bed and for the price we paid was disappointing our stay didn t even include breakfast One of the evenings I rang room service 5 times and no one answered the phone so in the end we gave up and went to bed hungry , Staff were friendly and polite 
26637,The Grosvenor, poor quality TV set with bad reception, position and membership of the executive club which provided continental breakfast and evening snacks and drinks
26638,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Location for travelling about excellent Entry direct from Victoria Tour busses directly outside Cabs and tube on the doorstep Staff were very friendly and helpful hotel was relaxing and quiet just what s needed after a day in the city
26639,The Grosvenor, Queue for check in Took about 15 minutes just to collect our luggage and keys as we had booked in earlier , The beds were comfortable and it was very quiet Excellent location Very useful to be able to leave luggage both before and after our stay 
26640,The Grosvenor, Bed was a little uncomfortable and the shower was very temperamental Although the staff were friendly their was no urgency about them when dealing with check in luggage etc , The room size was very generous even for the standard double The station is literally inside the Victoria station so it is very easy to get around 
26641,The Grosvenor, The staff was quite friendly and cooperative However when we arrived the reception was busy with one person and we had to wait for quite long time They have tiny waiting area which is across the big hall and is next to lifts After waiting for a while we heard noise and saw that security guys rushed to the person at the reception and pushed him out of the hotel hitting and screaming Then I came to the reception and the clerk apologized for what has happened and said that in compensation for what we had to witness hotel will give us a better room superior instead of standard double But when we finally reached our room it appeared to be quite small I guess not more that 15 16 square meters The room was quite narrow There was a double bed and distance from the bed to the walls was no more than a meter from each side which gave an impression of staying in a very narrow space However I had to hurry for an appointment and we accepted the room The breakfast next morning was quite good but same as in the most of the hotels I could not find any fresh vegetables Just baked tomatoes It s quite surprising that in the middle of summer the buffet is full of cooked food but fresh vegetables and fruit are a rarity , I haven t noticed any croissants The bed was quite good but can not say it was extra comfy Nothing special but just as expected
26642,The Grosvenor, We were supposed to have a cake in our room on arrival and nothing was there I had to ring down and ask for it which ruined the suprise a little for my partner , The room was lovely a little bit of a treck to get to it but it was nice and quiet 
26643,The Grosvenor, Lifts out of order Wifi patchy and rooms small even though we were supposed to have an Executive Room Dated and tired decor Wouldn t stay there again ,No Positive
26644,The Grosvenor, I had a room next to the lift so it was noisy and there was a lot of traffic past my door , staff very friendly and helpful beautiful hotel room very clean 
26645,The Grosvenor, I cannot think of anything unlikeable The staff were helpful and the gentleman delivering my breakfast was prompt and helpful, I had a very comfortable night and a decent continental breakfast which laster me until I had dinner at home 
26646,The Grosvenor, Small room Little bit noisy because of the construction around They didn t replace bath stuff , walking distance to the attractive location In Victoria station you get anything you want and it s in the same building 
26647,The Grosvenor, Bar closed early quality of the room facilities average particularly the very old iPhone 4 connection for the Bose player which is useless for modern iPhones , Location and helpful staff
26648,The Grosvenor, Shower cubicle in very poor state with a tiny curtain water was able to pour off the ledge in the tray and practically flood the bathroom which was tiny Could hear the train station announcements loudly as we had window open as a hot day ,No Positive
26649,The Grosvenor, The standard rooms are small as they are in all London hotels with almost no space for clothes or even large suitcases so make sure you book a deluxe room for more space if you stay more than 2 3 days or have large suitcases , Very convenient and comfortable hotel in central London next to Victoria train and underground station Great access for the major sights the parks and for west end shows Very elegant ambiance in the public areas and tastefully furnished rooms
26650,The Grosvenor, We had no view from the room but that is of little consequence , The hotel was superb in every respect the Staff were most attentive and polite Sarah Jane was most helpful and thoughtful 
26651,The Grosvenor, Check in could have been quicker We were queuing for a long time The television picture quality was very poor I would expect better from such a highly rated and priced hotel , Very good location and very clean Facilities were good and the bed was comfy 
26652,The Grosvenor, The room very small booked deluxe room but it was like what I would expect of a standard room Usually get extras such as dressing gown and slippers Very poor value for money as this was booked for a special occasion very disappointed, The location
26653,The Grosvenor, everything, absolutely nothing worst hotel we ve stayed in the staff must even go out their way to be inefficient there was nothing they would do to help 
26654,The Grosvenor, You don t get breakfast included when booking with booking com which wasn t clear from confirmation email and therefore made it a little expensive for room only, Staff friendly and helpful Food in bar area v good Cocktail bar excellent Excellent location
26655,The Grosvenor, The reception staff were very impolite One of the 2 lifts was out of order for my 3 day stay resulting in long delays to get up to my room on 6th floor and coming down by the stairs was quicker than waiting,No Positive
26656,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Hotel was very comfortable and clean Good beds and a good size room Staff very polite and professional Loved the fact it was right at Victoria station and had its own entrance which made travelling around easy Lovely bar and food at a reasonable price Had afternoon tea in the tea rooms which was very nice and the staff again were exceptional 
26657,The Grosvenor, Nothing, The beds are the most comfortable we have had after a month of touring the UK The room was spacious and it was wonderful to be able to sit on a sofa in front of the TV The heated towel rail is an essential for all travelers and this one was on even though the weather was warm therefore washing was a dream 
26658,The Grosvenor, Only one thing that marred our stay was the fact that we were woken at 7 in the morning by water coming through our ceiling On a good note the staff were excellent and had a different room for us within 10 minutes, The location was excellent and was close to everything we wanted
26659,The Grosvenor, Nothing, Since its my birthday they have upgraded me and send my room a postcard cake for my birthday I was really impressed and definitely stay there Location was great 
26660,The Grosvenor, one of the travelers was in a wheelchair and had a tough time having to maneuver the stairs to get into hotel, Location is ideal walking distance to landmarks Rooms comfortable and clean
26661,The Grosvenor, The room space compared to the price was ridiculous Only 1 elevator to the sixth floor Attitude of staff very poorly A totally bad experience , The location 
26662,The Grosvenor, The room reeked of smoke when we complained the check in clerk tried to move us from an executive room to a regular room without any compensation We worked hard to save for splurging on an executive room and weren t going to let her downgrade us for something that wasn t our fault Another clerk seemed to be upset with her trying to downgrade us but maybe our clerk was her superior so she wasn t able to do anything about it We refused to take the downgrade and left for the day when we came back to our surprise our room had been deep cleaned and all the soft furniture pillows and drapes had been replaced with new ones Our room no longer smelled like smoke and we had a wonderful 4 night stay there But then I accidentally forgot an expensive ring and I called as soon as I realized I left it behind I got the same crappy clerk and she told me my ring hadn t been found On our way back through London before coming back to the states I stopped in person to check if there was any chance my ring had been found Luckily I didn t have to speak to Ms Craptastic again and my ring was returned to me I wish I had gotten her name because other than her everyone else who works here is fantastic She really needs to be let go because she is giving the hotel a bad rep , Huge rooms yummy cookies left in room for turn down service Cleaning staff and Security staff were excellent at their jobs and super friendly Great location you can find anything you need at Victoria Station Beds were super comfy and the room was quiet for a good night sleep Giant soaking tub 
26663,The Grosvenor, Though I had paid up everything was stopped at the exit to take payment again and the staff were very rude and for the same room they deducted double payments and very unprofessional and poor service , Nothing was good staring from entry to exit level the whole stay was traumatic 
26664,The Grosvenor, The hotel is not changing those broken shower head That s a surprise for it as a four star hotel , The hotel lobby interior is really nice but the rooms may not be well furnished For example the shower head is broken but still in use and the bed sheet was damaged The location is really good tho And there are speaker in room for guests to use
26665,The Grosvenor, I expected the deluxe double room to be much bigger and more deluxe the bathroom was really tiny , I really liked the hotel s grand interior and the restaurant was very good Good access to the Victoria Station 
26666,The Grosvenor, The room was far too hot The radiator in the bathroom was on constantly with no way of turning it off The air con had no impact The shower needed descaling, The bed was comfy
26667,The Grosvenor,No Negative, room key failed 4 times dreaadfull small room saniflow system awfull noise when using bathroom view from room of victoria station dreadfull would not stay again
26668,The Grosvenor, The cleaner had left the air conditioning on and it was faulty The room was like a sauna Told reception as we were heading out for the evening Her response to a polite request to ask maintenance to take a look was its not my fault Returned at the end of the evening to no message and no fixed air con Had an uncomfortable night as window could not be kept open and room still hot Told reception again in the morning to no avail just a sorry didn t even make a note to put it right for the next guests Would never stay in this hotel again the staff are not trained in customer relations or solving problems , It was booked for a birthday treat and the lady at check in kindly had a slice of cake with happy birthday on delivered to the room 
26669,The Grosvenor, Steps As overseas tourists we had heavy luggage Access is not easy as there are steps to enter the hotel and more steps to access rooms It is also difficult for taxis to stop at the front door , Spacious rooms Very convenient location After a day of sightseeing it was lovely to be able to get off the tube and have a very short indoor walk back to the hotel Wifi worked really easily and well 
26670,The Grosvenor, The hotel is old and rambling and the wing addition not that easy to access But all in this wasnt a huge issue , The first room I was given was pretty grim right over the aircon unit low and dark but I complained and got something better The staff were super with this and moved me without question 
26671,The Grosvenor, Breakfast was rather slow The price put us off having the buffet Tables were close together Huge tv screen was distracting, Stylish Nice cocktail bar Felt like being in New York 
26672,The Grosvenor, Standard Twin Room tiny with far too little storage and cramped bathroom Brasserie food wasn t great expected better , Beds very comfy Staff very friendly and concierges in particular very good Grand Imperial restaurant was fantastic and there was lots of choice for breakfast 
26673,The Grosvenor, There wasn t anything I would change, The location was excellent train tube right on the door A short walk to Buckingham palace Lots of excellent pubs and restaurants As we d come for the theatre we were pleased to find it was a 2 minute walk away
26674,The Grosvenor, There were no drawers for clothes There was a nice closet and a drawer in each night stand but no dresser , Excellent location Very comfortable room Bed was very comfortable I had the best sleep I ever had in a hotel 
26675,The Grosvenor, WC downstairs smelt of drains in corridor, Location is perfect Just next to Victoria underground No noise Beds super comfy Breakfast hot and fresh So close to everything saving on travel time
26676,The Grosvenor, Delayed flight meant we were 4 hours late arriving 1 45 am Phoned ahead to let hotel know Despite this and with NOBODY else around check in took nearly half on hour for our two rooms Noise from Air conditioning kept two of us awake And it woke us after we fell asleep Contacted reception offered new room but as we had to be up at 7 to leave at 8pm it wasn t worth the hassle On checkout expected some gesture from the hotel but I was stone walled , Location
26677,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Love the little touches like heated bathroom floor heated towels and very quiet rooms despite being on the busy street The atmosphere cannot be beat and the location is ideal How often do you get to stay in an old railway hotel 
26678,The Grosvenor, Quality of rooms poor in places need a freshen up However we were upgraded when we queried the room we were in , Staff were very helpful and friendly Hotel is a lovely Building 
26679,The Grosvenor, Needed better check in and better trained staff in the exec lounge v, The room was excellent and the bar nice I had put on special instructions and they phoned me in advance to organise well done and thank you
26680,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Arrived early just to drop of our bags but they had a room available for us and gave us a room upgrade Was asked the purpose of our stay and informed them it was to celebrate my 40th birthday Arrived back from sight seeing the next day to find a bottle of wine and a happy birthday note from the staff Top hotel well looked after and very attentive staff 
26681,The Grosvenor, Queuing up to use the toaster in the morning Toaster didn t work very well There must be a better system for providing toast in the morning , Room was nice and quiet
26682,The Grosvenor, The swipe keys were constantly failing to work over the course of 3 days The staff were not helpful The bathroom was quite small The view from the window was a brick wall ,No Positive
26683,The Grosvenor, VERY noisy bedroom Room 102 and others near by They must be located near to either or both the AC unit or the kitchen extractor fan outside It wasn t the AC unit in the room making the noise because room 624 with AC was quiet, Good size double bed
26684,The Grosvenor, TV reception fuzzy but didn t come to watch TV Room bit small but fine for our needs one night stay , Location perfect arrived at Victoria by train for visit to Buckingham Palace surrounding areas Beautiful entrance foyer Friendly staff Clean well kept Comfy bed Will stay again 
26685,The Grosvenor, Do yourselves a favour Sort out the internal way finding signs It s a labyrinth but that s not the issue Your lazy approach in respect of making sure guests know how to find the way to their very expensive rooms is a complete joke There are plenty of sign companies in London Hire one of them , Basically in Victoria Station So the location is fantastic Very comfortable bed 
26686,The Grosvenor, We were arranged in a room with old furniture and facilities there is even no shower curtain in bathroom After communicating with their staff we were arranged into a better one But it s still overpriced , The location is great
26687,The Grosvenor, We requested a street view and got a view of the roof of Victoria Station even that was quite interesting although noisy , 1 They left us a birthday cake in the room as it was my daughter s birthday 2 The hotel is actually a part of Victoria Station So convenient and within walking distance from major points of interest 
26688,The Grosvenor, Not completely helpful on gluten free products I m a coeliac and have had a better service at other hotels so room for improvement , A beautiful building ideal for Victoria station clean friendly and overall very helpful 
26689,The Grosvenor,No Negative, I sent my parents to the Grovesner for their 30th wedding anniversary They loved it The bed was huge room lovely and surprisingly quiet The hotel is beautiful and they loved exploring in it Nothing was too much trouble for the staff Will definitely go back 
26690,The Grosvenor, WiFi wasn t so good, Staff were so courteous and helpful I walked down to reception dressed for the Royal Garden Party and the receptionist said how lovely I looked it made my day Hotel very classy and perfect location for sightseeing or shopping
26691,The Grosvenor, Rooms dirty sheet had hole in dirt under glass on table and dusty Furniture chipped and damaged Had to get room changed on arrival Second room not much better , Hotel in good location
26692,The Grosvenor, Our room was so far away at the back and the stairs for luggage , We stayed there for a very short time as it was where our tour ended It was comfortable especially the bed The shower was a bit tricky to operate Breakfast was good too 
26693,The Grosvenor, The double rooms have very small bathrooms even for a hotel of the capital close people better pay attention to it The rooms need to be repaired in some places Please note that the hotel s location in a noisy place , Good hotel location for Trips with a stop in London for a couple of days In the hotel you get a full continental breakfast There s a helpful staff and waiters in the restaurant room service at all Thank you to the waiter Victoria for good mood 
26694,The Grosvenor, Second room was not the same quality I booked 2 executive rooms one was a poorer quality water from the shower leaked onto the floor this was not cleaned cleaning in general was poor, Location executive lounge staff
26695,The Grosvenor, Our room standard twin was a bit small Maybe some herbal teas could be included along with tea and coffee , The location was fantastic for walking catching buses for Heathrow and the Chelsea Flower Show and the Underground Buckingham Palace is only a ten minute walk away There are many restaurants and shops if you need food close by We loved the hotels own entrance in Victoria Station 
26696,The Grosvenor, Our room number was 259 and it was very confusing to find our way on the first day with the luggage especially the lift does not take you there and there is stairs to come down from lift , The rooms were very high standard with comfortable bed Fluffy towels staff very friendly Clara was very helpful and had all the information which we needed very impressed with her service Lovely breakfast 
26697,The Grosvenor, Can hear the muffled speakers from the train station from about 7am , Great location right on Victoria station and walking distance to Buckingham Palace Large rooms for London with plenty of space 
26698,The Grosvenor, The room was nicely appointed but it could have been larger Having said that it probably is large by European standards , Really helpful and friendly staff Convenient access to everything we wanted to see Easy to get to via train from airport 
26699,The Grosvenor, Service in the resturantes was not exceptional It took a while to get your food if you did not have the breakfast buffet It also took a while to get you bill for breakfast , Location was wonderfully central you could get the bus next door at Victoria station and go anywhere The room was very quiet 
26700,The Grosvenor, Although the food in the restaurant represented quite good value for London it appeared a little thrown together we sampled breakfast and dinner We returned a room service sandwich as there was no chicken in the chicken mayonnaise They did exchange it for another but it did underline the sloppy kitchen service Not a fan of big screen televisions and pop music when trying to enjoy a meal in the restaurant as if the busy streets of London weren t enough excitement already It can get very busy and cramped immediately outside the hotel as there is a continuous flow of travellers often with suitcases exiting Victoria station , Very clean in rooms and throughout Our twin room 156 was spacious and incredibly quiet Handy shops in Victoria station pretty much under the hotel for those nik naks you forgot Friendly enough staff did what they could Pleasant atmosphere in public spaces great flower arrangements candles and light music 
26701,The Grosvenor, The company computers were not able to get connected via wifi due to the security issues When I required help for that the receptionist said only not possible despite I needed a quick solution He insisted on not finding a solution It was very surprising and rude approach Then I get connected via my cell phone which was actually the thing I wouldn t prefer After a while somebody came from IT however I had already solved it out I didn t like the approach , Location
26702,The Grosvenor, We weren t mad on the bar felt that it could be updated however we still enjoyed a few drinks there , The location was superb delivered right to the door by The Gatwick Express The lobby was lovely the staff very friendly and helpful the beds were extremely comfortable 
26703,The Grosvenor, The twin rooms are a bit small and on one of our stays there was only a locker beside one bed even if it was located between the beds it would have been way better The cost of the accommodation is a bit pricey , The location of the hotel is just excellent the beds are comfy and the breakfast is good have stayed here a good few times and wouldn t consider anywhere else while in London 
26704,The Grosvenor, Too many steps from the footpath to reception Too far to walk to get to the rooms in the Wing section only 2 lifts taking you up to the 4th floor in the main hotel then you have to walk to the wing section and take the wing lift to the floors above level 5 in the wing The wing lift broke down so we had to take the stairs we were on the 7th floor Reception staff were not concerned about the lift situation and treated us with contempt We were told that they were aware of the problem a tech was working on it We were not permitted to use the service elevator whilst the wing lift was out of order we had to climb the stairs That was okay for us but if you were less ambulant or were disabled you wouldn t be able to access your room at all We were not offered any form of compensation for the inconvenience at all Our room was extremely small and claustrophobic Our bed was too soft and collapsed in the center so we were constantly rolling toward each other throughout the night As a result we had hardly any sleep at all Extremely overpriced for what it had to offer , The hotel was very conveniently located above the Victoria Station and adjacent to bus stops Check in and check out was simple 
26705,The Grosvenor, No ramp leading up from the sidewalk to the reception area so we had to carry our suitcases up the steps A very long walk to the wing rooms only one set of lifts leading up to the 4th floor from reception then you walk for a long time to the wing rooms Room very hot but the air conditioner worked very well Bed too soft so we tended to roll toward each other in the middle Room very small but okay The door was extremely heavy to push open Extremely overpriced for what was provided , The location was fantastic 
26706,The Grosvenor, Breakfast not included in the room cost which made the room cost seem rather expensive , The location as we was catching an AM train the following morning from Victoria Station The complementary bottle of Bubbly to celebrate our anniversary was a nice surprise and thank you for that 
26707,The Grosvenor, We would have expected more than 1 pack of biscuits in room We were to have breakfast on train but it was going to be several hours after we got up Not enough packet milk for more than 1 cuppa each At that price I should have expected more Some empty glasses were left on the floor outside the next room for at least 12 hours until we pointed it out to reception who seemed concerned, D cor furnishings and pictures had that expectant departure arrival feel to it all We were travelling on the Belmond formerly Orient Express Pullman for a long day excursion The Hotel s ambience matched the occasion perfectly Bed Fantastic Rear door onto Victoria Station concourse a great benefit 
26708,The Grosvenor, Nothing all was perfect , The helpful and kindness staff The building itself The convenient location close to Victoria Station if you travel through Gatwick Airport
26709,The Grosvenor, There was nothing at all that we didn t like about this hotel or location , Staff could not of been more helpful The bar was nice well stocked and fresh The food was out of this world and well priced The room could not of been better and as for the location well it was central with everything you needed in walking distance We will definitely be staying there next year 
26710,The Grosvenor, The log in information for wifi could have been clearer other than that nothing, The staff were excellent and very helpful more than happy to assist in anyway they could 
26711,The Grosvenor, Safe in room not operating upon arrival refrigerator not working and no hot water for over half an hour on morning of day of departure Had emailed to say that the stay was a special occasion but nothing arranged for us , Staff most helpful
26712,The Grosvenor,No Negative, My husband experienced a medical emergency Sied sp the night manager was extremely helpful He got us a taxi and told the taxi driver to take us to the hospital We had no idea where we were going Sied sent us to the best hospital in London Sied also helped cancel our reservations at our next stop on our travels which took a great burden off our minds While my husband was in the hospital Sied was very helpful getting a cab for me early in the mornings and he was very kind and supportive He seemed to sense my worry and took effort to encourage me The staff was also very accomdating in extending our stay We were so fortunate to have chosen this hotel for its beauty comfort location and service We highly recommend it 
26713,The Grosvenor, The location as very little around the hotel but once inside the hotel I was able to block the outside noise and busyness , The hotel is architecturally stunning beautiful decor clean and comfortable rooms and great facilities the cocktail bar had a low key vibe and was relaxing after being in the hustle and bustle of London 
26714,The Grosvenor, Room was very small and too much had been jammed into it Very little practical hanging space better suited to the male traveller with shirts that women with dresses , Excellent location decent gym and comfortable bed
26715,The Grosvenor, Directions to some bedrooms On occasion I have been quite lost , Proximity to train station Almost always can I get into a room earlier than expected 
26716,The Grosvenor, Requested a quiet room but was given a room above several air conditioning units which were constantly in use , Bed very comfortable food good and good breakfast Good location for Buckingham Palace and theatres close to underground 
26717,The Grosvenor, Nothing to report , Staff were excellent and made our stay very pleasurable Clara had made an appointment with the hair dressers at the required time etc 
26718,The Grosvenor,No Negative, We really enjoyed this wonderful hotel This hotel had character and charm and our room was very comfortable The main restaurant was superb and had great food and service The morning breakfasts were great The concierge was very helpful with directions and helpful touring ideas The desk clerks were very courteous and friendly This hotel was not expensive The location is great with a side entrance directly into Victoria Station Many sites were within easy walking distance We highly recommend this hotel We look forward to our next visit to London with a stay at The Grosvenor 
26719,The Grosvenor, Staff were too busy chatting away rather than paying attention to their front counter some seemed rather rude, Change the name its confusing with Grosvenor house
26720,The Grosvenor, Wi Fi in the room was unreliable We were constantly having to reconnect and log in The log in procedure was time consuming and frustrating The bathtub filled with water while showering It drained very slowly poorly The view from our window was poor We basically looked out from our 6th floor window onto a bus depot and construction activity There is a bus stop right out in front of the hotel The area was always full of folks waiting on the bus which made moving along the sidewalk to and from the hotel difficult The area is also congested with folks going to from the train station bus depot and underground all of which are located right behind the property There was half eaten food in room service dishes in the hall just outside our door upon arriving They were still there the next day so we told the front desk The dishes were removed The next day a coffee cup from our room was left in the same location not by us It was still there in the hallway when we checked out 3 days later , The hotel building and interior are beautiful It is an older property that has been restored well 
26721,The Grosvenor, Staff could have been a little more friendly Hotel restaurant was understaffed took way too long to get food and the check , Loacation was great next to the Victoria train station Hotel was very quiet and clean Lobby was beautiful 
26722,The Grosvenor, 5 for a cup of tea ouch pint of beer was cheaper Also discretionary service charge of 12 5 for serving one drink at the bar was taking the mickey , Excellent service from all staff
26723,The Grosvenor, Small room Cramped Stayed in a twin room for two nights and was glad I wasn t staying longer No room for luggage , Excellent location with easy access to the tube station Handy for onward travel to the airport and for buying snacks in the station 
26724,The Grosvenor, Really disappointed with the room the hotel staff and the experience overall The shower was cold the bed was uncomfortable the staff were rude I felt this was extremely over priced for what we got Comparatively we stayed in another hotel for two nights and had a wonderful experience there , Location was handy
26725,The Grosvenor, I was very disappointed in the breakfast Coffee was cold Changed twice but no improvement Wished we had taken breakfast at Victoria Station , Bed very comfy Staff very helpful and pleasant 
26726,The Grosvenor, The only negative would be the temperature of the shower water it was barely warm , The bed was incredibly comfortable location was perfect menu was very good giving a variety of dishes and staff were very hospitable by supplying gluten free options 
26727,The Grosvenor, The room was not up to the rest of the hotel s standard Small room rickety chair window didn t close properly so got a bit drafty no drawers to put clothes in and dusty behind the and under furniture and beds , The Reunion bar and the Chinese restaurant were of very high standard The staff beautiful entrance and on site food drink venues were of high standard over all
26728,The Grosvenor, Nothing, Fantastic place to stay staff were great food was brilliant and just overall spectacular building in the heart of London definetly would stay again
26729,The Grosvenor, I couldn t get WiFi in my room and being beside the station meant we heard the announcements from the early hours , The staff were very helpful and friendly as always The bed was very comfy and the room was clean The food was very nice 
26730,The Grosvenor, Nothing springs to mind , The helpfulness of the staff Nothing was too much trouble The beautiful smell in and around the foyer and the floral displays 
26731,The Grosvenor, the service at the hotel is horrible You can call housekeeping room service and reception and nobody is picking up for up to 30 min After having called room service with no response for more than 30 minutes I had to go to the reception myself as they were not picking up the phone as well After placing the order at the reception I got a cold and tasteless soup after 40 minutes There were also other issues like not ordering an airport taxi despite knowing there are no taxis at the street Sunday morning a long and nonexhaustive list of failures, stylish decoration and close to all sights
26732,The Grosvenor, The bathroom was very up to date but a bit small , Gorgeous hotel at Victoria Station Very old world but the rooms were renovated the beds extra comfortable I loved staying here 
26733,The Grosvenor, We found it difficult to let the water out of the basin We found it difficult to adjust the mirror , The staff were wonderful and the food was good Access was easy once in the hotel The room was spacious and easy to move around 
26734,The Grosvenor, Wish there had been a separate shower in our delux room and a better view , Bedroom lovely and beds so comfortable Beautiful hotel and breakfast very good 
26735,The Grosvenor, I had to leave after one night , The attention to detail was outstanding We were left a little package of snacks in the bedroom We were also upgraded to a king size bed free of charge as my other half is rather tall Location was exactly what we needed 
26736,The Grosvenor, We paid for a executive room so we could use the lounge We found the lounge poor compared to other lounges we have used No vegetarian food on offer and when I asked if they could provide something was told no The complimentary wine under lock and key and have to keep asking if you would like a drink Hardly anything on offer to eat and breakfast was poor We have used executive lounges at the Marriott chain and at the Millenium hotel in London and were far better and offered so much more They don t even offer nibbles such as nuts and crisps to have with your drinks just a jar of hazelnuts , Complimentary upgrade to a suite from an executive room and reception staff were very helpful 
26737,The Grosvenor, No ramps no doorman struggled to get 2 cases up the stairs ordinary room ordinary breakfast buffet drab dinning room with no table cloths and unpleasant crockery cutlery very poor service in dinning room all females running around after any men and I had to ask 3 times for an expresso sorry I forgot and it was far from busy lacklustre reception no direction for using phone eg what number for reception had to return to reception twice to get it sorted and then outrageous charges I would give this hotel 3 stars now You are just paying for the location and London prices , Location is very handy next to Victoria station Concierge was most helpfull with luggage and getting taxi
26738,The Grosvenor, The bed was extremely firm and uncomfortable This Made for a bad nights sleep , Location was fantastic just around the corner from the theatre and tube station 
26739,The Grosvenor, Tired old rooms Paid for upgrade but when shown room was much lower standard than the room given to my parents in law who hadn t paid for an upgrade Was given a slightly better room when I complained but was still lower standard and much smaller than my parents in law room, Location and pub restaurant food was very good
26740,The Grosvenor, Entry from front street level required lifting luggage up several steps many more steps from Victoria Station entry to lobby bus stop in front of hotel created overly crowded entry on very narrow sidewalk bathroom was quite small Food was average , Room was large comfortable clean view was good Convenient access to Victoria Station from inside hotel 
26741,The Grosvenor, We had service issues in both restaurants not enough staff resulted in very slow service , The beds were comfortable property is stunning and the food in the pub and Chinese restaurant was absolutely delicious 
26742,The Grosvenor, The Wi Fi connection was a little hit and miss could have been better , The whole hotel was just luxurious and so clean Staff were fantastic and extremely friendly and helpful Absolutely stunning hotel We had breakfast bought to our room which was absolutely delicious and bought up right on time we requested and was lovely and hot Would recommend staying here 
26743,The Grosvenor, All was superb Staff were exceptionally professional right from Reception till my Departure , Value for money indeed Will be back for a full weekend 
26744,The Grosvenor, No complaints at all , Excellent location friendly staff well appointed clean room Attached to Victoria station which gives you convenient access to anywhere you want to go Walking distance from buckingham palace Westminster Abbey and Big Ben and other points of interest Loved it 
26745,The Grosvenor, My wife is a Coeliac and we were disappointed that for breakfast there was not a lot of choice for her and staff did not seen to know what she could eat etc Although our room was good the main Shower would only run cold perhaps it was us but I can usually work out how it works but nut this time , The service was good and all staff polite and very helpful 
26746,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Beautiful classic hotel Very plush Stayed in an executive king which gave access to lounge Fabulous breakfast and free evening drinks made the stay extra special Location cannot be beat when visiting central London Highly recommend 
26747,The Grosvenor, Towel rail in bathroom was very hot to touch Made the bathroom very warm after a shower The room itself was also very warm and although the air con was on 16 it was too hot to sleep comfortably Coffee selection could have been better All but one were the same flavour Booked an afternoon tea as it was a very special occasion Found the service in the beginning to be poor It appeared as though the staff had no idea of what I had booked I had also asked for a vegan option in advance and this appeared to have been forgotten All he got was sandwiches which were very nice I would suggest to offer maybe some fruit or something else to give a desert option , Room was lovely clean and tidy Overall the stay was good and staff were friendly Location is excellent and the hotel looks lovely inside 
26748,The Grosvenor, Nothing, Beautiful hotel in a central location Staff were amazing couldn t do enough for you We got a free upgrade on our room which was superb and unexpected Couldn t fault it 
26749,The Grosvenor, Breakfast was very poor I am not a fan of buffet style breakfast anyway but the food had obviously been out a while and was tepid so by the time you have your food and waited to get toast the food was cold the bacon was dry and shrivelled the mushroom a bit of a warm oily mess I sent it back to the kitchen to be warmed but it came back slightly warmer but the middle of the sausage was still cold Ended up with a croissant and apple which wasn t worth the money I paid I think you should consider cooking a fresh plated breakfast for 17 00 I would stay at the Hotel again but I will go out for meals , Checked in and out with no fuss staff were very helpful Everything was clean but we didn t see staff cleaning etc The Hotel was quiet The room was nice and the bed was comfortable All the staff I encountered were helpful and friendly 
26750,The Grosvenor, There was no toilet brush in the bathroom and the sink area was a little confined but we made do , We loved the position of the hotel it was close to the underground so we could get around 
26751,The Grosvenor, The room we had 234 was an upgrade but it wasn t big I think it was an upgrade as it was a front facing room over looking the park You can hear train announcements from the back of the hotel , The staff were very helpful had a free upgrade The room was very cosy and clean Couldn t have asked for a better location There s a side door that takes you straight into the train station too 
26752,The Grosvenor, Front of house reception staff very unhelpful and not intrested in helping asked for early check in to 1 of our 2 rooms booked as we wanted to freshen up before theatre trip didn t even listen just fobbed off with we will ask housekeeping Made to feel like we were just another on their conveyer belt of customers was like they were not even listening , Bar staff was fantastic and made us very welcome 
26753,The Grosvenor, They could put some bathrobe in the bedroom and the phone didn t seems to work properly but yet not a big deal this is only to help the hotel to be even better , Very well located in the city the bedroom was very quite even know the hotel is located in a very busy street The staffs were also very polite and helpfull Of course it can always be better but they are not selling the hotel as a 5 stars hotel it s a truly beautiful and very honorable 4 stars Honestly speaking it s a very good value for the money you pay 
26754,The Grosvenor, Housekeeping ignored Do not disturb sign 9am Saturday morning knocking then opened door to room Seems to be prevalent and really annoying , Great friendly check in staff Ideal for Westminster 
26755,The Grosvenor, nothing at all, Great value for money food in restaurants was excellent rooms were spacious and immaculate staff freindly and very helpful will be staying again
26756,The Grosvenor, My room was extremely small with very little space in the entrance and around bed even for a slim person dark cupboard The new wing rooms lack ambiance Pity the main building old part not available for everyone , Check in and house keeping were good and friendly
26757,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Had a birthday party in the Reunion Bar and stayed over for convenience Brilliant location staff were attentive and attended to everything we needed 
26758,The Grosvenor, The meal in the Grosvenor Arms could have been better and the cocktail bar is far too expensive for the drinks you end up with Having a secret gratuity added to the bills for both of these therefore was not really appreciated I don t mind tipping but only when it s deserved , The executive double room was enormous and the rainfall shower was a dream to use The whole hotel feels very opulent and expensive and the location is absolutely perfect The hotel wasn t cheap to book but where in London is And you do at least get what you pay for here it s a lovely hotel 
26759,The Grosvenor, Some scones were very heavy not up to any hotel standard a couple were fine The chocolate bite sized cakes stodgy and these items spoilt the afternoon tea , The bed was firm supportive and very comfortable The hallway was impressive Good location Porridge and poached eggs were no problem when we requested these at breakfast Good Ambience in the restaurant and tea room 
26760,The Grosvenor, WiFi was extremely slow and couldn t use Bad lighting for ladies getting ready in room , Excellent location for train travellers from manchester staff were attentive clean rooms Comfy bed 
26761,The Grosvenor, Breakfast would have been nice but not included in price , Very quiet room on the wing overlooking the station Very quiet with comfortable bed and great shower bath 
26762,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff was especially helpful We asked where the entrance to the train station was when we were checking out and the gentleman actually carried our bags down the stairs and into the train station for us they were all very helpful The room was very comfortable and we had a good view of the city 
26763,The Grosvenor, Rooms were on the small side square footage was given but I wasn t 100 on what that would look like once in the room Bathroom was small too but it s not like I was spending most of my day in there , The back entrance to the Hotel was in Victoria station so it was really handy not having to walk around with our cases Staff were very helpful I d obtained a breakfast voucher after booking but this couldn t be added on so as a compromise we were offered a free upgrade with use of the executive suite On our first day the concierge asked if we were going far as it may rain and offered us a complimentary hotel umbrella nice touch 
26764,The Grosvenor, The room was appalling Forget the pictures on the website The twin room was so small you couldn t swing a cat and housed in the wing accessed via two lifts and a route march All the hallmarks of a larger room that had been split into a smaller one to sweat the asset Curtains fitted into the window recess and not the outside Result Light flooding in at any time this is a capital city hotel for goodness sake The lights never dim outside No room between the beds and very little down the sides A standard lamp in one corner that you walked into every time you walked around the beds An office chair that couldn t come out from under the desk because the foot of the bed was too close You entered the room and walked straight into the side of the wardrobe Full entry required negotiating a dog leg movement A mini fridge housed in the wardrobe that couldn t be accessed unless you opened both wardrobe doors A life expired TV An en suite so small that the sink was an arm rest when sat on the lavatory The hotel was booked because my daughter was undertaking a theatre experience in the West End and in particular the Apollo Victoria Theatre Whilst the theatre experience was wonderful this room really took the shine off What an end to a hard working day sleeping in a rabbit hutch , The hotel is close to Victoria A beautiful entrance lobby that lulls the unsuspecting traveller into believing that the rest of the hotel experience will be just as beautiful 
26765,The Grosvenor, Prices in bar a bit over stated compared to similar establishments , Very comfortable rooms Great location and was easy to travel Really nice and friendly staff
26766,The Grosvenor, Being told in advance of the easy access to the hotel via Victoria Station would have earned a higher rating from me Arriving at Victoria we got lost in the building works , We ate twice with our family visiting from outside GB and also had tea Everything was of a high standard and nothing was too much trouble for the staff 
26767,The Grosvenor, No proper heating in room we had Noisy air con heating windows in room were open when we arrived it was cold and very hard to close them pillows could of been a lot softer , Central location good selection of food for breakfast polite friendly staff very welcoming spacious bedroom 
26768,The Grosvenor, Could hear announcements from the station but didn t really disturb any sleep, Big spacious room with good facilities and the whole place was beautiful with chandeliers and comfy arm chairs Had afternoon tea there too which was delicious and the staff were attentive 
26769,The Grosvenor, Poor cleaning of room but after a short phone call to reception the problem was sorted , Very comfortable bed and quiet room with good amenities Central for train and underground and a large amount of shops on site 
26770,The Grosvenor, The phone music dock didn t work , The whole stay from check in to checkout was the best experience of my life The staff were attentive friendly and professional The hotel is opulent I would love to go to London again just to stay in the hotel and have the most fantastic dinner and couple of days of my life Thank you so much to all the staff at the Grosvenor We will never forget it 
26771,The Grosvenor, Our air conditioning wasn t working and i asked somebody to check it while we were out But when we got back it was exactly the same I did mention it again when I checked out so the next person wasn t so hot in the room , The location was excellent for our stay The breakfast was very good The staff were very helpful and friendly nothing was too much trouble 
26772,The Grosvenor, Our twin room was pretty small and the window was covered in hand finger prints, Excellent location for getting around very comfy beds friendly staff generally very clean the price we paid was very good
26773,The Grosvenor,No Negative, We were greeted by lovely friendly staff who on our arrival upgraded us to an executive room as it was my Birthday They then rang the room and asked if everything was ok and were we happy with the room we then went out shopping on our return the staff had kindly left me a birthday cake and a post card wishing me a happy birthday Lovely personal touches which made our stay a little more individual and special well done The Grovsneor
26774,The Grosvenor, Not the friendliest check in Required to produce ID for all guests Never had this before Tatty bedroom furniture, Convenient for Westminster Central London Room small but comfortable 
26775,The Grosvenor, We were supposedly upgraded but the room was very small glad we did not pay the rate for a deluxe as would have been even more dissapointed Asked staff but were told that the room we were given was a deluxe , Lovley decor in main building
26776,The Grosvenor, Tannoy at Victoria station could be heard from the room Not really an issue as measures were in place to try and lessen the noise Very central London location so wouldn t expect any less Doesn t affect my 10 rating , Excellent location friendly and helpful staff Room was immaculate 
26777,The Grosvenor, My room overlooked the bus depot which was a tad noisy at night That said I was shattered and the bed was comfy so no issues when I fell asleep , Location great bed was comfy and I felt great value 
26778,The Grosvenor, Having received a phone call from the hotel a few days before to say both the rooms I had booked had been upgraded to executive rooms we were all quite excited On arrival at the hotel we were allocated the two rooms 1 was far superior to the other which was a big disappointment to me as we I ended up with the more basic room Why call ahead and then change what you are offering , Location was excellent Was raining when we went out and the hotel lent us an umbrella 
26779,The Grosvenor, Had the feel of a rabbit warren Should have more prominent signs for lifts and reception especially on the 4th to 6th floors Could not see a map in my room on how to leave if a fire alarm was sounded If it was there it should have been PROMINENT TV had poor sound quality and no teletext which I use a lot as I have a hearing problem so I use teletext for the news etc However I would certainly return and recommend the hotel excellent value and extremely helpful staff , quiet comfortable room I had the room at a special price excellent value
26780,The Grosvenor, The rooms seem more spacious in the pictures than they really are , The location is just the best possible The hotel is quite charming and calm although in a busy surrounding 
26781,The Grosvenor, We booked as 2 adults and 2 children We would have expected the rooms to be next to eat other if interconnecting weren t available Our rooms where several doors apart and opposite so it did not feel safe knowing my children were not close by I feel we should have been advised if this especially when the lady who phoned us the day before gave the impression that we had connecting room I would not rebook on this basis , Nice bed
26782,The Grosvenor, Breakfast a little on the warm side and not a lot to choose from compared to a lot of other hotels I have stayed in Also Free View had no TV menu so didn t know what you was watching also it might just of been our room but they wasn t much channels even though it was Free View, Excellent Hotel Beds comfortable hotel was very clean food lunch Evening Meal excellent for money and the Staff couldn t do enough to help I would really recommend this hotel we will be staying their again very soon 
26783,The Grosvenor, There wasn t anything to dislike , We were very impressed to arrive and be told we had been upgraded to a suite Lovely touch also the excutive lounge was first class we couldn t have asked for more 
26784,The Grosvenor, The service in the lounges restaurants was good but at times i felt that the hotel was short of a person Shower didn t get repaired , Food excellent Loved the corner room and the whole ambience of the hotel and architecture Modern but with an old fashioned twist 
26785,The Grosvenor, Unfortunately choose the weekend that work was being done on the tracks at Victoria station so sadly it was noisy on the 2nd night however my friend slept throughout , Rooms were lovely Beds we re really comfortable Great staff really helpful 
26786,The Grosvenor, Wifi in our room was terrible It is also huge Couldn t keep the bathroom door open , Beautiful foyer Excellent location Rooms were comfortable Staff very friendly
26787,The Grosvenor, We were offered a free bottle of wine no room upgrade to celebrate a 50th Birthday sadly it took two phone calls to chase the wine which arrived 30mins before we were due to head out Great promise turned out to be a bit of a let down, Location was excellent for our visit to Victoria Palace Theatre
26788,The Grosvenor, View from room was awful air con units and filthy yard breakfast was of the highest quality unfortunately it was stone cold , The staff where amazing location was superb The hotel is stunningly beautiful Our room was clean comfortable I would highly recommend the Grosvenor and will certainly be stopping there in the future 
26789,The Grosvenor, Construction on streets outside also mainly no shops and few caf s restaurants nearby have to walk a distance if you wish to get to parks or shopping areas Also screen TV in breakfast room distracting very mediocre standard breakfast, Foyer very striking good soundproof rooms comfortable bed Afternoon tea salon lovely
26790,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful as there were six of us we ate breakfast in the lounge and staff couldn t have been more attentive Usually we eat out for breakfast but because the hotel had made such an impression we decided to eat in and had a thoroughly enjoyable leisurely breakfast Loved the grandeur of the hotel and it didn t look tired 
26791,The Grosvenor, We changed the schedule with one less night from the requested For the change we are asked to call the booking company We lost 18 pounds with no success Later the other receptionist called for us and solved the problem immediately This is because the other party knows who is calling You should have called for us from the beginning This is the only complain for our stay ,No Positive
26792,The Grosvenor, The restaurant was very good and good value but we had 3 X cups of tea and 4 slices of bread toasted at 10am on 20 3 16 in the side room and got charged 22 30 which I thought was ridiculous , The location was fantastic and the staff were very helpful and friendly
26793,The Grosvenor, Our room didn t have a mirror next to the desk which would ve made more sense to me from a woman s point of view of course , Breakfast is amazing The decor is beautiful Location is excellent Beds super comfy 
26794,The Grosvenor, No electric plugs for charging phone up There was one that was behind the tv despite the hotel supplying hair dryer iron ipod bose Very little milk , Location is fantastic Very classy and decadent Lovely champagne bar
26795,The Grosvenor, Bathroom in need of renovation , Lovely reception area and entrance hall good central location although noisy in the evening My room was in the wing so further to access Pleasant room with everything I needed including an iron Bed comfortable and clean 
26796,The Grosvenor, We ate in the Chinese restaurant in the hotel the food was ok but that s all it was 100 for two with sparking water , The location is fantastic round the corner from Victoria Station We only stayed one night so didn t really see much of the hotel 
26797,The Grosvenor, No complaints or areas to improve on from our visit , The staff were very friendly and happy to help at all times Our room was outstanding Very clean spacious beautiful design layout and features The hotel itself is in a fantastic location for people visiting London to sightsee as it s around the corner from Victoria station A perfect mix of the old historic lavish London you would expect with a hint of modernisation I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone and am looking forward to visiting again A huge thank you to the staff for making our visit a memorable and special one Look forward to returning to the Grosvenor Hotel in the near future 
26798,The Grosvenor, Dis organised arrangement for breakfast quite poor for taste quality and presentation Wished we d organised breakfast in bed that menu looked great dining room option was disappointing to say the least , Made very welcome by the concierge who offered to check us in as there was a queue at reception The room wasn t ready which wasn t surprising as we were there for around 10 am We were upgraded as it was my husbands birthday Later that day when we had arrived back at the hotel our luggage was in our room and 10 minutes later we were given a complementary bottle of wine and a happy birthday message 
26799,The Grosvenor, The fact that a tray of left over food was left outside a door on the fourth floor for a full day and a half although it was reported by us on our first day, Our room was good the bed was comfy and our gift of bottle of wine much appreciated
26800,The Grosvenor, The noise Traffic noise all night Stayed on 4th floor and Mays well sleep outside with the noise level took a while to drop of to sleep due to this, Extra comfy bed hard to get up in the morning Fab location and close to everything
26801,The Grosvenor, My room was a little on the small side but that is London I found it easier to boil the kettle on the floor for tea as there was little room on the desk A hazard if you have small children But there was plenty of tea and coffee unlike many other hotels Toiletries were sparse I took no soap and relied on the hotel to supply it I am sure the staff would willingly have supplied more if asked Wifi occasionally signed me off , I needed a location near Victoria Station This hotel has an entrance into the station so could be no nearer The foyer and public areas of the hotel are impressive The hotel was excellent as were the staff who were without exception polite friendly and helpful Bar and restaurant prices are very reasonable for London I woukd certainly stay here again Free wifi
26802,The Grosvenor, Room 102 very noisy I think there was a unit may be air con that made a very load noise until 2 00 am then all went quite until about 6 00 am My own fault I should of asked for a new room No view , Friendly helpful Staff location value for money and description on website accurate 
26803,The Grosvenor, I didn t like being on the station side so that despite being on the 5th floor you could hear the ambient noise of the station announcements and the pipes must have gone past my room as there was a lot of water flushing noise room 555 and reception staff could have been friendlier but otherwise a great hotel at a great price , I must praise their maintenance staff Aziz who was not only prompt in replacing a burnt out light bulb but also helped me get a floor lamp as the room was under lit with only 2 bedside lamps and a desk lamp He really cared and made an extra effort first to get the lamp and then to get the extension cord so it could be plugged in It s so rare to find someone who cares about your comfort in a big hotel The room was otherwise very good spacious and had 3 windows so during the day nice and bright but evenings gloomy before the extra lamp 
26804,The Grosvenor, The room was ok but not great It was cleanish but not what I expected The plumbing in the bathroom was bad so the room smelt less than fresh The room was over the station and despite having asked for a quiet room I woke up to the sound of the voice announcing the departure times of the trains For a hotel with this price I expected much more , The entrance to the hotel is very nice Very close to Victoria station 
26805,The Grosvenor, The service at breakfast and evening meal was not good at all and the food at supper mediocre and the venue is very gloomy in the Dorchester Arms, As above
26806,The Grosvenor, We didn t sleep well and both woke up with back and neck pain Complained to staff also by e mail no response back Feel we are being fobbed off Not a very Professional for a top hotel Disappointed , Close to station and our valentines location Beautiful hotel 
26807,The Grosvenor, When I came back to the room at Sunday lunchtime there was a fashion show going on in the function room opposite my room There were people drinking and using the corridor outside my room as a party venue There was very loud music coming from the function r om which was inescapable in my room As much as I understand this happens in hotels you should keep guests away from it How am I supposed to relax in my room with this type of noisy event next to my room Every other day was perfect but this gets a 0,No Positive
26808,The Grosvenor, Drinks and beverages were on the high side , The reception staff were very welcoming It was very clean and the breakfast was of good quality with plenty of choice 
26809,The Grosvenor, For the price I was disappointed that there was no hairdryer Tv quality was poor and bose speaker didn t work, Bed very comfy Room clean and decor was lovely 
26810,The Grosvenor, Sitting in bath meant I could see really horribly dirty rim under toilet Not nice , Location right at station perfect for our needs Late night room service also produced brilliant steak at 10 45pm 
26811,The Grosvenor, The odd train announcement but that s whay you get been next to a train station nothing to worry about was at decent times , Great location and lovely reception foyer Would definitely stay here again
26812,The Grosvenor, The room was pretty small and the bed was tiny bear in mind we did book a room with a standard double and I am 8 months pregnant It was still nice just not Fantastic , Staff was lovely breakfast was amazing And the hotel as a whole was very nice to The location was perfect 
26813,The Grosvenor, Size of the room very small could hardly move very restricted not a lot of room for cases Insufficient tea and coffee and used things not cleaned from previous occupants , Beds very comfortable and clean Good location 
26814,The Grosvenor,No Negative, By far the best hotel experience I have ever had The staff were both efficient and friendly at all times making me and my mother feel very welcome The hotel itself has beautiful interior and the rooms are very comfortable we both had a very relaxing nights sleep I would definatly stay again 
26815,The Grosvenor, Standard Rooms too small upgrade recommended Not a good place for night life activity , Very central location Excellent spot for public transportation Gatwick Express tube etc Beautiful entrance staircase and corridors Good Asian restaurant
26816,The Grosvenor, Rude inattentive restaurant and bar staff Lukewarm food at breakfast inedible cheap salty bacon Requested a quiet room when booking given a room directly next door to gym Woken up by constant thudding of gym equipment at 6 30am on Sunday morning , Great location impressive reception area and friendly welcoming reception staff 
26817,The Grosvenor, I closed my card off when I paid for the rooms on arrival however when one of my party charged a drink to the room for 8 89 an additional pre authorised amount of 200 was taken which I had no knowledge of until I checked my bank balance on returning home This was extremely disappointing especially as I advised I did not want to keep my card open for extra s and I was not asked my permission to charge this pre authorised amount to my card In addition when contacting my bank they informed me that the amount would not be credited back to my until 10 days later , Special touches we were upgraded for my partners birthday and a bottle of room and card were there for him the room
26818,The Grosvenor, Other guests were offered a glass of bubbly or juice on arrival we were not at breakfast other guests were offered pots of tea we were not none of which was a problem but we did notice that we had been left out , Staff were all extremely helpful friendly the room was lovely comfortable Hotel very beautiful especially the main entrance 
26819,The Grosvenor,No Negative, breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice almost too much our room was very comfortable my only regret was i didn t take my gym clothes for the state of the art gym
26820,The Grosvenor, There was nothing we didn t like about the hotel, We loved the hotel and all its staff were very friendly Our room was excellent the size of the bed was superb A 
26821,The Grosvenor, Coffee could have been warmer out if the machine , Bed was amazing and comfortable The crossaints were better than the ones I ve had bought straight from a bakery in France Breakfast had everything you could want Staff were so friendly approachable and amazing Whole hotel was the best we ve ever stayed in 10 10
26822,The Grosvenor, Disabled access no staff offered help with wheelchair breakfast was barely warm scrambled egg cold tea not hot sat at low table for breakfast noise in early hours woke everyone , Location 
26823,The Grosvenor, The lighting in the bedroom was poor very dark and no mirror in bedroom area Ask if you bedroom faces the train station as staff did not make us aware and we were woken at 6 30am with the station tannoy system Spoke to staff upon leaving and didn t even get an apology We paid for breakfast but when we went down the waiter didn t explain where we needed to go and the cooked breakfast was cold , Good location and very clean 
26824,The Grosvenor, Nothing , Staff kindly accommodated our last minute decision to spend the night in London gave us wash bags and made phone chargers available extremely convenient location
26825,The Grosvenor, Room was a bit cold they brought an additional heater but I didn t really have the time to set it up for a good temperature Also the Victoria station was right below my window and it was a bit noisy I couldn t close the windows completely , Beautiful place Great location Very nice staff 
26826,The Grosvenor, We had poor service in the cocktail bar on Saturday evening no smiles and noone looked very happy to be there , We had afternoon tea on Sunday and the gentleman who served us made it extra special 
26827,The Grosvenor, Lighting was quite dull in bedroom, Atmosphere was friendly relaxed welcoming decor beautiful cleanliness spot on liked entrance from station 
26828,The Grosvenor,No Negative, the room was so beautiful and we were upgraded aswell so that was wonderful breakfast was yummy and the staff were amazing thankyou for a lovely stay this is our favourite hotel x
26829,The Grosvenor, the breakfast was adequate but boring uninspired same choices for the 7 days I stayed it was bland , staff helpful and friendly nice looking hotel well maintained 
26830,The Grosvenor, The staff are quite curt you que for reception for way to long , Excellent location right into Victoria station Rooms basic but comfortable you can t hear the train station at all 
26831,The Grosvenor, Heating did not work but was sorted quite quickly Room adequate small Main restaurant closed for private function Room not ready on arrival despite being past 3pm, The building meal and breakfast
26832,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Helpful and friendly staff and the location of the Hotel is just perfect easy to access from Victoria Station especially when it is raining just follow the signs from the main concourse up a flight of stairs Champagne and Cocktail bar is lively too
26833,The Grosvenor,No Negative, My husband and I were celebrating our 1st anniversary The hotel gave us a lovely room upgrade for free and a free entry to an executive lounge area and to top it off they gave us a lovely slice of cake with a card to celebrate as a gift The staff was amazing We felt like we were royalty all doors where open for us as we left and entered the building taxi ready for us outside We would love to go again and recommend to all our close family and friends 
26834,The Grosvenor, There was no hot water on our first day The room was also freezing cold The signage to our room wasn t clear at all the door to access our floor was locked and we had to go back down to get reception to open it The lift to this floor was also out of order and we had to carry our heavy suitcase up steep stairs ,No Positive
26835,The Grosvenor, The coffee in the hotel lounge was awful and our room was cold when we arrived, Staff were very polite and helpful The room and bathroom was spotless and the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable
26836,The Grosvenor, May be our standard room could be a little bit nicer, The Location of this hotel is totally convenient it even have an entrance directly from Victoria Station no need to go outside to the streets The staff is very attentive and pleasant The breakfast was very good fresh pastries delicious fresh fruit 
26837,The Grosvenor, Wasn t much near the hotel so spent a fortune on taxis Our breakfast menu for room service wasn t collected and when breakfast was late we realised the menu was still on the door When it did arrive after we phoned reception it was luke warm and no toast but appeared to have a lot of butter and jam In all fairness we did have a free bottle of wine sent to the room as an apology Following morning we only had 1 cup so had to take it in turns to have a drink Breakfast room felt like a school room and not the ambience we expected I also don t like having my breakfast with a man sitting slightly above my eye level on a bar stool wearing shorts hairy legs are not appealing whilst eating I think the dress code should be no shorts Didn t take a picture of our room view it was buildings and cranes , Hotel was comfortable and warm and the staff were friendly
26838,The Grosvenor, Can t think of anything, I was so surprised at how good the overall experience was Way better than I would have expected at the price Friendly and efficient staff comfortable and quiet room Common areas were immaculate
26839,The Grosvenor, Nothing, The staff were very helpful I booked this for my husbands 50th Birthday they upgraded our room offered me a choice of cake or a bottle of wine as everything I booked was a surprise the staff were discrete I can t praise them enough
26840,The Grosvenor, Room was a little small, The convinence of being next to the rail station and being greeted with a smile after a fairly long commute helped ease the stress of travelling 
26841,The Grosvenor, I had an inside room that overlooked the roof of Vicotria station and a single skinned window so I could hear all the announcements Double glazing would be better or thicker curtains , Location close to our London offices in Upper Belgrave Street was superb also handy for travelling to Victoria It was a very luxurious hotel that impressed our visitor Good breakfast buffet choice and a fast check out Bar staff were friendly when we met others for drinks
26842,The Grosvenor, Nothing, The breakfast was plentiful and very fresh with something for all pallets and many diets The room we had was a twin double which was kindly upgraded by the management without us making any request nor complaining which was extremely generous and a kind gesture bearing In mind the circumstances for our visit 
26843,The Grosvenor, Nothing , Best nights sleep quiet despite noisy location v fast check in and wonderful friendly staff Told them it was my boyfriends birthday and they upgraded us and left a bottle of wine in the room Fantastic service Oh and the hotel is breathtaking 
26844,The Grosvenor, The mattress toppers on the beds were a bit scruffy looking TV channels pretty rubbish Ok so you don t go on holiday to watch telly but when you re out sightseeing all day you re sometimes in quite early and it would have been good to have digital TV not just a selection of dodgy channels after all there are 100 s of freeview channels available for free in the UK Our toiletries were already used and not replenished on arrival Coffee bar closes too early , Great location next to Victoria station and tube 
26845,The Grosvenor, The bar food was average for the price I ordered crayfish on a bloomer when it arrived the bread and crayfish filling were very cold as if taken from the chiller unit The chips were also cold , The staff were very attentive and helpful 
26846,The Grosvenor, While the room was large it lacked character the decor was dated and in need of a redo to match other parts of the hotel , Loved the wow factor of the lobby the gym and the location 
26847,The Grosvenor, No where to dry and straighten my hair a mirror by the desk dressing table would be good obviously designed by a man , The staff were so friendly and helpful and the bed was superb 
26848,The Grosvenor, If I was being really reallly picky the freebie toiletries were no great shakes and did not give the finishing touch to the otherwise lovey elegant bathrooms , Conveiniance of having a side entrance door directly from Victoria Station so no distance to lug luggage from Gatwick Express especially handy for a late arrival and early departure Very handy buses right out side the door C1 to Westfield Shopping Mall via Kensington High Street V A and Sloane Sq C2 to Regent Street Oxford Circus and the 11 to Traflager Sq The Strand and Convent Garden for Theatres Beds really comfy and rooms quiet bathroom simple and classy with big towels Breakfast good and all staff discretely helpful Proper tea making facilities kettle and tea pot 
26849,The Grosvenor, The facility seems old especially the elevator and shower The shower head is stuck on the wall and I had to bare taking a cold shower times to times warm shower is not stable enough Not so nice especially in winter , The hotel is next to Victoria station and has direct access in the daytime Authentic beautiful lobby with beautiful flower arrangement Staffs are friendly and helpful 
26850,The Grosvenor, The bed head boards had thick dust on the top and the bath over flow had no cover and was black with dirt, So convenient for Victoria station Stayed before
26851,The Grosvenor, I asked for a coffee at the bar at 10 50 and was told the bar was shut really surprised on a Saturday night I was also given a room i think maybe 663 on the wing Really two far and also two lifts I have had 11 back operations and felt this should be asked before givin this room to anybody Also yopu need to take yourself and your case in sideways Brealkfast was OK but nothing special and also felt like you were sitting so close to other people , Good hotel nice location 
26852,The Grosvenor, The bedroom we were offered was very small far to dark with no windows to open for air I had booked this room for my husbands birthday and was disappointed with the quality of the room we were given, The location was very good for the theatre and in distance from various pubs The bars were very friendly and welcoming within the hotel and as long as the rooms could be better i would consider using this hotel again
26853,The Grosvenor, Not much really always stay there when on business trips to London , Location is excellent entrance in Victoria station makes it very convenient if travelling by train with luggage 
26854,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Location is Fantastic Staff were great arrived early into London and left our luggage whilst we had the day out On arrival later luggage in room awaiting Buckingham Palace a short walk away 
26855,The Grosvenor, I couldn t find information about hotel facilities and restaurants etc in the room apart from the room service menu No questionnaire given by reception if there was I would have told them the taps etc were loose in my bathroom and the water whilst hot for the sink was not very hot in the bath or shower either at night or in the morning which was a bit disappointing , The location and the very friendly staff and a very comfortable bed 
26856,The Grosvenor, Heating broken so freezing Phone didn t work when I tried to call to report it Had to walk all the way back to reception where I was made to feel very uncomfortable before being moved to another room ,No Positive
26857,The Grosvenor, 1 Bed was faulty seemed to dip in the middle very uncomfortable 2 VERY noisy room so got very little sleep because of 1 and 2 3 Make up mirror faulty 4 Cleaning disturbing me when I m trying to get ready for work 5 Concierge whose response was oh dear i was not impressed , Locate ideal clean facility
26858,The Grosvenor, Often had to wait to be served at Reception Even at the desk or on the phone , I was upgraded when the air con broke without even to have to mention it to staff Staff couldn t have been more helpful at all times There was a secret entrance into Victoria Station I felt like Danger Mouse 
26859,The Grosvenor, Our room wasn t serviced it was raised that evening as we stayed two nights and at check out but no gesture was made and our room service tray remained with us for the two nights Otherwise a lovely stay, Lovely staff although check in could be smoother
26860,The Grosvenor, We had no bad experiences at all This was a treat weekend so we probably paid above our normal comfort zone but we d definitely return And for all its expense the entire experience felt well worth it , The exterior and interior of the hotel were both beautiful and the staff were very helpful with any issues we queried Breakfast which we paid to have included was also great The rooms themselves were very nice 
26861,The Grosvenor, We were on the attic room and my wife was disappointed as there was only shower and no bath , Convenient location for travel to other places in central London 
26862,The Grosvenor, A try with old food was left out side the room when we checked in and was still there 3 hrs later when we came back, Very relaxing overall good value food and drinks no need to leave the hotel
26863,The Grosvenor, expensive if you stayed more than 1 night , Excellent location staff couldn t have been more helpful despite being located in a busy part of London i heard no noise and slept peacefully The food in the restaurant downstairs was excellent as well 
26864,The Grosvenor, the breakfast was not great and the restrurant was just ok, two blocks from my meetings the remodel when ever it was done is great everything seemed ne or close to new
26865,The Grosvenor, The Bose speaker only works for old iPhone models not the iPhone 6 I didn t have an adapter to fit it in so couldn t use it , Grand property with a lot of character well renovated and well kept Efficient friendly attentive staff
26866,The Grosvenor, It was very noisy in the room The room has had the size of a box and the furniture seems to be from the eighties Very dark and used , The staff was really helpful and friendly 
26867,The Grosvenor, Massive steps up from Victoria station entrance no lift Walk round to main entrance massive steps and no doorman outside to help with heavy luggage As soon as I entered they come and help Was in wing and there is no route there without steps was not warned so took own luggage When leaving I was wise to this and rang for concierge If you are not good with stairs avoid this hotel unless they have special facilities of which I was unaware , Staff helpful room fine convenient for VIctoria and everywhere Once found concierge and all staff helpful and smiley see dislikes 
26868,The Grosvenor, Unfortunately the remote control on our TV didn t work even after changing batteries The only thing to mar an otherwise excellent impression , Old world charm Delightful and helpful staff Excellent buffet breakfast Location just next to Victoria Station 
26869,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff were friendly and attentive Room was very comfortable and clean Requested a quiet room the room was inward facing with no view but very quiet Absolutely perfect and met all our needs 
26870,The Grosvenor, The service in the bars and The Grosvenor Arms was appalling We had to wait a long time for drinks on one night in both the bar and the cocktail bar Another night we waited for a long time for our food despite telling the staff we needed to be quick and when it finally arrived they missed some of the order , The location and comfort of the hotel was excellent The front of house staff were friendly too The rooms were well appointed and quiet 
26871,The Grosvenor, We were rushed to finish out Christmas lunch as they needed the table for another sitting The bed was too hard , Pleasant staff nice decoration good food 
26872,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Good location right next door to Victoria station without experiencing the noise and bustle of the station Very friendly helpful staff and good food 
26873,The Grosvenor, Chaotic breakfast system As a solo traveler I found breakfast a stressful experience Staff communication and efficiency were poor On the first morning my unfinished breakfast was cleared when I momentarily left my table in search of some jam The second morning after being shown to my table I went to queue for breakfast only to return and find my table had been allocated to other customers I expected better from this hotel On checking out I mentioned the chaotic breakfast system but the receptionist didn t seem interested I would not return , Excellent location Comfortable quiet room on the 6th floor 
26874,The Grosvenor, Room service Ordered soup of the day described as soup of the day with crusty bread roll and butter took over an hour to arrive and had 3 slices of white bread no butter and no spoon Poor , Location was amazing Hotel was Fantastic friendly staff lovely and clean room and great nights sleep 
26875,The Grosvenor, There is no sense of privacy or exclusivity in this hotel Its bar and two restaurants in the lobby are open to the public and from morning till midnight the place is besieged by people of all sorts Including those you d rather not see We were also surprised by the level of guests staying at the Grosvenor Some of them wore hoodies and a lot of them looked like from the EastEnders Even though we stayed at the Junior suit it was tiny its air conditioning very unresponsive and some table lamps missed bulbs very long response to replace And what is it about spot lights They were glooming from the ceiling giving insufficient light in the evening They also made everyone look dreadful Spotlights are for lighting up objects not people Terrible atmosphere bad lighting impersonal furnishing And all this for more than 200 GBP a night Oh and location is nothing to write home about It only looks close to all the attractions on the map In reality it is a long long walk from anywhere attractive Do not recommend , Members of staff at the reception were polite and professional 
26876,The Grosvenor, We had booked a room with access to executive lounge After we had checked in we discovered it was closed for renovation When we complained we were given breakfast and drink vouchers Breakfast was buffet only and featured some great items good bacon sausages and croissants but the worst tea badly cooked eggs and cheap orange juice , Beautiful room with very high ceiling American kingsize bed was very comfortable Staff in bar very friendly 
26877,The Grosvenor, We had no information in the room regarding the hotels facilities restaurant details etc only room service information , Beautiful hotel in an excellent location we ate in the brasserie and the food was delicious and good value for London 
26878,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff are examplary and David on the switchboard customer service help us in away I ve never experienced from a hotelier before As the hotel wasn t fully booked he organised my kids to check in early as they arrived from Australia at 6 30am Wonderful service 
26879,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Understandable confusion at the desk as we d ordered and cancelled previously due to illness Was dealt with superbly and we endend up in a fancier room 
26880,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Me and my partner got upgraded to a suite from a deluxe double The room was absolutely fabulous and we couldn t believe there was no extra cost The staff were extremely friendly and the overall cleanliness of the hotel was exceptional I would definitely recommend and I would love to return sometime soon 
26881,The Grosvenor, The only bad experience we had was the room service we order 2 drinks to our room through room service whilst we got ready we were told it would be there in 25mins My wife said that was ridiculous and cancelled it and received back chat from the gentleman saying we re very busy you know 2mins later we got a call and were told the drinks were on their way Later that evening ordered a couple of drinks and a burger which arrived after about 20mins which we were happy about however we wanted breakfast in bed and filled in the card of what we wanted and when we wanted it this wasn t complimentary we asked for our breakfast to arrive between 9am 9 30am by 9 35am still hasn t arrived so my wife called room service and we were told it was on its way By 9 50am still hasn t arrived so called reception to ask what was going on the lady apologiesed and said she had just been told it was on its way By 10am I called room service to say I wanted to cancel my breakfast as we had plans and were going out the gentleman asked my room number I told him and he started shouting down the phone saying I have sent it it should be there we re not ones to complain but for 200 a night I won t be spoken to like that Didn t get breakfast but spoke to the manager and she cleared the other room service bills so rectified the issue, Everything was great upgraded to a suite upon arrival very comfortable quiet 
26882,The Grosvenor, We were at the front of the building so could hear the announcements from the train station keeping us awake only secondary double glazing and woke us in the morning For the price we feel breakfast should have been included if only a continental one Special offers for this hotel after we had booked included a free breakfast which doesn t seem fair when you have booked in advance, Beautiful foyer Lovely staff especially the Liverpudlian concierge who helped us with open top bus tickets and luggage storage Enjoyed afternoon tea in the lounge Handy for the Victoria Palace theatre where we saw Billy Elliot 
26883,The Grosvenor, The beds were really uncomfortable and there was very little hotel information in room TV was hard to turn on and I guessed the number for reception to call and ask for advise Turned out that to turn it on you press any button on the remote just not the on off button So just some basic information in room that explains that kind of thing promotes the in house restaurants and other local services would have been helpful Little things but would make a stay pleasanter , A beautiful hotel in a great location easy access to tube and other transport and attractions Staff were lovely and helpful 
26884,The Grosvenor, It was to the most the same hotel staff as is has been before and they were outstanding in their approach last time But this time I felt like I was very unwelcome and in their way Made me feel great uncomfortable I wrote to the reservations manager to have a change but instead of increasing their service and attitude to the better it was the totally opposite, I often choose this Grosvenor at Victoria station if Grosvenor House at Park lane is fully booked I like the convenient I find in the hotel Victoria location
26885,The Grosvenor, Not applicable, This was my first stay at this hotel and will not hopefully be my last The location next to Victoria Station is ideal and the hotel itself is very stylish The marble staircase colums and decor of the past year is truely wonderful to see so well preserved 
26886,The Grosvenor, The bed was old and extremely uncomfortable made for a very unpleasant 4 nights without much sleep Staff should have picked this up with my having to tell them , Great location and the friendly welcome and service from Vic the bar mixologist in the restaurant he made our trip 
26887,The Grosvenor, There was a small chip in the bath enamel Other than than no complaints and nothing to dislike , Loved it Location great and the hotel had a lovely fresh fragrance Breakfast fab and great value Will be booking again next year if prices don t change 
26888,The Grosvenor, The room we had looked a lot smaller compared to the website the location of our room was right above Victoria station so all you could hear was the next station will be or something of the sort Also the bar staff one man followed us out we had 2 cocktails couldn t pay by card due to system failure in the area so we said we could pay on a tab they said that was fine we assumed this was already sorted with our room as we told them our room number and didn t need to do anything else therfore went to leave and got chased out saying we have not paid Very embarrassing , The hotel staff were friendly the hotel itself was clean and stunning One man on the desk was very helpful with places to go and the hotel was a great help in letting us leave our luggage so we could go off for the day after check out 
26889,The Grosvenor, No champagne in the Club Lounge Range of food in the evenings was limited Some staff had poor knowledge of how to mix and serve drinks Nowhere near as good as executive lounges in Melia hotels Lack of timely assistance offered at front steps upon arrival and early morning departure Little attention to security of our luggage when left at concierge desk Rigid adherence to check in time , Very well located especially with such easy access to Victoria Station Our executive double was quite spacious and had a pleasant view We would possibly stay here again 
26890,The Grosvenor, The bars was to busy and nowhere to sit and our breakfast arrived cold at our room and a little later than we had requested , The whole experiance was wonderful It made my husbands 50th birthday very special 
26891,The Grosvenor, No american plugs windows were either too small or there was no view , Good location Average room Felt like a no frills vacation Conceirge using a booking site for reservations and I had to call myself to actually get a reservation on two occations 
26892,The Grosvenor, Am convinced we were put in a standard double room the first night which wasn t what I had paid for However we were moved the following day to a far better room with no noise from the station announcements keeping us awake , Great location for getting around London particularly for evening shows 
26893,The Grosvenor, The bathroom in the room didnt have any extractor fan so felt damp all the time also seems very strange not to have a shower head that is flexible i always use a shower head with a hose for washing my hair over the side of the bath Not the end of the world but just seems like a strange thing not to have , Location is great staff are great
26894,The Grosvenor, Room very small for price Food ended at 10pm and limited room service after that Buffet breakfast not very good for price eat locally elsewhere , Beautiful hotel excellent location right next to Victoria station Quiet and clean and very friendly staff Restaurant served large portions Buckingham Palace short walk away and easy access to theater district by the tube 
26895,The Grosvenor, It would have been nice if the price had included breakfast as it wasn t cheap This is expected in central London though , Rooms are spacious with comfy beds and nice thick walls so you can t hear anything from other rooms or the corridor Brilliant location for sightseeing and easy underground access Everything was really clean 
26896,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff were amazing made our weekend one to remember Our bed was so big and comfortable great night sleep hotel had stunning entrance couldn t fault our stay 
26897,The Grosvenor, Terrible cooked breakfast cold and nasty Stick with the continental breakfast Music far to loud in the bar Shocking booking in service , Location was good bed was comfortable but not the pillows Room was a good size and very clean 
26898,The Grosvenor,No Negative, the staff were very polite friendly and efficient The hotel was beautifully decorated and clean and quiet too you wouldnt have known you were in central London next to a busy station a thououghly enjoyable stay thank you
26899,The Grosvenor, I would say however for one night it s expensive even on a deal So if you plan on staying here make sure it s a special occasion or something The way the hotel is as it stands is marvellous but I would say from my experience I just didn t feel I was getting my money s worth Check in 3pm and Check out 12pm next day Just isn t reasonable maybe a full 12 hours should be given to the one night s stay customers I feel that the hotel is missing something that will make people feel happy about spending that kind of money like a free spa or something swimming pool sauna steam etc As it stands the only freebies would be a gym which isn t fun or relaxing in my eyes and a complimentary bottle of wine or cake The cake was delicious by the way it just felt like I d paid 50 for it or something Please don t get me wrong I loved my time in this hotel and I was amazed at how beautiful the interior was and I was extremely comfortable But I m just not used to spending so much on one night and it being just for the room itself On another note the only thing I didn t like was that there was splash stains on the wall in the bathroom was a bit icky and ruined the view of the bathroom , Everything was lovely we enjoyed the decor the comfort and the ambience The staff were very friendly and we loved where the hotel was situated The bed was unbelievably comfortable most probably one of the best beds I have ever slept in too 
26900,The Grosvenor, Bar staff were very unprofessional Refused service at 11 30 when bar open until 12 Another member of bar staff said we had to pay by card as we were not registered as guests He was wrong not discreet other guests heard him say no you are not registered in the room you say you are registered in you will have to pay by credit card, Convenient for all transport access through Victoria Station
26901,The Grosvenor, My room was facing the outside of the station and was incredibly loud I needed to change rooms after midnight If you are staying over the weekend be sure to ask for one of the inward facing rooms , Beautiful lobby Super convenient location 
26902,The Grosvenor, Nothing else, We enjoyed everything Staff especially were very helpful breakfast was also nice and good value All public rooms were very ornate and comfortable 
26903,The Grosvenor, Most of the staff seemed inexperienced unable to provide useful information in regards to local transport and sightseeing more suited for business people In house restaurants fell short of expectations both with food quality and service ie despite several requests for morning cup of tea left breakfast without one , Great location
26904,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Exceeded expectations Fantastic room staff responsive and friendly from outset including answering our pre arrival emails and letting us leave our luggage early on check in day 
26905,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Location Easy to find since you could get to it from Victoria Station and you can get from the check in desk of the hotel to the station in about one minute 
26906,The Grosvenor, What I did not like is the long walk to our room And being by the train station alot of foot traffic and everyone had baggage , The hotel was lovely and the staff was very pleasent and helpfull Location was great 
26907,The Grosvenor, The bar staff did rush us out when they wanted to clear up at 11pm I thought that was early and quite rude , Excellent location and very friendly staff The historic building gave a great atmosphere and it felt like I stepped back a hundred years 
26908,The Grosvenor, The breakfast was terrible the fruit was old the tables were not cleared the coffee machines did not work staff were so busy a few of the were shaking under the pressure worst experience, The staff and the beautiful reception
26909,The Grosvenor, We left the room at night to go to a show and left the service room light on On our return it still hadn t been done To be fair I didn t point it out to the staff on reception But I assumed the light on would indicate it Also the parking in Victoria was great spot but directions weren t great not the hotels fault Could be indicated by the hotel better , Lovely room Everything required was there Great shower Great black out curtains Parking at Victoria great spot
26910,The Grosvenor, Massive queue for breakfast we waited about 15 minutes then gave up asked for a refund and went to a local cafe This was despite most of the tables being set up and empty in the restaurant , The position for transport links and theatre for Wicked
26911,The Grosvenor, We had a small room for the price Our room was in one of the wings not in the main part of the hotel It was a long walk to get there since there are not elevators directly to that part of the Hotel I don t think those rooms had been updated for awhile we had some mold in the bathroom A bus stop is in front of the hotel so coming going we always had to fight a crowd waiting for the bus , The location was great close to Buckingham Palace 
26912,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Staff were very friendly and helpful went out of their way to make us feel welcome location was excellent for access to trains and sights in the city and good for tube links
26913,The Grosvenor, 264 for single room only for one night was expensive , Love the location and the access from Victoria station into the hotel Arrived early and was still able to check in 
26914,The Grosvenor, Stayed in a deluxe room As requested it was in a quiet area Sadly the room was in need of maintenance one of the sockets didn t work the bath cold tap didn t work and was coming away from the wall The lighting needs upgrading nowhere bright enough to read or put on makeup No mirrors near the sockets so difficult to do hair , Good location beautiful communal areas and very helpful staff 
26915,The Grosvenor, Only staying one night , We only stayed for one night before getting on the Orient Express but we thoroughly enjoyed it and will return Free room upgrade on arrival and a complimentary bottle of wine for our special occasion All the staff were very helpful and polite The hotel was very clean and had a nice atmosphere 
26916,The Grosvenor, Nothing , Fantastic location direct access to Victoria Station which is great when arriving departing from Gatwick Excellent staff professional yet very friendly and helpful 
26917,The Grosvenor, Broadband was awful Complained to front desk who said no one else has complained so it must be fine Went down twice They said a maintenance person would be up in 20 min but never turned up Ended up standing in the middle of the hall to get a better signal but speed didn t improve Could hear the train station announcements all night Rail Station in the room View was of the train station roof room 353 , They let us check in a bit early which was very helpful as I had a little one with me Nice hotel reception and decoration Good location for the tube and the theatre we went to Billy Elliott Large room and bed 
26918,The Grosvenor, the Wi Fi had a few blank spots in the room which meant I needed to use the Wi Fi in the passage rather than the room I stayed in room 755, the location was excellent
26919,The Grosvenor, Liked it all wished we could have stayed longer, It was our Wedding Anniversary and we were upgraded and given a bottle of wine in our room Beautiful interior decorations fantastic service lovely and clean
26920,The Grosvenor, The rooms were very small we stayed three nights and felt any longer would have been too much There was a fire drill at 6am no one guided us we just followed other guests to the meeting point no one was there to tell us what was going on eventually a member of staff waved us back into the hotel Still no explanation we asked the girl on reception but her English was poor and she struggled to explain , The location was excellent we were able to visit all the places we wanted from the hotel 
26921,The Grosvenor, No drop off for families travelling in a car No pushchair access TV sound not working and shower also intermittent randomly between hot and cold water,No Positive
26922,The Grosvenor, Standard rooms are over the station and very noisy Deluxe rooms are only called that because they are less noisy but are small no mini bar windows not well insulted The breakfast was mostly cold scrambled eggs and beans especially and the coffee from the machine was horrible No marmalade The waiter hardly understood English and most of the reception staff were trainees who didn t know how to handle simple requests resulting in long waiting times , The hotel entrance is impressive and it s well located at Victoria 
26923,The Grosvenor, I didn t have any negative experiences However the breakfast is rather like being in a 3 star all inclusive in Europe The quality of the cooked breakfast for the price paid was disappointing and it was rather smash and grab in there as I think I had breakfast at a busy time The TV idea is awful Who wants to sit opposite the sports news Not me , At the price I paid I expected good service free wi fi and a clean and comfortable room This is exactly what I got My room was spotless and the bed was comfortable The wi fi was speedy I needed to get a good nights sleep and I did 
26924,The Grosvenor, A little expensive for the quality Room on wing which is quite a walk to reception and exit Bathroom was small and in need of upgrade , The location of the hotel is good 
26925,The Grosvenor, The room was extremely small and expensive It was not in the old part of the building We were unable to pull out the drawer of the tv cabinet to access the tea and coffee making facilities because the gap between the end of the bed and the cabinet was so narrow ,No Positive
26926,The Grosvenor, Leaving and going back to my less pampered life , The room and especially the comfy bed The executive lounge for drinks and breakfast and both restaurants 
26927,The Grosvenor, We had an executive room It was lovely as was the VIP Lounge which we used However the bed was terrible It sloped to one side which resulted in me sleeping on the edge of the bed all night No refund for the room was offered 275 for one night stay expecting luxury should have chosen the Premier Inn as they guarantee a good night sleep or your money back ,No Positive
26928,The Grosvenor, The room was far too small for the large suitcases we had and manoeuvring was difficult , The beds are really comfortable think the toppers add that little extra fantastic location
26929,The Grosvenor, The staff both on checking in and out were new meaning that it took double the time it should have They weren t even apologetic about it and the experienced members of staff weren t helping them It was painful , The bed was comfy
26930,The Grosvenor, Buffet breakfast was made from good ingredients but most of it was barely warm The plates were cold so by the time you d got back to your table it was cold No glasses for juice for almost 20 minutes Also the hotel bar only has a license until midnight even for residents and the after hours room service selection was appalling , The hotel itself was very nice and the room was very spacious and clean Location was good for walking from too 
26931,The Grosvenor, Executive lounge closed which we were advised about by phone before arrival and by reception on arrival The alternative bar on the ground floor that we were given access to by executive tickets when we presented them to go in were informed that it was reserved for a private function I found this exceptionally irritating and was offered a seat in the lounge serving afternoon teas which for us was not a bar , very comfortable bed and well proportioned room Room service excellent Cocktail bar excellent Breakfast a real pleasure 
26932,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Hotel is clean with efficient staff and in a good location with easy access to tube and bus travel A very comfortable and enjoyable stay and looking forward to a return visit 
26933,The Grosvenor, Their wasn t really anything bad, I really loved the look of the hotel and how classy it looked I loved the decor the ornaments everything really Our room was very nice very nicely decorated and very modern The food was nice as we had room service and the breakfast was delicious as well 
26934,The Grosvenor, I required a working refrigerator for my medication and the refrigerator in my room did not work Medication kept downstairs is a hindrance and a nuisance eventually I was offered another room I feel the staff need lessons in customer service and care Smiling would be good as would good morning how are you today just simple interactions that life more pleasant ,No Positive
26935,The Grosvenor, The TV was a little old and hard to work The bar staff were a little indifferent to us , The Grosvenor is a beautiful hotel It s close to public transport 
26936,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The Grosvenor is clean comfortable hotel in an excellent location with easy access to bus and rail tube travel The staff are efficient and friendly and aim to ensure your stay is enjoyable 
26937,The Grosvenor, Constant announcements from Victoria Station penetrating the doublle glazing Too far from the West End Non constant hot water made showering difficult Breakfast cold with cold plates No views whatsoever except platform roofs, The staff in attendance pleasant but hard worked and understaffed thus quality of service suffered
26938,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The lovely gentleman at reception Nabil was such a delight and was extremely helpful The room was amazing and exceeded expectations definetly a 5 star hotel 
26939,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Right next to Victoria station which made catching the Gatwick Express a breeze Room had a good size by London standards Furniture in the room was worn and fairly old Overall a good hotel and I wouldn t have a problem staying here again 
26940,The Grosvenor, The trainee reception staff were very inexperienced the check in lady made no mention of the dinning at the hotel the location of the bar or anything the check in was functional only , The grand building no history was offered by any staff the beds are very comfy
26941,The Grosvenor, Slight discolouring on wall bed was quite firm , Location was fantastic Staff were extremely helpful and friendly The room was nicely laid out and looked luxurious 
26942,The Grosvenor, It has become more expensive over the years so with family totalling 6 it is becoming costly, Great for getting wherever you want too excellent concierge service Efficient friendly service
26943,The Grosvenor,No Negative, So close to the theatre for Wicked and pre theatre dinner in the hotel was excellent value Great shopping centre close by we saved by breakfasting in Leon Lovely weekend 
26944,The Grosvenor, The bar staff on Tuesday seemed to charge what ever they want for the drinks we had it was a lot more expensive than the same drinks that we had on the Monday night , Good room and excellent food friendly staff 
26945,The Grosvenor, Unhrlpfulnstaff Breakfast service wws shosking Staff cleaned empty tables leaving plates on occupied tables to fester Cold coffee coffee machine had no water or beans When we tried go pay cashier asked us to wait and went off to ralk to other staff Whrn we were rescued by the manager he waived our charge on hearing our concerns Biggest isue poor staff trainjng and cost cutting so not enough staff ,No Positive
26946,The Grosvenor, Miinor quibbles TV in room poorly placed and poor quality Chair with wheels on carpet not a good idea and not very usable at desk No access with baggage without steps but staff will always help Some confusion with staff over leter addressed to meet me on arrival ,No Positive
26947,The Grosvenor, Creaking floor in corridor minor issue but it did wake me up, Close to tube mainline station tourist attraction UK passport office Hotel clean efficiently run and helpful staff
26948,The Grosvenor, Breakfast was overall very poor would have expected table service in a 4star establishment not buffet that was tepid at best and then to be charged a 12 5percent service charge for self service was quite frankly ridiculous as no service was offered,No Positive
26949,The Grosvenor, The bath water was tepid it seemed impossible to get the temperature up Rm 330 , Very pleasant welcoming atmosphere The Imperial restaurant served delicious oriental food
26950,The Grosvenor, Nothing , Beautiful old hotel full of ambience and old world charm but with all modern conveniences Loved the champagne High Tea in the Victorian tea room and the complimentary birthday cake delivered to my room I felt very special Fabulous location for theatres and Victoria train station 
26951,The Grosvenor, smell of foist in annexe coridors which a member of staff agreed with the rooms extremeley small wanted to leave but was told they would debt my visa account they finally upgraded us to a larger room this spoilt our evening and the start of our once in a lifetime holiday on board the orient express , location
26952,The Grosvenor, Bathroom not fully stocked with shower gel etc Had to phone down for towels Minibar not refilled after first day why , Clean rooms courteous staff location 
26953,The Grosvenor, Although I did not complain at the time as I did not want to spoil what was a very special occasion the room had not been thouroughly cleaned There was a lot of hair in the bathroom Did not display the tv message as requested Complimentory cake was nice gesture but only one slice with one fork , It was right next to victoria station
26954,The Grosvenor, The air conditioning in the room was ridiculously noisy So much so we had to ask to move rooms at 11 30 at night, Location was good and the entrance was amazing
26955,The Grosvenor, I didn t like the view from our windows It was also a little difficult to get in and out of the bath tub , The location was convient We could walk to several resturants from the hotel 
26956,The Grosvenor, Room was quite small Fridge still had a packet of cheese in it from the previous guests , Location was perfect for us being adjacent Victoria Station A very easy walk onto the Orient Express 
26957,The Grosvenor, Reception staff didn t speak very good English Not great first impression for foreign visitors when staff in an English hotel can t understand the language , Executive room very comfortable a good size with lovely big bathroom with the added plus of access to the executive lounge with benefits 
26958,The Grosvenor, Its such a small thing but the room I was in 570 the shower water temperature seemed to vary from warm to hot whilst showering Otherwise that was all , Reception staff were great and the manager of the breakfast buffet was very friendly and most helpful
26959,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Absolutely loved this hotel with its nostalgic feel but it was the location that swung it for me As a person who regularly gets lost this was utterly perfect nothing to have to remember except that it was at Victoria station Door to door tube service Room very comfortable and no smaller than any similar hotel in a major capital city so I had no complaints there I could hear the muffled platform announcements from below but actually I quite liked that and thought it added to the ambiance of a unique stay To sum up perfect 
26960,The Grosvenor, There are trainers at reception and on information desk I think that they are not well trained that requires much more time then necessary , Near to Victoria Station
26961,The Grosvenor, When we came in from the theater no food available apart from room service thought this was very poor and so did several others We also tried to book a meal for 27 guests on Saturday lunch nobody even returned calls , Everywhere clean afternoon tea lovely staff very friendly Booked 2 rooms one had sloping ceiling which was not good for someone 6 6 tall Both rooms were supposed to be upgrades Doubtful 
26962,The Grosvenor, I could hear the announcements at Victoria Station from my room Changed rooms and the air conditioning didn t work properly , The staff was very nice 
26963,The Grosvenor, Bed was a bit hard and showering in a bath tub is always a bit awkward , Location was very central to sights shopping etc and right at Victoria Station for public transport Room was comfortable and clean Especially appreciated the mini fridge to keep snacks and drinks cold 
26964,The Grosvenor, Reception sometimes got a bit crowded when large groups were preparing to move off and breakfast was a bit pricey, Excellent location really handy for Victoria station and food court and the Victoria Apollo 
26965,The Grosvenor, Wish we had known about the after hours menu before we had visited McD s due to missing out on pre show meal , Staff were excellent very helpful and polite Facility to leave our luggage with the conciege before we booked in and after we checked out was fantastic as we had traveled into London by train 
26966,The Grosvenor, Stains on the white bed sheets stained towels stained carpet blocked sink in the room several cracked bathroom tiles and a toilet that didn t flush not exactly what you would expect for such a pricey hotel No effort at all made to accommodate an early check in 1 hour early to attend a wedding despite several emails to the hotel and several other hotels in the area accommodating early check in for their guests, Excellent location beautiful interior in the reception area no problems with leaving luggage for the day prior to check in check out
26967,The Grosvenor, Although this isn t guarenteed I Booked the room a while ago mentioning our 10th anniversary so it was disappointing to have a room with no outlook and just rear buildings A higher room with better view would have been more special , The courteous staff were the most impressive 
26968,The Grosvenor, When you get off your taxi you are expected to get your baggage into the reception yourself climbing up 4 to 5 steps with heavy bags is difficult with the exception of 2 or 3 most of the staff act as if they are doing you a huge favour even if it s a simple thing ,No Positive
26969,The Grosvenor, Not enough staff to assist in the breakfast room , Beautiful large quiet bedroom with high ceilings supporting extra large king size bed Bath tub was nice to soak in after a day hopping on and off a tourist bus and walking the streets 
26970,The Grosvenor, brassiere service was very slow in fact took 40 mins for starter to arrive then main course showed up while still eating starter, Excellent location pleasant staff reasonable sized rooms
26971,The Grosvenor, Dining experience poor Had to repeat order three times and then it was wrong and items missing with no apology at all , Central to where we wanted to be 
26972,The Grosvenor, thick dust along the bed head as this is not a cheap hotel it was unexpected in a cheap B and B maybe but it did not spoil our stay I cleaned it myself , brilliant location really friendly staff
26973,The Grosvenor, Shower head above the bath did not work so had to use the hand held shower to wash my hair Hair on toilet and numerous hairs on sides of shower area Bathroom very small , Location excellent for seeing a show at the Apollo Victoria 
26974,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The staff especially Paul who has been there as long as I have been coming to this property has always been so kind and helpful All of the concierge staff were so very helpful The evening head concierge went out of his way to help me 
26975,The Grosvenor, Nothing, If you are arriving at Victoria Station the location is priceless There is a hotel entry right in the station which also connects to the underground The lobby and restaurants are exquisite 
26976,The Grosvenor, This was one of our favourite hotels in London as you can see from our earlier reviews through the years But sadly all gone down hill The young lady at reception was miserable even when we asked for a smile she grimaced Room 520 filthy when I moved the small minibar which made so much noise we had to unplug Has never been cleaned there since opening Asked for a double bed got 2 singles no slippers or bathrobe or breakfast for 440 Euro a night get real , Location of course is perfect to Victoria 
26977,The Grosvenor, The bathroom was to small and not very clean When you took a shower the water run out in the hallway We had to ask for clean towels and a member of the staff came one evening and asked about the cleaning She took our teacups because we didn t get new ones when the were cleaning the room , Lovely hotel friendly staff in the reception The room was nicely decoreted 
26978,The Grosvenor, Most of the staff were ok but a few obviously under stress not enough in certain locations overall enjoyed though , Location and the bed quality amazing 
26979,The Grosvenor,No Negative, All the staff were extremely welcoming and helpful they were wonderful The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful the room we stayed in was fabulous 
26980,The Grosvenor, The stairs to get in and out of the hotel difficult to haul luggage in and out of the hotel Luckily the staff were fantastic and assisted us without having to be asked The rooms were much smaller than we anticipated but comfortable and clean we just expected more , The staff were all wonderful and the hotel was beautiful Lunch and Breakfast were very good too 
26981,The Grosvenor, Room service was really poor No answer from the hotel for room service so I had to call from my mobile on an outside line before someone would answer Waited 1 hour for two bottles of hot wine and had to call twice from my mobile before it arrived , We loved the location comfort and size of the room 
26982,The Grosvenor, The creaky floorboards in the next room , I liked the efficiency of the check in The very friendly and customer focussed staff The large bedroom considering we only had the basic double room 
26983,The Grosvenor, Afternoon Was also put in incorrect room which wasted our time a bit as we were tight on time anyway, Sandwiches on afternoon tea were hard bread not fresh
26984,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Hello What amazing location that deserves the value of money to this hotel It s a luxury comfort and clean hotel I like the fact that their careful about disabled peopleThe helpful staff speak many languages which help us a lot I love this hotel and will proudly book it next time 
26985,The Grosvenor, The room was no better than a premier inn I was disappointed considering the price reputation of the hotel Premier inn more comfortable spacious, The staff the cleanliness the amazing entrance
26986,The Grosvenor, Ordered breakfast in our room No toast or milk Had to ring room service twice before they arrived 45 mins later , Very close to Victoria station Nice to get an upgraded room
26987,The Grosvenor, My room which we were offered for 20 extra was very noisy There was an intermittent loud hum from in house machinery It was loud enough to prevent sleep However the other room allocated to our party did not have this problem , Location Architecture beautiful old building Cocktail bar
26988,The Grosvenor, Could hear the night club next door but was not to disturbing , Stayed in an Executive room it was huge very comfortable Nice touch leaving a bottle of wine to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary Canap s and drinks in the Executive lounge and breakfast the next morning all included
26989,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Very warm welcome looked after bags next day for us and shortly after booking into our rooms a surprise cake arrived compliments of the hotel for our daughters 21st birthday with piped happy birthday and postcard from the reception staff very thougthfull touch Will use and recommend again thanks 
26990,The Grosvenor, Our room was too far from the front two different elevator rides Our tv didn t stay on There was no hair dryer in the room Not typical for a 4 5 star hotel , Location was great 
26991,The Grosvenor, I booked this hotel because the rooms were advertised on booking com as being larger than most in London Then I saw a review saying the rooms were small On checking in I asked to make sure the room was a larger as advertised and the girl told me the size advertised was wrong It was still small for what it cost , The location was great 
26992,The Grosvenor, did not have all the amenities that were in your description of room No pay per view channels no bathrobe didn t see ipod dock We had a few problems with service and when we spoke to the manager of hotel he acted like we were not telling the truth We waited to for service for high tea for 10 minutes and still no waiter came We left the restaurant and spoke with manager He said that couldn t be true Also while my husband was in the shower we were called by staff and told there was a leak in bathroom I said my husband was just getting out of shower and he said good we ll send someone up I didn t want to take a shower if there was a leak so I went without showering that day because I assumed they wanted it fixed asap When I spoke to the manager about that He said Oh no you could have taken a shower when I told him the conversation I had with the staff person he didn t believe what I said So the staff has a lot to be desired , location great very nice hotel
26993,The Grosvenor, There is nothing not to like about this hotel , Hotel is beautiful and the service is outstanding The location is within walking distance of almost everything Victoria station is next door Room was clean quiet and comfortable Breakfast in the morning and cocktails in the executive lounge after a long day were an added bonus and free when you book an executive room 
26994,The Grosvenor, Rooms ensuites are ridiculously small my partner who is 5 10 couldn t fit his head under the shower head we had to get moved we went for breakfast both mornings 20 mins before closing time and we were made feel like a nuisance by rude serving staff No residents bar on Sunday night Lifts all over the place hard to find to 7th floor Very disappointed for money we spent , The location was excellent Breakfast was delicious 
26995,The Grosvenor, The old front desk staff is gone the new people are untrained and rude rude rude On check in I ask the bed size I was told I don t knows what bed is in room You go look I asked for a Coffee press they own truck loads I was sneered at and told If you want coffee must upgrade room They should pick staff from the waiters and bellmen who are pleasant not the former kgb types from eastern Europe , I have stayed here a lot it is grand hotel in the perfect location to catch the train to Gatwick or the bus to Heathrow Bell staff and waitress were very nice 
26996,The Grosvenor, Everything was just has really helped thank you again, The staff are smiley they were courteous and they could not do enough for you we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves thank you very much
26997,The Grosvenor, Shower a bit temperamental ie hot and cold but otherwise a really enjoyable stay, Stayed here before Great location with a bit of luxury We were upgraded to a deluxe room very nice
26998,The Grosvenor, The fire alarm going off at 7 30am without any prior warning was a hell of a shock to wake up to It went off again later in the morning , The entrance and reception areas look very impressive and grand 
26999,The Grosvenor, The rooms were tiny and outdated The bathroom was inadequate and very small The service was slow when we checked in at midnight despite there being 6 staff around reception only one was serving so it took us 20 minutes to get checked in Way over priced for what it was , The breakfast was good The entrance was nicely decorated 
27000,The Grosvenor, Double room a little small Took 3 4 attempts to make contact with the reception for an emergency last minute reservation Would prefer king beds as standard for delux rooms , Beautiful hotel great staff 
27001,The Grosvenor, I have stayed here a number of times Standards have dropped took 45 minutes to even get my drink in the restaurant and the bar staff just ignore you well until closing time when they sprang to life The hole place just feels as if the penny pinching has gone too far, Location
27002,The Grosvenor, On arrival I was expecting to be taken to our room not left to find it ourselves Breakfast was not good from a food point of view or service we were left standing in a corridor for 15 minutes waiting to be seated then the hot food is buffet style not what I expected for the price they charge , The room was amazing and the staff very pleasant 
27003,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The Hotel and staff made us feel very special It was an absolute pleasure from the moment we walked into the reception until it was time for us to leave Thank you all very much indeed 
27004,The Grosvenor, bought 2 drinks at the bar which came to 24 75 bit expensive but i suppose thats London, we weren t bothered the whole weekend had do not disturb on the door the whole weekend and we werent disturbed staff very friendly and helpful when we needed them
27005,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The staffs were extremely Nice I was previledge to have propose to my fianc e Right in the reception And the staff were so helpful in capturing the moment for me So happy
27006,The Grosvenor, Nothing bad in particular The room could do with more light especially over the desk where I would have expected a reading light , Comfortable room but a little smaller than expected for the quality of hotel Dinner and breakfast were good 
27007,The Grosvenor, The television in our room only had 3 English channels but that s being picky We weren t in the room a lot , The location is fantastic for us and you are central for sights and the theatre 
27008,The Grosvenor, The Grovenor is a lovely hotel but they are not friendly in terms of flexiblity We booked 9 months in advance needed to change the date by four days still 7 months in advance and were not allowed to change the reservation even one day There fore I would not recommend this hotel to friends It is located in a great spot but going there with teenage kids was a big challenging since there was NO pool a very small workout room and as I stated earlier NO FLEXIBILITY IN THE RESERVATION even many months in advance , Location 
27009,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Biggest thanks must go to staff especially Jamal Very friendly and helpful The dining areas were very good I found the location brilliant for my short stay in London
27010,The Grosvenor, There is little storage space in the rooms that stayed in Price of laundry whilst it may be inline with the market is EXTORTIONATE , Very friendly staff nice bar recently refurbished hotel 
27011,The Grosvenor,No Negative, The ovation as we were visiting Buckingham Palace We were able to walk to many locations We were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room due to this being our 36 th wedding anniversary celebration 
27012,The Grosvenor, I know it s only a small thing but I don t like it when there isn t a separate shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom, Hotel is right next to the tube station making it ideal for getting to all of the tourist attractions we wanted to get to without having to change lines 
27013,The Grosvenor, Bed wasn t very comfortable but then didn t like being woke up by station announcements , Location very central right next door to Victoria Station We paid for a deal for the hotel room which was about right but wouldn t pay any more for a standard room very clean
27014,The Grosvenor, It was a bit of a trek to get to the room but really no worries I would happily stay here again , The location was perfect Very convenient for catching the train Easy check in and out The room was lovely and very comfortable 
27015,The Grosvenor, Because of the size of the hotel it took about 5 minutes using 2 lifts to get to the room we had The TV volume was muffled making it difficult to hear it even with the volume turned up For the price paid the room and en suite was very small , Location was excellent and near to many visitor attractions Staff were very helpful Our room and the hotel on general was very clean and tidy 
27016,The Grosvenor, Didn t tell us about fire alarm test Tv guide didn t work properly Didn t put any sugar in the room when they got it ready Asked on our way out for some to be taken to room for our return When we came back they still hadn t put any sugar in the room So another trip to reception to have some bought up to room , It was clean Staff was friendly Location was ideal Elegant decore 
27017,The Grosvenor, This is our third time staying at the Grosvenor in the past two years We moved in the Grosvenor from a hotel located in the financial district after business meetings That hotel provided customers with free breakfast It was disappointed that there was no breakfast included for our three nights staying at the Grosvenor this time however breakfast was included in our previous two times staying at The Grosvenor We told the front desk staff the fact and requested for breakfast to be included but the request was rejected We think The Grosvenor should treat its loyal customers better , Location
27018,The Grosvenor, There s a lot of building work going on for HS2 so pavement widths nearby are restricted and with lots of tourists around it s not good Our room was in the newer wing so rather compact although had everything you wanted , Helpful and friendly staff location is great next to Victoria station and close to restaurants shops etc Food was good
27019,The Grosvenor, It is pricey especially for a South African which was fine for an over nighter but probably would ve looked elsewhere for a longer stay , Great location quality and service Extremely comfortable bed after a day of travelling I slept like the dead 
27020,The Grosvenor, The hotel is over priced We paid 485 00 US per night for the room, This is a very nice hotel with a fantastic location Connects to Victoria station so if you are flying out of Gatwick you can walk through the back door of the hotel into the station and catch the express to the airport The location is also a 10 minute walk to Buckingham Palace 15 minute walk to Westminster Abbey and a 20 minute walk to Big Ben and Parliament It is an older hotel but has been remodeled and upgraded and is very nice Rooms are much larger than you would think and the bed is very comfortable Bathrooms in some rooms are much larger than others Staff was great 
27021,The Grosvenor, Window overlooked the station so it was a little noisy in the day when the aircon was off , Excellent location right next to Victoria Train Station and Tube Easy to get to tourist attractions and the west end We were lucky to get a deal so it was good value 
27022,The Grosvenor, There was no sign of the refreshment in the room so as very thirsty on arrival went downstairs with 6year old and were charged 8 55 for 2pots of tea Then on returning to room and going to unpack found the kettle etc hidden away in cupboard which I found most annoying especially as my granddaughter was quite tired and we had to wait some time for our teas to be served , Travelling with granddaughter 6year old being next to station a great advantage Also being able to leave case before and after stay gave us opportunity to make the most of our time in london 
27023,The Grosvenor, We ordered steak and chips to the room which we were told would take half hour it came 1 hour and half later with no tomatoes as advertised in the menu The in room fridge was buzzing through the night and the biscuits on tea tray were open so unable to be consumed as they were soggy Apart from this the bed was comfortable and location good , Air conditioning
27024,The Grosvenor,No Negative, Outstanding staff wonderfully helpful Amazing location at the center of many things we liked to do Bounteous breakfast buffet Victorian charm Booking com got me a good rate 
27025,The Grosvenor, Food in the Grand Imperial restaurant was truly awful Tasteless and not good value My main course of chicken with sweet basil etc was actually burnt Very disappointing Staff were indifferent apart from Magdella who was friendly and entered into conversation Window got stuck and ended up hearing all of the announcements from Victoria Station from 5am Not helpful when you ve an early start , Friendly staff Mohammed in the brasserie was very helpful and allowed me to prepare book a table each morning for a couple of business meetings I had Consierge was friendly and helpful 
27026,The Grosvenor, stayed here 3 times before This time first room was so cluttered we could not store luggage We were advised the hotel had been recently renovated and room configurations changed We paid an extra 100GBP to upgrade to a larger room only to have a shower that varied from hot to cold with little pressure the light in the bathroom fell out and the toilet roll holder was broken On raising this with reception we received 25GBP refund we now know our worth as a repeat client , Location is great convenient to public transport both bus and train
27027,The Grosvenor,No Negative, We loved the location amenities of resteraunt bar and helpful staff The bed in our deluxe room was so comfortable and food from room service was delicious and delivered promptly The breakfast buffet was also very good We will stay here again 
27028,The Grosvenor, rooms are very very small u can t turn in it The bathroom is very very small you have to close the door to set Elevators was dawn u have to take the stairs to the room I stayed five days never knew my way to the room It s like a miz, Location is good
