245158,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Breakfast poor few selection no water offered for breakfast not even a tap water Supervisor at breakfast was not friendly serving the breakfast was also slow Reception could not do anything on the extra charges for breakfast for 2 persons and it was 1 even I explained I m traveling , Reception staff on the first day were friendly second day not Clean property but overpriced for what is it 
245159,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, The Staff at the reception was very un co operative I made a booking with a child under 8 years old Inspite of that he insisted that for SAFETY RULES of the hotel i had to upgrade my room to simply allow my child to stay No other hotel during my stay made such an absurd comment Also the kitchen was closed and the included breakfast was A la carte and not with options it was more like bread and juice Only choose this hotel for location Not for anything else ,No Positive
245160,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, First the shower or the bath did not work properly we ask for assistance but nothing happened until very next day our last nigh we got another room because the nice man in the reception saw the mistake from the others that did not getting this fixed The bad thing about the new room was that was the mold behind the large lamp in the room and please if you don t want look at porn don t click with mistakes Also fancy hotels should not have rotten furniture, The service at breakfast was great and the food At the dinner the food was very good but the service not so Big and nice rooms according to Paris 
245161,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, there was no clear parking lot in front of the hotel nor was there a door man available all the time There was no porter to take the luggage to the room during check in or out of it during check out,No Positive
245162,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, My booking is a buiseness room but the services are way below this level The extremely bad cleaning and housekeeping I can tell syiries about that The primitive old uncomfortable furniture The old unclean appliances iron ironing table and coffee machine Housekeeping coming to disturb despite the do not disturb sign Old bed linnens and towels This place needs complete refurbishing proper housekeeping and dining services if they want to keep their five stars , Near to Champs Elysees
245163,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Room on the small side and we couldn t regulate the temperature of the room, Location was fabulous and central lots of great sights and restaurants about
245164,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, The room was poor outdated things did not work in it bathroom basin stained nd the whole place not worthy of 5 star rating at all We chnged rooms the second night which was better but still not 5 star 3 4 at best ,No Positive
245165,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, We paid 30euro p breakfast and they served what Only two cross a Ssmall glass of juice and coffee with horrible food hotel must do it in buffet stylus like every hotel in the world, Breakfast was horrible it s look like they just feeding with No interest and it feel like we are eating like beggars
245166,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, I didn t Like lobi small old and dark didn t have any wish to spend time there it could look amazing if u furnished better , Room is ok
245167,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Completely forgot a wakeup call expensive terrible breakfast plaster falling and mold in the bathroom tiny desk with a stool not a chair, Fast free wifi
245168,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, On the same day we bought the same room with 200 euros discount on the booking And this reduction is in us After all we paid And it was very annoying , location
245169,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, No complimentary water in the room a 50cl bottle of water from the mini bar at 6 is excessive when it costs them 30 cents at most , Great location beds are really comfortable rooms are small but that s typical of Paris 
245170,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Pls read above I am displeased that hotels com has mislead me with a star rating of 5 stars for radisson blu located near arc triomphe It worse than a 3 star , Very worn down feel the moment I stepped into the lobby Curtains in the middle of lobby Stayed in room 305 n toilet was very old fashion this time not even a shower curtain at the tub to keep water out of the floor Sink was disgusting with discolouration problem Rubbish bin was like a public toilet with flaps Next to the bed there was a mirror that looked so dirty I had goosebumps sleeping next to it In conclusion it was so bad that I paid for two night I left after a night not getting any refund n checked into beautiful gorgeous Sofitel with splendid service standard from every staff 
245171,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Not clean No services No parking No swimming pool No gym, GREAT LOCATION BUT REALLY LOW set up it s not a 5 stars No parking stayed 36 hours the nearby public parking place charged me 80 euros Lobby and restaurant are so basic no swimming pool or other facilities Never again Room was very basic bathroom not very clean stains and hairs on the floor Should be a business 3 4 stars hotel but not a 5 stars
245172,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, The breakfast was great BUT the cooked part of it was too small for me a larger portion but that is just me I think for what you get the price was a bit high a group of thirteen I could have got similar for less but then may have compromised on the location and attentiveness of the staff , Just a nice relaxed place to stay Very friendly staff not pushy professional but not in your face The room was comfortable cakes and bubbles in the room when we came back in the evening the curtains had been drawn the towels out the even tidied up the mess I had made very attentive This is literally a stone s throw from the Arc De Triumph a wonderful location not the tacky tourist spot 
245173,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Air conditioning is very bad not working properly most of clients complaining for bad cooling system The beds and rooms are very small This hotel should be 3 star or 4 maximum, Staff was friendly
245174,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Everything The hotel should be torn down and Re built, Hotel was disgusting Air conditioning never worked It was like being in hell Wish we could have moved Manager was disgusting Did not care about dilapidated filthy moldy hotel

245176,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, The breakfast is missing French Cheese You are in Paris The rest was great The croissant and petit pain were fresh Just need French cheeses They call it an English Breakfast We are in France The Tv you have to pay 15 Eur to watch anything other than the news , it was all great 
245177,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, The rooms could have been better appointed and in need of updating , The Location of the Hotel was just right The Staff were very helpful and well informed and provided us with great recommendation as to where to dine out 
245178,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Staff upon arrival was not helpful at all as the room I booked was from 3 adults but they provided me with double room in addition to child bed I had to argue hard with the staff as he confirmed that this is the standard room and no body complained about the size of the bed before By calling his manager the manger instructed him to give additional single room until next day The manager when he came and checked the bed he confirmed that this was not the proper bed and he instructed his team to replace it with bigger one This issue took long time until resolved specially I had short time visit to Paris and it spoiled my schedule Seams expensive compared with other hotels Internet was slow , Breakfast was good Location was good Staff manger was helpful and assisting 
245179,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, reception staff should try to assist more We asked about them booking the Louvre for us and they said we would have to book online , Good location certainly for the Champs Elysees

245192,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, We booked the hotel as room was advertised for 3 people and as having 3 single beds suitable for a holiday for myself and 2 friends The room actually only had 2 single beds and a small camp bed more suitable for a child The room was made up for 2 adults with 2 mugs towels toiletries etc The hotel staff cleanliness and breakfast was all very good but I feel it was wrongly advertised on booking com, The location was excellent for sightseeing 
245193,Radisson Blu Champs Elys es Paris, Hotels nowadays should have mobile chargers and universal adapters that ll make life easier because the first thing we do once we reach is charge our smartphones tables laptops and there s is no enough for all this , The location is amazing The chance to be 2 minutes from the champs lys es and not having the busy crowded street
