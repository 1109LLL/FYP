111290,The Portobello Hotel, Room 45 Don t let a tall person sleep on the right side of the bed or they will bang their head on the ceiling moving round the end of the bed , Good facilities Welcoming staff 
111291,The Portobello Hotel, Location was just ok thankfully the weather was good for the walk up to the tube I think the hotel was rather expensive for what you get it says it includes breakfast but that is only the basic cereal toast etc for f you want eggs or bacon you have to pay extra , The hotel was lovely and quaint and the staff were helpful I do prefer to not be in a big chain hotel The bed was really comfy but the toilet was so small that you couldn t close the door when you were inside 
111292,The Portobello Hotel, Only the smallest of faults I asked for a fruit tea at breakfast and they didn t have any However I had a delicious hot chocolate and refreshing iced lemon water , It was in a beautiful quiet street the staff were so friendly and each room is different So refreshing not to stay in a chain hotel The bedding was luxurious and the chocolates on the pillow were delicious We will come back again and highly recommend it to friends staying in London
111293,The Portobello Hotel, We didn t like having to leave Also oddly there was no turn down service so we had to wrestle with a wall full of heavy English curtains every night before tucking into bed , We LOVED our stay at the Portobello not only was the location and street picture perfect the staff were wonderful and our ROOM we were delighted to have been upgraded to what was described to us as Famous Room 16 with its gorgeous yellow wallpaper majestic freestanding tub and ROUND BED We felt like we had fallen into a fantasy and relished every second of it 
111294,The Portobello Hotel, Included breakfast very limited , Excellent location nice room great bed so high it felt like a cloud Staff friendly but not particularly helpful 
111295,The Portobello Hotel, everything was first class, it was not myself who stayed it was my cousin and his wife i booked it for his 50th birthday they absolutely loved everything about the hotel from the staff who were superb through everything and the location and the breakfast and the whole experience was first class
111296,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, The room was lovely The staff are fantastic The location is excellent Really enjoyed our stay and would happily recommend We will go back for sure 
111297,The Portobello Hotel, The only flaw was that they only had a continental breakfast and the additional breakfast choices was rather expensive , This was by far the best hoteI have stayed in in the UK A bit pricey but well worth the money Cosy and comfortable rooms with AC and great beds and pillows The staff was all very friendly and helpful I would recommend this hotel and may absolutely come again 
111298,The Portobello Hotel, Service at breakfast had to ask for a pot of tea both days felt they could be quicker off the mark with this and the lovely teacups are too small , Bed was beautifully comfortable Location great for hanging out in Notting Hill but not so handy for West End and the usual places for tourists Staff really friendly 
111299,The Portobello Hotel, There was a spot of dust in the shower It was minimal so I am being very picky here , We received an upgrade upon arrival always a good start The property is a gem the rooms take you to a more glorious past my partner shed some tears when we walked into our room it was exceptional The breakfast included in our stay although simple was tasteful and enjoyable served on an elegant tray The bathroom not to mention the bathtub were both unique As stylish as they were enjoyable The mini bar and the honesty bar were original and both had plenty of choice 
111300,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, The Portobello is warm and welcoming I had a beautiful spacious room with a great view Intimate authentic original old school My room was stunning and reminded me of Old Europe Bed was super comfortable with crisp linens and a clean modern bathroom though the size of a closet The downstairs lounge is open to hotel residents and swirling with interesting visitors from all parts of the world The included breakfast was a wonderful plus and very welcome to this weary traveler 
111301,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, The welcome was awesome the room was really beautiful The chocolate on our pillow when we arrived back from our evening out all really lovely touches lovely magical place
111302,The Portobello Hotel, the bathroom was a little small, extremely cute boutique hotel with antique furnishings the staff were extremely friendly and attentive the bathtub in our room was large enough to lay in we had the option of having breakfast served in our room every morning at no charge 
111303,The Portobello Hotel, The single room was a bit small I had to step over my bag a lot but the coziness of the room and bed made up for it , The most magical place to spend a couple of days in London I didn t want to leave 
111304,The Portobello Hotel, The room was hardly bigger than the bed the bathroom a tiny cubicle very drafty single glazed windows the heating smelly and the curtains worn and torn The breakfast is too basic and the service , The staff at the recption was very helpful and forthcoming 
111305,The Portobello Hotel, Expel air not working in bathroom No other problems , Very comfy bed super location good continental breakfast in comfy lounge Quiet at night Like being in a luxury house Good shower Friendly staff 
111306,The Portobello Hotel, The size of the onsuit toilet is impossibly tiny verging on dangerous We had to request a move to avoid injury but I believe all onsuits are the same size Difficulty sleeping due to to the noise outside of what sounds like a leaking gutter Sorry to say it will take a lot to bring me back , Bed very comfortable Very pleasant staff great location 
111307,The Portobello Hotel, The bathroom was tiny in the room I had although there was a nice bathtub outside of the bathroom Overall it was a nice room , The bed was extra comfortable and I enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast 
111308,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, Great place great people My husband and I were celebrating our 10 years anniversary and the staff surprised us with a glass of champagne in our room Really thoughtful 
111309,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, We were tempted to ask to take the bed home with us as it was so comfy Staff were lovely particularly Keith who was really quick to reply to emails beforehand and was happy to stand and chat to us 
111310,The Portobello Hotel, We should have appreciated luggage racks in our room There was enough room for two of them , The staff were very helpful and solicitous Aleksandra was extremely helpful both with the original booking over email from the USA and in person throughout our stay It was very nice to be able to open the windows onto the garden at the back for fresh air We have stayed here a number of times over the last 15 years or so The last time we did the hotel was a little run down Since then minor changes to the hotel have greatly improved its appearance The morale attentiveness and knowledge of the staff have improved too Its location in Notting Hill is ideal Walking distance from any number of shops restaurants public transport and of course the Portobello Road 
111311,The Portobello Hotel, The single room was the smallest hotel room I ve ever seen almost like a closet Made me feel really claustrophobic , Nice hotel but very cramped feeling overall 
111312,The Portobello Hotel, The bathroom was so tiny it was hard to move around at all , Fabulous hotel decor etc V comfy beds helpful staff lovely breakfast and loved the honesty bar
111313,The Portobello Hotel, They ve got the slowest lift in London , Lovely room comfortable bed and best toiletries ever Staff were friendly and helpful room service was great 
111314,The Portobello Hotel, one of the main attraction is the typical English living room which was fully occupied by one guest and her clothes laying all over the place it would have been nice if the staff could ensure all guests can use this room, location location location there is no better location within walking distance to all Notting Hill high lights and for this the price is more than reasonable
111315,The Portobello Hotel, Single room adequate but could have done with a little more space , Location and staff were both excellent staff could not do enough for me 1st class I don t each breakfast normally but did have toast and tea There was plenty of food there for those who wanted it Continental 
111316,The Portobello Hotel, Run down not the right staff and who wants to here the staff talking about cleaning products to rep Small rooms it all needs renovating and turning back into the legendary hotel it once was Will not be staying again , Was probably amazing in the 70s the location was great 
111317,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, Extremely quiet comfortable hotel Room was fabulous and beds so comfy Staff so helpful and loved the coffee machine in our room Highly recommend this hotel for couples 
111318,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, The bed was very comfortable and we loved the bathroom with it s perfect towels and bathroom products The staff were very discreet which we appreciated it s a beautiful house 
111319,The Portobello Hotel, Was a bit surprised to receive an email after our stay saying we owed 50 GBP as we d taken the half used bottles of toiletries Apparently there is a sign to say there s an additional charge if the products are taken but we honestly had not seen it anywhere during our 3 night stay Furthermore we have never been charged extra for toiletries which we assume are complimentary during a hotel stay Anyway the hotel was understanding and thankfully believed it was an innocent mistake Perhaps guests should be notified when checking in about the hotels toiletry policy though Apart from this can t fault the stay at all , We loved everything about the hotel the style and decor of the hotel and rooms the lounge area with free continental breakfast and honesty bar the location within easy walking distance of Portobello the comfy beds and awesome shower We would definitely stay again and recommend to others 
111320,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, This is an old hotel that has never been allowed to get tired it is just the epitome of a fine old school hostelry with all the most modern facilities a treasure Their beds are sumptuous the linen Devine the air con silent the shower powerful and the toiletries luxurious everything from reception to departure perfect a wonderful wonderful hotel and if you are staying in London look no further 
111321,The Portobello Hotel, Amenities not great first our bed in a Better room was listed as king size it wasn t even a queen it was a double also wi fi very iffy on and off finally tiny elevator was out of order for our last three days and we had a huff it up and down narrow staircases to the top story , Lovely location stylish decor friendly staff nice simple breakfast
111322,The Portobello Hotel, Small room especially ensuite no kittens could be swung and being charged exhorbitantly for shower gel after the visit when we took bottles we had started It was not clear these would be billed or were not supplied gratis as usual in hotels of a certain standard Over 100 Really , Comfortable bed relaxed staff and atmosphere
111323,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, Booked for a special weekend with my Kiwi boyfriend and was not disappointed Beautiful hotel in a nice area of London Room fantastic we booked a better room and especially loved the roll top bath Staff excellent nothing was too much trouble Would definitely recommend if you want a treat 
111324,The Portobello Hotel, had a room on the 4th floor which was basically in the attic very few places where one could actually stand upright had to kneel to make coffee, super friendly staff good breakfast quaint and charming open space
111325,The Portobello Hotel, The only negative was that upon booking I had specifically requested Room 16 for various reasons and whilst first having been told this room was available unfortunately due to unforeseen maintenance work this room wasn t available upon our arrival This in no way reflects badly against the hotel though it s just one of those things that unfortunately can happen and is just another reason not that it s needed to make sure we go back when Room 16 is available , Everything Beautiful location lovely hotel with amazing rooms We had room 13 which has a bed so big you need a small ladder to climb in Whilst you don t have access to the private gardens which the rooms to the rear overlook they certainly do provide a great view especially if having breakfast in the room The best part though has to be the staff every person we met who worked at the hotel were very friendly polite helpful and genuinely nice people and they were all certainly a big factor in helping to make this trip such a wonderful experience We literally can t wait to go back When planning my trip to London I had various hotels which were on my shortlist like Claridge s the Savoy etc but have to say that I m so happy to have found this wonderful little hotel as I honestly don t believe we would have had such a great trip without it 
111326,The Portobello Hotel,No Negative, Great location in a relaxed part of Notting Hill Away from the usual London hustle and bustle but with all shops bars restaurants amenities walking distance away Perfect 
111327,The Portobello Hotel, Mini bar was very expensive hardly a shock and the bathroom was tiny , The hotel was lovely the staff were great and very helpful We loved the atmosphere and there decor the bed was turned down and chocs were left on the pillow but also a weather forecast for the following day And A nespresso machine Whoop woo I was very excited 
111328,The Portobello Hotel, Nothing dislike If I have to say something then the bathroom could be bigger and it would be better to have a restaurant in the hotel , a very nice stay good decoration Staff are friendly I had an early check out and the staff was ready to help at 6am thank you guys I especially loved the bed it was super comfortable
