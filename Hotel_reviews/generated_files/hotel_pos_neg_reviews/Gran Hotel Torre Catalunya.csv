279808,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Wifi sometimes dropped off as our room is at the corner of the hotel block but we enjoy the view from the window , Enjoyed the stay as it is close to the train and metro station 
279809,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, The location of the property was excellent Around the corner from the hop on hop off bus Opposite a main train station and a short walk to the airport bus The breakfast was really good Lots of different options to suit everyone The view from the restaurant was amazing You can see the whole city while eating breakfast We also had dinner in the reataurant It was lovely seeing the city at night while we ate Dinner was also excellent The room we stayed in was very clean modern and spacious and the staff were excellent 
279810,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Dusty and unclean rooms Filthy windows resulting in the magnificent view that the hotel prides being affected in that you can barely see past the dirty windows Rude staff on reception who was unhelpful with the mentioning of the dirt , The spa 
279811,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Locked out of my room at 10AM on the day I was leaving Why I don t know and the guy at the front desk had no explanation or apology , Literally 100 meters from the train station can t be any easier The top floor views of the city are awesome 
279812,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Nice staff Good location the hotel is near the Barcelona Sants Train Station and although is pretty far from the Placa Catalunya and La Rambla it very easy to get there by metro Nice view if you are located on one of the top floors Good internet 
279813,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Little far from Barcelona s main tourist attractions and nightlife around hotel was lacking , Location near the Barcelona Sants station was very convenient 
279814,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Shorter length of time queuing at front desk on check in out, Bed linen towels really great quality divine Room spotless clean Excellent breakfast buffet
279815,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The windows didnt seal prperly and the night we stayed was winter solstice People were setting off fireworks until 5am in the morning making it very difficult to sleep This is the last thing we wanted after 32 hours traveling from Australia , It was close to the train station 
279816,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, The view from my room was phenomenal I stayed in their superior room and I got to see the whole Barcelona This hotel is also in walk proximity with two metro lines and a major train station Basically anywhere in the city you want to go there is a way of public transportation you can use that is near the hotel to get there The reception people are extremely friendly and speak good English 
279817,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, We thought the fact that there was no discount for us to eat at the hotel restaurant was a annoying as it looked amazing up there We also thought 10 each to use the sauna and pool was a bit expensive especially after paying a good chunk of money to stay there , The view was amazing and the room was very clean and nice and cool during the heat wave The location was great for us we walked to camp Nou and rented bikes to get to the beach and we cycled up to the Olympic stadium We didn t go on one of those bike tours as we felt they were over expensive for what we did for 10 each on a bike and found our own way 
279818,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, The quarter where the hotel is opposite to a main station is not that sexy but the view over the city is magnificant The restaurant and breaktfast room on the top floor overlooks all of Barcelona beautiful 
279819,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Hotel was directly across the street from the Metro station which we used to get all over Barcelona very easily It was also right next door to a major train station so getting to other places in Spain is very easy from this location 
279820,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The breakfast was not included in the price , The bed was comfortable and the bath well equipped Location near the station is great and still not noisy 
279821,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, I appreciated that the bell hop came out of the hotel to help me get my suitcase us the stairs He then took my suitcase to my room very quickly and set up my password for the wifi 
279822,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I would not recommend this hotel to those who have tight sleep since I could easily hear trains most probably from deep beneath coming and leaving each few minutes in my room 715 First I tried room 1401 bit it was noisy there from street traffic as well Anyway most people would not mind that constant noise but for me it took days to get used to it Therefore avoid this hotel if you prefer silence during night especially because doors slamming is also quite noisy , nice view from the restaurant
279823,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The 2 twin beds to make a double was a bit uncomfortable for my husband and I to share, The room is very spacious and lots of natural light Great access to transportation and even though it is a busy area the room is very quiet 
279824,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Great size room and bathroom The outside of the building does not do justice to the interior and the rooms Great hotel and good location We strolled all the way to Passeig de Gracia in 35 mins and could have stopped to some fantastic looking restaurants and bars on the way Highly recommended Good value for money 
279825,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The first night we were on the 3rd floor It was too noisy from the train station across the street but the desk clerk Sonia moved us to the 18th floor the next morning Wonderful , The food and and service was great The hotel staff were accommodating and friendly 
279826,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I hope there were more breakfast options , If you re going to travel by train this is the best location since it s just walking distance from Barcelona Sants 
279827,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, We booked a Junior suite through Booking com which doesn t exist they had an attico room prepared for us which was just slightly bigger than a standard room so we had to pay an extra 40 a night for the suite Disappointing start but completely the fault of Booking com, Hotel was lovely staff super helpful We were there for the Grand Prix and travel to the race track was made much easier due to location of hotel Once we paid to upgrade to the suite it was very nice a couple of little niggles like door not staying closed to the bathroom and tech could do with an upgrade but nothing that would make us even slightly bothered
279828,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, As a guest we were still required to pay to use the swimming pool this should be free for paying guests Visual restaurant had a limited food menu , Staff were friendly Visual restaurant had great views of the city 
279829,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The spa entery could have been included in price since you already are paying a lot, The main subway line to las ramblas the beach front nou camp etc is right at the hotel also the train station to get to and from airport is right next door Loved having the spa to go at the end of a long day walking 
279830,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The hotel is located a good 20 minute metro ride from most of the main Barcelona attractions but the metro is right outside the hotel and it s very easy to get around , The staff were very helpful and friendly they spoke good English The spa was amazing and the 23rd floor restaurant was spectacular food incredible and views perfect 
279831,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Spa and massage opening times were limited to 12 00 20 00 Not handy when you re out discovering the city Neighborhood not too interesting , Breakfast was great Mostly helpfull staff Great view from the 23rd floor Station on your doorstep Closeby supermarket 
279832,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, There were 3 people sharing a room but all the facilities offered ere for 2 Constantly had to ring reception to provide extra towel soap cup kettle and more, Location
279833,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing, Bed is amazing so comfortable And nice staff they took our luggages and carried them up to our room when we came back Location is so great cuz 3 minutes walk to train station We used convenience stores in sant train station and had breakfast in there I want to visit again this hotel 
279834,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Iron was ready but temperature was limited for ironing, Excellent location just opposite to the Sants Station easily access to the Lambla via L3 line Spacious and clean room comfort bed
279835,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Everything was fine I would not have booked again if things weren t up to standard for a Four Star hotel , Location only minutes from the station Very convenient if you are catching a train early in the morning Rooms are very comfortable and there is an excellent place to have breakfast in the morning with lovely views of Barcelona Expensive but great choice available It is cheaper if you have three breakfasts Nice comfortable lounge bar for a night cap Staff at all levels were helpful and polite 
279836,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The view around hotel looks ruff Although I had massive room with king size bed I have not slept for 2 nights I stayed there Mattress poor quality as I left with the marks on my body every morning All night the wall next to my bed was shaking together with the painting on it so with sound like that I couldn t sleep For money I payed they should have minimum spa included or water in the room Breakfast 20 euro is very expensive spa gym entry 10 eur , Very good location if you travel around Barcelona and from to airport Good tube link as its only 7 stops from centre of Barcelona 
279837,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nowhere near enough powerpoints in the room Had to unplug bedside lamp to charge phone Lighting in bathroom not really enough for shaving Breakfast expensive so I didn t take it Room a little shabby for the price , Great views
279838,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I would recommend one of the places around the hotel for breakfast as the hotel breakfast is over expensive Strange that the room had coffee and tea but no water cooker , spacious comfortable and clean rooms
279839,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The air conditioning in the room wasn t very good We ended up waking a few times in the night to sit by the window or even lie down on the floor to cool down, The speed of the wi fi was excellent The view from the top floor magnificent and the staff were very nice
279840,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Didn t like the quality of the room service but everything else was great Taxi drivers had no idea where it was Had to say by the station , A great hotel Lovely spa and staff very well located for the marathon EXPO and start 
279841,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Worst aircon i have experienced Only gives you option of going 3 or 3 of temperature If temperature is feeling like 40 degrees in room then going to 37 won t help When calling reception they offered no support other than open the window Breakfast is silly price one of the most expensive Although advertised as double bed there is clearly 2 mattresses under the covers as I kept falling down middle , The room was very comfortable Had a stunning view of the city Food we got for room services was delicious Love the spa Very relaxing Great location for train station and the fountains nearby 
279842,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, It was a little bit noise maybe because it near the train station There was no bathtub but it was in the picture when we reserved the room very disappointed about this , Really good location Near the railway station and surrounded by lots of subway lines like L3 and L5 it s really convenient for tourists The room is extremely clean and the bed is soft 
279843,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, First they wanted to charge us more for our seven year old boy even though the room max capacity was for three people No where in our reservation said there was an extra charge for children We didn t have to pay extra but it was not a good initial impression The A C didn t work and they couldn t make it work either and they did not do much about it We had to ask for our room to be serviced because some days nobody cleaned it There was no tissues in the room and we had to ask for some in the reception In short we wouldn t come back to this hotel nor recommend it to anyone but you can take your chances , Not much really Something nice is that they left little snacks in the room and that was nice 
279844,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nil, Thankful to have stayed in this hotel Left my wallet behind when I left Barcelona for San Sebasti n Staff immediately helped to look for it and sent it over to San Sebasti n for me Thanks to the efficient service of Susanna Antia housekeeping Montse frontdesk I received my wallet the next day with all my money cards intact Kudos to them for their integrity as well as efficient service 
279845,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The attendant when checking out no smile no nice word The noise in the corridor during the night The spa very small sad on resevation only , The nice welcome The amazing view from the room High floor and the restaurant on the top floor 
279846,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, All staff very helpful and eager to please Had to complain on 1st morning that mattress had been very hard immediately they moved me to a room with a new mattress and next morning when I was in reception they inquired if the new mattress was more comfortable 
279847,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Breakfast very pricey so we went elsewhere Aircon didn t work at times but reception were helpful in getting this to work , Great hotel We had the Junior Suite and the room was great The view of the skyline was beautiful and we could see the Montjuic Fountains We were even brought cakes on our first night Classy The Spa was lovely and my wife and I really enjoyed our time there Also right beside Sants station which was a bonus Staff were helpful 
279848,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Beautiful hotel Rooms so comfortable and luxurious I only stayed 1 night as it is right next to train station Wished I had stayed here my whole trip Upstairs Restraunt expensive but the view so worth it Easy to get around subway super close 
279849,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing, Everything was so nice and the staff was so helpful The breakfast buffet was soo good We really enjoyed our stay The view from the room window was really beautiful 
279850,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, It s not in the centre of town and lacks a little character but it s a business hotel really which I knew when I booked it , We had a great view towards the National Museum of Art and Montjuic Castle from the 22nd floor The room was nice and comfortable and the hotel is about 2 minutes walk from Sants station which is a Renfe and Metro stop easy to get to airport and into town The restaurant is very good 
279851,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The bed was in fact two beds and the mattresses a bit hard , The hotel was situated near the Sttion in Barcelona whichmeant that we could use the Metro system for everything We loved the Spa area since it was not frequented by other guests They made is feel very welcome As a welcome gift we had two cup cakes the first night Great view from the restaurant at the top floor 
279852,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Domestic staff threw out my husband s toiletries which were in a plastic bag on the bathroom bench Reception staff a bit unfriendly, Very comfortable room Good breakfast although a bit expensive Room very good value for money
279853,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful but sadly some were a little stern and unwelcoming , The room was very clean spacious and the bed was very comfortable 
279854,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Been to TDC since 10 years and have seen it go down little by little stuff not being repaired toilet seats minibar Shower showed some corrosion I am used to get a parking place offered by the hotel Not in TDC which costed me EUR 72 3 days Breakfast is extraordinary expensive better go the bar down in the street The bar area is not really inviting put in a corner In the past the concierge came to help me out with the luggage now not anymore And that all for the same price as in the past EUR 130 , Accross Estacio Sants makes voyage easy
279855,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The restaurant let the hotel down it was very expensive for the amount of food that was served We waited 20 minutes to be asked if we would like a drink and an hour between starters and main course in fact we had to ask them were our meals had got to when they arrived the food was cold and so were the plates that it was served on We decided not to go to breakfast , The hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were very helpful
279856,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The room is very old very noise in the night hard to sleep the BIG ISSUE is the shower head is very very old and broken badly when you turn on the shower the water went all over everywhere in the bathroom the bath tower is old Nothing is enjoyed very regretted by staying one night at this hotel The front desk is careless before arrived at the hotel called in asked for hotel direction and one customer service staff doesn t speak English and after the phone line was being transferred the another customer service staff speak English but she hanged up the phone with no reason The customer service is totally not satisfied , Nothing 
279857,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing , The view from the room was incredible The cleanliness and friendliness of the staff was everything and more Great location for our stay in a great city 
279858,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Room was bland and looked well worn Bedhead had large burn mark on it Empty oreo packet just underneath the bed for several days Bed cover ripped Only 1 cup in room to make tea , Location is excellent for airport and getting into Barcelona by tube Felt safe walking around in local area when going out for dinner View at breakfast is amazing 
279859,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Requested a high floor and early check and neither was met Little out the way from the city centre taxis everywhere all added up About 30min walk from camp nou Not really any supermarkets nearby to buy refreshments as the hotel was quite pricey Around 15min walk to the closest Would maybe stay near les rambles gothic quarter next time We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost 34 on the way back we wanted to take a bus or metro but the hotel staff told us there was no bus service from the hotel we could get a metro but it would take 2 metros and an hour travel time which I didn t understand because it was only 10mins in a taxi We opted for the taxi and it was just 25 on that journey which was more reasonable that 34 Having said all that I would return to this hotel but would maybe seek other options also , Very modern hotel very clean constant taxis parked up outside which is very convieniant Staff were helpful in directions and taking bags before check in Very comfortable stay and quite room Cannot fault the presentation of the hotel Barcelona really is a beautiful city highly recommend the hop on hop off bus tour Hotel is perfect location for camp nou and the mount juic is t too far either 
279860,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, No tissues in the bathroom something one would normally get in a hotel of this calibre, Nice spacious room Large comfortable bed with lovely pillows Good breakfast with good views over the city 
279861,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Spacious room well designed shelves for two cases very comfortable bed and pillows good soundproofing between rooms Very convenient for Barcelona Sants station 
279862,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, A little noisy in the rooms I was woken several times by banging doors clomping feet and moving furniture in neighbouring rooms , Located within easy access to metro and trains and a short walk from local attractions bars and restaurants Great view from room great facilities and nice room size 
279863,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The hallways were not air conditioned Property is downtown and you must take a taxi most everywhere wish it were closer to Port Vell where everything is happening Still the view and room are worth it , 21st floor Jr Suite Incredible view Room and bathroom were huge We were on our honeymoon and they left us gorgeous cupcakes and a bottle of prosecco Great room service menu Make sure you grab a couple of drinks downstairs at the hotel bar for guests only Great service 24 hours by staff that speak multiple languages They were really so helpful All of them look like gorgeous Spaniards The service here is truly outstanding and makes a big difference during your stay This is definitely the best priced hotel during our entire trip Felt like we were kings in Barcelona Viva Barcelona 
279864,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I booked this hotel for my two very senior colleagues on a business trip because it was close to the bullet train station the office they were visiting It seemed bigger than the average size a 4 stars hotel and had good reviews After the first night they asked me to move them to another hotel as there were all kinds of small but inconvenient issues the air con appeared to be working but the room was not getting any cooler shower had low pressure the room seemed a bit outdated breakfast wasn t nice etc I had two rooms booked for 4 days one of them a suite I asked the hotel to cancel the other 3 nights and keep one night as cancelation fee that s the policy if you cancel less than 24 hours before the stay and on booking com it appeared that it can be cancelld anytime if you pay one night Print screen attached They refused saying we can check out but pay the remaining 3 nights for each of the rooms I sent emails to Booking com with print screen of the reservation that seems to show this cancelation policy they did not have ANY answer They just encouraged me to take photos of the room so we can convince the hotel that the room is inappropiate I can t really take photos of shower pressure and temperature My boss who was actually staying at the hotel had business meetings all day and didn t want to interact with them so he asked me his PA to negotiate with the hotel I made the booking from my account I handle all his travelling arrangements especially abroad outside Japan The hotel refused the request because the person actually staying in the room did not report directly despite telling them many times through the Booking com customer center that I m their assistant who made the booking the people actually staying don t have the available time foreign language ability disponibility to negotiate with them , Location right next to the high speed train station 
279865,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Reception area let the hotel down Sign writers would be able to print a wall graphic of an historical building in say black and white and cover the wall behind the staff Would make a great impact on visitors and be unique to Barcelona , Very comfortable bed in good size and quiet room Great to be able to make a hot drink Awesomely huge bathtub 
279866,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The windows were dirty and could have been cleaned Perhaps it is a bit too expensive but Barcelona is a popular destination , Great views nice large bed the suite was huge Very classy overall The staff were very friendly and the facilities lovely 
279867,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Somewhat cheap looking walls doors and reception desk Outside noise could be heard at times in our room , We flew into Barcelona and took the train to Sants station We were only staying one night before traveling on by train to Poblet so convenience was important to us This hotel worked out well Good restaurants within walking distance just a block from the train station 
279868,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Paying for room on arrival Payment on check in at this hotel is policy and in my opinion is not acceptable for a 4 star internationally positioned hotel The front office staff are invested with insufficient authority to be able to waive this condition if you don t like it and if you put your foot down they just call the hotel manager Escalating this request just makes for a fretful confrontational check in and taints the hospitality policy of the hotel A big negative , 1 Good sized hotel rooms they were offices 2 Excellent 23rd floor restaurant with great views of Barcelona good but pricey food attentive waiting staff 
279869,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Very hard bed room was part of a conjoined room on the corner of building resulting in bad view from windows of hotel balconys of opposite hotel House keeping noisy at times and food in panaramic restaurant was limited and not very nice Would of had better food in downstairs bar so this was disappointing On arrival we weee met by a lovely member of staff who we thought checked us in and took payment however when returning to get room keys it turned out our details had been lost frustrated staff bickering in front of us and I feel the room we were given was not to the standard expected for the price paid , The double sink bathroom and location close to metro and main railway station

279879,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, No room service to deliver food from hotel restaurant Not many restaurant options around the hotel Room price is good, comfortable bed good shower 3 mins walk to metro and train station and very close to la rambla catalunya good room cleaning service good wifi signal
279880,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Amazing friendly and very professional staff They did everything we asked for and more I will definitely go back to this amazing hotel during my next visit to Barcelona 
279881,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Had to request tea and milk as had not been stocked up but it still didn t arrive until following day, Beautiful hotel in great location Great views from higher floors
279882,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, There s a little hassle with the air con that wouldn t turn on as the sensor wouldn t work properly but worked in the end Not overly happy but the breakfast wished I had more option , The hotel was nicely designed they pay attention to every details possible The staff was amazing and very helpful do seek advice for places to go The location was really close to the public transportation and some attractions are in walking distance The roof top bar is great Lunch pho at the restaurant is wonderful 
279883,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Windows dirty coffee machine not cleaned still had the pod from the last guest in the machine overall cleanliness could have been better , Junior suite big room nice view and very comfortable bed 
279884,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Bulb missing from bedside light and hotel s hairdryer blew the room s electricity trip switch when it was switched on Lack of an outside swimming pool we didn t fancy going to the next door hotel, Excellent shower and both the missing bulb and the faulty hairdryer were replaced quickly by the management Staff were unfailingly helpful and cheerful Location not very exciting but good for rail and metro access 
279885,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, the window could have been cleaner so I could get a better picture I find the bath tub difficult to access when one is small and older but I still manage to access it , I have appreciated the warm welcome and the help received as soon as i entered the hotel The location was for me excellent I loved the view from my window see pictures 
279886,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Would have preferred a double bed Wasn t clearly obvious if there was a bar , Breakfast superb staff in restaurant very helpful and friendly View from restaurant stunning Location ideal as we were travelling by train

279888,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Breakfast we had was a bit disappointing keeping in view the high standards of the hotel because the quality of fruits was not very good The options in break fast was also limited , rooms are spacious and very comfortable view of the city from the rooms was lovely Staff is welcoming and friendly bathrooms are very big and supply of hot water is very good the hotel gives a very comfortable feel the rooftop restaurant has great views over the city We did not try the food at the restaurant so cannot comment Location wise if you have to take the high speed train there is nothing more convenient the sant train station is next door tot he hotel But if you want to explore the gothic quarters and La Ramblas which are the main happening places in Barcelona the same are a bit away the cab takes about 15 euros one way metro station is also next door so the hotel is convenient that way the Hop on Hop Off service also has a bus stop next door Cab is readily available at all the hours Barcelona is a great city with vibrant nightlife I split my stay this time between Torre catalunya and another hotel on La Ramblas just to be within the main gothic quarter Overall a great place to stay
279889,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, At check in I was asked if I wanted to pay in dollars or euros In the moment I chose dollars but looked at my statement after and realized that it would be less if I chose euros I asked the front desk to change the charges and they would not Also when we first got to our room there were pubic hairs on the toilet seat and a blood stain on the wall by the toilet paper dispenser which means the housekeeping does not clean well Upon check out the front desk insisted that I ate breakfast and I had charges in my bill so when I asked to see the sign in seat they reversed the charges , Location
279890,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The elevators were really small but there were 6 of them available all the time Our queen bed sagged a little in the middle but pillows were decent , The staff was very friendly and helpful 75 of the rooms had a great view Location every mode of transportation was available at the door step Ice machines on each floor Roomy bathrooms and closets Very clean 
279891,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, No complaints , We stayed here just one night for the convenience of being very close to Barcelona Sants train station Staff was very nice and rooms were comfortable with nice big windows 
279892,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Beautiful comfortable and spacious bedroom and bathroom The bedroom had an excellent view of the city The staff were friendly and very helpful especially Elena who was fabulous in giving us directions and suggesting places to go The restaurant bar on the 23rd floor has a stunning view of the city and it s really worth going up for a drink at night we re only sorry we didn t go a second time The member of staff on duty when we went I don t know his name unfortunately went to extra effort to make a delicious white sangria for my friend even though this wasn t something on the menu We spent a couple of hours in the spa which was a lovely and relaxing experience too In terms of location this hotel is also very convenient it s directly across from a train station with regular trains to from the airport It s also near the metro and within walking distance from the centre for example we walked to the Sagrada Familia in about 30 min Highly recommended hotel 
279893,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, This is a great business hotel It is run very efficiently The reception desk seems focused on quick service to prevent long customer lines The bar area is very nice and restricted to guests so it allows for casual business meetings It also has a very nice outside patio area The hotel is a 1 minute walk from the Sants train station Many rooms on the higher floors have a nice view of the city 
279894,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Breakfaat wasn t included in our rate but if we wanted it it would have cost 22 euros each which is very expensive , Excellent location next to Sants train station clean and comfortable lovely bathroom with bath and separate shower 
279895,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Breakfast at the restaurant on top of hotel was a little pricey I guess you pay for the view Seemed like every time we headed somewhere it was a distance from hotel , First time traveler to Europe Room was spacious and cheaper than most with similar ratings Staff were helpful and spoke English well enough to be useful View from restaurant at top of hotel is very nice Bathroom was excellent and spacious
279896,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, very few negatives at this hotel we would have liked the air conditioning to have gone cooler but that s a personal preference , Elena on reception was friendly on arrival she took the time to find out our plans and helped with advice and directions the reception staff helped my 6 year old travelling with me feel very welcome The room was big spotlessly clean and had a great view over the city 
279897,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, coffee in breakfast is awful I almost throw up on my table BTW Why this hotel doesn t have membership card program what a pity I ve been here 7times expect they could realize marketing part could be more morden, Location room and food restaurant so beautiful

279908,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Well there was a great idea which was an ice machine in the hallway that would fill a water bottle with water and ice however when I tried it it didn t work and the Machine itself was full of dirt When I call down to the desk they said it hadn t worked in a number of years So if they re going to do something like that why not get it working Otherwise everything was great, Staff member Elena was very helpful in switching our room when we got the wrong kind of bed They called a cab for us and were very pleasant and nice
279909,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nice rooms but extremly expensive, Breakfast is good but also extremely expensive When cheking in they told 17 Euro on the receipt it was 31 Euros

279917,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Couldn t fault this hotel, The beds were fantastic the spa was so relaxing and the staff on the front desk couldn t do enough thank you all so much
279918,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The spa was closed all week for maintenance yet the rooms still sold at the same value as a hotel with spa facility We chose this hotel because it has a spa Bookings com should not have allowed it to be in the filter hotels with spa , The views and staff are the only good thing

279923,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, It was a shame that the spa pool didn t have a jacuzi hot tub by itself to sit in instead it was part of the the pool and that wasn t to a great temperature But the spa was a good price and still nice to go to I would of preferred it to be a little hotter is all , Our hotel was amazing As you walked into the hotel it smelt nice and we re very welcoming and spoke good English View from our hotel was amazing Staff very friendly and helpful with directions and knowing good places to eat Couldn t fault anything in the room it was spacious Nice a quiet so didn t get disturbed when sleeping or relaxing Bathrooms were great too Very big to be able to fit two people in the shower as well as the bath and you even had two sinks And at the end of our stay we still had the whole day to look around meaning we didn t have anywhere to put our luggage and the staff looked after it for us until we needed to pick it up which was a huge help for us The location of the hotel was good to as it was a two minute walk from the train station 
279924,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Only concern was that the fllor of the shower was slippery and potentially dangerous Check in was very slow , Stayed here many times for it ease of getting to the station and the airport

279926,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Rusty coloured hot water though they said it was a one off maintenance thing that they would sort Also a bit mean that they charge 10 euros to use the sauna most 4 hotels make it free for guests Breakfast expensive at 22 Euros discounted to 17 euros if you commit to having it every day Plenty of cafes nearby with decent breakfast for 6 or 7 euros , Located near transport hub at Barcelona Sants but a little way from the sights Stunning view from 23rd floor restaurant which serves excellent dinners 
279927,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, If you come to visit Barcelona as a tourist location is not ideal Too far away and there is not much around , Nice hotel very clean spacious room and bathroom and located near tran station Good breakfast with the great view over Barcelona Suppose it is a correct choice for business travel

279939,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Just wish that they have better mattresses it was slightly uncomfortable to sleep on the bed , They realised the reason why we came to stay was for my partner s birthday and sorted out a cake and a lovely message for my partner without us even asking it was a great surprise and I will definitely recommend the hotel to everyone I know Thank you for a great and comfortable stay 
279940,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Good central location but need to take a bus or metro to get to the interesting parts of the city which is not a problem because the hotel is right on top of the central station Great rooms Great view Great restaurant Great spa facilities with indoor pool 
279941,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I wish we had known we needed to make a dinner reservation as soon as we checked in Couldn t get one later and area choices were limited The location isn t great for sightseeing in Barcelona , View from top floor restaurant was wonderful Food was also wonderful Great location if you re overnighting between trains 
279942,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Location close to major metro station but if one wants to be more in the center of the city don t recommend , Nice sized room Nice bathroom Lots of storage Great view had upper floor 
279943,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The hotel is a bit dated windows were filthy had to pay extra to use swimming pool etc Bedroom very warm Ran the bath water it was brown There was a kettle in the room but maid forgot to leave milk Ice machine on each floor but doesn t work , It was in each reach of major metro that linked to most networks Restaurants close by 
279944,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, We had a wonderful trip to Barcelona The staff could not have been nicer and helped us get where we wanted to go not easy when you are dealing with 8 people Location is close to a great wine store 
279945,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Maybe the temperature control from the AC Heater was so limited 3 C anyway I would not hesitate to come back next time I need overnight in Barcelona , The room was clean nice and very quite Bathroom was very clean and I had a great relaxing hot water shower and bath The bed was very comfortable and I had a good rest and sleep Definitely I will come back 
279946,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Room service dinner was an expensive rip off the portion was a starter size unbelievable I advised the hotel in advance that it was our belated honeymoon 1st wedding anniversary while there but they did nothing to make it special not even a note of congratulations from them , Professional helpful polite staff at all times The Superior rooms are spacious light airy with stunning city views

279949,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, As a solo traveller I liked the fact that you had to have a room key to access the bar The hotel is near a station and too many people might try to have a drink there It felt quiet secure and comfortable and the menu was perfect for a light tapas or snack 
279950,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I requested an early check in since my overnight flight from the States arrived at 0800 hrs but was not able to check in until 1300 hrs , The hotel was right next to the Barcelona Sants Train Station and across the street from the Sants Metro Station so it was very conveniently located The rooftop restaurant had a fabulous view and it was a pleasure to have breakfast there each morning The coffee was the best I had while in Spain and the breakfast buffet had many food selections The room was spacious and exceptionally clean 
279951,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, If I had to find something wrong the staff in the bar won t a friendly and helpful as the staff in the main reception area , It was very easy to get around from the hotel The train metro taxi and tour bus right outside the hotel

279954,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Breakfast was disappointing as not all hot food items available , Friendly staff and facilities were very good especially the Spa services The location was also excellent with fantastic views across the city from our high floor room and restaurant Close to the railway station 
279955,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Great location close to both city and station metro making it really easy to get around Rooms were very pleasant and beds especially comfortable We loved being on the 21st floor as we had a spectacular view of the city and surrounds 
279956,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, We had a corner room on the 15th floor with wonderful views of the city around us Being next to the metro and close to the Bullring centre and Spanish Village was an added bonus 
279957,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing, Location to Sants station All staff we encountered were excellent but Pablo from Malaga on Reception is remarkable and if all hotel receptionists were like him the world would be a better place The room was amazing large clean comfortable with terrific views Everything you need is in the room including an iron tea making facilities and complementary water 
279958,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, cost of breakfast which is very expensive for an unremarkable breakfast no ice in ice machines, easy to find near all transport interesting view had our room changed without a problem
279959,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The stay was without breakfast The extra cost for breakfast was very expensive , The staff very kind and helpful They made all the necessary efforts to enable us a pleasant stay I shall recommend the hotel to my friends 
279960,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Excellent location next to train station Helpful and friendly reception staff which spoke perfect English Spacious and comfortable room with great view Will definitely stay again 
279961,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Everything met my expectations had a great view on the 21st floor of the city and everything was near by with the staff letting us know how to get by The pillows were great as well 
279962,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Bathroom could have been a little cleaner It wasn t dirty just wouldn t expect water spots on the chrome for this level of hotel not really that big of an issue , Great View of the city generously sized rooms No noise from the streets below
279963,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The one thing I would fault was the meal I had in the restaurant A fantastic view but the food did not measure up being bland and flavourless I had the ravioli and the monkfish both disappointing So whilst I might return to the hotel the food was a huge disappointment ,No Positive
279964,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, We were very tired from sightseeing and just wanted to sit in the bar downstairs and have a drink and something to eat but found the menu very lacking in anything inspiring very disappointing food for such a great hotel Breakfast was over priced , They gave us a corner room with a great view The staff were great very friendly and helpful
279965,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing, Fantastic location near the train station hop on hop off bus and metro Had a superior double so were on floor 21 so views were amazing Staff very helpful and rooms were nice and spacious Would definitely stay again 
279966,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Love everything except the early breakfast We re small eater and the cost should be less ax compare to your breakfast at your top lounge Nevertheless still very satisfied , PERSONNELS was very helpful and accommodating and very treat us with respect and so do we EXCELLENT 
279967,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Hotel is noisy with regard to doors slamming etc especially in the morning due to it being near the business district and naturally people staying there had early starts , Staff were helpful and friendly The restaurant is a must to visit we were apprehensive as it wasn t on our agenda as not really part of cultural trip but the food was fantastic I can definitely recommend the gorgonzola and pear sacchetti Cleaner came every day and replenished toiletries and towels as requested Overall a perfect stay in a fab location near the Saints station which gives access to many lines all over Barcelona and to the airport 
279968,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, expensive breakfast old furniture in rooms, location was perfect near metro and also easy access for airport comfortable room and beds great service
279969,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, If i was been picky then the only thing i can say is the windows could do with cleaning on the outside something n nothing really great hotel, The massive bed and pillows were very comfy
279970,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Restaurant lacked atmosphere at night but great views Breakfast was too expensive at 17euro but 22euro if you only took it on one morning Never had that before We had very early start on 2 mornings so could not eat anything till later such a petty ridiculous rule for such a large hotel chain had much better breakfast in many hotels around the world , The beds were fantastic as were the views over Barcelona Right next to Sants station for airport train and metro Also open top tourist bus stop staff were superb too 
279971,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Located across from the train station Always cabs available We did not eat at the hotel but there is a beautiful view from the top floor restaurant 
279972,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Location is right next to main station but does mean you have to get the metro in for anything all meals etc This was a bit of a pain some nights especially when we were tired after a long day of sightseeing and couldn t get any decent meals locally Neighbourhood seems more business focused would probably stay closer to gothic quarter in future to get that Barcelona charm Room was great well worth paying extra for the suites with panoramic views 
279973,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Staff seemed really disinterested and didn t seem to realise they were supposed to be offering a service The hotel could also do with a bit of TLC Furnishings were a bit worn and it didn t look like it had been refurbished since the 90 s It didn t feel like a 4 experience at all , Location was perfect so easy to find and we could get to everywhere we wanted to go by foot or by easy reach on the metro Great choices at breakfast and the view from our room on the 20th floor was stunning 
279974,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, There is a fun fair outside for the last two weeks every August Unfortunately the rides and the screams don t stop until 3am This made for a very poor sleep Would stay here agin but never in August , The staff were very helpful and efficient
279975,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, 4 superior rating not justified used building needs renovation defective water spender chocolate overdue in the frige replacements warm melted noisy you here neighbour moving chairs cleaning not complete shower edges rusty , nice view centrally located near sub station friendly staff
279976,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The room faced the train station and there was a carnival right next to it The traffic noise was terrible and people were out partying all night Naked people were swimming in fountains at 3AM The bed was hard and no top sheet only a down comforter too hot , Location was good The Concierge help was excellent 
279977,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya,No Negative, Great views from room top floor restaurant Staff friendly respectful of privacy Enjoyed food atmosphere in Eclectic Restaurant Location perfect for train station metro
279978,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Parking cost Front desk always crowded queue for check in check out request info Need a refresh, Location close to train and metro station Breakfast buffet on top floor 24th with a nice city view Bed quality Parking accessibility
279979,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The only disadvantage that I have strongly noticed is a prominent smell of the air freshener in the lobby spinning door It is nice to see that you would like your guests to have a great experience in your hotel but this smell is definitely too much Also the ice machine did not work and you have to call room service for ice which is not a problem at all but passing not working ice machine everyday is probably not the image that you want your visitors to have about your hotel , Everything was a lot better than expected
279980,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Nothing, This was my fourth time at this hotel and we loved it as much as ever We stay there in part because of the parking facilities and extremely easy access to the airport The hotel is very very clean and the beds are wonderful The staff is extremely efficient and helpful The views of the city are amazing The rooms are bight and sunny and the bathrooms so well designed and spacious 
279981,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Ice machine on the corridor was not working Like all the meals I had anywhere in Barcelona the food was quite salty, The room and service were excellent 
279982,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, It was a tad pricey but totally worth it if you ll only be in Barcelona for a short visit and are traveling by train , It was across the street from the train station and was a beautiful building with an excellent view 
279983,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, Food in the restaurant was of a poor quality and over seasoned, Very helpful on check in and the concierge was very friendly called up to the restaurant and managed to reserve us a table by the window Good value in an ideal location opposite the train station

279986,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The bed was awful Not only was it very hard but I could actually feel the spring pressing against my body It took me forever to fall asleep , Rooms are clean and nicely decorated 
279987,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, The room was not cleaned very well Our 1 year old girl found a pill and the floor no idea what it was must have been from the previous people and I just stopped her before she swallowed it Could have been disastrous And when they tidied for us then didn t wash our dirty wine glasses etc , The room was huge and well furnished with great facilities kettle gym fantastic restaurant with 360 views of Barcelona They provided a cot with no problem and even gave us a bottle of cava for our anniversary
279988,Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya, I clearly requested before I booked online I required 1 room for 2 adults and 2 children I was forced to rent an extra room because their policy is max 3 persons room Not cool If I wasn t so tired from Jetlag I would have argued till the end of time , Large rooms and bathrooms Great brunch
