145520,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Fabulous hotel in a great location Just near enough to the hussle and bustle but far enough away so that you wouldn t know it We stayed in a twin room and we re pleased with the size of the room for two people Decor was lovely and beds were very comfortable Staff were brill Would stay again and would recommend 
145521,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Size of the room was toooo small The pictures on site are misleading V noisy at night due to several pubs around Had to keep window open as there was no a c Fans were not efficient Garbage cans emptied late night around the area so basically no escaping the noise, Location Safety 
145522,Grange Langham Court Hotel, No aircon equals no sleep Bed was tiny and for an upgraded room it was so small this was nowhere near the standard of other evenly priced rooms I think you need to look at the sister company s in Hong Kong they have been amazing you guys really need to update that place asap We will not be returning and advised others not to as well last year we where in the Hilton and it was fantastic , Location
145523,Grange Langham Court Hotel, No air conditioning and it was a very hot weekend There was a fan in the room which really helped but it couldn t be placed near the window so the air was still fairly warm Also the kettle was awkwardly positioned the base was wired into the wall and the lead went up through a cupboard This meant you had to pull out a shelf to sit it on top of and the shelf wasn t flat so the kettle was boiling away precariously on a tipping shelf It didn t fall but was a bit worrying and wouldn t be great for someone with any difficulty using their hands The bath was very deep and having short legs was a challenge to step out of inadvisable for anyone frail The drinks at the bar were very expensive cheaper to walk outside to a pub so the bar wasn t very popular they could do with slightly reducing the prices to encourage more guests to use it The lift was extremely small 2 3 people could stand in it at most and it was incredibly claustrophobic to use after using it twice we decided to walk up the stairs and three flights in hot weather was uncomfortable In the morning there was noise very early on from dustcarts and traffic and without air conditioning we had to sleep with the window wide open The road isn t a big one but there were some people on motorbikes and in cars who drove really quickly up it so watch out when crossing over , The shower was very powerful and could be as hot as you liked The location was great 15 20 mins to the heart of London The staff were really friendly and helpful at check in and check out The bar area is very nice The bed was comfortable The TV had channels in all sorts of languages as well as Sky The area seemed lively with a number of restaurants cafes and pubs around 
145524,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The bed was the sort that can fold up against the wall so is basically a mattress on the floor very low to get in out of , We booked a standard room but were upgraded to a premier room on arrival which was a nice surprise The location is very good a quiet road just off Regent Street so no noisy traffic during the night despite being on the ground floor at the front of the hotel Can t comment on the food as we sorted ourselves out 
145525,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Maybe deserved it s rating when it was built but with no visible signs of any renovation or improvement to bring it to a modern day standard it is a very poor hotel 
145526,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The TV did not work on arrival Room somewhat small We had booked 2 rooms the 2nd room toilet flush did not work originally also the radiator fixings had come away from the wall without anyone touching them , The central location just off Regent street in easy walking distance of tourist spots 
145527,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Nothing, Petra the Staff member on reception was excellent She was helpful organised and proactive Extremely professional with obviously very good customer services skills and common sense 
145528,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Very helpful reception staff A super location Oxford st and Regent s Park a five min walk away Very good bars and restaurants nearby a very smart hotel beds v comfy toiletries great 
145529,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The hotel has no air condition lucky for us the weather was great Room is not very big, Great location minutes from Oxford Circus Very helpful staff helped us to weight our luggage The hotel in general and the Room specifically were very clean
145530,Grange Langham Court Hotel, We were given a disabled room which had a very tiny sink in the bathroom just big enough to was your hands but st knee height which made for interesting use ,No Positive
145531,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Elevator did not work had to climb six flights of stairs for three days It was apparantly to complicated to fix Rooms are properly sized for smurfs , Location
145532,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room was called executive double room but was in fact really small That s fair enough but the bed was not more than 140 cm which is too small for two adults The bed was also extremely hard Unfortunately for this hotel there was a heat wave in London during this weekend and the rooms were not equipped with either ventilation nor AC So there were insanely hot in the room The room was equipped with a table fan but even with the fan on and the window open the temperature was around 25 degrees in the room , The staff was friendly and the location was perfect Short walking distance to Oxford Circus underground station Oxford Street and Regent Street 
145533,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room was tiny more like a single We were only there for one night and are small in stature but would have struggled had it been for longer Nevertheless the room was tastefully decorated and had everything we needed except perhaps aircon , The location is perfect 
145534,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Rooms small stayed in a basement room 8 very noisy as staff room was opposite no air con so had window open quite noisy , Close to palladium and shops
145535,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Don t dine in here it s too expensive and not good , Loved it Everyone of the staff was really kind and nice location is just three blocks away from the Oxford Circus tube all the stores and shopping area are two blocks away and there are several Tesco s close by Perfect stay 
145536,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Our bedroom was very small and the bathroom tiny , The hotel is in a good position for central London and within walking distance to central London attractions such as Oxford street Piccadilly Leicester Square and the Embankment and many theatres and museums 
145537,Grange Langham Court Hotel, I had requested an early check in only an hour before normal check in time we were left for nearly 2 hours in the lobby just off reception and kind of forgotten about We were asked if we wanted to be transferred to a sister hotel in Holborn I said I didnt due to all the amazing things I had planned in the area so the lady said she would be back in 5 mins 40 mins later a coach load of people were checking in and our day was cut shorter because I had to go looking for the lady who was dealing with us eventually we were able to check in The continental breakfast was pretty standard but you should be allowed a pot of tea in the morning not just one cup , The beds were very comfy felt safe I loved the pillows the shower was hot and worked something which we always find to be a problem and for two sisters staying together it s great that we had loads of mirrors and plug sockets I knew I booked an amazing location but seriously this is the best location for EVERYTHING I had planned Tea and coffee and biscuits were replenished everyday and our shower condiments were as well which was lovely Staff were friendly especially the cleaning ladies 
145538,Grange Langham Court Hotel, We had a room on the lower ground and it was very noisy first thing in the morning when the staff were moving about preparing breakfast etc, Friendly polite staff
145539,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The people at the reception could have been more friendly not a smile in sight and talk a bit louder as I had trouble hearing them The rooms with twin beds was very very small 2 people had trouble moving around the same time and no place to have your suitcases as there was no room , The room was clean and quiet and the hotels location is perfect 
145540,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Rooms too warm and fairly small but suited our purpose would not recommend for younger families, Beds very comfortable Lovely quiet location but excellent for sightseeing and central to all key areas Staff friendly and polite
145541,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The coffee shop in charged tried to over charge our breakfast without asking whether we were hotel guests or not Quality of breakfast declined compared to our last stay Neither a twin bedroom nor a double bedroom fits 2 guests There is no space to put 2 suitcases I have no idea how western guests fit into it No daily complimentary bottled water Not even a mini fridge for chilling drinks Bathroom design is useless No ventilation and windows couldn t be opened The sliding glasses on top of the bathtub take up lot of space making more difficult for adult to get in out , Friendly helpful staffs at reception Location is excellent 
145542,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Check in was 3pm and check out was 11 am a bit early if you you are on holiday no late check out either not sure if other hotels have the same 4 hour gap I may have not noticed it since everywhere I have stayed had atleast a check out time of 12 noon or a sympathetic extension this was a firm no without even a explanation that the hotel was booked out or something like this , Great staff Great Location Rooms etc
145543,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The bed was too small and the room and bathroom was very small Compact and everything you would want was there but it was far too small and a bit claustrophobic for the money we paid , The bed was comfy
145544,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Hi the room was lovely but it was a bit warm wouldn t like to stay in room in hot weather the window wouldn t stay open to let some air in so it made it unpleasant to sleep , The hotel was lovely so we re the staff and breakfast was good would stay again but not with a triple room 
145545,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Size of the room was great for my friend and I with a great bathroom attached Centrally located and a good selection of restaurants located all around made this hotel a great choice 
145546,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Having to step over a high sided bath to get into the shower , Excellent location friendly and accommodating staff great choice for breakfast well catered for gluten free comfortable room Good choice for business or sightseeing trip Would recommend and will definitely be using this small hotel again 
145547,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The shower was a bit small and the head of the shower was unmovable so if you were small and didn t want to get your hair wet it was a problem, The bed was so comfortable I didn t want to get out of it 
145548,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Restaurant was unstaffed at 9 20 although notices said it was open on Saturday evenings till 9 45 Next door guest came in very noisily at 2am, Friendly helpful staff Pleasant room 
145549,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The welcome was okay The room was very very small for two single beds we could hardly move around them There was only one bedside table positioned between the two beds with very little space to put two cups and saucers two glasses and personal bits and pieces The unusual hot drinks cupboard meant if you hadn t got all of the items you need to make the drink out of the drawer underneath it meant removing the kettle and closing it up again to access the contents The bathroom door was too small I guess 2 6 and hit against a floor stop when you opened it making it a squeeze to get passed the protruding towel ring without either bruising your hip on the door handle or your thigh on the towel ring It is probably the smallest ensuite I have experienced There was a number of lights on the TV a box above it and the phone that lit up the small room and made it difficult to get to sleep Reading other reviews I think we were possibly given the worst room in the hotel , The ideal location Looked perfect for my needs on the website 
145550,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room was very small with very little natural light which made it feel claustrophobic it was also very hot with no ventilation and there was a constant buzzing sound, The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable breakfast was good also
145551,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Bathroom had malt everywhere Used ear cottons behind the night tables Tiny room without space for two suicases Windows don t close properly cold room , Got an alternative hotel at same fee after complaining as the malt was just horrible 
145552,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The mattress was very uncomfortable and hard Lobby reception bar extremely small and cramped We asked to leave our bags in storage with the hotel on the day we checked out We came back in the evening to find our bags along with others unattended in the corridor leading to the toilets next to the lobby Very unhappy with that Some staff members very pleasant others not so much , The location is perfect The exterior of the hotel is beautiful Bathrooms are very modern 
145553,Grange Langham Court Hotel, We had a street facing room which had a constant draught making it very cold particularly at night The bar could do with a make over as it very uninviting and dated , Excellent location and just minutes walk from Oxford Street and shopping etc 
145554,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Once again high score on the location of this little gem Nested on a quiet street in the middle of SOHO this hotel is minutes from the underground shopping and eating The hotel is clean and comfortable and staff friendly and helpful 
145555,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Not sure how this hotel got 4 stars Rooms are very small and the carpet is old and better not to know when it has been cleaned last Bathroom is so tiny you can not even turn around Also extractor fan did not work and walls were mouldy Also it was very cold in the room since the windows were not even double glazing although when sleeping under the blanket temperature was fine , Location was great just 5mins walk to Oxford Circus perfect for a weekend trip Beds were comfy 
145556,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Didn t like a drainage smell that came from the bathroom Had to ensure the door was closed Very off putting, The location was perfect for our planned activities The hotel was lovely we didn t eat here so I can t judge but the room was more than adequate for our needs
145557,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Bathroom was extremely small service was shaken Ordered room service after giving them a credit card on checking in and had to come down from the top floor with cash before they would send any food up At breakfast despite there being plenty of room elsewhere in the dining room we were seated next to the toilets We realise why now this was so keenly priced I would not stay at this hotel again The lounge was tired and all the wires from the TVs were hanging down , The position of the hotel was excellent 
145558,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Rooms were very small as was the bathroom , Bed were comfy and the breakfast a little pricey but very good Very friendly staff Very good location near lots of shops restaurants and the oxford circus tube station 
145559,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The breakfast is not included The breakfast is toooo expensive If you buy breakfast from reception when you check in that will be 10 and 12 pounds for two options My friend and me decided to eat outside in next morning but we changed plan on next day morning we decided to eat inside the hotel We started to eat and the waiter asked me and my friend to pay 24 pounds each That was 48 pounds for two people s breakfast The reception didn t tell us that will be full price if we don t buy breakfast when we check in I feel so disappointed about this That was too much money just for only breakfast I hope the hotel can change the breakfast plan ,No Positive
145560,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The double room we had was very small even by London standards Okay for one night but wouldn t stay longer for this reason , Really like this hotel because of the location and because it s small and friendly 
145561,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The noise kept us awake most of the night We were in the basement and could here water running all night and boilers banging people talking , The staff were helpful the location was excellent 
145562,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, The staff were so lovely on our check in for our honeymoon trip We were kindly upgraded and they also added another lovely touch by sending us strawberry cheesecake on our first night The hotel is located in an amazing area with close access to so many places The bed was comfy a tad small but we re 2 tall people and the bathroom was lovely and clean 
145563,Grange Langham Court Hotel, I had been moved hotels because of a technical glitch on the system so it was a rushed experience The hotel was accommodating to book taxis for me however confused the time in the morning so had booked it too early , Breakfast was great and bed comfortable 
145564,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Paid a lot of money for room which was supposed to be a double but was small for one person No bath in bathroom although it was given as a facility when booking one side of bed was against the window Breakfast very expensive although discount offered at check in it was still 18 Some suspect hairs on cushion on bed , Breakfast good staff pleasant room was comfortable and bathroom was clean 
145565,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Bed was too firm for our preference and the ensuite was quite small especially for my other half who at 6 2 and broad athletic frame repeatedly hit his arms in the shower , Staff were friendly and was in ideal location for us 
145566,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The lift is very small so get used to walking up stairs to save time , Location is excellent in Fitzrovia near Soho within walking distance of 2 tube stops
145567,Grange Langham Court Hotel, very small rooms had chosen an Executive double which was smaller than most standard rooms elsewhere waste of money If you want a bit of luxury book somewhere else , close to Oxford Circus
145568,Grange Langham Court Hotel, bedroom and bathroom were small had to manoeuvre sideways between bed and TV on the wall to avoid hitting my head the safe in the cupboard was at floor level requiring the user to kneel down to operate it and even then it was dark under the shelf so the keys were hardly visible All very irritating, Location was good staff were efficient and polite room was clean
145569,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Basement room smells slightly of drainage plus noisy next to storage rooms and breakfast room no drinking water in rooms rooms looking a little tired could be so much better with a bit of TLC, Location perfect room size good pleasant enough for 3 star hotel 
145570,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The bathroom was extremely cold we visited in mid November Quite small room superior Would have liked to have a mini bar , Very nice and helpful staff Nice breakfast Good location and very nice hotel all in all I recommend it 
145571,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room v small but this is central London TV had v poor reception First impression of the reception area is poor cheap the room was much better, Excellent location Very clean
145572,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The rooms are small, Great location close to oxford street regent street the room was very clean and the beds are SO comfortable We had asked for a quiet room and which was given to us 
145573,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room next to dining room so disturbed by clientele having breakfast For price would expect breakfast a bottle of water in room and hand towels and face cloths for each person , Bed comfortable and room decent size Location great Staff helpful 
145574,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Nothing everything was lovely, The beds were really comfortable the rooms were lovely and the breakfast was really good The staff were helpful and friendly would recommend this hotel to anyone 
145575,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room was not as advertised So small could barely move and next to kitchen in basement so dingey Woken up at 6am with chefs banging and clattering and staff shouting , Clean Location 
145576,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room smelt of drains , Staff nice friendly and helpful Except for asking someone for some cleaning liquid of some sort for the drains They smelt awful No one arrived nor any cleaner 
145577,Grange Langham Court Hotel, I arrived and was told that my room wasn t available due to a maintenance issue 2 other people waiting had the same issue I was told that they would relocate me to a better property in Holborn it was actually St Paul s but due to early meetings and needing to take quite a lot of luggage that wasn t an option I spoke to them three different times about this while they looked at options and was told there was no availability and therefore no choice It wasn t until I asked for my money back and said I would book around a corner which was available that they gave me a triple room Upon checking in it looked like a plain old double room to me Shocking behaviour really Not only did they not tell anyone in advance what was going on they lied to me and the other customers that were with me , Located centrally
145578,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Rooms were actually quite small and we were on the lower ground floor but had staff walking backward and forward down the immediate pathway at 6am on a Sunday, Great position and excellent value
145579,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Early check in not possible When you travel for business sometime it s necessary to have the room at least in the late morning , Very kind staff at disposal for your needs Clean room very comfortable and nice Central position near to Regent Street 20 minutes walk from Piccadilly circus 5 minutes from Oxford circus 
145580,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room was small which is the norm for London but not well laid out We had to open the suitcase in front of the door as there was nowhere else The bed was rather small as well The staff were nice but I found the check in rather chaotic for a 4 star hotel I would expect this to be more streamlined , The location was ideal for us everything we needed was within walking distance 
145581,Grange Langham Court Hotel, No mini bars and no A C in the rooms Furniturr requires repair, When we arrived by the midday there was a problem with water supply in the triple room However the hotel manager Stella who speaks very fluent Russian was so friendly and proactive in trying to sort out the problem that we did not feel any discomfort at all She even offered us a free upgrade in Grange s 5 star hotel located near Tower bridge Wonderful management All other staff was also extremely helpful and polite Any request was settled immediately 
145582,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Minor detail the bathroom was very small making it almost impossible to sit on the toilet if you got long legs , Great location shops restaurants and pubs just around the corner Friendly staff Perfect for a romantic get a way 
145583,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Great location close to Oxford street but in quiet suburb with restaurants and shops Extremely attentive obliging and friendly staff Room on small side but very comfy beds very clean with everything you needed Great value for money would stay again Can t comment on food as we ate out 
145584,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The booking said the room had a bath I made a note that I wanted a room with a bath My room had a shower However when I pointed this out the desk staff were excellent and within 10 minutes I was in a room with a bath Excellent Although there was no air conditioning which I knew so is not a negative the sash windows were fixed so they could not be opened to set up a convection current which is a pretty good alternative Most places with sash windows have this problem as they don t know how to work them properly That said a fan was provided and that did the same job if a little noisier , Excellent location for my needs and very helpfull staff especially when the bath issue came up 
145585,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Check in out was long winded Had to fill out form with details again through slow iPad system even though these were included when we filled in the booking form Check in took about 20 mins from the time we got to the desk , Comfy bed Great location right in the middle of Oxford Street and Euston Hotel looks very impressive from the outside and nice and tucked away so not too noisy at night 
145586,Grange Langham Court Hotel, My wife didn t like the very small tomb like lift with an outer door She took the stairs , The whole concept of the hotel was lovely The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms although small as it is an old hotel were just fitting Overall we had a lovely stay and I would definitely stay there again as it is in a good location for around the BBc and Harley Street 
145587,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Nothing, Loved the refurbished room 103 I would wish this to be my room I stay in from now on You cannot go wrong with a room rate of 106 Plus the wifi is very good and fast
145588,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room was so small that I had to walk sideways to get past the bed It was that small that I banged my shoulder very bad as the to was on the wall and I had to bed over the bed to walk past to get to the bathroom I won t be staying here again, The location is perfect 
145589,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room was small Shower was awkward and in a tub and not good pressure Room was pricey 82 pounds for a single room for a single night Pillows could have been better , Bed was of good comfort Location was good a little bit of a hike from the metro if you have luggage and are walking 
145590,Grange Langham Court Hotel, We were just there for a bed and reasonable size room so hotel met our expectations Walking distance to many London attractions , Great location comfortable beds good wifi clean room I like that the cleaning staff don t come in your room unless you ask them to feels quite private 
145591,Grange Langham Court Hotel, We had a basement room which was poor Very cramped and stuffy Staff occasionally walking past our bedroom window which wasn t ideal Staff s level of conversational English was poor , Good location
145592,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The bath was a bit worn out but still extremely clean super pedantic only commenting because the place was so nice otherwise , Very helpful staff very nice room great location 
145593,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, The hotel was lovely the room was on the small side slight nuisance bumping into the TV trying to get round the bed The bath was too small for a soak 
145594,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The hotel was chosen as it was advertised on Booking com as being near to the theatre we were attending in the evening I have a knee problem and walking any distance is painful The hotel was not near the theatre A cab was needed to take and return us from the theatre Also the executive room was snug and compact I would have thought a larger room would come with the executive label There was quite a lot of noise in the early morning from refuse collection vehicles and their operatives shouting , Staff were friendly and the room was available for occupancy before the advertised time which was a bonus when checking in We were also upgraded to an executive room at no extra cost 
145595,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room size a little on the small size not bad but if you are used to US size rooms you will be disappointed, Walking distance from everything Quiet location
145596,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Nothing at all , Very happy with this choice of hotel for a birthday night out in London Staff were very helpful and efficient the room and overall hotel was exceptionally clean Will definitely stay again she up in town and recommend to a friend 
145597,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Hot rooms We asked for connected rooms but they put us in the lower floor and not connected rooms No vantilations in the rooms no air conditioning it was very hot in the rooms while outside was cold We really disappointed Staff George was helpful and cooperative Thank you GEORGE, Good location
145598,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Staff were helpful Room and bathroom were adequate but pillows were uncomfortable and the room was hot and a lot of noise from the air conditioning hot water tank
145599,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Check in room 50 minutes and staff were inefficient and not friendly Requested a twin room on a low floor and was given one on the 4th floor they then changed it to the ground floor but this was a double on the third attempt we finally got a room The room was very small and the shower you could not close the door and stand in it so small No fan in the tiny bathroom and the whole room was so hot you could not bear to be in their too long The beds were extremely soft and uncomfortable not good for back sufferers To cap it all they pre authorised my debit card and I did not get my money credited back to my account for days even though we had paid by a different method on the day totally inefficient and poor service we would not stay again ,No Positive
145600,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The place is a bit too hot for summer Even with the fan it provided I d prefer a place with air condition, The staff is really friendly and helpful
145601,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The hotel called me on the morning of my booking and told me they could not make any guarantee that the room I had booked weeks before was actually available as they had allowed another guest to extend their booking and take my room It was eventually sorted but very very distressing on the day of my trip to be told I had nowhere to stay , Very well presented and really close to Oxford Circus station 
145602,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The bathroom smelt really bad to a point I could to use it at all, Great location and value for money Reception staff very friendly Bedroom great with comfy bed
145603,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Very small room and wrong room given lacking advertised facilities such as safe I booked pay for an executive room and we were given the superior which is tiny and only having a small shower cubicle Room looking more like a small 3 and definitely not a superior 4 Plenty of choice in London so I would not go back, Friendly staff good venue for meeting nice coffee
145604,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, Went to London for a concert at the Palladium and the hotel was really closed both to the train station and the theatre glad we didn t have to get lost in the subway for once 
145605,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Some rooms are really small One has to lie in bed while other person moves around the room , The location is really good with restaurants shops and other attractions 
145606,Grange Langham Court Hotel, As a complete tea addict 1cup of tea with no offer of refil spoilt an otherwise excellent breakfast, Good price for such a central location Pillows were like sleeping on clouds bliss 
145607,Grange Langham Court Hotel, The room we had was small but perfectly adequate for a two night stay Because it s a lively neighbourhood it can be noisy on Fri and Sat nights but it s so convenient and you can always slip out locally and join the fun , This is a perfectly located small central hotel less than 10mins walk from Oxford Circus It s in a great neighbourhood with some seriously good food and coffee right at hand It s very well kept with up to date interiors and unassuming staff The building itself is quite special and historic We got a super deal on our room rate with booking com highly recommended if you can get a good rate 
145608,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Small bed for a 4 star hotel Got a basement room which was super hot Impossible to sleep after 6am or so due to staff noise maybe starting their shift and cafeteria noise getting the breakfast ready it was next door with our room , Great location
145609,Grange Langham Court Hotel,No Negative, This is just a wonderful place The staff the manager and last but not least the dog are truly friendly helpful and give you a homely feeling It looks like the staff is very happy to work there and it shows off to the customers Our room was very clean and cosy with a beautiful view over the park I really recommend it 
145610,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Staff often didn t understand what I was asking for If people called me from outside it took some time for them to get connected , Bed was super I liked that there was tea and coffee in the room and it was easy to go downstairs for a snack coffee etc 
145611,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Accommodation is a little bit cramped but adequate for a single traveller , Very helpful staff Modern warm comfortable and clean with tasteful decor and choice of lighting plentiful hot water Thick curtains to keep in heat and daylight out for restful sleep Efficient sustained Wi fi connection 
145612,Grange Langham Court Hotel, If I was to be critical I would say check out at 11am is a bit early considering check inn is 3pm, I pre booked holiday inn originally and was priced 278 and hotel looked very dirty and out dated and then found grange langham court at 90 cheaper when I arrived the staff were lovely and let me check in 40mins earlier everything from reception hallway and room was clean and tidy and rooms were lovely with great wifi connection and speed in rooms enabling to watch Netflix on iPad also TVs have sky sports also to watch football will definitely be booking here on next visit also great location 15mins walk to theatres and Madame Tussaud s and 5mins walk to Oxford Circus station 
145613,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Politely asked for a bigger room and a nice view as me and my boyfriend were in London to celebrate our anniversary hotel were unable to do this for us but understand that they were fully booked and sometimes it is hard to fit everyone s needs, Location is excellent with a 5 minute easy walk to Oxford street and about 10 mins into soho staff were really friendly and helpful
145614,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Reception area is not welcoming no seating provided Lift way too small Too small that can only fit 4 persons Breakfast can be improved Charged 10 95 for crappy breakfast Not happy Bathroom too tiny Triple room you hardly have space for luggages and moving around No view from my room 405 The view was rear part of surrounded building Very ugly view and depressing Value for money NO A fair bit of walk to nearest tube station , Overall cleanliness of the hotel and room Fresh fruits basket at the reception and morning breakfast Grab a fruit a day while you stay I like it Staff are okay Most of them are non locals 
145615,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Can t think of anything but, The room was perfect for what we needed The food was really good and the staff were really helpful Breakfast was lovely make sure you pay for it when you check in it s cheaper perfect location for visiting BBC 
145616,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room is real small and bathroom is far too squeezy for the money they charged House keeper wasn t cleaning the room properly No fridge No reception for TV , Breakfast was good and worth for money Staffs were helpful Location is excellent for shoppers Good restaurants around

145622,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Although we were upgraded to a superior room because of 5 foot bed it felg a bit cramped Otherwise it was well furnished and comfortable Due to foreign accent of receptionist we made mistake of not reserving breakfast the night before which is then charged at lower rate Luckily the manager sorted this problem out for us , Very good location walking distance to west end and shopping area helpful staffand manager 
145623,Grange Langham Court Hotel, Room was absolutely boiling Even after switching the radiator off and leaving the window open all night it was like sleeping in a sauna and stayed in January If it wasn t for that would have slept well as beds were lovely and very quiet, Nicely decorated rooms comfortable beds very helpful staff Great location for Oxford Street
