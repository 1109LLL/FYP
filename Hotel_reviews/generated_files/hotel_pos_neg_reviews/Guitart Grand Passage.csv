382536,Guitart Grand Passage, Take care the hotel brings you to a very old dirty and worn out room If you do not complain it is up to you If you complain you are offered a better room still with problems , The room has good space 
382537,Guitart Grand Passage, Nothing to not like , This hotel is a gem beautiful and huge rooms with a stunning balcony There were no parking spots left in the hotel garage but they gave me a coupon to park at a garage just 1 2 block away where the management was lovely and accommodating The hotel is an easy drive from the highway and only 20 minutes to the airport When I went to collect the car at 7 30 a m the next morning it was waiting for me Since I had only the afternoon to explore Barcelona I took both routes of the Hop On Hop Off bus with a stop right across the street from the hotel for the orange line I would gladly book this hotel again 
382538,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, The bathroom was lovely it wasn t noisy at night even though we were facing the street They gave us a choice of a sheet as it was summer or a duvet if u felt the cold 
382539,Guitart Grand Passage, Breakfast really bad The pic shows all hot food they provided We dont even go to eat even we paid already Safe was not free to use house keeper enter my room three times without my permission , Nice location warm staff big room and bathroom 
382540,Guitart Grand Passage, Reception on arrival not helpful No orientation provided Was not made aware of lobby welcome refreshment Limited complimementary coffee in room No instruction on ac use Expected more for price,No Positive
382541,Guitart Grand Passage, The plumbing could be better as had problems with water draining and not the best shower in the world hot then cold and then hot again but minor thing The fridge was very dirty and we had to clean it before using it , Great location easy to get to all areas of Barcelona good reception area The hotel has free wifi which is good welcome drinks in lobby We didn t use hotel for eating as so much in local area to experience Very large room with good balcony and bonus to have a fridge Lots of supermarkets shops restaurants and the best pizza takeaway just round the corner New York Pizza amazing guys pizzas cooked to order 
382542,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, room a good size but a bit sparse in furnishing Lacking in information about the restaurant and facilities on offer On balance very well positioned and opposite an excellent Tapas bar and restaurant Would go there again
382543,Guitart Grand Passage, A bit noise at night but acceptable price is a bit high the entrance to room is super narrow overall I have no complain about the hotel , Near to famous shopping street many good restaurant nearby friendly and helpful staff big room with balcoy breakfast is excellent although not many varieties but in very good quality good wifi excellent hotel
382544,Guitart Grand Passage, I found the boiling bottle had remaining tea inside door to toilet cannot be closed glass door to the balcony is actually not a door but an half open window shower water changes from warm to cold unexpectedly breakfast is far below 4 star standard Parking is extremely expensive unlike other hotels which usually offer free or much lower cost for parking Though not very far to scenic spots it still needs a 10 20 minutes walk to the nearest one over all I don t think it is worthy for such a high room rate , big room with balcony they had a very good waiter serving during the breakfast smiling all the time and willing to help upon any of your request 
382545,Guitart Grand Passage, We had over bath shower It was difficult to get In And out of because shower panel opened near toilet and there was nothing to hold onto as the bar to help isn t placed very well, Room was clean and spacious
382546,Guitart Grand Passage, Various problems with the rooms booked by our group Not sure if the staff didn t know their jobs or didn t care This was not a language problem as we understood each other perfectly Many faults were reported by our group lights not working broken tap shower held up with a cable tie Nothing ever done about any of the problems and when reminded simply said yes we have a note of it Took nearly half an hour to check out as the member of staff couldn t get my card to work in the handheld card reader There was no problem with my card just that she didn t seem to know how to operate the machine She became fed up placed the blame with me and asked me to pay by another means as she couldn t take payment Eventually 25 minutes later another member of staff finally pushed the correct buttons and hey ho it worked fine No apology Kettle in the room but nowhere near an electrical socket so had to balance on the bedside cabinet Nespresso pods provided nothing else but no Nespresso machine No fault of the hotel but this is the financial commercial district of Barcelona fine for business but not a leisure trip , Large Junior Suite Comfortable Bed Nice sized bathroom 
382547,Guitart Grand Passage, We had a room on the first floor During the nights over the weekend there was quite some noise until long after midnight As a result it was not easy to fall asleep unless you are very noise resistant, Very kind and helpful personnel Excellent location with various stops from public transport bus metro Big comfortable rooms Very nice and big breakfast buffet 
382548,Guitart Grand Passage, Nothing , The executive room was great very spacious and all amenities The bed was very comfortable great after all the sight seeing The variety for breakfast was excellent Staff were friendly It was only a 10 minute walk through lovely streets to the metro It was very handy on the last day that they looked after our luggage so we could have a nice lust day prior to our flight 
382549,Guitart Grand Passage, The description on Booking com stated there would be a balcony but it was just a glassed area like a conservatory , The bedroom was massive Lovely and clean and a nice big bed
382550,Guitart Grand Passage, The breakfast was often stale and looked as tho it had been the same food from the day before Generally quite disappointed by the breakfast , Loved the whole experience All the staff and facilities were fantastic 
382551,Guitart Grand Passage, 80 ish style apartment Smells like old too In early May 17C outside 17C inside AC setup for summer No heating possible according to the receptionist Far from a pretended S hotel Apartment in close vicinity to an office room and a staff elevator are located or other machine from hell running from 6AM till midnight We asked specifically for a quiet room , Apartment s size was great Clean too 
382552,Guitart Grand Passage, Tea but no coffee in milk in room Tea was only replaced for a fee Kettle had no plug nearby so had to boil up in the bathroom Zip tie holding to shower head , Junior suite was lovely so large 
382553,Guitart Grand Passage, Every thing is fine in this h tel expect the room safe box It is available only if you pay a supplement This is not convenient and not usual for this class of h tel , Gr t h tel Spacious rooms
382554,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, Very nice hotel not fur away from downtown 10 minutes to the subway 20 minutes to Sagrada Familia Great design of hotel A lot of cafes restaurants and bars near the hotel 
382555,Guitart Grand Passage, Having to pay for the room safe Poor water pressure and shortage of hot water in the shower Thin walls hearing everyone s alarm clocks going off in the morning Lots of street noise Bed was comfortable until one of the wheels fell off in the night and gave me a shock Location was a bit too far from the centre for tourist attractions, The bed was comfy but one of the wheels fell off during the night and gave me a fright that wasn t pleasant at all The room was nice and spacious lots of closet space for a one week stay that was nice 
382556,Guitart Grand Passage, Breakfast management was poor Felt like being in the middle of an humanitarian operation after an earthquake , Everybody was nice there Very helpful staff Quiet spacious and comfortable room 9 2 10 would come again Bonus Try the sushi across the street Fantastic experience 
382557,Guitart Grand Passage, Because of all the traffic fumes lots of mopeds scooters and motorbikes it was not possible to keep the windows balcony doors open at any time As unfortunately in so many hotels insufficient lighting for makeup and shaving in the bathroom , Good location with many restaurants in the neighborhood Nice staff Elegant and spacious room Wonderful king size bed with two pillows person Lots of wardrobe space and hangers Good and plentiful breakfast 
382558,Guitart Grand Passage, Should renovate corridors Look very old and dirty and give bad impression of the whole hotel which in general is OK Location is little away from center or metro Would go again there , Very good breakfast Everything OK 
382559,Guitart Grand Passage, The room was not properly clean there was hair in the shower definitely need to be more careful on the cleaning standards, Great location comfortable and good sized rooms Very pleasant overall
382560,Guitart Grand Passage, It wasn t that close to a metro stop One day it thunderstormed and we had to be somewhere and apparently there were no taxis We had to walk 4 5 blocks in the downpour , I really enjoyed this hotel The location was great and we were able to walk to a bunch of places The room was spacious and full of light Breakfast was nice and offered much more than I expected 
382561,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, Excellent location modern fabulous rooms we were upgraded for free 3 families Staff went out of their way to make it pleasant especially Omar Sheshen It was my birthday they had bought in a cake for our group There s lots of short cuts to diagonal station so be aware as we spent 2 days using the long routes 
382562,Guitart Grand Passage, No drink making facilities in room , Friendly helpful staff They were happy to print off tickets for tourist attraction visits we had booked whilst there Lovely sized room Maid service everyday Good facilities in room e g hairdryer wardrobe space hangers Close to shops restaurants with a 10 minute walk to Diagonal metro station No issues with hot water 
382563,Guitart Grand Passage, Booking classed this as a luxury hotel SHAME ON YOU BOOKING COM This at best would be 3 star when being graded on luxury Only 1 plastic plug to use between sink bath and bidet Bath had holes which had been filled but the plug obviously didn t fit the anyway Luxury having a laugh The facitilities are none felt more like a apartment without tea or coffee in the room Will provide a kettle if you ask just take your own tea coffee etc Location is a good walk or bus ride to the centre not for people who aren t able to or don t enjoy a good stroll This hotel would be better classing themselves as an mini apartments providing kettle toasters few cups etc in rooms , The room sizes great Felt like an apartment Great big beds and very comfortable Choice of pillows plus extra bedding Nice bars cafes restaurants on doorstep Lovely area of Barcelona The rooms clean enough we found the public areas needed more attention to its cleaning Staff friendly professional manner although in the dining area not enough staff to be able to forfil their duties thoroughly The price of hotel is cheaper than others I would return without having breakfast Plenty of little cafes to grab some from Also knowing I m only getting a room with nothing else 
382564,Guitart Grand Passage, There was a mold in my bathroom ceiling Bed was clean but I couldn t be sure about other parts of the room Because hotel was a little old , I like the location of the hotel it was comfortable to stay for business Breakfast was fine 
382565,Guitart Grand Passage, Wider range for breakfast somewhat limited and repeative However good quality Crack in cabinet mirror in room also slightly disappointing , Overall really well presented hotel with good access for key tourist spots Clean and as per pictures provided 
382566,Guitart Grand Passage, acoustic is really bad you here all the noise from the street shower is old, good location to take a cab as it is not far from diagonal and the exiample good bed
382567,Guitart Grand Passage, Nothing really Would be nice if bay window could be opened and be usable as a balcony , Huge suite like room Floor to sealing window and bay window to see around the street corners Nice big bathroom with dual bathroom sinks his and hers Comfortable king size beds Near the center of tourist attractions but it is still a quite neighborhood 
382568,Guitart Grand Passage, No kettle for making tea coffee in room Not very near to and also difficult to find Metro from hotel Wifi not very good Shower over small bath , The bed was amazing and the room quiet so had a good sleep at night The shower was over a narrow bath so it was a bit tricky Breakfast was good but cooked food greasy and dry Coffee good Fridge Staff very friendly and efficient No one tells you about free tea coffee juice croissant in lounge in afternoon also wifi only allows 2 devices at a time unless you ask for another voucher which is free 
382569,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, We really loved our stay at Grande Passage Hotel the rooms were really spacious full of light and very nicely decorated with white and grey the location was very good too full of restaurants nearby we would recommend this hotel to every one and surely return back to our next trip in Barcelona 
382570,Guitart Grand Passage, The renovation was done but if you look closely you see the cracks and dirt It was not bad and some may not pay attention to that but we did Overtime it develop into a problem , Room was bright and had everything you need The interior was nice and towels were fresh every day If you like walking then the location is good as well There are very good eating places nearby Overall hotel was nice and I would recommend it 
382571,Guitart Grand Passage, Wasn t very clean no tea or coffee making facilities no complimentary water even for the cost if the room it was very basic and not somewhere I d stay again, Good location And a big room
382572,Guitart Grand Passage, Shower head was always twisted and water ends up on the floor making it very slippery , Hotel was in a central location and very clean staff were always helpful Wifi was excellent Our room had been renovated and it looked like they may have been going to start on the passages 
382573,Guitart Grand Passage, We were with a toddler who slept with us the beds were like 2 singles together our girl of course kept falling on the hole between the beds they should look into buying normal big beds , Location is great staff is fine they could be a bit more helpful room was great 
382574,Guitart Grand Passage, Our junior suite room 217 was quite badly lit and there were 3 bulbs missing which we reported Also the door to the iron board was jammed closed and would not open apart from this everything was good, The receptionist we had the most dealings with was extremely polite and helpful and even went to the trouble of printing out sheets for specific clubs and events and put them in our room when we were gone which we were very useful Ander was his name and showed great hospitality
382575,Guitart Grand Passage, Hotel had air condition problems and took 2 to 3 hours per day to complain then fix it any modification on room type was not possible so very poor service from booking com and so the hotel charged extra for no reason at all,No Positive
382576,Guitart Grand Passage, Floor corridor was not so nice as it should be for 4 hotel Carpet was dirty with some kind of red juice Next to our doors was closet or some kind of electric switchgear which was always opened also laundry trolley was always in front of our doors In bedroom was very large wardrobe but it was damaged In half of it there was no shelfs And the nails protruded , The room was pretty big spacious living room nice bedroom and very nic bathroom with large mirror Room was cleaning everyday The balcony was also amazing 
382577,Guitart Grand Passage, We came to breakfast 30 min before the end and the scrumbled eggs were really dried up The room especially bathroom were not completely clean spots in the corners and mirror But whole impression is still good, Stuff are really friendly the view from the balkony on 5th floor AMAZING room full of light we loved it
382578,Guitart Grand Passage, A swimming pool gym but considering the central location this might be difficult, Great staff lovely rooms and overall perfect spanish hospitality 
382579,Guitart Grand Passage, bedcloth is a little old the rooms also need renovation Safe in the room is 4eur night , Friendly Staff allowed for late check out great location however a little far from the sea Enjoyed our stay there good restaurants and sightseeing close to the hotel 
382580,Guitart Grand Passage, Hotel staff very unfriendly Room was not ready when promised Reservation said for 4 people and the room given initially was for 2 room was on 1st floor and the smell of tabbaco was horrible Sheets where not clean Pillows were like bricks horrible beds and sofa bed was very uncomfortable for the family Location was ok and some nice restaurants nearby for family dinning As other reviews the pictures of the hotel in this website are not what in reality are Noisy as some construction or remodeling on the hotel or nearby was during the day overall awful experience and do not recommend for the price of over 700 euros for 3 nights look elsewhere please , Nothing
382581,Guitart Grand Passage, The rooms are not like in the pictures very bad welcome we didn t had the room we booked instead of suite we got a double room personal are not helpfull at all the room wasn t clean when we arrived , Nothing 
382582,Guitart Grand Passage, No negatives , Excellent quiet safe location Close to transportation and walking distance from many restaurants and cafes Great full service 24 hour restaurant across street with excellent cooked to order breakfasts Friendly helpful staff Spacious comfortable rooms and large bedding with modern clean large bathrooms By European standards great price and would give 4 plus star rating Would definitely stay here again 
382583,Guitart Grand Passage, The restaurant for the breakfast is too small so sometimes you have to wait for a table and it is almost impossible to have a table for 4 , Very convenient location you can reach everything on foot Close to many shops and restaurants Very spacious room for a family of 4 compared to many other European hotels Nice staff 
382584,Guitart Grand Passage, House keeping service provided every day but room was not clear as all cabinets were full of dust also back of armchairs too , Breakfast was perfect staff was always helpful and smiley Room was very large and comfortable Towels were changing every day 
382585,Guitart Grand Passage, Lack of Hot water in the mornings , The room we stayed in was spacious and well lit Great location as we were only 20mins walking distance away from Catalunya Great Tourism links beautiful architecture 
382586,Guitart Grand Passage, Although we had a kettle and coffee machine there were no tea bags or coffee capsules the mini bar had a half drunken bottle of water in it and was never replenished the decor was tired the staff were young and prone to making mistakes such as giving other people our key and room number while we were still in it had to chase a group of young man out of our room which seemed to amuse the reception staff no idea what the breakfast was like because we were never told where or what time so not likely to return there are many hotels in Barcelona si no need to settle for incompetence, Location was handy for metro lines lots of good restaurants and bars nearby the room was big
382587,Guitart Grand Passage, No big luxurious reception area if that s what s important Hot water in shower in bath took forever to arrive wasting lots of water , Our room was 1st class with balcony Quiet area but close to everything we walked Barcelona from this Hotel for 2 15 got the bus back from the beach All the staff were just great 
382588,Guitart Grand Passage, The air conditioning was not working to point out though we did not notify the hotel until check out as we spent very little time in the hotel and the temperature was liveable Sleeping with an open window does not work if you are a light sleeper as the street is noisy The overall cleaning was not up to the standard especially in the bathroom Re bathroom we believe that the hotel has been is being renovated as the pictures were different from what we got Breakfast was not great and the facilities again not very clean even if this may depend on how sensitive one is , The room was huge A lot of space Bed was comfortable Pretty good location 
382589,Guitart Grand Passage, The room stated it had a Balcony It was not an Open Balcony to sit out on as it was all In closed as part of the room The Reception staff did not speak much English No Bar or Outside Space to go to and hang out Good hotel for Buisness Purposes only The Breakfast was till 10 30am but staff start clearing the breakfast bar at 9 45am Would not stay here again , The room was very spacious and clean
382590,Guitart Grand Passage, Cleaness, Most of the staffs are really nice and helpful Location is not very good It is too far from the Metro station but if you are familiar with the buses it is not a bad choice 
382591,Guitart Grand Passage, At the breakfast they only had this coffee machine with one choice of coffee A selection of special coffees maybe lattes or cappuccinos would be nice , This hotel s location is right on point The area is in a walking distance from La Ramblas but it s also a peaceful block filled with cute restaurants and caf s We were sent to another hotel for the first night but upgraded to a suite for the rest of our stay That was great Breakfast was good and the lady working at the breakfast room was the sweetest She even remembered my wish for a hot milk every morning 
382592,Guitart Grand Passage, The room wasn t clean enough It had the used soap clean close the sink All the gel and shampoo half empties in the bath The old wifi ticket of the previous guest I will go again to this hotel but it s a feedback to keep in mind to improve in the future , The beds The hotel have the best beds I ever tried so far in Barcelona of all my trips 
382593,Guitart Grand Passage, I asked for a request to be made to the room as it was my boyfriends birthday I wanted banners Etc in the room which I agreed to pay for in advance but there was no banners and no one apologised about this , Bed was comfy Best sleep I ve ever had 
382594,Guitart Grand Passage, It was slightly north of the centre but I didn t mind too much because it was 5 minutes from 2 stations and the area is lovely to walk around , Staff were incredible and so friendly The room we had was absolutely gorgeous and had everything we need 
382595,Guitart Grand Passage, Bed was poor Minibar didn t contain much and was not restocked Coffee machine breakfast area why not fresh in hotel was extremely slow Airco unit inadequate for size room , Room was large and great Staff helpfull friendly Wide choice breakfast 
382596,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, The rooms were spacious clean and well looked after It was a good idea to have the door separating the bedroom from the living room The hotel location was great only a short walk from Las Ramblas or only 7 euros in a taxi The hotel was only a 20 minute bus journey from the Camp Nou stadium Close to the metro station and bus links Staff were extremely friendly and really helpful when asking for directions to places 
382597,Guitart Grand Passage, Nothing I didn t like about the hotel there was a fair walk into the city but plenty of bars and cafes on the way nice walk Barcelona is very spread out anyway for the tourist attractions but the taxis are very cheap and easy to flag down , Spacious and clean rooms staff were also very helpful 
382598,Guitart Grand Passage, No kettle in the room Breakfast insufficient equipment for coffee or tea No gym facilities Asked room service for ice one evening and we were told we would have to go to the shop to buy some , Location and very comfortable beds 
382599,Guitart Grand Passage, Nothing , Wow what a room we had in this hotel It was huge and spacious and the bathroom was also massive The restaurants round about are all very nice and the hotel is located a few hundred meters from 2 or 3 metro stations and also about 100 meters from the bus stop perfect 
382600,Guitart Grand Passage, No response to the email I sent prior to my arrival regarding my reservation , Free breakfast buffet Staff very helpful and friendly Helped us booked reservation at restaurant Very central location Very spacious room 
382601,Guitart Grand Passage, The property could do with some serious renovation the rooms are basic outdated and many utilities don t function properly for example the air condition took 4 days out of 5 to fix The ambiance is dead boring no facilities other than a stuffy breakfast room in the basement serving a very poor choice The lighting in the rooms is more like a camp site really you better bring a torch Overhall it feels like a lazy and stingy landlord is in charge There are much better deals in Barcelona for this price ,No Positive
382602,Guitart Grand Passage, We had problems with the A C as this is an old building Also a leak in our shower wand The persons at the front desk were so helpful and bought a new wand for the shower and replaced it the next day They tried to help us with the A C and it did work a bit better but as I said it s an old building The staff made everything great , The staff were exceptional for greeting us and helping us with metro and getting to specific locations Nice hotel 
382603,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, Very nice hotel the apartment very cosy and spacious Close to the centre and everything The metro is close by walking The coffee in the morning was excellent We definetely enjoyed our vacation

382605,Guitart Grand Passage, The hotel charged my card twice for the room There was no reply to my request via their contact form on the website And now I need to waste my time with bank procedure of refund , Good location 
382606,Guitart Grand Passage, nothing to say all is ok, good location almost in centre but on quiet street big room with good panoramic view big comfortable bed friendly staff
382607,Guitart Grand Passage, as a couple we would prefer one king or queen bed instead of combining two standard beds , Great location a lot of nice restaurants around Very good value for a money 
382608,Guitart Grand Passage, I think the guest contact should be better We arrived after lunch and a member of staff told us that our room would be ready in 20min we chose to wait and settle instead of leaving the luggage on the locker It ended up being 40min of wait not with them letting us know or apologising just us constantly asking Another event was that the internet was down we needed that to buy tickets and plan also no feedbacks just us chasing them for it We got a triple room and the air conditioning power wasn t enough for the space Our room was facing the street it s a very busy noisy area at night which woke me up many times Overall very average for a 4 star hotel , Location is good the hotel is charming downstairs it s a small foyer but nicely decorated and cosy The rooms are much simpler though 
382609,Guitart Grand Passage,No Negative, The Staff were very helpful giving some info and a good suggestion of using touristic bus to see all the places in a limited time Everything was ok It was a good experience to stay at this hotel Next time if I go to Barcelona I will choose it again 
382610,Guitart Grand Passage, Internet wasn t working which was quite a problem for us as we depend on it so much but it wasn t the fault of the hotel Breakfast items ran out before we got there at around 9 00 am Extra fee for using the safe prefer to make it a deposit for return of key Suggest that reception has a decent map of where the hotel is in relation to key sites and tourist bus services , whole ambience lovely room and bathroom Plenty of space Liked the modern simplicity of the decor including the front entrance 
382611,Guitart Grand Passage, The bathroom basin drain was a little clogged Also bathroom fittings could be newer, The rooms were very spacious and nicely planned Staff was quite helpful and friendly WiFi was free Location of hotel was excellent a little away from all the noise but close to a lot of boutique stores Bus stop was just outside the hotel so transport was also not an issue Good cafes nearby 
382612,Guitart Grand Passage, Staff is the biggest problem They need a lot of training on dealing with guests with a smile, The hotel was very clean with a very good exposure to restaurants buses and entertainment The hotel area is very quite at night also The room was very well equipped
382613,Guitart Grand Passage, I did not like arriving at 15 30 being told by an arrogant receptionist that my room was not available and that I could come back after 16 00 No compensation was offered but I was informed that there was a cheap restaurant around the corner where I could have lunch , Very comfortable big room Wonderful bed 
382614,Guitart Grand Passage, There isn t anything i didn t like, It s a very nice hotel It looks beautiful and the rooms are big Nice bathroom good beds Wonderfull There are busstations everywhere so you can take the bus You re nearby Passeig de Gracia so you can shop 
382615,Guitart Grand Passage, Coffee machine broke for breakfast Breakfast over priced without coffee , Outstanding service at front desk
