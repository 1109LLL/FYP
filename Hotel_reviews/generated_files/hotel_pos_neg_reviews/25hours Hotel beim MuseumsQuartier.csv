370323,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier,No Negative, The thing that stands out the most about this hotel is how unique it is the styling decorations the rooftop bar the amenities were all very clever and well designed For the rooftop bar I really enjoyed the fancy drinks and the antiques scattered around it gave something for you to walk around and look at other than the amazing view I really enjoyed the bikes as well for 10 euro you can get a bike to ride for the whole day Surprisingly the bikes were actually very nice belt drive single speeds that were fast and light I actually got great exercise on them along the canal and also explored a decent amount of the city I also enjoyed the shop and fun free postcards they give you they are nothing special but a nice touch I never tried the restaurant but if the food was as good and as reasonably priced as the drinks at the rooftop bar then I am sure it is good For location I think it is good if you want to see the museums and not be too close to the main downtown It is a bit of a hike to get to the majority of bars and attractions near the canal but it is no problem if you are energetic or take the public transport Would go back for sure

370456,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Staff are very friendly BUT they need to be very well trained on costumer services 1 improper handling of an AC problem in one of the suits I was in 2 I actually checked in twice in the hotel In the second time I checked in at midnight and the room wasn t ready as I asked for an extra bed and they didn t place it In addition I asked 3 staff members 3 times to provide me with luggage stand and Didn t get it till I checked out 3 The staff are lack of word of mouth as I asked at morning if possible to have a late check out and I got a verbal approval then at desk they informed me it can t be done The hotel must improve the laundry service as I wanted to place two pieces for a top top urgent service during the weekend and they didn t take it and said it may takes until Monday evening to get it after my checkout , Beautifully designed hotel Nice shop Good location Friendly staff
370457,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, The bed had no headboard which was a little strange and no way to make tea or hot water in the rooms It s a busy hotel with a very hip bar upstairs but it brings in a lot of non guests that get confused which elevators to use , Close to the city especially the City Hall and all the museums right behind Hofburg so amazing location Parking available right across the street Clean plain rooms great for a short stay with nice bathrooms Cool weird theme to the rooms

370468,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Some of the staff at the reception and especially at the restaurant were passive aggressive It is not what you want to experience at a hotel We found the rules around payment for breakfast quite irrational During check in we had to commit to having breakfast everyday for a set fee otherwise we would have to pay 5 Euros extra per person per day for walk ins Having no idea how breakfast is like at check in it is absolutely an annoying choice a guest is asked to make We ended up paying more for the same breakfast Not what you want to experience at a hotel We stayed at the hotel twice our first room was quite small and it was difficult to move inside the room with multiple bags We were told it was one of the largest rooms and were then given a much larger room for our second stay , We liked the photo booth at the entrance We liked the food served for breakfast The gym room was quite interesting
370469,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, The a c in the room did not work as well as in the other hotels i ve been to and it was very loud Also i did not quite understand why there is a window that you can see the other person sittin on the toilet while you are lying in bed You could shut the window but still there was some holes in it , Most special hotel i have ever been to Everywhere you look youll find most wonderful details Loved the rooftop terrace and the performers there Very friendly staff Lovely atmosphere Short distance to go anywhere Good location

370472,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier,No Negative, One of the best hotels we ve ever been A lot of additional facilities in particular the spa gym area the rooftop bar and the restaurant Definitely worth the money
370473,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Room was far from elevators and reception There is and endless corridor from the entrance to the room It s a little expensive for the offered service in our opinion There aren t so many amenities in the bathroom Pillows are small and uncomfortable Room is small but enough for a couple of nights Bed is high but bedside tables are beneath the bed so it s difficult to reach your stuff , Hotel is nice and modern even fancy Great location we visited the city by walk There are some bikes that you can use in the front door They provide a UE Boom in the room and also a bag for your personal use while you are a guest Staff is nice Wifi works reasonably well Pet friendly

370477,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, My only complaint is the open bathroom I still do not comprehend why hotels think guests think it s cool to be able to see your friends and spouse in the shower or on the toilet , The hotel staff was great easy going and helpful The attitude was don t worry be happy and decor truly minimalist meets avant guard The terrace bar had awesome city views and the bar staff were awesome Although outside city center it was still a great location very close to museums hop on hop off stops good shopping streets and Cafe Eiles I d stay here again 
370478,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, The restaurant inside the hotel is very good but really biased toward italian food A bit expensive but value for money, This is a design hotel with a soul welcoming and very nice People are hospital and helpful The position is optimal being inside the Museum Quarter with a nearby Underground and Tram Also the city center is at walking distance The breakfast is gorgeous For families it is good to note that there is a small park with games just in front the hotel

370480,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Bed was very uncomfortable there were stains on the bathroom walls as well as under the bedroom window which were a bit off putting We were told we had a courtyard facing room but instead got one which backed onto a cobblestone road which was used for taking out rubbish empty glass bottles making for a very unpleasant wake up call each night around 2 3am , Hotel itself had a nice vibe the feature wall was lovely the rooftop bar had great cocktails and views and the location was very good 
370481,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Sorry nothing to say here even for the sake of improvement and definitely not anything for sake of complaint, This is the second time we stay here and will want to stay here every time we are in Vienna The hotel simply goes well with us like coming home I want to thank staff once again for making this stay perfect and my birthday memorable
370482,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Bed was too high pillows were way too soft The funny thing of this hotel is that the slightly more expensive city view rooms are too close to the hotel and bar entrance therefore it gets extremely noisy I like to sleep with a window slightly ajar and there was way too much noise from drunk patrons right until about 4am on Saturday On Sunday the cleaning stuff missed cleaning our room despite the fact that we were out from 9am to 4pm We came back for a quick nap and shower and THAT s when they wanted to clean It s a pity because otherwise this hotel is quite amazing they should work a little more on these aspects , Loved the decor and style of the room The bathroom shower was amazing The room had nice touches like they let you have a bag for the duration of your trip so you can carry things around Breakfast is very nice too Location is quite perfect not too close to the noisy center but near everything by short walking distance

370500,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Staff is terrible The team is extremely young and obviously badly trained At breakfast or on the rooftop terrace it is almost impossible to get them to serve you drinks At breakfast one member of staff spilled something on the floor wiped it with a wet cloth and did not bother to dry the area Minutes later an elderly man slipped on the area and could have been badly hurt The staff then proceeded to wet wipe the floor again and only dried it after I pointed it out Quite a few members of staff had such a limited knowledge of German that I could not understand what they were saying I am a native I understand that the hotels target audience is young but even at 27 years old I do like to be welcomed warmly as a paying guest , Location design comfort and breakfast are amazing 
370501,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Nothing, It s a fantastic place Centrally located so original in the decoration clean cool All very efficiently organized the food at the restaurant is excellent and the breakfast very generous and of very high quality There s a trendy bar on the top floor My girlfriends did not want to go because of the rap music but it looked great to me 
370502,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, I didn t like the bed at all pillow way too small like no pillow at all 2 single beds stuck to each other and 2 seperate single covers not queen or king but it was like this in the other 2 hotels in Austria as well So I guess this is their couple system , Staff were so sweet and helpful they let us check in around 10 AM I Loved the decoration of the rooms so funky and cool The location is awesome too close to the main historical and tourist attraction spots Breakfast buffet was OK nothing so awesome about it 
370503,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Our room was tiny No storage apart from 3 wall hooks A notice on the wall invited us to store our clothes in a suitcase under the bed Since there was very little floor space accessing our clothes was difficult No space for a chair in the room either which might have been okay if there had been any public spaces in the hotel for guests to relax read etc The bar on the top floor catered for a young non resident clientele and was too packed and noisy in the evenings for comfort When I took my book up there during the day to enjoy the impressive view across the city the staff were preparing for a function and I was asked to leave We had the impression the management of this hotel wanted the best of both worlds Big bucks from non resident clientele at the expense of relaxation and comfort for those who d paid to stay there We won t be going back , Location was pleasant and central Pizzas were good on the fairly limited restaurant menu

370526,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, Some of the staff can be very short and slightly what I as an American would consider Rude But this was only maybe 1 or 2 employees and not a representation of the staff as a whole , I have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and overall I really enjoy it Its close to the Subway The rooftop bar is a great place to start the night but wished it stayed open later the pizza at the 1500 restaurant is great but it would be nice to expand the choices I was also glad to see that the Spa is included now and not a 10 Euro add on as it was in the past Always nice and relaxing just remember its natural

370529,25hours Hotel beim MuseumsQuartier, I understand that the hotel is circus themed but silly decor like lampshades that hit you in the head because they are hung too low and carpet rugs that sit underneath the bed instead of protecting your cold feet from the floor are annoying Also I asked for a quiet room but we were 2 rooms away from the lift and there was a constant stream of people stomping down the corridor passed our room all night Make sure you ask for a room at the end of the corridor away from the lift Location is just that bit too far away from the main attractions We re very agile but by the end of the day the walk back to the hotel was a real killer , Buffet breakfast was extensive and included options that gluten intolerant people could eat The rooftop bar was uber cool and groovy We only discovered it on the last day unfortunately Bed was comfortable but the super heavy quilt was ridiculously hot Bathroom was roomy and functional The view from the window was beautiful It had snowed and the park Weghuberpark outside looked amazing
