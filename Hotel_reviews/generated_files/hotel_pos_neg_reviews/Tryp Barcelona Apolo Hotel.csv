279479,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The hotel is quite dated The room was adequate but also quite dated There was construction going on The online photos showed a huge gym facility but it s actually 2 blocks away outside the hotel Generally the experience was disappointing , Wewere going on to a cruise and the location relative to the port was convenient
279480,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, They lost our booking through you I had e mailed them that our trip had changed and we would only be there 1 night instead of two Pre paid for two of course I understood no refund but asked for maybe an upgrade to our room They found the reservation and agreed We would have a nice room It was no better that our two other visits In fact was smaller Construction going on for a remodel project Like the location and service but this time it was not good and would make me not go next trip to Barcelona, Good breakfast and location near old town Third stay there
279481,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, I m allergic to the dusty and immediately when I entered inside the room I smell it The carpet was partial distroyed A metal stick for the bath towel was broken and the shower was not in the best condition not worth for the price paid , The huge bed and the mirror behind

279487,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The smell of old smoke is everywhere I was first given a non smoking room but the stench in the hall was so bad that I was choking before I reached my room I then asked for a room on a non smoking floor while that hallway smelled better the room clearly has had smokers in it I decided they don t really have such a thing as non smoking rooms so stayed but wouldn t go back again for this reason alone D cor in halls and rooms is tired price was high considering standard of rooms , Breakfast was great and really good value for 12 euro Part of time attended a conference at hotel and lunches were fabulous really creative tapas type stuff Staff are lovely and helpful Location super short walk to La Rambla or waterfront and going the other way a short walk to a pedestrian street with many blocks of tapas restaurants

279513,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Absolutely it is not a 4 star hotel Hotel was so noisy because the building is so old and the equipments in the room was not like a 4star hotel since it is very common in Barcelona to charge much more than expectation as a 4star hotel they did not put boiler either tee or coffee in the room and asked us to go to the Apolo cafe and buy if we want after asking for kettle for 3times at the last night they put kettle in the room and wanted to charge us for 4 nights 18 5 euros just for kettle which we did not have time to use it for sure I did not pay for the unused kettle but I am so unhappy for hidden costs in Spain every where , Location is good

279517,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The bed was awful and really hard the bar was only open for a couple of hours in the day The price was quite a lot for this hotel , The location was very good and staff helpful 
279518,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Breakfast only ate there once stayed for 5 days though It s like a huge loud cafeteria where you sit in rows no privacy as your right next to each other Food not the best either They also recommended a restaurant to us which was just awful 4 other couples were also there from Tryp at the same time as us One couple walked out The other two complained about the food Wonder why it kept being recommended , Struggling to think really

279524,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, I am not sure how this hotel has received a 4 star rating The hotel is run down and needs a major renovation When you check in you have to pay at time of check in The front desk is very casual and not at all like a hotel The rooms on the street side are very noisy The bathrooms are old and need major renovation and rooms are old an tattered The carpet in hallways needs to be replaced You can stay at a much nicer hotel in a better location in Barcelona , The staff in the restaurant were very accommodating when requesting vegetarian food The location was a short walk to the pier
279525,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Limited choices of breakfast but enough to accommodate myself Would like a more fluffy omelette and baked beans would be highly appreciated Found a small bed bug in the room Also would be great to provide tour booklets in English from various tour providers and be able to purchase at the hotel , Staff service is excellent bed is comfortable and more than enough towels provided Cleaners have cleaned our room very well Location is second to none next to Trevi fountain and bus station

279528,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The beds are a little firmer than we like but after touring the sites all day it really didn t matter , We arrived in Barcelona 2 days before our cruise departure We chose this hotel because of its location to the cruise terminal It is about a 10 minute walk to the water and a 10min taxi to the cruise terminal It is also located within a short walk to the gothic area The metro stop is just a few minutes walk from the front door and was very easy to use to get around the city The staff was very friendly and helpful We are a family of 5 with 3 teenage children so they were able to accommodate us with a triple and double room right next to each other We asked for rooms at the back of the hotel so it would be quieter during the busy night hours The buffet breakfast was great As others recommended I too suggest you purchase the breakfast It is a great start to your day 
279529,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, I booked interconnected family room We were put in a very small cramped room without privacy for my husband and I my teenage daughters had to walk through our room to the bathroom The hotel made us wait until 7pm the second night to move to the room I had booked The manager didnt make any attempt to reimburse us for our inconvenience or our disappointment at having our holiday disrupted int this way , The position of hotel 
279530,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Was put in a smokers room when we do not smoke so everything smelt smokey and old When complained I was advised the hotel was full and to ask again the next day However we just 2 nights here it wasn t worth moving Pool booked this hotel on the basis it had a pool when arrived we were told this is not open due to a refurb after asking where it was We were advised to go to local pool but obviously we would have to pay for this , Good location

279537,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The hotel is starting to show it s age The beds and bathroom could use an upgrade , We liked the location because of it s close proximity to Las Ramblas It was about a 10 minute walk For 10 euro the full breakfast was very good 
279538,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, We have stayed at the Tryp Hotel in Berlin and thought it looked very similar in the images they show While this is true and the hotel lobby and lower levels are very funky clean and new This is not at all true for the remainder of the hotel The rooms are very old and very dirty and there is a stale smell in the air , Our stay was ok in the end but only because the staff were kind enough to offer us one of the prototype rooms for the hotel upgrade starting in September The breakfast was very nice and the staff were very helpful and happy to work to resolve any problems 
279539,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Room at the front of the hotel ridiculously noisy It was like there were no windows in I know it is on a main road but you would expect the windows to be triple glazed to take account Black out blinds didnt cover the full windows although it didnt matter because we couldnt sleep anyway because of the noise, Great breakfast Good sized family room
279540,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Mattress of the room was not comfortable Room service was poor Charge 6 for put kettle on your room, Just a few second to metro station Many bar and night club close to the hotel Good staff 10 min walk to the harbor Good location for leisure and young people
279541,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, The website reservation I thought I had made was for a 1300 per night room that had been discounted by 81 to 251 per night The room we received was what one could describe as an average hotel room with old fittings in the bathroom and worn carpet in the hallways As a Wyndham Privileges owner I would expect a much higher standard than was in evidence I feel I have been duped by false advertising and will be very wary of Booking com in future , The location of the property suited our purposes well and the breakfast buffet was excellent and offered a wide range of quality food both hot and cold 
279542,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Rudeness of the staff horrible Location and extra charge to use the fitness center false advertising of room very small , Nothing will never stay again
279543,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Really disappointed that this hotel still have smoking rooms The least they could do is put smokers all on the same floor to keep them away Some friends were given a smoking room and it stank I wouldn t have accepted it, Staff very friendly and helpful Great location for the metro and for concerts at the Olympic Park We were there to see Adele 
279544,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Bed was very uncomfortable Mattress was firm but had bulge in middle Staff in breakfast area was less than friendly , Location was ideal Walking distance to sights and shopping Registration and housekeeping staff were friendly and accommodating Concierge assistance was very good

279546,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Front desk not helpful and rude Room stated air conditioning but they only have airco in summer Bed uncomfortable pillow uncomfortable No way is this a 4 star hotel aesthetically or by service levels , Location
279547,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Euros 26 a night extra for upgraded room something of a rip off tea and coffee which should be provided in all rooms couple of bathrobes free not very well stocked minibar Not worth it And breakfast nowhere near as good as some reviewers seem to think Leak in bathroom ceiling Kettle wouldn t turn off and handle got much too hot to hold , Location good Room comfortable and clean 
279548,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, I was on the third floor and i could hear the noises on the streets srom early morning till late night a little pricey when not booked in discount times , Its close to the center and many other touristic places in barcelona very friendly and helpfull staff a big sellection in the breakfast buffet the room s size was perfect many food places and markets are near

279551,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Room 458 the windows didn t close fully so noise from the road kept us awake I think they need new seals On speaking to reception he said we should have complained and we would have been moved The point is they need to be sorted out , Best location 
279552,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, Came two hours before check in they said the only rooms that were available at that time were 25 Euro more a night When checking out they literally used the word upsell to describe what happened during my check in experience Not sure if this is a matter lost in translation but if you are looking for a budget option I would be wary of upselling here ,No Positive

279554,Tryp Barcelona Apolo Hotel, the half board evening meal was not very good but the reception staff cancelled it for us even though it really wasn t their job to do so and the hotel should invest in a plate warmer if they intend to continue serving English bacon and egg breakfasts as by the time you got it back to the table it was cold these are not complaints merely suggestions to improve and already excellent hotel, the staff in reception were faultless the rooms were kept in excellent order by the very cheerful young lady who looked after them the breakfasts were very good with a wide selection of goodies to suit everyone
