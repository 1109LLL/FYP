462866,The Savoy, No shelves or space in the bathroom for my own cosmetics make up etc Laid them out on toilet seat Windows didn t open , The bed was amazing very large and comfy Loved the extra little touches like the fruit delivered to the room dressing gowns and slippers All the staff were very helpful and efficient but also very friendly and approachable Great location 
462867,The Savoy, Low flexibility with regards to check in out timing House keeping in guest room needs improvement carpet vacuum and removal of dust Attentiveness of staff whilst serving breakfast needs improvement not delivering portions of order rendering reminders by guests Verbal English skills of house keeping staff , Flexibility of chef towards children s food order Concierge services Quality and presentation of food Proximity to supermarket s Proximity to Pharmacy Proximity to Covent Garden restaurants 
462868,The Savoy,No Negative, We loved the ambience of the lounge the high tea afternoon tea Amazing check in experience and a birthday surprise in the room Lovely staff and great atmosphere 
462869,The Savoy, As guests we were disappointed to be unable to have afternoon tea as fully booked A lot of new staff seemed to be training When they served coffee with the evening meal instead of serving around the table we were asked to pass it around Just a small thing but can make a big difference on service We did not let this spoil our stay , Super food with excellant choice Staff make you very welcome and comfortable 
462870,The Savoy, The only problem was we had problem with money withdrawl from the hotel but was sorted , The property was lovely it has so much history towards it and it was clean spacious welcoming and well structured regarding the hotel facilties and staff The Americano bar was so lovely to finish the night off and they were so lovely regarding our birthday celebration with card and treat in the room 
462871,The Savoy, I find nothing to fault, The staff were superb from the moment of arrival every single member from the door to the room restaurants bars to concierge were superb 
462872,The Savoy, I had to send my steak back in Kaspers I d asked for medium rare and it wasn t They did bring another one which was only a little better , Breakfast was very good Kasper s was quite good
462873,The Savoy, The only thing we did not like was being asked to wait outside to collect our bags which the hotel stored after we checked out The service was great But having to wait while cars were arriving and crowds were exiting the theatre did not align with our experiences at other hotels of a similar standard , A peaceful oasis in the centre of London which has retained it s character The hotel has everything you need and provides good value The service is impeccable and all the team are helpful This was our first stay at the Savoy and we will definitely return 
462874,The Savoy, All OK, Stayed there before and so enjoyed the Savoy that we stayed there this trip It was excellent There was a slight problem with the toilet and it was fixed immediately The room was comfortable and a good size 
462875,The Savoy, Nothing, Wow what a hotel me and my wide celebrated our first wedding anniversary at the weekend We had a balcony with a view across the city and the Thames The hotel staff were amazing and so friendly they really made our stay that extra special If you want the real class of a London hotel than the Savoy wins hands down
462876,The Savoy, Everything was wonderful Nothing to dislike , Where do I begin Everything was wonderful This is the second year in a row I and guests have stayed at the fabulous Savoy Hotel The decor is beautiful the food delightful and tasty and the location is perfect being in Westminster on the Strand within walking distance to several major attractions including Covent Garden Big Ben The Houses of Parliament Trafalgar Square the London Eye and others The service is outstanding the best of any hotel or establishment I have ever been to and there have been many The whole staff from the top hat and tailed door men to the concierge to the senior establishment to the maid service were all amazing They were respectful and friendly and made you feel like royalty Smiles abound and there isn t anything reasonable that they won t do for you I could go on and on We were offered a room upgrade to the most amazing beautifully decorated 2 room suite with enormous windows that had close views of the River Thames Big Ben the London Eye and to the east and west The views were amazing in the day time but at night when everything was lit up it became a stunning wonderland We enjoyed staying in the sitting room at night with tea and chocolates courtesy of the Savoy s on premises chocolatier shop The atmosphere was magic and so lovely Even if you don t have a room with a view from what I can tell all the rooms are attractive and lovely My sister and I can hardly wait to make a return visit to our favorite hotel 
462877,The Savoy, They were overly commercialized for the fame They offered a free upgrade which was unacceptable quality Then they offered better room with charged upgrade of 495 UK pounds which I did not accept I paid 1200 UKP per night but the value was less then 600 UKP compared to Ritz Paris Staff mindset was arrogant even though pretend they were not and motivated to sell upgrade room with a fee I suspect owners are giving pressure to staffs I will never go to Savoy again in my life I was there two times in the past and quality was certainly deterioratong , Fame and History
462878,The Savoy, room was quite small and felt cramped, very comfortable bed not usually a fan of combination shower bathtubs but this one was clean and quite comfortable for a bath Room service was quick and food was excellent

462882,The Savoy, I have hoped that the noise from outside wouldn t disturb our sleep but it did Garbage and other trucks came every morning from 06 am backing up making that beep beep sound and on Saturday the glass recycling truck came at 09 00 am making a terrible noice , Great hotel and great location Very friendly and welcoming hotel with very good variety of restaurants and drinking facilities Top notch Clean spacious and well equipped rooms Lovely bathroom with a very good shower not common in London Very friendly staff We are very happy and would stay here again if we get the chance

462898,The Savoy, We stayed at the savoy hotel in the midst of a very busy festive season and everything was to our liking the hotel and all staff are second to none A mixture of wonderful personalities every member of the hotel was extremely outstanding which made our stay special and overall a great job has been acheived here , The ambiance of the savoy was second to none the staff were beautifully amazing my family thoroughly enjoyed there stay over the Christmas weekend we went to the savoy to celebrate my 7 month grandsons first Christmas It was truly wonderful and everyone at the hotel responded to my beautiful grandson romeo We will definately return this year

462906,The Savoy, Savoy Grill now Gordon Ramsey not run by The Savoy less impressive this time seemed to be more tables i e more money for them and food and service less memorable , 2nd visit to The Savoy Everything top notch 
462907,The Savoy, Bit costly but worth it The Screaming child in the Grillroom should be child free so the other paying adults can enjoy their meals , Everything great Hotel lovely rooms good bars and restaurants and very few children 
462908,The Savoy, Room was nothing special bathroom was disappointing My wife and I wanted to use the sauna and steam room in the spa together as you do but these are available in male and female changing rooms only Breakfast was only ok room was only ok I previously stayed at The Ritz in an equivalent room and everything about our stay was better I would not stay at the Savoy again and I d go back to The Ritz Disappointing is the only word I would use to describe our stay , Location
462909,The Savoy, The only thing I was disappointed was about the size of the room I thought our room would be bigger as like on the website However on arrival we were told as I requested twin beds there wasn t a room with a city view river view available but yet I did book this in February this year and as my request was acknowledged at the time of my booking I would of expected a room with the better view I also felt the room was smaller than the deluxe rooms advertised on the website , We stayed here as part of a birthday celebration for my daughter The hotel made it extra special by way of leaving a birthday treat in our room in readiness for our arrival This was a lovely surprise for my daughter We were made very welcome from the moment we arrived and all were very accommodating throughout our stay 
462910,The Savoy, It didn t bother us much but there is a hair on one of the soap dish As we both have dark hair unfortunately we could easily tell the hair doesn t belong to us It was tiny light coloured hair so probably just missed , Friendly attentive staff from beginning till the end We got upgraded which was also nice surprise we liked reading a little history about the room and the guest who stayed there as a resident The suite was very spacious and elegant and the bed was the most comfortable bed we ever slept on Very memorable stay and we enjoyed every moment Thank you 
462911,The Savoy, Buying a Christmas ornament from the gift shop which was taken off the shelf not from behind the counter Shame to end on a bad note waiting for our bags that were supposed to be bought down from our room Waited half an hour asked 3 different people and resulted in missing our transport , All a pleasant experience from the bed to the interior 
462912,The Savoy, The room was very disappointing as ordered junior suit with river view Whilst river view was lovely room was quite small with only 1 chair and no facility for having breakfast in room No floor length mirror in room Also having paid a lot of money for room we were charged 1 60 for Sunday papers which we thought was appalling Dinner dance Saturday evening very disappointing as venue was poor due to constant coming and going to and from bar and main restaurant Didn t like music and had to wait long time between courses, Location is very nice for theaterland
462913,The Savoy, Breakfast at Simpsons on the Strand was disappointing although the food was ok the service and the staff did not reflect the same standard as The Savoy Beds not turned down in the evening and no fresh bottles of water after the 1st night , Junior Suite was very good spacious with everything catered for beautiful Christmas decorations in lobby and restaurant areas

462918,The Savoy, Ate in their Restaurant Simpsons in the Strand which was poor Service was not good we weren t offered the specials of the day nor the pre theatre menu food was very average and it seemed like they couldn t get rid of us quick enough Did actually question whether they were part of the Hotel , The staff were just fabulous extremely attentive Rooms are well appointed really comfy beds Nespresso coffee machine bottled waters plentiful Breakfast was excellent so much choice American Bar worth a visit wonderful Cocktails and a great bar team Savoy Grill great food choice and service definitely need to book any of the restaurants particularly the afternoon teas Concierge extremely knowledgeable He managed to get us some great theatre tickets at very short notice

462935,The Savoy, Convoluted passageways to reception could be easier to follow with better signage A couple of slightly firmer pillows would be nice All were very soft , The rooms were quiet The staff were all particularly friendly and helpful 
462936,The Savoy, the staff in the breakfast room where we asked for a window view and they aaid it wasn t available and it was empty juat needed table to be cleared , The window view over looking the London eye and the butler service Richard was very helpful and friendly 
462937,The Savoy, I would not recommend rooms on the 9th floor as there was a loud buzzing emanating from the aircon system that would disturb light sleepers or people with sensitive hearing , The Staff we all excellent very courteous and obliging we asked to change our room which was done without any fuss this was because we were experiencing noise from the air conditioning from outside the room 
462938,The Savoy, How is it possible for a 5 stars palace recently redone to still have toilettes in the bathroom , Great location Great Staff Great restaurants and bars Very high end in every details except for toilettes in the bathroom

462949,The Savoy, Alllllllllll good breakfast was amazing and the staff too , Just an amazing place we were treated like kings and I can t recommend enough for anyone wanting to sample this sort of lifestyle 
462950,The Savoy, the reception area felt more like a business interview rather than check in Not much of an atmosphere in the general public areas , Turn down with bottled water Concierge were great 
462951,The Savoy, Unrealistic expectations that have been set with our children with regards to the type of lodging they want to stay at on future trips, We do not usually stay at hotels of the caliber and price range of The Savoy for our family vacations We decided to splurge and were rewarded with a truly memorable stay The staff were attentive friendly and made us feel that they knew us personally The family room was stylish and well appointed and the beds were very comfortable We arrived at the Savoy early in the day Our room was understandably not ready but we were able to check in and drop off our luggage Upon our return later in the afternoon our room was still not ready but we were taken to a temporary room by a very apologetic manager and offered complimentary dinner at Kaspar s which was not necessary but much appreciated nonetheless Afternoon Tea in the Thames Foyer is an experience that should not be missed Our children loved The Savoy so much that they wrote a thank you note to the manager and staff describing in detail how much they enjoyed their stay You really had them won over with the Black Cat stuffed animal on their bed Thanks for making dad look awesome 
462952,The Savoy, The Savoy Grill My wife constantly being knocked without apology by the staff When we swapped chairs and told the waiter why it still continued but was my turn Food was good but wished we d chosen Kaspers the other restaurant ,No Positive
462953,The Savoy, Loud rude gang of lads in the American bar swearing and messing the staff about The smart casual dress code should be better enforced throughout the hotel , Staff are brilliant Hotel areas are exactly what you expect Breakfast in Kaspars is great just choose anything it s all good 
462954,The Savoy, As above with Wifi Also the receptionist who checked us in was really friendly on that day but when I saw her the following morning she ignored me when I said hello , We had an amazing stay only downside was the Wifi we could only access it in the Lobby area Could not get a signal on my phone either Other than that highly recommend 
462955,The Savoy, Absolutely nothing The stay was faultless , Luxuriously furnished rooms with excellent facilities All the staff were friendly helpful but none obtrusive Food first class 
462956,The Savoy, Breakfast was nicely presented but style over substance cooked breakfast was quite dry and a bit of a let down and really not worth the extra cost Also 3 for a kit kat from the room fridge 50 for overnight parking , Great location lovely bedrooms
462957,The Savoy, Breakfast is nice but rip off pricing terrible view no view basically bed unusually high and firm broken iron quickly replaced not much else to criticise really , Lovely shower great pillows decent wifi fantastic rib eye steaks ordered twice in four days very nice Malbec wine excellent staff as always nice touches like addressing you by name bumped into Sir Tom Jones again 
462958,The Savoy, Nothing, The Art Deco design of the bedroom The mattress and pillows were superb The staff were very helpful and very proud of the building and history 
462959,The Savoy, Nothing, Completely met my expectation in every way Attentive staff wonderful service a real feeling that you are important to them irrespective of the level of room you are staying in
462960,The Savoy, it s a bit expensive, I ve stayed at the Savoy several times and the service is consistent The staff is very friendly and goes out their way to accommodate any needs one may have They are very willing to go above and beyond and do not rest on their laurels I am always impressed with the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff and hotel every person on the staff takes ownership of any need the guests may have I have stayed at The Shangri La and the Corinthia in London and the Savoy continues to outshine them with the friendliness and attentiveness 
462961,The Savoy, Staff attitude Phones not working Cold dirty water in the showers , Constant problems with showers cold water Phones in the room not working Staff completely ignorant to the complaints 
462962,The Savoy, Having the cost of wifi as an extra at such a superb hotel this should be in with the booking , The hotel is extremely comfortable and so central for every where in London All the staff very courteous as you would expect from such a fabulous hotel We booked for my partner s birthday and was surprised to have a lovely slice of chocolate cake delivered to our room It was delicious 
462963,The Savoy, We booked a king room Whilst we had a king sized bed the room itself felt rather small The room was tastefully decorated but lacked any wow factor, What sets this hotel apart is the service Staff were helpful courteous and couldn t do enough for guests Bars are sumptuous and the hotel is very clean 
462964,The Savoy, House alarm fire went off briefly at 4 00am was a rude awakening , Excellent attentive staff best of class Comfortable spacious room and bathroom 
462965,The Savoy, Everything was charged and added on Most hotels have complimentary bits and pieces Even a fresh pot of tea at breakfast was charged Room was quite small and stuffy , We went to the Savoy Theatre so excellent location Staff charming but didn t see anyone twice

462968,The Savoy, Couldn t have a drink with 14 year old boy dressed smartly in the American Bar at 6 30pm on Friday evening I feel the staff should have discretion If it s an adult crowd I can accept a 14 year old s presence might not be appropriate but that certainly wasn t the case ,No Positive
462969,The Savoy, The price of some of the items in the mini bar , Made to feel special from the moment we approached the building service and attention to detail exceptional 
462970,The Savoy, Unfortunately due to flooding from heavy rain the night before our stay the hot water pumps were damaged and therefore for our 24 hour stay no hot water was available throughout the entire hotel, Ambience location excellent Lunch in Kaspar s was very good Room bed very comfortable 
462971,The Savoy,No Negative, Just excellent all round we have stayed in many hotels in London This is the best hotel we have stayed in From now on we will only use this hotel for our trips to London 
462972,The Savoy, Meals in Savoy grill and Kaspars nowhere near as good as expected Burger in Kaspars was returned as it was cold Both mornings could not use pool due to chemical In balance in water On both occassions water not tested until after we arrived just after opening time , Beautiful room staff very pleasant

462978,The Savoy,No Negative, I booked The Savoy Hotel on behalf of my Aunt and Uncle for my Uncle s 70th birthday The feedback from them was that the staff couldn t do enough for them and there was even a cake in the room for my Uncle s birthday

462981,The Savoy, A little too hot in the rooms Even when turning down the cooling system I had to sleep with a heavy duvet on a May s night Moreover I had a room at the 7th floor with an amazing view on the Thames River but couldn t open the window to take a glassless picture probably safety issues , Besides that everything is perfect at the Savoy hotel Most kind staff ever seen gorgeous rooms incredible bed Not to mention the drinks at the american bar 
462982,The Savoy, Bathroom could have been a little wider to accommodate a full size bath , Meet greet service was very personal Service with a huge smile at breakfast

462985,The Savoy, Only negative was it went too quick, Made to feel welcome and comfortable by all the staff bed was like sleeping on a cloud great overall experience made it a birthday I will remember always
462986,The Savoy, We had a room in the 2nd floor on the Carting Ln side of the building There is a kind of logistic centre DHL in this street It also seems to be the main access for delivery trucks and waste disposal for the hotel The noise after 6am in the morning also Sat Sun felt like sleeping next to a recycling lot We were actually too lazy to ask for a room change and just lived with it However noise sensitive people should definitely ask for a room on the other side of the building I also think that a hotel of this standard 700 room night should make the investment in modern window insulation in areas where noise from outside is unavoidable , Great location excellent breakfast very friendly staff
462987,The Savoy, The food at the Savoy grill was pretty good but not great or unique It was also very expensive , Service and staff friendly warm and impeccable Luxurious digs Delicious breakfasts loved the flakey choloate croissants as well as all other breakfast items Wonderful gift and chocolate store A tray of fruit and choloate was sent to our room twice Great area in the heart of must see tourist attractions as well as excellent shopping areas Staying at the Savoy was what made my experience in London so wonderful

462992,The Savoy, Nothing , The staff was very nice and super attentive Lucas was especially helpful as we had been traveling several weeks already and had lots of bags that were pretty heavy He even told us where to go to purchase an inexpensive extra suitcase In fact he offered to go pick it up as well When we checked out he made sure the office knew when to prepare our bill and the doorman when to get a cab Tony the doorman was super friendly and great as well 
462993,The Savoy, Being honest felt it was a little over priced compared to other hotels in London Beds far too high Told towel shortage for pool due to hotel being full and backlog at laundry which I wasn t expecting for the price , Staff were fantastic and location perfect for our visit Breakfast amazing Smoking room a bonus 
462994,The Savoy, Wifi was not as readily available throughout hotel as you would have thought for a 5 star hotel, Food was delicious cocktails very tasty and very well presented rooms were spacious and very comfortable

462999,The Savoy, mistake on breakfast to the room which did not happen They apologised profusely outlook of room was poor but that was incidental as the hotel was fabulous , We loved all of it 
463000,The Savoy, We were taken to our room on check in to find it was still occupied by the previous guests A very basic error unworthy of the Savoy The hotel had lost some of its character and charm and seemed focussed on maximising their share of my wallet rather than focussing on giving us a memorable experience The prices in the American bar were ludicrous and the my 7 year old grandson could have played better than the resident pianist The Super King Luxury room wasn t really No more than adequate and very expensive , The hotel was clean and immaculate The Savoy Grill was excellent Breakfast was good although the room needed a maitre d 
463001,The Savoy, The Grill restaurant was a bit disappointing The staff was not as attentive as at the hotel and the food was too salty , The staff is very attentive and welcoming particularly towards the children My son was over the moon with his new friend the cat Breakfast was excellent The hotel has very comfortable beds for those with back problems not too hard and not too soft The location is ideal for theatre going as well as other tourist attractions

463003,The Savoy, We had a shock at the price of a Blue Angel cocktail at 50 The prices weren t on the menu so you didn t know until the bill arrived but it s the Savoy the cocktail was served with flare and gold dust Would I order it again Yes I m glad my wife ordered the drink she wanted because she wouldn t have if she knew the price beforehand , We stayed for one night to celebrate my wife s 40th We were treated like royalty with a room upgrade two surprise birthday cakes and cards for the wife and complimentary champagne from a member of staff who was also celebrating their 40th The staff couldn t do enough for you and we re truly superb 
463004,The Savoy, Wheel chair access is made difficult by the age of the building and better facilities for such access could have been achieved when the hotel was recently refurbished As it was my wife had to be wheeled around the service passageways to get to the terrace restaurant and the american cocktail bar She also had to sleep in an armchair because the bed was too high for her to climb into notwithstanding provision of a stool to assist her Even I at 6ft tall didn t find it exactly easy to get into bed , The staff were truly excellent and attended to my wheelchair bound wife s every need without needing at any time to be asked Of particular note was the young spanish lady at reception the doorman and the waiter who served us at an afternoon tea to celebrate my wife s 70th birthday We both loved the room and the views over the Thames We particularly appreciated the valet parking arrangement which was reasonably priced 
463005,The Savoy, Could only afford to stay 2 nights Breakfast is a la carts so you don t get to choose exactly what you eat Went for room service second day which was great , Everything done at such a great level of detail 
463006,The Savoy, No free wifi no reflection on The Savoy at all as it is now a Gordon Ramsey restaurant Don t bother with the The Grill disinterested dismal service disappointing food Stay in the American Bar instead , Amazing staff They did everything to make it very special Outstanding service and welcome We were even found a table for tea even though it was all booked up Fabulous tea too and all were very attentive It made my sister s birthday because they were so genuinely lovely Fabulous room and river view Yes it is pricey but it was totally worth it We loved it

463009,The Savoy, It cost so much , Despite what I have read in the past I found the staff very helpful and keen to help They weren t snooty just very proper in their manner 
463010,The Savoy, Nothing to report , An anniversary stay in which we thoroughly enjoyed The food facilities and cleanliness were above satisfactory We were made to feel relaxed and welcomed by friendly helpful staff Highly recommend and would return again 
463011,The Savoy, The queen superior room was a little bland with doors to the outside balcony being very shabby For the Savoy this was very surprising It was not so clear from the internal documentation within the room what was on offer from the hotel this could do with modernising and or making more obvious with perhaps an interactive nature We are now in the new world of apps , Layout of the lower area was exceptional bar and meal areas were also fantastic with the breakfast being exceptional All staff were very helpful and polite apart from the night staff 
463012,The Savoy, The Grille room was disappointing Noisey and tables too close to each other There was issues with service such as presenting deserts not at the same time The Grille room is not a fine dining restaurant I understand it is leased to others and not managed by the Savoy , Staff and general appointment of the building 
463013,The Savoy, We ate elsewhere as booking for evening dinner was only evailable very late in the night Breakfast was very expensive so again we dined out Browns of St Martins Lane did a complete breakfast for 10 10 and was very acceptable , The warm welcome from the commissionaire and the helpful staff Being able to see the river and the snug warm comfort of the room and fitments and fixture The bathroom shower and wash basin were of the expected standard and the whole was comparable favourably to our last stay before the facelift took place 
463014,The Savoy, A better view from the room would have been an added bonus however we appreciate the City location offers limited aspects Consequently the characteristics are dominated by the might of The Capital , Our short extremely enjoyable stay was thoroughly enjoyed The perfect location in all aspects The breakfast s in Kaspers were outstanding Room service was perfect 
463015,The Savoy, Our room overlooked an area where the lorries delivered early morning and as we live in the countryside we did find it irritating , Everything Kaspars restaurant is a great place in which to dine breakfast lunch or dinner The food is delicious the wines excellent and the staff are very welcoming The American bar too is excellent very knowledgeable and friendly staff plus having live piano music 
463016,The Savoy, The only issue can be getting a table in the restaurant or the Thames foyer they can be extremely busy so notice is required , I love everything about this hotel the staff the service the style It s our favourite London hotel 
463017,The Savoy, Breakfast not very warm bread used for toast too thin and too many different waiters Dealing with us Found the afternoon tea poor have experienced your tea 2yrs ago and was not impressed Not at the same standard , The room comfortable
