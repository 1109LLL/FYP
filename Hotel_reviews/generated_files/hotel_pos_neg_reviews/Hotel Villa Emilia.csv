292257,Hotel Villa Emilia, Should be good to have an early check in After night flight we had to wait 6 hours with a child at the reception , Very clean cozy hotel Friendly staff 
292258,Hotel Villa Emilia, For a 4 boutique hotel the staff was not very personal Reception is a little secluded and no one really pays attention when you enter Also it was a bit too far from the center for my taste and definitely missing a rooftop pool , Coffee hour at the rooftop was a nice touch 
292259,Hotel Villa Emilia, No cooked breakfast offering unless you boiled your own egg Was offered scrambled egg on last morning which I gladly accepted probably worth asking for anything you fancy Good quality cold meats selection cheese and excellent bread but some sliced tomatoes or salad things to go with it would be good , Adequate breakfast offering fresh orange juice Cava wine also on offer if you really must Great coffee Good quiet A C and comfy beds Close to Metro Super helpful English speaking staff 
292260,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Comfortable bed and pillows great food and fun rooftop bar This hotel is classy and reasonably priced In great neighborhood close enough to walk or metro to various sites 
292261,Hotel Villa Emilia, Nothing in particular It s true that it s about a 20 minute walk to the centre but Barcelona is such a fantastic city to walk around that it isn t a problem In any case there is an underground station around the corner , Excellent reception staff comfortable room and wonderful rooftop bar it s well worth trying their barbecue in the evening great value for money Would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return 
292262,Hotel Villa Emilia, There is nothing we didn t like, The rooms were clean trendy and the beds were nice and comfy The bathroom was perfect and location was great Eixemple district has so much more going on that first meets the eye 9Reinas is an amazing restaurant nearby if you like steak wow The breakfast the hotels was really lovely and most of all the customer service is 5star the staff are a credit to the hotel oh and the free coffee and cake on the terrace on the 7 floor between 5 7pm is a lovely touch especially if you have been walking around all day WELL DONE EVRYONE THERE 
292263,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Great location Very close to the metro station and to the bus station Has good connections to all major objectives The staff was very polite and helpfull 
292264,Hotel Villa Emilia, Only suggestion would be extra hanging space in room, The whole experience The cleanliness the room faced the street but was extremely quite Staff were very obliging friendly The zinc bar terrace bar were excellent 
292265,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Eat in and had their BBQ which was very poor and expensive for what one received and the service was bad plus I had 2 Business Associates from Barcelona with us and they were not impressed so all 4 of us were very disappointed 
292266,Hotel Villa Emilia, No balcony but not a big deal , We were first drawn to the restaurant when we stayed at a nearby hotel The food was great and so was the service We realized that it was also a hotel so when we went back to Barcelona after a trip to France we booked Villa Emilia The hotel is also fantastic We enjoyed the welcome drinks and tapas at the rooftop bar Great ambiance and terrace setting 
292267,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Great location close to public transport Helpful staff nice good terrace and excellent breakfast as well as free coffee and snacks in the late afternoon 
292268,Hotel Villa Emilia, The view was a bit of a let down , The staff where extremely friendly and helpful They went out of there to make us feel welcome and to help Great food and activities around the hotel 
292269,Hotel Villa Emilia, Told no availability by Hotel yet was able to book via booking com Contacted them to asked for extra bed took 2 days to reply Confirmed extra bed on arrival was told no problem yet still had to request it from Housekeeper The view from room disappointing , The Food Beverage Staff particularly Pedro who went out of his way to chat to us suggest good places to go and make us feel welcome Reception staff a bit cold could be more helpful Contacted the Hotel prior to visit and they took a long time to respond 
292270,Hotel Villa Emilia, Emailed twice because our overnight flight got in at 7am Was assured they would do their best to get us in a room as early as possible When we arrived at 8am the young woman at the desk told us no one had checked out of a high quiet room as we requested and she didn t think she could get us into the room until at least 1pm or more likely 2pm their check in time No offer to contact us when the room was ready just waved us goodbye We trooped back six hours later absolutely exhausted and unhappy and we re given a mid level room next to a stairwell Not what we requested and not what we waited for NOT customer service oriented or particularly friendly or welcoming , Room was spacious and comfortable
292271,Hotel Villa Emilia, The room facilities were minimal no complementry water no electric kettle in the rooms for making tea or coffee The staff were not so friendly actually gave a short answer to every question or guid you wanted The breakfast was ok , The lobby and the zinc bar is very exciting The smell of the candles in the lobby is also great but going up to the rooms after you have seen the lobby might be a bit of dissappointment The metro station is just a few walks from the hotel and this helps alot There is also a small super market near the hotel 
292272,Hotel Villa Emilia, The weekend live music performances Thursday to Saturday at the bar restaurant area are quite loud The space is small and the volume too high We had to go elsewhere for dinner on our last night because of the noise The restaurant changes its menu every three days which is the average length of a weekend getaway Thus you end up having the same menu every night Fortunately there are plenty of restaurants in the area to chose from , Very helpful staff nice lobby and bar restaurant area Rooms quiet and comfortable Excellent location Nice breakfast and fast wi fi We tried the hotel restaurant for both lunches and dinners and we were perfectly happy with the quality Some restaurant staff do not speak English which creates some challenges A beautiful hotel and definitely will return back

292275,Hotel Villa Emilia, Traveled in February the room and the lobby are extremely hot and stuffy Very uncomfortable to sleep at night Asked if there is a way to put air or fan on was told that no air and no fan can be put on at this time The front desk suggested I keep the window open which is a ridiculous comment since the window has no screen and keeping the window open and drapes closed would not help the situation Very uncomfortable at night , Good location friendly and helpful stuff

292291,Hotel Villa Emilia, The doors of other rooms were closing with slam in the mornings and always waking us up , The atmosphere was magical the location was great the staff were very friendly and helpful the hotel has locker room for the luggage
292292,Hotel Villa Emilia, The room was far too warm and I had to keep the window open in November at night in order to be able to sleep The A C was not working and after asking I was informed that the hotel switches it off in the cold season However when the unusually warm weather makes the temperature in the rooms uncomfortable they should put the A C back on Another issue is that I could clearly hear some noise from the elevator engine every time it was used apart from that the room was rather quiet , The hotel is located in a quiet residential area the staff were always kind and professional Room and bathroom of good size bed mattress and pillows really comfortable Very good breakfast with a small but fresh selection of cured meat cheese and fruit also with freshly squeezed juice and pastries served in a nice room 
292293,Hotel Villa Emilia, Would have liked to have tea and coffee in the room Rooms very warm , the location was good easy assess to main attractions Friendly staff and good food 
292294,Hotel Villa Emilia, the shower goes hot and cold which is uncomfortable but bearable , the service was excellent the free tea break in the afternoon is a nice idea the lobby has a very special feel to it 
292295,Hotel Villa Emilia, Room smelled a bit strange old , Great atmosphere restaurant lobby and rooftop bar Good room size Minibar Breakfast was simple coldcuts fresh juice fruit cake DIY boiled eggs but good Not too far from Europa Fira direct train from Pla a d Espanya 
292296,Hotel Villa Emilia, First room allocated on 6th floor was too noisy due to faulty window and cleaning of terrace at 1 00am However we were moved without any problems the next day to a quieter room , Hotel was very clean well located excellent staff great range of choice at breakfast Comfortable bar area 
292297,Hotel Villa Emilia, It would have been nice to be able to get some food on the roof top terrace The breakfast was very overpriced More people would take advantage if it was less expensive I thought the weak link at this hotel was the staff Our housekeeper actually hung up a dirty towel on the floor instead of leaving us a clean one Twice we asked for a restaurant recommendation The first time they sent us to a restaurant that wasn t where they said it was they marked it on a map We never found it The second time we wanted paella and they sent us to a restaurant that doesn t serve it And last we were heading to the airport and I was low on Euros and told the front desk that we needed a cab that could process a CC She assured me that all cabs in Barcelona took cards We got to the airport and found out that ours didn t and we didn t have enough cash to pay her , We loved this property Modern yet still warm and comfortable I loved that so many people took advantage of the public spaces The rooms were very comfortable and there is a Metro station just 1 block away 
292298,Hotel Villa Emilia, The building across the street is under renovation sometimes could hear some noise , Great location with everything close by and mostly walking distance Good places for breakfast near the hotel and a supermarket next block 
292299,Hotel Villa Emilia, The street noise is vigorous had to keep our windows shut which solved the problem , There is a cozy bar area and a great terraza bar on the top floor There are several options for breakfast one being the formula which includes freshly squeezed orange juice delicious coffee and a mini bocadillo sandwich which was excellent and not really mini or a pastry for 4 95 The staff were friendly very efficient and knowledgeable We got some great tips for restaurants and shopping Most major sites are within walking distance If you get tired take the Metro color coded train lines were easy to follow We would go back to the Villa Emilia again 
292300,Hotel Villa Emilia, Staff in bar and restaurant are overworked and occasionally slow Internet reception is poor in bedrooms Ignore the advice from head receptionist about Airport bus On arrival it drops near Urgell metro station it s an easy two blocks walk back to the hotel on Grnad Vias On departure the receptionist said go to Placa Espanya This could be disastrous as the buses are full when they get there and there are crowds trying to board In the early morning The best bus stop is near junction of Urgell and Sepulyeda only 3 blocks walk away and one stop before Espanya , Excellent hotel breakfast superb fish dinner on Thursdays is top rate Very friendly and helpful staff Lovely roof terrace but slow service there Excellent location one minute from Rocafort metro station Use a T10 ticket
292301,Hotel Villa Emilia, Nothing, Modern hotel well placed in Barceloba with roof top bar Very comfortable and clean and staff were extremely helpful and efficient Would definitely go again
292302,Hotel Villa Emilia, The elevators are quite confusing or should I say confused The wi fi was in our room was quite weak and unreliable though stronger in the Business Room The shower and bathroom barn door seemed to be chosen more for the design value than for functionality , We are used to firm beds so found the beds very comfortable The staff on the rooftop were wonderful The room was beautiful There were lots of places in the area to eat The Rocafort train station was very close but we enjoyed walking to the city center 
292303,Hotel Villa Emilia, Room view , Wonderful location to see Barcelona very short distance to metro station Helpful and polite staff Breakfast had good quality and variety 
292304,Hotel Villa Emilia, Wifi was not good need to come down to the sitting area to can use the internet By the way beautiful sitting area In the bathroom was missing beauty kit and shower cap No kettle , The most friendly staff from the receptionists to the barkeeper Breakfast was delicious you can experience all types of coffee made by professional machine Loved the cool orange fresh and cold gazpacho with extra virgin and fresh grounded pepper Metro is a 5 min walk away very close is located fruit shop small market and a bakery 
292305,Hotel Villa Emilia, The two elevators do not function very well somehow they are not working as pairs so you have to press twice , We stayed in Villa Emilia 5 nights Overall it is a very modern comfort and well organized boutique hotel that fits especially couples without kids we are very pleased to recommend Emilia to everyone Room Cozy enough to relax even thought it isn t as that spacious as it looks on the picture AC is extremely quiet Location Not very close to the city center around 25 30 mins walking distance to La Rambla but by metro and bus at door step it takes only 10 mins to almost everywhere that Barcelona is to offer There are many small restaurants cafeterias and groceries around the corner Pl Espania is within 10 mins walk Restaurant Very stylish cozy bar Dinner served at 8pm costs 21 euros p but it does worth the price Cod fillet tastes unbelievably soft and fresh Highly recommended Cleanness quite OK Facilities nothing else except for the bar and terrace But for us it is not a big deal as we spent most of the time exploring the city
292306,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Perfectly suited to our needs Terrace absolutely stunning Stylish and beautifully decorated Loved our three day stay and will stay again in the future

292310,Hotel Villa Emilia, Tatiana at the reception desk was a tragic experience Can t deal with clients , Barbecue on the roof managed by Salvatore was simply fantastic Staff at the bar extremely kind great montaditos highly recommended Excellent location great design good food excellent taste for decoration makes Villa Emilia a great experience for demanding travellers 
292311,Hotel Villa Emilia, You have to walk 20 min to the Rambla a little bit long for young children but you can take the metro, The beds extra comfy stuff very freindly breakfast very good Metro station nearby 
292312,Hotel Villa Emilia, The only area would be the The roof top terrace My suggestion would be though the BBQ was great it was not worth 28 Euros and should be called BBQ Tapas I would use the space differently and you will have more people using it from the hotel and spending more example should be also where you can have breakfast as well , The people with a young toddler who was 2 the staff did everything to make our stay great fun 
292313,Hotel Villa Emilia, One lift was particularly small and slow The addition of a pool would be a welcome enhancement to what is already a very very nice hotel , Air conditioned rooms much appreciated Terrace Bar relaxing comfortable and friendly Location very good with easy access to metro Reception area inviting with nice fragrance s evident 
292314,Hotel Villa Emilia, A nice hotel like this should have a quality iron and ironing board in every room The rental bikes are in poor shape Need servicing , Excellent location great staff and service My third stay at this hotel I will be back 
292315,Hotel Villa Emilia, Don t plan to eat or drink here It doesn t appear that any cooking is done on site We were served raw pasta and incorrectly served tuna gray in color when chicken was ordered Chicken re delivered was also gray in color Clearly a microwave in use No hot food at breakfast Rooftop bar served us a cocktail with floating bugs or dirt and another in a chipped glass all while offering a view of the neighbor s laundry across the street , This hotel has the look decor is upscale Rooms are clean comfortable and quiet 
292316,Hotel Villa Emilia, The room was a little on the small side but not a problem as we didn t spend too much time in the room , The hotel was very clean and comfortable Ideal for a city break It was nice to be able to have a drink on the roof terrace 
292317,Hotel Villa Emilia, Parking is about 20 euros per day after they validate some of it , The location is about 10 min walk from the hop on hop off bus which was great for us It is about a 15 min cab ride approximately 10 euros or 1 hour walk from the cathedral The staff was incredibly kind and helped with everything There are a few shops around the hotel for bars in the evenings breakfast in the morning and easy super markets to get to The room itself was very modern looking and sleek We brought quite a bit of luggage so we had to be creative with our bags But it worked out perfect I would stay again Ps I ve stayed all over the world and the staff here was definitely some of the best 
292318,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Excellent breakfast classy spotless rooms with a relaxed feel to the hotel Lovely terraced bar although drinks there a little bit more expensive than other establishments although the atmosphere and sunshine made it worthwhile with super super friendly and helpful staff 
292319,Hotel Villa Emilia, That we had to leave soon I would like to stay there longer , I loved the most the smell in the hall and very comfortable beds Lunch in the restaurant was delicious and worth the price Very relax and cosy atmosphere We slept very well and didn t hear any sound from other rooms or the corridor Recommend 
292320,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Our triple room was very comfortable spacious even by American standards with a lovely bathroom and even a mini fridge AC was by a controllable thermostat and we didn t have any issues with that we like the room very cold at night Breakfast was expensive but elegant and very convenient a lovely European style continental breakfast with superb proscuitto smoked salmon mancheco cheese brie selection of fresh baked breads tea and coffee granola and cereal perfectly ripe fruit juices wine champagne milk 
292321,Hotel Villa Emilia, The bed was a bit too hard I also think it was 2 singles pushed together which is a shame Extractor fan in the bathroom didn t work but wasn t really an issue , Great location next to Rocafort metro station Nice reception bar area and roof terrace Staff very friendly Room was quiet and clean with good quality fixtures and fittings 
292322,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Our host Maria welcomed us warmly and was so attentive and helpful during our stay Everything about this hotel was wonderful The view over the valley is spectacular 
292323,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Very trendy hotel with great reception area caf The hotel is clean and modern and the bedroom had a great big bed and sufficient natural daylight The roof bar is a nice place to chill out too I think 200 is quite a lot for one night especially as we were only in the room for about 6hrs but I guess that s Barcelona major cities for you and it seems about standard 
292324,Hotel Villa Emilia, Would have liked tea or coffee making facilities in the room, The service makes this hotel The staff went the extra mile to help you It had a great location with the metro 100 metres away and the parking station next door The rooms were modern and clean 
292325,Hotel Villa Emilia, Room was not as quiet as expected and we have had more comfortable bed in similar type of hotel But overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will book again on our next visit to Barcelona , Lovely boutique hotel in central location We had a very enjoyable lunch in trendy modern restaurant and also very pleasant to enjoy evening drinks on rooftop bar Hotel staff were also very helpful and courteous 
292326,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Excellent location near metro station and walkable distance from city centre Cool comfortable rooms and lovely rooftop terrace perfect for early evening cocktails Staff extremely friendly and helpful Would definitely stay here again 
292327,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, Cozy little boutique hotel with piano bar friendly service and comfort Not in the middle of the hustle and bustle which was good Near enough to walk to attractions and distant enough for a quiet area 
292328,Hotel Villa Emilia, Just a few which they may consider 1 As comments from previous guests a little in the way of sausage eggs fried scrambled bacon would make the 14 00 Euro breakfast more appealing 2 Perhaps bedroom robes would add to the excellent bedroom bathroom facilities 3 A little more clarity when the hotel made taxi bookings no mention of the small surcharge paid to the taxi driver was made Hotel Emilia to the airport was 38 65 Euros part of which was a surcharge Then a tip on top of that made it fairly expensive I understand the shuttle bus or tram is a fraction of this but obviously there is the inconvenience factor , There was so many things that was positive about this place which includes the very excellent staff It would be unfair to mention each one by name although the reception staff of Monica David and Claire went out of their way to assist Claire had only just started with the Hotel and showed great enthusiasm for the role management potential 
292329,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, The staff were exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable for the local area The place was decorated brilliantly and the food was great The room was perfect in terms of bathroom and bed Would recommend for someone looking for a great city centre hotel 
292330,Hotel Villa Emilia, Just a bit far from the centre of town e g Ave Diagonal P de Gracia etc but it s only a 20 min walk or less than 10 mins in a cab However the great hotel service made up for it , Excellent breakfast and outstanding house wine Bar is very cosy and hotel decor is lovely Staff members were efficient and attentive Hotel room was very quite too 
292331,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, I had made a request prior to my arrival for non allergic pillows etc and the staff informed me upon arrival that this had already been done All the staff were very helpful and polite The hotel room was immaculate and very comfortable Location was close to the underground and the staff advised the best transportation tickets for our stay in Barcelona 
292332,Hotel Villa Emilia, Honestly not a thing We had the perfect stay , Couldn t have asked for a better stay My passport was stolen and the staff were as hospitable and helpful as possible Room was quiet and comfortable food was tasty hotel was luxurious Loved the roof terrace too 
292333,Hotel Villa Emilia, Bed was very small room was a cubicle very tiny Service was fine I would say it was a bit too expensive for the services that were on offer Rooms are not very soundproof as advertised , The bathroom was very nice and clean Location was very good around a 20 minute walk from Las Ramblas Very good restaurant nearby it for Brunch it s called Copasetic The terrace is really nice to sit in Nice staff 
292334,Hotel Villa Emilia, Could do with a small set of draws for small non hanging items , Excellent room we asked for quiet and were placed at the rear of the hotel away from the road very peaceful Room was cleaned every day Wonderful modern bathroom The hotel had a lovely smell from the moment you walked through the doors and in all the corridors Roof terrace bar was not open for many hours when we visited but you were still welcome to go up and relax up there and drinks were brought up to you if requested The blankets to wrap yourself in were a nice touch and needed 
292335,Hotel Villa Emilia,No Negative, The rooms and communal areas were spotless The bed was super comfortable our room was at the back of the hotel and wasn t very noisy but the view wasn t very inspiring Our friends were at the front of the hotel with a better view but was noisier at night 
292336,Hotel Villa Emilia, Nothing, The service was outstanding from the professional manager to the friendly and helpful reception staff and waiters Even the handyman who sorted out a small problem in the bathroom arrived immediately solved it and left smiling Beautifully decorated with comfy beds and smart bathrooms Excellent location 70 metres from the metro 
292337,Hotel Villa Emilia, The room was quite small and I was with my Mum so we had twin beds which was in fact 2 single beds pushed together I pushed them apart them a bit but there wasn t much space I don t like sleeping in a single bed in the UK I think you would get 2 small double beds in a twin room and they would be separated Also the weather was unusually warm but I couldn t put the aircon on because it s switched off centrally for the winter so it was very hot and too noisy to sleep with the windows open though with them closed the noise was almost completely cut out Those are my only 2 complaints , I really liked the feel of the hotel very friendly and cosy ambience not too big really nice and helpful staff and it s right next to Rocafort metro and Gran Via buses so easy to get around The food is really excellent we had both lunch and dinner there on various occasions and it s just a nice place to sit in the bar with live piano music in the early evening Also they have a coffee break tea coffee biscuits laid on in the mezzanine from 17 00 19 00 so perfect when you come in from a day s pounding the streets 
292338,Hotel Villa Emilia, Unfortunately the main bar and restaurant were being renovated Nevertheless the food and wine tasting each evening was a nice gesture , Ideal location for my needs Very pleasant friendly and helpful staff particularly in the Reception The room was spacious and spotlessly clean 
292339,Hotel Villa Emilia, Not a thing , All the staff were very friendly and attentive Very helpful in answering any queries Loved the rooftop terrace especially after a day sightseeing it was lovely to sit quietly and enjoy a coffee or something stronger The rooms were comfortable and quiet even though we overlooked the busy intersection
292340,Hotel Villa Emilia, No complimentary coffee or tea The person who cleaned the room didn t refill the room with new shampoo and soap instead she only put the bottle upside down And we have to ask for new tawels soap and shampoo The hotel just average and over rated , The Staff were really friendly

292345,Hotel Villa Emilia, breakfast selection is a bit short Lack of amenities in the room dirty iron business lounge is above the bar so a bit noisy to receive customers terrace is better for that and bad window soundproofing so you can hear a bit the noise from the street , good location near plaza de espanya 30m from metro 20mn on foot from catalunya rambla Nice terrace nice bar good food good hard bed clean and charming boutique hotel with a friendly atmosphere

292350,Hotel Villa Emilia, I felt the hotel breakfast selection was excellent but I was disappointed when my wife and I ate dinner there The portion sizes were too small and not good value On the Sunday nigh dinner there was a restricted number of starters and only one dessert available If I had been informed of this I would not have eaten there I was extremely disappointed with this lack of choice , The staff were extremely knowledgeable about Barcelona s attractions and transport They were courteous and attentive and I commend all of them 
292351,Hotel Villa Emilia, Trapped with no cancellation payment Staff not aware of excellent restaurants in the neighborhood like the crown marine and can valles , Design and decoration
