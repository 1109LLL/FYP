143660,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Bathroom on the smaller side , Very nice hotel and big room compared to a typical hotel room in Paris The condition of the room was spotless Hotel staff was great and helpful 
143661,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, I booked a room of luxe but i didnt see at all how this room is different from regular room NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL The room is very Very small and i m 100 sure i can find some room way better than this with 380 euros one night bad experience even the frontdesk is fine, Location ok stuff ok things are new
143662,Le Belmont Champs Elys es,No Negative, Amazing Helpful staff beautiful facility excellent location This hotel made a great start for our stay in Paris Had everything you could want Very comfortable nights sleep 
143663,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The bedrooms and bathrooms are small You cannot easily put a suitcase on the floor and walk around the room The elevators are also small The front desk personnel is just OK not very friendly , The location is great Very near to the Champs Elys es Many restaurants and shopping facilities around 
143664,Le Belmont Champs Elys es,No Negative, Best option Great location beautiful facilities the breakfast is super complete Bathroom great with excellent shower The bed was great and the pillows were perfect The staff is always ready to help you at everything 
143665,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Wifi was terrible we stayed 3 nights and blnibidy ever cleaned our room or brought fresh towels and when we called to ask for them they complained about the request, Awesome bed decent location
143666,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Shower was not made for big people like me , Fantastic ambiance at a top A location in the golden triangle of Paris Super beds big and longer than usual in hotels
143667,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Lobby check in area outdated small TV could not find wifi code in the room , Great location with value for money the bed was really nice and great shower 
143668,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Checkout was a little stressful as despite arranging a later checkout before they wanted to charge us a day rate , Nice comfortable bed and lovely decor Quiet location 
143669,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, as above, Lovely clean rooms beautiful bar lounge area we had a couple of problems on arrival our t v wouldn t work and 4 times someone visited the room to try and fix it then said it would need to wait until the next day the next day we reported it still wasn t fixed after arriving back from the day we were told we needed to contact sales but we were leaving the next day so that was a waste of time we asked to be moved rooms and were told there were none but after explaining this was a trip for my mum and we didn t wish to be out in the evening they eventually moved us The advert stated all rooms had a balcony however ours didn t nor were we able to open the curtains net like to see a view The room was very dark We were advised there were no rooms available with a balcony The spa is only for treatments and doesn t have a sauna or Jacuzzi or small pool and the gym had 1 treadmill and a weight machine but nothing more 
143670,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The reception staff were frosty bordering unfriendly There are no water or ice stations located anywhere in the hotel For 22 the breakfast options are ridiculous The rooms are really close together with narrow awkward hallways Good luck staying up late around 10pm and not getting a call to turn your tv off really There is no glass or curtain on the shower so the entire bathroom floor ends up covered in water when taking a shower Even attempting to jam myself up against the faucet into the 16 square that s created by the side of the sink didn t helped I m a skinny girl and the place still got drenched I ve stayed in hotels all over the world and this hotel is nothing special The pictures make it far grander than it is I m not a fan of European hotels but I m pretty sure you can find better for the money in Paris I was very disappointed with my stay here , Location is good The hotel is on a quiet street but just steps away from restaurants pharmacy and coffee shops etc 
143671,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The room was small for the price and the sound proofing was not good The people in the room above were clearly unawares that their activities were disturbing others until at least 2AM , Comfortable bed proper pillows adequate table for writing good wi fi well equipped bathroom 
143672,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The glass wall in our bath shower was very short which caused the bathroom to be partially wet after showering The rest was all perfect , Overall atmosphere of the hotel we had a room with a balcony which was very nice and spacious with a table and two chairs Comfortabel bed 
143673,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The room was clean but had cob webs off the lights and could have been cleaned more thoroughly , The staff were very welcoming and it was a beautiful room and well thought out for the size It is a boutique style hotel so did not expect a huge room Location was excellent No restaurant so no breakfast to rate 
143674,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Our room was in the attic and on arrival smelled like a sewer Very basic amenities for the cost of the room It was a strange layout with very little space to walk around the bed however there was a long hallway to the door , Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful 
143675,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, An iron was not available to us in the evening when needed , The location and staff were excellent Within walking distance of all major sites in Paris and hugely helpful staff especially Alex the bar manager 
143676,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Hawa at the front desk was rude and impatient as we were checking out She kept on making comments under her breath which made me feel really uncomfortable,No Positive
143677,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Room temperature was often too hot or too cold in the night Bathroom was a little small so while I loved the water pressure I was often fearful of soaking the bathroom When the room was cleaned it was not thorough While the beds were made and the floors tidied cleaned mugs were not replaced with fresh tea coffee sugar and creamer The lady at the front desk when checking out was not very friendly , Nice amenities and toiletries Nice decor Fantastic Water pressure The gentleman at the bar was very helpful in finding somewhere nearby for us to eat The hotel was reasonably close to the Champs Elysees which was very convenient for our New Years Eve stay we saw the fireworks at the Arch de Triumph 
143678,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, TV did not work in the room, Provided you go for the luxury room you have enough space more than usual in Paris hotels there is a nice bar and spa including a small fitness facility The hotel has also a nice sitting area Cosy hotel 
143679,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Serving staff at breakfast took a long time to respond and there were no vegetarian options for a cooked breakfast even though I had requested this There were 2 3 staff which is inefficient use of resources especially as no cooking was required Very expensive prices at the bar 2 g t was 30 And beauty treatments 160 for a massage The hotel appeared opulent at first glance but there was flaky paint and stains on furnishings that I wouldn t expect of such a highly rated hotel During one breakfast meal there were 2 unaccompanied children and one child pocketed lots of packets if nutella and the other ate very little from a big plate of food They seemed to be very familiar with the waiting staff and I wondered if they were actually guests I would prefer the hotel to spend on guests and reduce high prices than on waste I wouldn t return for this reason poor value for money , Great location with excellent reception staff who welcomed us Enjoyed the Hammam loved the Hermes bathing products robes and slippers plus the room was cleaned every day Lots of croissants and pastries in the morning Our room was very quiet and we felt secure 
143680,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, I was excited to have a good stay in this hotel for the good location but unfortunately I shocked with the not clear and honest description for the facilities and rules they forced me to pay more and change my room and its not my fault to not have a good details in booking proceeded and I didn t have a good welcome by staff in arriving and the bathroom smell was disgusting they said through booking com all children under 12 are free for stay and that not true the booking com couldn t do anything and this is not the first time I had trouble with the booking com and they can t solve it before only saying sorry for what happen to you so this is the last time to book through them the hotel need to change their staff specially the night shift and have to fix their bathrooms and change their details of the facilities and the rules and we will see if booking com they clear to but my comments and review , Only the location every things were offal
143681,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Nothing, Great location in Paris and nice staff This is my 2nd time at this hotel and I will definitely go back The breakfast is good and was included in my room 
143682,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, I would not recommend the Spa treatments The cost does not justify the experience 180 for 90mins treatment with a very nice well meaning therapist only rather young inexperienced so it was more like a 50 euro experience for over 3 x that Maybe that was just my luck of the draw But I would be remiss not to draw attention to the possibility it could happen to other customers For that money we should flamin well get champagne a bodyscrub a bodywrap and maybe some canap s IMHO Because otherwise one feels somewhat fleeced Alternatively I would advise charging sensible prices for the simple experience provided We don t even pay those prices in London and that s saying summat , I thought the staff were wonderful The hotel was just as gorgeous as the photos Very comfortable Very relaxed No complaints at all Even happy to accommodate a late checkout Class 
143683,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The bar was closed early in the evening You re squeezed in a tiny shower under the roof on the top floor No English TV channels only 8 French channels, More than you expect when you get into the room
143684,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, At the reception middle aged guy wouldn t feel and think for the customer but insisted only the opinions and reasons of hotel s repeatedly for lots of time even the same way and the same words I thought he had to be a foolish stupid or too poor ability to understand what the customer s saying That must be crazy from Algeria aha of course a lady at the reception were not so bad looking but easily I could esteem she also not so smart brain and mind must be broken UNDOUBTEDLY , young staff are all so kind and friendly soooo good Breakfast was also delicious not so many kinds but tasted good indeed 
143685,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The air conditioning did not work and the room was extremely hot which was in part due to the heat coming from the minibar A fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and the staff were nowhere to be found and no explanation given The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor , The location is great with easy access to the sites and transport links The breakfast was good 
143686,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, No coffee machine Just a water kettle with coffee, The room is very spacious and the water system in the toilet is excellent The gym was average It serves the purpose
143687,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Can be more light in hallways And lower price on breakfast But don t pay for breakfast bc just eat out side and enjoy the multiple coffee shops around, Very convenient and right in the center for vacation Next to metro nice restaurants safe and upscale area Excellent choice for money
143688,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, The only downside was when we opened our balcony door we could see into the room across from us but I can t complain too much as we did get the room for a good price , The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were lovely and well decorated The hotel is in a good location very close to the Arc De Triomphe and the Champs Alysees and within easy reach of the Eiffel Tower I would recommend this Hotel to anyone 
143689,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, Although there were quite a few guests bar and spa were never staffed Got a drink once by asking at reception and they sent someone round to it Spa never EVER had anyone there It s a shame because that s why I booked hotel but never got to use it , Room was very clean and comfortable I asked for a quiet room and that is exactly what I got I never heard a soul Breakfast was adequate but not worth 21 Euro mine was included in my package so it was fine Good location if you want to shop like staying just off of Bond St in London but there are better areas However easy to get to other places on Metro Couple of staff really helpful in aiding us to buy and print tickets for the football others quite nonchalant C est Paris 
143690,Le Belmont Champs Elys es, very small room, staff responded quickly when we asked to change beds
