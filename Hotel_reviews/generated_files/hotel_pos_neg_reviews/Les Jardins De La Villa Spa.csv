201146,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa,No Negative, The communication was poor when we got there I asked to do something special for my boyfriend birthday and didn t get anything The breakfast and spa facilities wasn t explained very well so had to go out and find somewhere to have breakfast wasn t able to use the spa facilities till the day of checking out as it was booked up 
201147,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa,No Negative, Well thought space with great contemporary d cor Personalised service and attentive staff Very enjoyable boutique feel In a small quiet street but near lots of facilities transport links shops restaurants 
201148,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, The towel warmer would have been excellent if it were colder during our stay it was not needed unfortunately there was no off switch and we had to call the front desk It was ajusted very quickly , Excellent neighborhood Warm charming and safe The hotel had an upscale feel and a reasonable rate Staff was attentive and friendly they went out of the way to provide detailed metro walking directions and offered excellent feedback on area restaurants The private Spa access was a very nice complimentary benefit much needed after finishing a the 2017 Paris Marathon 
201149,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, No negative comments, Needing to be in the Porte Maillot area I used to stay At the Hyatt or M ridien Always a disappointment not at 4 star level Les jardins de la Villa was a pleasant alternative A nice small hotel with personalized and friendly service An experience definitely to be repeated Very nice 
201150,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Breakfast was disappointing with very limited choice and not worth the 20 charge Eggs and bacon ran out an hour before the official end of breakfast time I mentioned this politely to a member of staff and asked if any more would be forthcoming He shrugged and replied non c est fini no it s finished and that was that Some of the hotel decor is over the top for my taste a lot of glitter but I accept this is a matter of personal taste and not a big deal for me Also I prefer a shower one can stand under without having to hold it theirs can only be fixed at waist height or hand held , A pleasant little hotel conveniently located not far from a main line Metro station Porte Maillot excellent restaurants and the Bois de Boulogne The room was not huge but very comfortable and clean Staff were friendly and helpful with one minor exception see below The hotel has spa facilities but we did not use these so cannot comment on them We enjoyed our stay there on the whole 
201151,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Would have been nice to have been able to make a cup of tea in our room There was free tea and coffee available in the reception except during breakfast hours which is when we like our morning cup of tea Minor point , The hotel was well decorated the rooms were lovely and well thought out and the staff working on reception were very friendly very helpful showing us on a map how to get to places and made excellent recommendations on where to eat and get cocktails 
201152,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, The room was very small for an executive suite But I think the rooms in most Europe hotels are small we were out most of the day so this didn t bother us much , Great location Walking distance to l arch de triomph helpful and friendly staff Comfortable clean room Very nice washroom Nesspresso machine in the room with pods filled daily I loved that we got a tiny box of chocolates upon arrival 
201153,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Loved everything about the hotel , The proximity to restaurants stores the Metro station and tourist activities yet close to a Parisienne neighborhood Loved the spa which was included in the price steam shower and sauna Each concierge was extremely helpful in translating helping make calls to tour operators and booking restaurants Loved the in room cappuccino machines always present fresh coffee in the lobby and chocolates on the pillows Would highly recommend this hotel We ll stay here again when in Paris 
201154,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa,No Negative, I would like to talk with travellers with head on their shoulders and feet really on the floor There are so many hotels in Paris but when you exclude the very expensive ones the big chains hotels not very exciting the bad ones then you have the good hotels good location reasonable price small good service We find one in Paris 17 LES JARDINS DE LA VILLA SPA Everything perfect starting with the manager STEPHANE une perle rare the receptionist NICOLAS he knows his job and he is doing it perfectly and all the remaining staff The decoration of the hotel itself and the rooms particularly is amazing Breakfast is very good and served in a very different manner than other hotels It s really the place to be in Paris mainly due to the location the calm little street proximity of main center of Paris very good restaurants around Room 22 was a very good choice but I guess all numbers will satisfy the most difficult Go there it s a very good choice 
201155,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Breakfast rather limited but perfectly adequate , Located where we wanted the ground floor is quirky and pleasant with a tiny but neat garden to justify the name The room was also pretty small but well equipped and comfortable great shower 
201156,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, The person from the reception tried to steel my computer in some way I asked to leave my luggage in hotel after check out when I came back my computer was not with my bags anymore he gave me only bags but not the computer Thanks God I remembered it myself came back and computer was at the other place , Breakfast was good except scrambled eggs made from powder 
201157,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Breakfast included automatically in the room rate would avoid confusion in the morning as their breakfast room and accompanied treats for breakfast are well worth enjoying here for a stay in Paris, A very French chic feeling at this boutique hotel suitable for all tastes either business or pleasure in Paris 
201158,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Reception staff had poor English and she charged my card incorrectly the first day Thankfully I noticed and was refunded but it took a few days to get back into my account ,No Positive
201159,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, The lift that doesn t go down direct from your room to the hamam level meaning u have to wear clothes at 8am just to cross the breakfasts area which makes the hamam experience not as pleasant and relaxing as it should be , The welcome from the staff the location the room the terrasse the bar the breakfast the Hamam 
201160,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Nothing not to like, The staff were incredibly helpful Nicholas was friendly and helped us with all our requests The hotel was beautifully decorated and we were given a room with a balcony which was an unexpected bonus Location was great and the honesty bar was a lovely feature which was relaxed and convenient

201166,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Rooms are pretty small even the larger room that we paid extra for Parking not included though was told there was a discount at local garage by staff Turned out false and wasted 30 45 mins at checkout trying to figure it out with hotel and parking attendant , Clean modern room Good location

201170,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Bathroom Shower had no rim on floor water spread throughout bath when showering Toilet was right in front of shower and your feet would get wet when you needed to use it Staff did not have the initiative that you would expect of a 4star hotel They would respond when asked though , Cleanliness Comfortable mattresses
201171,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, When sitting in the garden at night one couple were being quite loud in their room with the balcony doors open which made sitting in the garden with other guests uncomfortable This was not the fault of the hotel though but more other guests , The staff at Les Jardins were exceptional very welcoming professional and helpful They went above and beyond to facilitate any requests I had and were probably the best hotel staff I ve ever dealt with Upon checking in early they made it a priority to make sure my room was cleaned next so I could have the key to it asap The hotel is very clean has excellent facilities and is in a great location I really enjoyed my stay here and thoroughly recommend it to others

201173,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, The only thing I didn t like was other guests who didn t book the hamman and started using it during my booked time so I had to go and ask reception to handle it which they did immediately , The staff are very nice and helpful ensuring that you feel relaxed and comfortable The breakfast area is beautiful so tranquil a lovely place to sit and have a coffee and a croissant I like that there is a small garden space for good weather which again is tranquil or there is a lounge where you can have a glass of wine and relax in the evening The fitness centre and hamman is really great and everything is there for you that you will need robe fluffy towels slippers water they think of everything The products in the bedroom are very good quality and smell divine The bedrooms and decor are very very nice and there is always a bottle of water and chocolates offered in your room Location is great On line 1 metro which is 2 stops to champs Elysee and surrounded by lots of cafes restaurants including the famous Entrec te and a shopping centre I stay in a lot of hotels in Paris and this is by far the best because it has such a lovely energy which is no doubt down to the fantastic staff 
201174,Les Jardins De La Villa Spa, Honestly cannot think of a thing , The decor of this beautiful hotel isn t given justice by the photographs Lovely little touches wherever you look The finish is of high standard throughout Our room was a nice size I had been expecting small The bed was wonderfully comfortable and huge The shower room amazing never been in such a huge shower All in the room could not be faulted The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful Location good and in an area of upmarket shops Easy access from metro Breakfast was nice more than just croissants fruit salad and yoghurt eggs and bacon Would love to visit again hope I get the opportunity
