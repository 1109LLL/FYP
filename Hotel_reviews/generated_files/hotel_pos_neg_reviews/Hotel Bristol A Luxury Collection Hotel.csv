352677,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Smoking is allowed in the bar and all the furnishings in there reek of smoke I understand smoking inside will be outlawed next year though , Beautiful bathroom with separate toilet Balcony overlooking the Kartner Ring Champagne on arrival flowers and fruit Exceptionally prompt with every request including laundry room service etc very comfortable bed Quiet room 
352678,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, The Hotel Room at least our room was worn needs a refurbishment The outside of the Hotel needs a basic and total overhall For that reason we found the price too high , Location nice ambience of the Hotel 
352679,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, No iron board Have to ask for kettle for coffee For a luxury hotel these things should be present in the room and not ask for it , Friendly staff Excellent location near underground station Tourist bus good restaurants very near the hotel 
352680,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, Very comfortable bed and linen Quiet and clean room A very nice bathroom A good restaurant with an excellent Viennese schnitzel A very friendly staff 
352681,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, BATHROOM IS OF OLD DESIGN TUB SHOWER TOO NARROW ONE SINK NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR 2 PEOPLE ALSO HANDHELD BARELY WORKED AND THEREFOR NOT USABLE TAKING A SHOWER WAS A BIT OF A WORKOUT , POLITE AND EFFICIENT STAFF VERY HELPFUL CONCIERGE GREAT LOCATION TOWELS AND ROBE ARE EXCELLENT
352682,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Nothing, Excellent location excellent breakfast beautiful hotel near to everything excellent staff clean everyday green apples near to opera and restaurants nearby shopping street metro tram in front of the hotel 
352683,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, This is not only hotel this is un historic institution You feel proud to have opportunity to stay in hotel like this like many famous persons in 125 years old history of Bristol hotel For me it is synonym for luxury and good taste 
352684,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Everything was a tad pricey but it s what you d expect to pay in a high end hotel establishment However the one big disappointment was the fact that smoking is allowed in the Lounge Bar and my husband and I couldn t sit in there on a number of occasions as the smoky atmosphere was too unpleasant and due to having had a lung transplant I cannot stay in smoky conditions for obvious reasons It s a real shame as it s a beautiful bar really comfortable with pleasant staff and a great atmosphere , Excellent service clean room wonderful views great location polite and caring staff very good restaurant The restaurant menu was mostly traditional Viennese fare and of a very high quality Would love to go back 
352685,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, I would sum up this hotel as faded grandeur It s a little tired and could use some updating Also the bar allowed smoking One of our vacation highlights is to get a drink to discuss the day s events but we couldn t stand sitting in a smoke filled lounge One night it was pouring and we wanted to get a light dinner there but couldn t stand the thought of eating in a smoky bar so we had to go out Also the lobby is not much of a traditional lobby There were six club chairs there not a place to congregate It was a hotel which in it s day I m sure was grand but now not really The staff was very polite and helpful but overall I think it was overpriced , The location was excellent right next to the Vienna State Opera 
352686,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Due to the age of facility noise from outside and next room was heard from time to time , Great staff Very convenient location in front of opera walking distance to almost everything 
352687,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, the mattress on the bed was too soft people were smoking at the bar so the non smoking option was to have drinks at the same place we had breakfast , the design of the hotel was beautiful excellent room staff was friendly
352688,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Rooms on the inner courtyard have no view at all The courtyard is thoroughly ugly and industrial looking , Large and beautifully decorated rooms Elegant and classy establishment Great staff Bonus points for the electrically operated window shutters blinds 
352689,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, The room was quite old Bathtub was very uncomfortable for bathing a young child We asked to switch room but were told there would be quite a price difference which I found outrageous given we were already paying so much The food was also generally quite mediocre for the quality and rating of the hotel especially the food delivered at room service , The location was great and the staff were also very friendly and attentive
352690,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Would have liked spacey wardrobe with more hangers we only had 3 , Liked their hospitality location and noise proof windows as we were in the middle lucyof the traffic 
352691,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, We have been waiting for the waffles during breakfast for 40 min Unfortunately we were unlucky to stay in an amazing room with balcony in the nastiest weather possible Because of awful wind and snow it was really cold in the room , Amazing opera view room Flowers and champagne were a very nice welcoming gesture Really tasty breakfast Beautiful Christmas decorations Hope to come back for the Ball 
352692,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, My personal opinion is that price of breakfast is a bit too high for what is offered as a variety For 2 people the charge was 72 EUR For this amount you could easily have a good meal at a good restaurant including main dishes Food was good quality but still 36 EUR per person is a bit too much This could be improved , Location is perfect Staff is very nice and friendly The hotel has history and tradition and is next to the opera pedestrian shopping street metro and transport connections 
352693,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Poor quality of the accomodation with a very high price 400 per night for a standard room looking at the glass ceiling of the ringgalerie passage with old bathroom and furniture which was broken room 42 breakfast NOT included Even for a 36 breakfast one should wait in a line of 10 persons waiting all for their eggs any style Not a value of a 5 star rated hotel Disappointment totally , Perfect location next to the staatsoper
352694,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, I think there should be an additional more secluded restaurant specialising in Austrian food The existing restaurant has no soul and left me feeling I had not received value for money, Everything except the restaurant in the evening
352695,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, We loved every moment of our stay Our requests for soft Pillows and quiet room were acted on The breakfast was superb and concierge very helpful Will highly recommend the Bristol 
352696,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Really can t think of anything except maybe the wifi could be faster, The staff was very friendly and helpful They gave my adult son and I a connecting room It made such a difference in the enjoyment of our stay The premises were extraordinary The food delicious And the location couldn t be better 
352697,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, May be some more little deteails in the bathroos a little bit old , I enjoied everything great rooms great brekfast and location It is very rappresentative of Vienna But fisrt of all I DID ENJOY COURTSEY AND PROFESSIONALITY OF ALL THE STUFF in particular of Mrs Sanskia in the front office that was so helpfull anf professional to solve big problems about the reservation before if my arriving Thanks Sanskia SHE WAS THE ONLY REASON WHY I DID NOT DELETE THE RESERVATION AND BOOK AT KEMPINSKY WHRE THEY WERE WAITING FOR US AND HAD 2 GRET ROOMS READY

352700,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, There s probably something they could do better but I like the place too much to notice, Helpful staff old world charm with comfort Fabulous room with view over the opera house with entrance hall and walk in wardrobe Easy walking distance to music art shops food and fun The hotel feels like its part of the fabric of Austria and that s what I m looking for 
352701,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, We were disappointed by the dinner menu options The descriptions of the dishes were somewhat of an exaggeration for instance if say broccoli was mentioned this resulted in being one floret on the plate My wife and I had a switch dishes due it not being what she thought it would be , The location was fantastic very central to most of the museums and sights we wanted to see For further afield such as the schonbrunn palace there is a metro stop just adjacent to the hotel The facilities at the hotel are of a very high standard and the breakfast options provided something to suit everyone The staff are very helpful and friendly 
352702,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Can t think of a thing , The staff was exceptional The room was breathtaking The breakfast was incredible And there couldn t be a better location Also this hotel can t be passed up by those who enjoy history The hotel has a past 
352703,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, Wardrobe door hitting the lights when opened bathroom curtain overlapping with bathroom door renovation could be thought through more completely, Location was very good overall atmosphere in the hotel is very nice helpful staff nice coffee machine in the lobby good for quick coffee before taxi in the morning 
352704,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, the bathroom had no space for my cosmetics I had to drag a chair in and there was a shower curtain which is a no no but I had not time to complain and removed it myself , Only spent one night but the lobby was greatly improved since my last longer stay location location location 
352705,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, Excellent location spacious clean and superb decorated room we had even 2 small balconies good to know for smokers complementary sparkling wine and water nice little bar with hundreds of spirit drinks Also staff was great But most of all I liked the stais and the elevator can understand this only if you go there 
352706,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel,No Negative, Great location to visit Vienna State Opera could not be closer one minute walk door to door Magnificent rooms great restaurant friendly staff all willing to help Chaise lounge was a welcome as well as the armchair as a couple we could both relax View from the rooftop rooms is exceptional 
352707,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, It took an unduly long time to arrange for the heat in the bathroom to be turned off , We found the housekeeping staff most friendly remainder of stall could have been more outgoing a smile would have helped 
352708,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, We were in a newly refurbished room fabulous but only 1 chair i had to sit either on the bed or a stool You couldn t have the bathroom light on without having the bedside lights on You can t sleep with the bedside lights on you can t turn them off without killing the power to the whole room so no light in the bathroom Bathroom door needs proper handles Fabulous room for solo traveller niggly irritating for 2 They will sort these teething issues , Fabulous hotel excellent location pro actively helpful staff
352709,Hotel Bristol A Luxury Collection Hotel, overworked concierge service had to queue for advice poor internet connection unuseable , We had an awesome room with lots of space and luxury furnishings The common parts of the hotel are very nicely decorated if a tad corporate Vienna is sensational and the location was perfect for exploring All of the staff were lovely apart from the slightly stressed concierge guys who although they did well had to think about the next person in line Oh and the lift was very quick despite having to service lots of people not sure how but it worked for us
