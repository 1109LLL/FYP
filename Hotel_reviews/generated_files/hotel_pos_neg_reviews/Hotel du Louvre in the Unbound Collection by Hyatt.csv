413878,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, See above , The concierge desk added costs without informing me Ordering a cab for departure and telling me that I would be charged 7 Doris for their call eas not honest Charging an additional 5 euros for a ticket to the Louvre was not unacceptable but should have been divulged The front desk was much more obliging and helpful Paris needs American tourists and should be welcoming helpful and generous to those of us who are visiting despite the precarious conditions in France 
413879,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt,No Negative, Staff were fantastic really helpful and always available I travelled here with my wife to celebrate her 40th birthday I had contacted the hotel beforehand about this and they couldn t have been any more accommodating with all of my requests From a room upgrade to a birthday cake and a bottle of wine on her birthday they made the stay an excellent one

413889,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, I found the outside of the hotel beautiful very old world building the interior left a lot to be desired in my opinion especially for what is to be a 5 star hotel Fell very far below the equally priced hotel I stayed at week prior in London which was also 5 star and centrally located , Location was great directly across from the Louvre and central to most everything either on foot or the subway which is also right there

413905,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Despite being described on the website as air conditioned the room was not air conditioned They did move me to a different room which although not air conditioned was cooler The d cor was shabby and the carpets were worn particularly on the upper levels On checking in they required me to sign a permission which allowed them to withhold 1 600 from my bank account for 4 nights the price of the room and an extra 300 on top of the bill in case I had anything extra This was most unexpected and not at all evident at the time of booking or on their website To top it all they charged me an extra 320 which I only discovered when I got home and checked my bank account It seems that they charged me for one of the nights that my friend had stayed She was charged for 3 nights instead of 4 nights They said it was because I used my credit card to book the rooms but no one had mentioned it to me I had also made it crystal clear at check in that my friend and I would each pay our separate bills They have promised to refund this amount to me but it was all very stressful and an absolute mess , The location is excellent

413943,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, I booked the Hyatt Queen Room for our aniversary weekend away I was offered an upgrade to an executive room which i accepted and paid extra for We were dissapointed with the room especially the view from the window the run down decoration and noisy plumbing The room also lacked a trouser press Iron and board english speaking news channel on tv coffee or tea making facilitiies free bottled water and a poorly stocked mini bar The rest of the hotel was ok with the exception that it had no tourist information around We never used the hotel for breakfast so no comment I have travelled all over the world and in my mind this is not worthy of a 5 star hotel more 3 at best Hotel is well over priced beware of the bar prices and water from the mini bar is 7 euro for 30cl Its a great location with local attractions at your toes , The location and Staff
413944,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Condition of the hotel is poor it needs a full renovation Very poor sound insulation between rooms This hotel is nowhere near five star as advertised It is a low four star at best and HYATT should not allow their name to be used in such a way it greatly devalues the brand , Staff were friendly efficient and polite Excellent service 
413945,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Some of the rooms need an upgrade Some of the staff could be more helpful , They are getting better with service Mr Mohamed at the entrance is always the kindest most elegant and helpful Mme Florence at customer service was very kind too Having great key people at a Hotel makes the whole experience superior The beds are always incredibly comfortable and the internet is reliable The quality of the room service was better than ever The location is outstanding Overall the Hotel seems to keep getting better 
413946,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, Rude staff incapable conscience they managed to lost our luggage which we left for safekeeping for 2 hours Finally they found it only because I had to go look for it since they left it untagged But it kept getting worse The people at the conscience probably couldn t understand English as There was a problem with the payment they agreed to get paid in cash and then wouldn t accept it The general manager apologized and promised to make it up to us by making our stay memorable Needless to say we neither saw or heard from him again It s like the first five star hotel I ve been to where they make the customer feel invisible and irrelevant Shame That s all I have to say,No Positive

413948,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, We booked a courtyard side room as it was less expensive and we thought it would be quieter than the street side rooms What a mistake The courtyard houses the hotel s generators and was so noisy it was like sleeping next to a factory It was impossible to open the window and even with the window closed the noise was inescapable The hotel staff were unsympathetic and made no attempt to provide an alternative or to compensate us in any way Our room was undistinguished with poor quality toiletries no tea coffee making facilities room service tea is chaged at 10 euros and no complimentary water All in all over priced and certainly not good value for money I would have expected much more from a hotel that calls itself the oldest luxury hotel in Paris If you stay here avoid at all costs the courtyard side rooms unless you are hard of hearing , The hotel is a few minutes from the Louvre 
413949,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, pokey bedroom in need of renovation having to ask for toiletries and toilet paper to be replenished Thet were having a laugh with room service and breakfast prices poor value for money, The central location

413953,Hotel du Louvre in the Unbound Collection by Hyatt, For a 5 hotel it would have been nice to have a complimentary bottle of water for each night stayed rather than the one provided at start of the stay The hotel would also benefit from having spa beauty facilities to help with the aches and pains from all the walking undertaken whilst taking in the sights I was also slightly surprised by the sharp increase in the bar tariff from the terrace bar to the bar lounge , The location of this hotel is fantastic however overall it lacked the attention to detail you would expect for a 5 rating The staff especially the concierge were extremely helpful however on occasion we felt rushed to finish our drinks snacks by some staff at the terrace bar despite it not being overly busy The free wifi was a welcome feature
