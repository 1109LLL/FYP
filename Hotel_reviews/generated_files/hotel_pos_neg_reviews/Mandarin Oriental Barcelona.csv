399430,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Nothing, The staff were so helpful friendly at all times nothing was too much trouble The hotel has the most amazing smell would like to bottle it take it home The hotel is really clean well maintained fabulous bathroom facilities the beds are really comfortable definitely will return
399431,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,No Negative, mandarin just never let you down we were greeted by warm welcome and check in was super convenient rooms are small however it was a great stay for 3 nights 
399432,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, THE FACILITIES ARE NOT GREAT ROOM FINISHING IS DESIGNED TO BE LUXURIOUS AND MODERN HOWEVER THE CRAFTSMAN SHIP IS POOR WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ANY ROCCO FORTE HOTEL IN PLACE , CLEANLINESS ARTISTIC DISPLAYS IN THE BUILDING LOCATION 
399433,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, To be honest the bed was very uncomfortable my back was hurting me every morning and unconfortable nights some of them But everthing else was amazing, Everything good place good hotel good service will deff come back again soon
399434,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, 8 per hour for Internet It s unexaptable at hotel that cost you 700 per night Transfer that cost 140 for a distance of 2 5km is absurd as well , Super comfy beds and pillows 
399435,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, There is no sauna Gym too enclosed Room a bit too tight when v hv 4 big luggages , The services rendered by concierge reception feel safe when v stayed in MO
399436,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Was stunned to learn that you had to pay extra for Wifi in the room Was not what I was expecting for a 5 star service Especially after paying so much for the room Most 3 and 4 star hotels offer free wifi these days We decided also that 40 per person for breakfast was also not value for money In Passeig de Gracia there are loads of Cafes that provide quality foods for much less than this , The staff are very friendly the location is excellent and the design of the hotel is great The room is an excellent size and the bed is very comfortable We had a lovely meal in the Moments restaurant Well worth a visit and the price I highly recommend taking the Trip 
399437,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, When paying almost 600 pounds for a room per night the fact breakfast is an extra 45 euros and wifi is 15 euros per day is obserd Also having no tea facilities in the room is ridiculous therefore having to pay an extra 7 euros per cup of tea When paying this price for a room I wouldn t expect these added costs and made our holiday very depressing , Nice bed and bath
399438,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, The breakfast is overpriced 45 EUR person I think is to much for a breakfast We travel a lot generally we stayed at 5 Star hotels but never found so high price Our room looked onto the so called garden but actually we could see the partition walls of neighbouring houses , The location is excellent in heart of Barcelona 
399439,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,No Negative, The location the stuff so kind and smile all the time the room so clean and quiet even my room view was in Main Street Defenitly I will choose this hotel again 
399440,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, None, I have to say The service is fantastic All the staff are nice smilly specially when my husband was taking the huge luggage and walking in the lobby a lady with high heel I think she is the manager ran to him and try to help him Breakfast was good roof top is great Bed is comfortable as well Location is great We could visit lots of the top visit spot by walking 
399441,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Concierge service was great and very helpful before arrival email exchange but on site i guess they were overwhelmed with many requests and were not as thoughtful Also our room had an akward smell that we actually complained about but that remained during our stay , Great facilities Sauna and spa were definetly a plus after walking the whole day around Barcelona 
399442,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,No Negative, Customer service is superb We felt like we are looked after by a family To make you a complimentary hot chicken soup when you got cold in the rain it is something very special 
399443,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, We made our stay too short There is nothing more to say not a problem with our visit to this wonderful hotel , Food in the Terrat was amazing breakfast unlimited choices Staff extremely helpful especially concierge and check in staff 
399444,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Room area is too small in terms of Barcelona s hotels even in terms of Mandarin Oriental s hotels , The warm and sincere service of the concierge 
399445,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Price of breakfast could be a little more reasonable 39 was a little expensive and no kettle in the room for a brew in the morning Minor niggles on what was otherwise the perfect hotel , Beautiful rooms comfy beds and fantastic spar 
399446,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona,No Negative, Very friendly personnel great location we were surprised to find a bottle of Champagne as a compliment and warm greatings for our wedding anniversary Thanks a lot we will come back to Mandarin 
399447,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Pool Gym area I expected they have proper changing rooms for pool gym use but no somehow I was escorted to bathroom next to the pool as changing room However there s direct elevator from each guest room floors to spa pool gym area it would be more comfortable if they had proper changing room , Staff and general service
399448,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Lobby very limited room was smallish awkward to use comfortably and no great sense of privacy with courtyard facing room, Location Breakfast was excellent and expensive 
399449,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, Our room deluxe garden room overlooked a children s sports facility and it was quite noisy to sit in the terrace during the day , I loved the interior design of the hotel The breakfast area was perfect and the food was delicious The staff were so friendly especially the concierge team 
399450,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, The hot water in the bath was living its own life Sometimes it flowed like Niagara Falls sometimes it was a thin stream It was always a surprise especially during the shower I was not able to set it up properly , Convenient central location friendly staff knowledgeable concierges good food strong international brand

399454,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, The rooms are not a 5 star rooms there is no privacy you can hear everything in other rooms I was in room 309 everytime the door of room 310 opens I felt my room was opened There is no comfort at all comparing to the price of the room, The staff are very helpful the location is excellent located in an important street and everything is near
399455,Mandarin Oriental Barcelona, The strongly perfumed lobby which was the reason I checked out on the same day of checking in as we had a family member suffering from acute asthma When I asked them to turn it off The management wasn t cooperative in that regard as their reply was lowering the smell to a minimum as there is a standard they have to meet ,No Positive
