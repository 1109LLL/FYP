484929,LHP Hotel Napoleon, I asked for a plug adapter for my phone so I could set my alarm They could not find one I had a wake up call to be sure I caught my train They never called and I overslept and needed to rush to the station Breakfast was included with the room but we didn t get to eat it The woman at the desk was sorry and didn t charge me the tax I felt they needed to provide a greater discount , Clean

484943,LHP Hotel Napoleon, No help to carry the luggage to the bedroom I want to stay longer but the price of the hotel was to expensive for the week end , The place where the hotel is located is quite and pleasant In front of the hotel you can have a nice aperitivo From there all Milan is close The design is black and elegant 
484944,LHP Hotel Napoleon, As an ageing woman I was surprised and disappointed that a friend also of similar age and from Australia who had made the effort to travel to Milan to see me for the day was not permitted to come up to my room because she didn t have her passport with her Reason given security reasons , The Hotel is close to the Railway Station 
484945,LHP Hotel Napoleon,No Negative, I was thrilled arriving at 9 am that I didn t have to wait until 2 pm for a room So I didn t complain the room was so small The small breakfast room was very pleasant with a nice selection of items and nice coffee service from the waitress 
484946,LHP Hotel Napoleon, We paid for a king size bed room and got a queen size bed room which it turns out they all are No where else in Europe did we have such a problem They need to advertise honestly , The reception gentleman who wore a jacket and tie every time was extremely helpful and recommended restaurants which turned out to be fantastic Thanks
