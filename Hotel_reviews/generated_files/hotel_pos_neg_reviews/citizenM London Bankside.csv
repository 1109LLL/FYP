96177,citizenM London Bankside, This was our third stay at this hotel and it was our worst our room was on the road side and we didn t get much sleep because of the traffic noise Plus I always look forward to the big screen tv only to discover ours wasn t as big as the last time A bit disappointed with the stay ,No Positive
96178,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing this is our new go to boutique hotel for short London stays , What an amazing and unique hotel A short cab ride or 15 minute walk from Waterloo station and close to nearby bars and restaurants The room is comfortable and quirky and the hotel staff are super friendly The bar are and foyer feel cozy and the interior design is amazing I loved it so much I booked CitizenM in Amsterdam for my next trip

96180,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms were quite small but we expected that , While this is a self service property the reception staff was super helpful and willing to go out of their way 
96181,citizenM London Bankside, A mild but strange odour in the rooms Nevertheless rooms are very clean and very small My 10 year old loves the fact that everything in the room can be controlled from an iPad in bed , We love the cafe and the energy The location is extremely convenient for Tate and theatres 
96182,citizenM London Bankside, Bathroom could be slightly bigger and doesn t feel very private but the finishes were top notch , Massive bed and great automation features in the room Rooms are small but comfortable self check in is fast and easy Excellent modern facilities and bar area Great place to base yourself 
96183,citizenM London Bankside, Bed was against the wall so person sleeping on that side had to climb over the other person if they needed to get up during the night Missed having tea coffee making facilities in the room and felt this could have been made more obvious prior to booking, Bed huge and very comfortable free mini bar when the lady helping us check in knew it was my partners Birthday she gave us a voucher for a free drink at the bar
96184,citizenM London Bankside, The room is too small for 2 large suitcases or longer stays , Excellent breakfast buffet very friendly staff clean modern desing comfortable bed centrally located 
96185,citizenM London Bankside, The bathroom in the middle of the room still bothers me but I ve been staying here over two years anyway The energy is terrific , Two tired teenagers and patient parents unanimously agreed the beds are super comfy and the movie choices fun Cheerful minimalism If you have to pick two colors red and white is terrific We also love the new free drinks option in addition to just water I was pleasantly surprised that body lotion or other small necessities are available at the front desk 
96186,citizenM London Bankside, Room felt a little too tight Fine for one person Would have felt crowded with two , Getting the full multi media experience was an interesting change for a hotel It s like a hotel pod The entire room is the width of the bed Good modern crash pad Decent breakfast too 
96187,citizenM London Bankside, The room is tiny It was hard to find space for our luggage and toiletries , Checkin was easy Loved the vibe when you walk in bar and lots of communal space Room was clean and comfy Very close to Tate modern and the borough market Also loved the iPads for music movies etc in the room

96190,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast options are very misleading, Got the impression that breakfast was include when booking However it was not clear what was included and what was not 
96191,citizenM London Bankside, Room was tiny and very cramped for two people with luggage, Hotel in excellent location very close to London s attractions Comfy bed and awesome shower Great breakfast buffet and really good strong barista made coffee
96192,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast could be better no fried eggs kinda pricey Website says everything in the room fridge is for free but there are no information what is actually in the fridge, I like the design and the ambience and location brilliant
96193,citizenM London Bankside, Make checkout at midday maybe 11am is a bit early for a high end hotel I would say , Breakfast was excellent rooms very clean and perfectly fine for a couple or solo person Staff were just the loveliest people very helpful and wonderful to talk to Fixed all our luggage storage dramas with a smile really would commend their customer service 
96194,citizenM London Bankside, Small room but enough No complaints , The hotel is really good Very modern and practical The rooms are small but enough for a couple The breakfast was really well served and in a fair price I had to work ovewr the weekend and the hotel had a very good structure for that internet printer iron room for my shirts The region is also fantastic with good restaurants close to the train and walking distance form the Shard 
96195,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing, Excellent location and typical great citizenM hotel Excellent vibe in bar and lounge area comfortable rooms with luxurious bedding They also have meeting rooms at this hotel so very convenient for business trips Will definitely stay there every time I go to London 
96196,citizenM London Bankside, Room was compact and overall well designed though I wasn t wild about the bed located under the window so it s only only possible to access on one side With two of you one has to crawl over the other to get out during the night , Great place very funky lots of atmosphere loved the technology controlling lights TV blinds etc with the i pad and changing the colour of the light in the shower Free items in the fridge Really helpful staff

96198,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are quite small which didn t bother us at all due to their clever design but I can see someone travelling with a child or celebrity quantities of luggage will probably find it an issue , Bed was large and very comfy staff were beyond helpful fixed any issue very quickly and made the atmosphere so pleasantly friendly
96199,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing to show what was on in London and lack of good quality food in the evening and no complementary coffee or tea no room service, Clean and good location
96200,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Very modern hotel small room but big bed All the details are designed very well the room is full of jokes and special effects like lightning in the shower smart alarm and many other things I really enjoyed staying here and highly recommend to other touristis
96201,citizenM London Bankside, Its a pity that there is no tea ort coffee in the rooms , Location in London and the D cor quite a modern outlook on Hotels which we found quite pleasant

96204,citizenM London Bankside, Shame there s no coffee in the room but appreciate there s lots more in there instead , Lovely huge bed very stylish room and a good space Love the gadgets 
96205,citizenM London Bankside, We were unable to switch off the air conditioning only able to set it to low , The design the interior the big bed a quite room and value for money 
96206,citizenM London Bankside, everything was great we did not eat breakfast in the hotel as it looked too pricey especially for a 7 year old who does not eat that much , Great room not big but had everything that needed and we had so much fun changing the lights using TV closing the blinds and having the obligatory pillow fight was there with my 7 year old daughter Very comfortable and huge bed Great selection of films 
96207,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, So quirky and fantastic Felt very personalised and nice to know that everyone has the same sized room Was like something out of the hunger games The rooms are small but the bed is big enough for four comfortably if you ask me The shower is incredible and the mood lighting is awesome Had a great time at this hotel and my sister agrees with me when we say we would definitely stay here again 
96208,citizenM London Bankside, The positioning of the bed and the washbasin out in the room Also electric socket unusually close to taps The iPad to control everything wasn t properly charged so ran out very quickly and was awkwardly positioned on bedside table Bit style over substance , The bed was very comfortable but only one side to get out Good shower complimentary drinks and snacks in fridge well chilled on a sweltering day good air con Great vibe in bar in foyer 
96209,citizenM London Bankside, the free wifi in the room mobile phone was not very strong, comfortable bed clean room super friendly staff good shower good atmosphere on the bar

96211,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The biggest bed I ever had in a hotel Very smart design of the room even though the room was pretty small you didn t need any more space due to the smart design 
96212,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , I loved the staff I also loved the eclectic nature of the hotel very modern but not so modern that my wife and I both 71 years old couldn t appreciate it The staff was outstanding all very young but very helpful and friendly Also liked the easy walking distance to the Thames River walk 
96213,citizenM London Bankside, Initially the compact feel and space of the room Air conditioning was just adequate but It was a very warm weekend Maybe an option for top sheets Donna in the summer is too warm, The common areas 24 7 dining Modern minimal styling in the rooms
96214,citizenM London Bankside, Cocktails at the lobby bar were a miss and late night staff seemed like the polar opposite of the daytime crew , Location really can t be beat with 3 Underground stations less than ten minutes away at a leisurely walking pace Check in was a breeze Tip you can pay in advance via the hotel website to save time and avoid the on site credit card fee The rooms are all identical with a huge comfortable bed They are small but are also incredibly efficient and spotless The mood pad rainfall shower international plugs and free mini fridge goodies restocked daily too made it feel really special Try an iced latte in the super swanky lobby for a refreshing treat and some people watching 
96215,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Everything in the room controlled by ipad Blind curtains lighting media AC etc Easy check in even easier check out faultless Biggest bed ive ever seen 
96216,citizenM London Bankside, The music in the lobby can be a bit loud and there is just one large comforter on the bed for two people which can be a bit small for tall people, Extremely helpful and friendly staff great location near the Tate Modern and the river comfortable bed very well designed high tech room lively neighborhood and relaxed welcoming atmosphere in the lobby
96217,citizenM London Bankside, We had a courtyard facing room so it was a bit loud in the evening as people were socializing downstairs in the courtyard Plus music in the lobby area was a bit loud and distracting if you were trying to work , Loved the friendly staff the bar the space to work the relaxed nature of the hotel the location and its proximity to great food outlets and landmarks 
96218,citizenM London Bankside, No kettle loose taps loose loo roll holder key card failed 3 times kept having to go to reception ended up staying in the room with no key card to get back in, Fridge
96219,citizenM London Bankside, Walls could have been a little cleaner , First time staying at a citizenM for those not in the know they re a much smaller hotel room but that just translates to coziness Room controlled by an iPad mini and excellent selection of free films 
96220,citizenM London Bankside, Nada Zero Nil Nothing Everything was awesome , This hotel is a big bunch of starburst magic The staff are amazing Especially Milan our cocktail shaker maker The ambience and the quirky nature of this particular hotel was a real treat and delight for us all The hotel concierge was informative and helpful the security at night was reassuring residents only after midnight the 24 7 bar open very nice the deli the sofas and comfy seating oh and the rooms just so much fun We were celebrating our 25th Wedding Anniversary and they left us sweets and flowers in our room just absolutely top class this is what I like to call good service Thank You Bankside we will definitely return x
96221,citizenM London Bankside, The bar staff were lovely and enjoyed a nice chat with them however it was hard to get away because they wouldn t stop talking , staff were very accommodating
96222,citizenM London Bankside, Bedroom layout fine for lone travellers or younger couples but awkward for senior couples , A trendy modern hi tech hotel not my usual style but nice for a change Friendly helpful staff in t shirts Comfortable double bed but occupying whole space at far end by window no space to walk round not so good for couples if needing to get up at night 
96223,citizenM London Bankside, Kettle in room they do want you to join in downstairs but occasionally it is nice to just chill with a tea in your room You can take a tray upstairs but Its not so convenient , The ambience of this place is really good friendly staff lively and welcoming area to sit alone or with friends Rooms are really fun great bed lighting heating and media control fluffy white towels free soft drinks water in fridge in room Help yourself food mix and match sort of pay as you go eating and drinking Good location with lots of restaurants and food shops culture 
96224,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The lobby is extraordinary Comfortable inviting and beautiful Small practical room intelligently designed Excellent coffee and good breakfast Plus travelling from Canada my room was available early in the morning as I flew in much appreciated 
96225,citizenM London Bankside, Felt a bit stuffy in the room Also could do with a ledge or shelf for the person sleeping next to the window to have a bottle glass of water at hand during the night , The size of the bed The lighting in the room The staff Great for a couple of nights and the atmosphere in the bar area downstairs is great I even got a free drink as it was my birthday and a hand made birthday card Thanks Citizen M 
96226,citizenM London Bankside, , simply everything great hotel beautiful design high tech modern innovative clean comfortable nice size rooms fantastic shower with chromotherapy I loved the technology from the check in inside the rooms where you control everyhing with an iPad such as curtains blinds lights shower chromolights etc everything in the mini bar is complimentary the hall is huge with great interior decorations a fantastic bar caf and inner garden great location too as it s right at the back of the Tate Modern Unfortunately I didn t have the chance to taste breakfast selection Highly recommended 
96227,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The staff at CitizenM were all very welcoming The breakfast was a great deal We loved the lattes and delicious croissants The room was quiet and comfortable we enjoyed the free movies available and of course the rain shower It was easy access to Borough Market from the hotel we ate at Fish twice during our stay Southwark tube station was close by as well 
96228,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, We stayed during the weekend of the attack on London Bridge I thought that the staff were incredible They were calm and reassuring and made everyone whether they were staying there or not feel welcome and safe So I really hope they receive the praise they deserve for representing the hotel so well Thank you 
96229,citizenM London Bankside, My only small issue is the restaurant bar prices I think the price of a pint or a glass of wine should be somewhat cheaper for hotel residents , Almost everything about CitizenM is to be liked great concept great staff nice location Room is as expected small but hugely functional and comfortable Free mini fridge contents always a nice thing 
96230,citizenM London Bankside, i would have preferred a bit more space and a separate bathroom it s modular pod and opportunity to open a window but this is a personal preference , facilities staff cleanliness bar are all good and bed was comfortable and huge 
96231,citizenM London Bankside, It s more of a niggle but not having a kettle or coffee maker in the room Their very trendy free mini bar though was great , The beds were very comfortable and the staff extremely helpful The whole design had a laid back but high tech feel the changeable mood lighting for instance 
96232,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are slightly small however this did not matter, Staff were very helpful hotel is very modern and in a very good location to all the main attractions in London Nice and fast check in check out 
96233,citizenM London Bankside, Leaving , Converted Citizen M users love the concept of the hotels so much more than most large ground floor area with masses to enjoy art books great bar comfy seating Room is as usual large bed Ipad controls for lights blinds media tv Good choice of films rain shower goodies in the fridge Close to Tate Modern and all South Bank area good to stroll day or night 
96234,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Very modern clean and comfortable The location was perfect across from M S for breakfast and easy walk to the Tate and to the tube I would definitely stay there again 
96235,citizenM London Bankside, Coming home after one night definitely be back , Everything the bar reception area very cool Nice atmosphere staff excellent and friendly Morning papers Room brilliant bed amazing decent shower too
96236,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Great location decent facilities if very small rooms But I found the Citzen M says mottoes all over the place terribly naff and the staff a little too superior when explaining how the place worked self service late night food it isn t obvious to newbies I d probably stay again however 
96237,citizenM London Bankside, Ummmm Maybe a few more boardgames in the lounge area Struggling to fault , Superb breakfast quirky and stylish hotel with a very laid back atmosphere and helpful friendly and funny staff A shame to leave 
96238,citizenM London Bankside, I ll be honest there was nothing I didn t like and I ve been raving about the hotel to anyone who would listen, The main purpose of my trip was to visit an exhibition at Tate Modern and this hotel couldn t be more conveniently placed There was plenty more to do that side of the river including visits to The Shard Borough Market and The Clink museum but with a bus stop just outside the hotel it was also very easy to get to the West End to watch a show 
96239,citizenM London Bankside, One sided access to bed but once in it it was large and comfortable , Great location near Tate Modern Borough Market and comfortable walking distance from London Bridge station Appealing modern ambience and comfortable public spaces Simple but stylish room everything worked 
96240,citizenM London Bankside, A couple of members of staff were a bit too groovy which translated as rude but only a couple Bed was fabulously comfy but the room very small which I know is all part of the ethos and is why there is such a wonderful space downstairs , The communal area was excellent very comfy with a quirky vibe and air of tranquility The breakfast was superb 
96241,citizenM London Bankside, NA, The welcome even though it was late evening was great and reassuring Sadly was not there long enough to try all the facilities but will definitely be back
96242,citizenM London Bankside, Mirror in front of desk always a bugbear of mine I like to sit down and do my make up Thats all , Location Excellent Bar and food availability excellent Staff were the best ever experienced in the world Room very small but perfect for one night Completely served it s purpose of a comfortable clean bed for the night near the place we wanted to visit Will use again 
96243,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , Absolutely gorgeous hotel modern excellent decor and friendly staff Room was perfect for our one night stay and breakfast was exceptional 
96244,citizenM London Bankside, The individual rooms were quite basic and felt a bit like an upmarket youth hostel Could only access the bed on one side which was a bit of a surprise Very different in style and tone from the downstairs public areas Could have been two different hotels , Location was great and the public areas were stylish and comfortable 
96245,citizenM London Bankside, The air condition was broken and I was met by a pool of water covering the floor as I got to the room at 01 00 AM The air conditioner continued to drip with high frequency during the whole night keeping me awake ,No Positive
96246,citizenM London Bankside, A few things Firstly I asked for 2 half pints of Heineken at the bar and was told it would cost 6 I handed over my card and the waitress took it over to the other side of the bar did contactless without asking and actually charged me 7 50 I later found out She was messing around with my card and chatting to people she even dropped it down the side of the till at one point so I ve actually cancelled my card just in case The other issue was I was woken up at 3 30am by water pouring through the air conditioning room 508 I had to put towels down and obviously it wasn t ideal When I mentioned this when I checked out the girl didn t really seem bothered they were far more pleasant and friendly on check in , The beds were extremely comfortable and the free wifi and films were brilliant
96247,citizenM London Bankside, The toilet and shower were positioned within a glass cubicle with coated glass the lighting depth and colour could be changed which is a fun feature but I would suggest that if you were a little shy of natural ablutions this is not the space for you Possibly a little too intimate maybe that s an English thing Maybe worth checking to see if all rooms are the same The sink was positioned in the main room area It sounds odd but it does work The shower provided good pressure and hot water , This hotel was in an excellent position with easy walking distance to the southbank and all that it offers The venue itself was modern and well thought out with access to all that you would require and zoned areas for sitting The bar is positioned for easy access to enjoy the atmosphere The staff were all extremely friendly polite and helpful I could not fault them We were able to store our bags in a safe area whilst we enjoyed the rest of our trip to collect later before heading home The room was clean and controlled by IPAD very easy to use Our room was a quite room and the bed took up the entire end of the room so very large and comfortable but not so easy access for both parties depending on how agile you are We enjoyed our stay very much and I would recommend and hopefully use again 
96248,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are a bit too small , Amazing staff beautiful well designed comfortable lobby Well equipped rooms with comfortable bad large TV WiFi all around 
96249,citizenM London Bankside, You couldn t open the window in the room so it felt like there was a lack of natural air which is something that I am personally not keen on However every thing else was great so it didn t take away from the enjoyment although I might think twice if I was staying in London for more than a couple of nights Also just one small point for couples maybe more for new couples the loo and shower is just an kind of pod in the room so not a proper bath room so perhaps a bit close for comfort if you are travelling with someone you are not completely at ease with , The whole experience was very positive and very straightforward The staff in all areas were very friendly and helpful The hotel is very cool with an amazing decor It is all very modern The rooms are quite small but they have thought of everything the hooks and shelves switches and plug sockets are all in the perfect spot so the designs of the room have been very well thought out The bed was extremely comfortable We had a very good stay Also the location is excellent You slap bang in between Waterloo Southwark and London Bridge Station all around a 10 min walk and 3 minutes from Southbank There are also loads of bars and restaurants in close proximity as well as Borough Market 
96250,citizenM London Bankside, The fact there was no free tea and coffee but no kettle in the room the fridge full did not quite make up for it Misleading , Great hotel in great location 
96251,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , Excellent room and very clean The room functions lighting temperature curtains work from an iPad and were faultless The room has a powerful shower the bed is huge and pillows are proper robust ones Staff are very friendly and helpful with no hint of insincerity The bar is very nice and a pleasure to drink in The breakfast costs extra but is very decent I shall return 
96252,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent location Something a bit different to the usual bland chain hotels Loved the decor loved the in room tech and choice of free films staff were really welcoming Room is not big but I would expect nothing better for this price in this location Highly recommend 
96253,citizenM London Bankside, The room was quite small and I would have been a bit unpleased if I had paid the full price for the room , The giant bed best bed ever the TV set the hotel lounge and the friendly and efficient staff 
96254,citizenM London Bankside, The room and bathroom are quite small, The bed was huge and extremely comfortable Staff were friendly and helpful Huge TV screen with good selection of films to choose from and liked the funky detail of the mood board basically an iPad that enables one to change lighting blinds curtains etc 
96255,citizenM London Bankside, No gym in the hotel and no park nearby to go running , The place to stay for hipsters the bar is nice and always busy breakfast is excellent including real French croissants 
96256,citizenM London Bankside, The room was quite small but perfectly formed Would have liked some room at window side of bed Also no space to walk around the bed Also no baths A bath would have been nice after a day of sightseeing Also didn t like the sight of a white ceramic dish with a ceramic gun sitting in it Too threatening an icon for such a welcoming hotel , The staff were wonderful and made you feel like a VIP We loved the quirkiness of the hotel There were roses left in our bedroom when we got back the first day with a little note to tell us we were the sweetest guests Nice bit of PR Very close to the Tate Gallery and the Thames The bed was comfortable and the fridge was full of goodies The towels were so thick and soft We will definitely stay at this unusual hotel again Thank you for looking after us so well 
96257,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Very modern stylish hotel Great location for the Tate and walks along the river Thames Lots of restaurants within a short walk and only 20 minute walk to London eye 
96258,citizenM London Bankside, Tiny room Sink in bedroom Tv noise from next room Rubber scrambled eggs at breakfast No restaurant Being forced to use bar area to try to relax small room and to have a coffee tea no kettles in rooms , Flashy styling features Good bed Friendly staff Good atmospher Good range if free cold drinks 
96259,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The room is quite small but guys it is just few minutes walking from the Shard you cannot have any better than that in that area The room was clean and everything was very high tech The minibar was included and that was a good surprise The staff is very helpful and kind If you can find a good offer it is worth of it 
96260,citizenM London Bankside, Tea coffee facilities in room would have been nice but that said a free mini bar with lovely waters and snacks made up for it, Effortless check in out very helpful and friendly staff Great rooms and the hotel has a funky fresh vibe that makes you feel happy right from the entrance
96261,citizenM London Bankside, Can t think of anything Hotel rooms are probably best suited for short stays only as they are functional but not designed for long term comfort, The immediate area is very urban and gritty There is a wonderful view of the Shard from the street outside but also from the inside when emerging from lift on upper floors The hotel is in a great location for exploring the south bank borough market etc
96262,citizenM London Bankside, Bathroom had dual shower head the rainfall shower head worked fine but I couldn t use the handheld one without water streaming from the rainfall shower head Everything else was fabulous , Loved the hotel design sleek modern luxurious Accessible location 8 10 minute walk from the Southwark and London Bridge tube stations and buses to Waterloo and Covent Garden stop at the nearest bus stop along Southwark Street There are supermarkets restaurants bars and pubs nearby Room and bathroom were very clean iPad room controls were easy enough to figure out The bed was very comfortable and pillows were just right Check in and check out were self service but quick and easy and there are staff that will be able to help with this 
96263,citizenM London Bankside, One couldn t open a window in the Bedroom and thus had to endure air conditioning which isn t ideal , Bedroom was comfortable quirky intimate and compact Location was perfect for getting around Area immediately around Hotel still has a local feel with some nice Restaurants Bars and Borough Market near London Bridge 
96264,citizenM London Bankside, That I had to leave, It is 2 minutes from the river and the Tate Modern Fantastic restaurants and food shopping nearby On the bus and train routes The hotel bar is spacious and cool Very nice cocktails 
96265,citizenM London Bankside, Like all hotels in London the price is quite high even without breakfast , The staff is uttermost helpful and provides you with all the necessary information In addition the hotel is very well located close to the tube and a lot of the main attractions The free minibar is also a big plus 
96266,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing I did not like , I stayed for a long weekend I loved the concept and design of the hotel The room was rather small but everything was available The staff was very friendly and helpful The hotel is located in a nice quite neighborhood with some restaurants around and not far from the tourist attractions I walked to most of the places or to Westminster to take the hop on hop off bus I really had a very enjoyable stay 
96267,citizenM London Bankside, rooms bit small but ok, stylish funny very nice and friendly always helpful especially considering London average prices this is the perfect choice check out the Borough Market very close you will love it
96268,citizenM London Bankside, The only downside was the food we arrived late in the evening and all that was available was a hot place with one meat dish and one vegetarian dish with salad bar It didn t look so appetising , Staff were extremely lovely and friendly couldn t do enough for you The funky rooms with the mood pad was a fabulous touch and the huge bed was so comfortable 
96269,citizenM London Bankside, Terrible customer service prior to the booking tried cancelling booking due to excepetional personal reasons Received zero help and then no repsonse at all Poor value for money massively over priced Room stuffy claustrophobic cramped and small Bathroom inpersonal Hard to breathe in mornings due to whatever setting the aircon is using no window to open Design of room terrible like being in a space capsule with florescent lighting Awful rude unaccomdating staff who fail to realise that youre a guest of the hotel youre not there for them they should be there for you espeically at the prices we are paying Would look into other options as there are plenty Would never stay at a CitizenM hotel again ,No Positive
96270,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The cleanliness and quietness of the rooms The iPad controls in the room The very comfortable bed The gorgeous shower The free drinks in the room fridge maybe they re testing the idea but it is a very clever idea costing them only few pounds but making people happy The very good 24 7 canteen downstairs which I used for breakfast and a quick snack one night The very nice and friendly staff both at the reception and at the canteen The clever check in and check out process I will come back 
96271,citizenM London Bankside, No complaints , The room was great but the mini i pad charger failed and we had to resort to old fashioned switches and TV remote Bed is very comfortable and everything needed in a small space works well 
96272,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Bed really comfy loved the iPad provided to change room temp blinds and choose ambience Free movies also Perfect location for London Bridge station and Borough Market
96273,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, We were celebrating my partner s birthday and they had decorated the room with balloons and given us a voucher for 2 free cocktails at the bar Really lovely touch
96274,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing my favourite place to stay on Bankside , Bed soft and squishy and just divinely comfy and the fabulous fragrance as you enter the reception area is sublime beautiful
96275,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing to complain about, Can not fault this hotel had a great weekend Check in was simple and easy our room was comfy and had a great media system that all other hotels should do Staff were friendly and very helpful
96276,citizenM London Bankside, No tea and coffee facilities in room No opening window so only air con to keep cool no fresh air Thought pricey given we had to pay extra for breakfast 13 95 each neither of us could have eaten anywhere near that value so they most definately made profit on that You also had to book yourself in and out so no staff to pay for that All teas and coffees had to purchased for the bar , Loved the simplistic interiors Staff were extremely helpful and polite Nice decor and mini fridge supplies Perfect location for Tube access and O2 Arena 
96277,citizenM London Bankside, The bed is high and only has access from one side You can t leave a side lamp on during the night It s all or nothing , The lounge is brilliant 
96278,citizenM London Bankside, Please turn down the music in the communal areas , London is our second stay at a CitizenM and it was wonderful again We discovered riding the buses in London instead of the tube the stops were very convenient Visit the Tate Modern in the evening right across the street The staff was very helpful 
96279,citizenM London Bankside, Over all the experience was really just wished we had tea making facilities in the room, Bed was super large Room was funky and loved the mood light facilities 
96280,citizenM London Bankside, iPad in the room didn t work well to function room technology iPad wouldn t charge well on the docking station Reported the problem and staff change me the iPad but unfortunately it still didn t work well in Rm438 , Friendly staff loved interior design and compact room design 
96281,citizenM London Bankside, The room was a little on the tight squeeze side reminded us of some French hotels we ve stayed in but bags can stored in a drawer under the bed Overall a touch spartan but otherwise very practical given the realties of traveling , Quick easy check in and check out Friendly helpful staff Free snack food and mineral water in the fridge Room temperature and air conditioning a little more human friendly than other hotels we ve stayed in Good bed Lots of eating options nearby and access to trains and buses A short walk to the wonderful Borough Market 
96282,citizenM London Bankside, Food choices at the hotel but this was just because I have Gluten and nut allergies, The d cor the mini bar ambience welcoming staff and location were fantastic
96283,citizenM London Bankside, Found rooms quite small and have to climb over each ot her to go to the loo, We loved the quirky decoration and my husband loved the lights in our room and the technical gadgets We definitely stay again 
96284,citizenM London Bankside, The eggs at breakfast I love eggs but was disappointed with these The rest of breakfast was fine though , Great atmosphere and fantastic value for money Felt very much at home Staff were great very helpful and friendly The coffee is so good and the bar too 
96285,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are a little small but very practical and worth it particularly if you want somewhere to simply sleep as opposed to spending a lot of time in your room Recommend the courtyard view rooms as not a lot to see on the city view from most rooms unless you are lucky to face the shard , The bar and decor are really cool The place has a lovely vibe and felt relaxed and a cool place to hangout Love the concept Very easy to check in and the bed was massive a very comfortable Great iron in the ironing room on every floor too 
96286,citizenM London Bankside, The bed having no surround meant we had to climb over each other to get out Breakfast did not look inviting so we ate elsewhere, The room was great having the ipad to control everything made it really easy The foyer was very inviting to hang out in as was the courtyard which we appreciated as smokers 
96287,citizenM London Bankside, As a primarily single traveller woman retired I have noticed over the last 5 years of solo travel the lack of customer service offered by young women primarily wait staff as in bar or restaurant staff In this 3 night stay I encountered 3 different women working in the bar and 3 different men working in the bar I usually have a pre dinner Prosecco and a post dinner Prosecco or tea as well as morning coffee I was served 7 times at the bar Four were positive as in acknowledge me even when serving someone else 2 men and 1 woman the other three were no one else being served but a she can wait attitude no greeting and surly service I am a pleasant person and I am not interested in chatting with wait staff about my day just want to place my order and be provided with wait service The last service that I received after attending the theatre made me realize that I am unwilling to remain silent If a man treated me in the manner in which the young woman served my after theatre prosecco I would have said he was a misogynist I concluded the young woman took exception to the fact that I am a white older woman I was not greeted the woman reluctantly left her conversation with another client at the bar who was young and male and halfway through his beverage poured the glass of Prosecco did not fill the glass regarded me intently and took my payment all without speaking one word Although two other women had provided surly service none had provided me with service without speaking a word I already knew the cost of the beverage and had my cash payment ready got it ready while I was waiting for service I was 2 feet from the other customer and did not ask to be served I made eye contact with the wait staff and waited I made a complaint the next morning giving the time of my purchase to the front desk staff who apologized and expressed concern Unfortunately I did not bother to read the name tag , I always enjoy Citizen M the room works for me and the common space is excellent This particular location is great especially as this trip all of our visits to museums the TATE Shakespeare were within walking distance The front desk staff is as usual excellent 
96288,citizenM London Bankside, The pod style room room was functional but small although not a problem for one night Main issue though was the bed although very big and comfortable it literally took up one whole side of the room so the person sleeping on the inside had to climb over the other to get out We managed ok but obviously this could be problem for some people hence the only reason I have marked it down on comfort obviously they may not all be like this so would ask Also although there were cold drinks and snacks on the house which was nice it is always good to have tea and coffee making facilities although don t think there would have been room , Quirky and fun fresh and modern attractively designed hotel Massive bar and lounge area Very good value this was half price deal If you are in a hurry it is very good as you can use one of the many check in computers and do it all yourself although they are there to help I would definitely stay again Great location for Borough Market area 
96289,citizenM London Bankside, That breakfast wasn t included, A really great vibe from the moment you arrive Visually stunning internally great rooms and facilities I m a Citizen M convert 
96290,citizenM London Bankside, We were told bar was 24 hour and around 11 30pm we were refused alcoholic drink as my partner was to drunk already this wasn t the case at all as we had just come from having dinner at the shard We Didn t expect such rudeness and found it quite embarrassing and didn t really no what to say Everything else was great and we were very impressed would stay again , Room facilities were excellent loved the mood lighting and the use of the iPad Bed was really comfy and spacious Loved the black out blinds 
96291,citizenM London Bankside, Room might be a little small for two but great if you re staying by yourself , TV lights curtains all controlled with an iPad mini Checkin checkout was self service but staff assisted Interior design was great Bar staff were friendly 
96292,citizenM London Bankside, The bathroom is a glass frosted cubicle in the room a little more privacy would be nice The breakfast is overpriced but then again this is the same in most hotels , The hotel is in a great location just behind the Tate Modern and is within walking distance of lots of London attractions The room is soundproofed so there is no noise from other rooms The bed is very comfy The overall style of the hotel is very modern and trendy We stay in this hotel every time we go to London 
96293,citizenM London Bankside, I suppose no parking but the IBIS nearby is fine and a short walk , Friendly staff wonderful decor slightly hippy vibe great rooms large bed i pad control of lighting etc HD t v clean and smelled wonderful throughout breakfast was excellent in fact all outstanding and will be going again 
96294,citizenM London Bankside, The breakfast team were too slow Took forever to get your coffee and one morning they gave my order to someone else and I had to wait all over again , Loved the location and the decor 
96295,citizenM London Bankside, No complaints, Very customer orientated Living areas were great free drink posted through the door as one of 6 lucky customers forgot my toothbrush so received one complimentary good range of movies free to the room soft drinks in the minibar all free Nothing bad to say we are staying here on our next trip to London 
96296,citizenM London Bankside, Room very small and cramped Bed squashed against wall which wasn t ideal for getting in and out of bed It felt like being in a tiny caravan Our city view was a view of the rooms opposite so needed to keep blind down for privacy hence making the room dark Hardly any staff around very minimalistic no tea and coffee facilities in room although a mini bar with a few very strange drinks that were not to our liking The bathroom was a toilet and shower in a cubicle which wasn t very private and the basin was in the bedroom Very bizarre hotel and not certainly worth the money , Quick check in
96297,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast we too expensive We never paid for it because we could get the same thing much cheaper else where , Great Shower loved the ipad controller and though the mattress was too hard for us we really like the size of the bed and the pod like feel We enjoyed the library lounge type feel of the bar area as well 
96298,citizenM London Bankside, In general I like the Citizen M Concept but I did not care much for Citizen M Bankside Our bathroom floor flooded whilst taking a shower Room smelled old had not been ventilated or properly cleaned Prices in bar very steep even for London standards Breakfast overpriced and nothing special , Staff very friendly and helpful We liked the communal areas Relaxed atmosphere and international vibe 
96299,citizenM London Bankside, It would be nice to be able to get a coffee in your room but it s a tiny quibble More UK TV and radio channels would have been nice too But honestly a tiny quibble, The staff were amazing and the bar was just spot on 
96300,citizenM London Bankside, If you are looking for spacious rooms with good facilities then this is not the hotel for you The room was VERY SMALL indeed the room is the width of the bed and the toilet and shower facilities were behind a glass screen door rather than in a separate bathroom Space was at such a premium that the sink was actually in the bedroom There was no room to store suitcases other than on the floor and no enclosed clothes hanging space merely a clothes rail with very limited hanging space On arriving in our room we found that there are no tea coffee facilities a major omission but there is a fridge stocked with a limited range of soft drinks However the fridge was not working and we reported this to a member of staff to no avail Many of the innovative features in the room are operated through an iPad Blinds temperature lights TV but the tablet would not hold its charge indeed after an all day charge it was still holding less than a 25 charge which meant that it lasted barely a few hours before it needed recharging making it almost useless This is not a hotel that I would stay in again , This is a very modern hotel in a good location for access to central London 
96301,citizenM London Bankside, Londen is expensive I have to get used to this , I like the personal attitude towards customers and the fact that I can work in the lobby And print stuff I come back for sure 
96302,citizenM London Bankside, Stayed at citizenM Bankside London for 5 nights room size is slightly small for the length of stay don t like the idea that the sink is located outside the bathroom The hotel is overpriced considering the small room size and no gym facilities , The smart centralized control panel on iPad is a plus point Staff are attentive 
96303,citizenM London Bankside, Bartender lacks the most basic knowledge of wine Not a bit deal but little surprising how the choice could only be explained in North American grap varietal terms , I m a picky mega traveler and try to avoid staying in London hotels which are generally very bad This was an all round amazing experience 
96304,citizenM London Bankside, Very small rooms You have to step over your bed partner when visiting the toilet at night There are no independent light buttons Moreover the electronic room control system did not work properly , Nice location 
96305,citizenM London Bankside, No issues with anything, Unusual hotel room It felt a bit pod like but it was clean and functional The bed was comfy and the shower good The reception areas downstairs were very funky and good use of space 
96306,citizenM London Bankside, It couldn t, We have stayed here many times before and always loved the place This time my back went out and I couldn t move The staff were amazing One of the cleaners helped my partner get me down the stairs and one of the girls from reception helped get me to the taxi Amazing helpful and friendly staff Thanks guys
96307,citizenM London Bankside, Becoming slightly tired in the rooms shower wasn t very powerful , Modern and we ll positioned cool modern design very friendly and polite staff 
96308,citizenM London Bankside, The bar area got quite busy and they could have done with an extra pair of hands but the all staff were friendly smiley and helpful , Loved the chill out areas and the quirkiness of the hotel 
96309,citizenM London Bankside, There was a part of smashed glass in the wall which was not cleaned in room 423 Except from that all is perfect , The hotel is pretty central The room is not super big but very convenient and very technologic The mini fridge is included in the price and the funny thing is all the messages adressed to CitizenM The bar is cosy and the personnel is super friendly 
96310,citizenM London Bankside, Maybe more staff at the reception even it s self check in, Big surprise for this price very good design good experience interesting details free movie and mini bar 
96311,citizenM London Bankside, facilities and location fabulous but room very noisy facing road despite requesting one away from road and at a high level experience spoilt by this,No Positive
96312,citizenM London Bankside, Inconvenienced by not having access to both sides of bed Being over 60 we have more visits to toilet over night so there was quite a bit of crawling over each other overnight,No Positive
96313,citizenM London Bankside, There were no tea and coffee making facilities the in room which I ve come to expect as most hotels do have them and the iPad room control had a faulty connection so wasn t charging properly , The hotel was interesting and uniquely designed clean and also easily accessible The lounge and bar area was also very cool 
96314,citizenM London Bankside, The room was noisy from street traffic all night and nearby building work early morning I will definitely insist on a room at the back of the hotel next time , The location is great within easy walking distance of the city The staff are super friendly and helpful and the food and wine is of a very good quality without being expensive 
96315,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The hotel is completely unique never been to a hotel like it before Although the rooms were small they were big enough for the 2 of us without getting under each others feet The added bonus of the free drinks were great After travelling all morning the last thing I wanted was to have to find a drink or carry one up from the bar with luggage The staff were all really friendly and went above and beyond to help us with our stay The movies included were also brilliant for ending a long day We did have breakfast here there was a good selection of hot and cold items which helped to kick start our day 
96316,citizenM London Bankside, We were at the front of the hotel on a low floor and it was really noisy You could hear everything outside and even though it was a Sunday night it sounded like building works were going on all night They did offer us to change room but by then our baby was asleep and waking her to move would have been even more trouble Rooms are very small and beds not great if there are 2 of you as one of you has to climb over the other to get out of bed , Hotel is really stylish Bed was super comfy Location is great for Tate etc Rooms look great but as the shower loo is basically a glass cube in the room its definitely better for one person or two people that know each other really well 
96317,citizenM London Bankside, Pricey breakfast, Free WiFi and I measured over 80 Mbs that s fast Breakfast was OK but pricey Check in and out is a breeze and there s help if needed Foyer is buzzing unlike many other hotels where you can t wait to get out 
96318,citizenM London Bankside, Expensive if I am allowed to say that for London , Good staff people staying comfy bed and pillow lots of free movies to pick from free iced tea lemonade water and 2 fruit bars in the fridge
96319,citizenM London Bankside, The room was a little tight on space getting ready With one doing Make up in the mirror and one needing to shave , The location space downstairs bar area size of bed and staff more than made up for it I look forward to staying again 
96320,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Amazing hotel with incredible service and staff it was my GF s birthday and they went out of their way to make our stay great including a complimentary bottle of champagne Great rooms lovely beds I can t say enough good things about this place 
96321,citizenM London Bankside, The room was SO SMALL The bathroom wasn t an actual room but a see through capsule like thing where you don t have any privacy if u r travelling as a couple The sink unit was located outside from the bathroom capsule so that was very uncomfortable , Its a very welcoming hotel the staff was very nice and helpful Always with a smile The lobby was always full of people drinking and having fun It was less than 10 minutes walk to London Bridge underground so that was great 
96322,citizenM London Bankside, That I could no stay for ever , The attention to detail is astonishing The People working there are so friendly I felt so relaxed did not want to leave We felt like rockstars 
96323,citizenM London Bankside, No kettle altho free water was in rm and couldn t work out how to switch off the mood lighting so felt a bit too bright during the night but these are slight niggles, Fantastic location and was spotlessly clean throughout Comfy bed once you get used to feeling like you ve entered a spaceship as everything is done via iPad Closes your curtains blinds mood lighting very surreal 
96324,citizenM London Bankside, Time was up , Just loved the place New modern design compact rooms with all ipad controlled features Fridge got free goodies Lounge and restaurant area is just fun to hang around Employees all friendly and helpfull Will try other hotels of this fairly new chain 
96325,citizenM London Bankside, Room is a bit small, Beautiful and original Very new and clean Very convenient room with Iphone chargers adaptors etc Great location Nice living room area with bar wifi desks etc
96326,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing Rooms are small but you know that in advance Also know that windows in the room cannot be opened No nice outside views Bankside Citizen M because surrounding buildings are too tall No worries but if you are looking for a nice view maybe try another CitizenM in London , Atmosphere was lovely Sometimes really loud in the shared spaces but once in the room it was all quiet So the choice is yours Great toolset in the rooms with the tablet Nice gesture that the drinks in the fridge are for free Food breakfast was honest Location was perfect 
96327,citizenM London Bankside, Room was supposed to be city view it wasn t I pad to control the room wasn t charged and when placed on charge the screen was permanently on which was irritating while trying to sleep , Great location simple check in room clean tidy and comfortable Nice bar downstairs too which did a half decent espresso martini
96328,citizenM London Bankside, I went out of the room and when I went back my keys did not work until I pay As much as they have the right to get their money its not a hospital approach They should deducted the money directly upon check in Now that they forget they should do that at check out , Liked the lights and the ambiance
96329,citizenM London Bankside, While the cafe is lovely I m not a big fan of buffets and theirs was very British so would have preferred an a la carte service for breakie I ended up going round the corner to Table which was excellent for breakie each morning , I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the CitizenM I had never stayed there before and they kind of blew me away with their kind of co working space and cafe with hotel rooms concept It was seriously comfortable the staff were lovely and the rooms while small and some sort of capsule version of living in a space station lol were very well appointed seriously comfortable and could have everything you could ask for I really really liked it Problems in my room were dealt with promptly and efficiently and I thought the staff were top notch My general impression of London hotels is of getting ripped off and paying through the nose for a not so great stay CitizenM kinda changed my mind about staying in London Definitely my new go to hotel when forced to stay in Ol Blighty Location next to the Tate and some of the great dining of Bankside also quite appreciated nb I had a deep discount on the room so thought it was quit the value for money Not sure how I d feel about their standard rack rate 
96330,citizenM London Bankside, Would have liked there to be subtitles for the movies as well as for the TV as I am deaf and it meant that we couldn t watch a movie However the fire alarm went off in the night and it woke me up as it had a red flashing light so that was a good thing , The room was very comfortable and clean minimalist in size but I expected that from the info given on the website I felt the space was well used The room was great fun I enjoyed changing the colours of the lights in the bathroom Wonderful lounge and breakfast tea and coffee Also I asked staff to put a note saying Happy Birthday Peter in our room as a surprise for my husband they put up lots of greetings and pictures and left a little pastry with a candle it was a lovely generous touch thank you I would love to stay again 
96331,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Great breakfast excellent location helpful staff and comfortable bed There are hotels with larger rooms in London however everything required for a comfortable stay is provided I would stay here again 
96332,citizenM London Bankside, Shower wasn t very powerful and a little disappointed not be able to make a hot drink in the room , Having requested a room with a view to celebrate my birthday I was definitely not disappointed and was blown away by my balloons and extra bag of little goodies Very thoughtful and made for a very special visit Also a very comfy bed and very friendly staff 
96333,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, We loved our stay The room was a bit snug but that was well communicated during the booking process so that was no surprise The bed was huge and incredibly comfortable something I really valued after an exhausting first leg of my trip The property was very cool and modern and incorporated technology into the function of the room We loved having the iPad controls 
96334,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent Staff and Hotel Quiet location only ten minutes walk to Borough Market and St Pauls Staff 10 10 All the rooms controlled by an I Pad amazing 
96335,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are just a little too small and if more than one person bathroom privacy is a definite issue , Love the hotel location staff and just everything about it really 
96336,citizenM London Bankside, Quite abit of walking from the nearest underground but that is manageable , Modern room Super XL bed Right opposite to M S and Tesco is just around the corner walking distance to Borough market
96337,citizenM London Bankside, A la carte rather than buffet breakfasts and more options would have totally put this over the top , Staff were really nice and the rooms while small and capsule esque were surprisingly and fully appointed with free movies free minbars etc It takes a second to get used to since it feels like you re living in a future space station in the rooms but it gets surprisingly comfy quick Quite the fan now after staying there Oh and loved the co working space esque living room and bar Ver comfy to get real work done while there 3
96338,citizenM London Bankside, The bed linen felt a bit scratchy and itchy Probably would feel a bit tight on space after a day or two For a business overnight stay it was just right Not enough local restaurants I m sure that will come , Fantastic customer service from the staff in the lobby Great vibe in the bar area with amazing artefacts books and funky sofas and places to sit The room was small yes but I knew that would be the case otherwise it was perfectly formed Loved controlling everything from the iPad and also having free movies The shower was great 
96339,citizenM London Bankside, I know I m being really picky I m finding it hard to think of any negatives but maybe there could have been two chairs instead of one , Easy checkin friendly staff free non alcoholic minibar with quality organic drinks sophisticated iPad based control of lighting and temperature well designed room spotlessly cleaned with no disruption Great lobby cafe free papers 
96340,citizenM London Bankside, My only complaint was the size of the room it felt like a shoebox This is fine for 1 night but not so great for more than that , The public places were great The bed was comfotable

96344,citizenM London Bankside, We didn t have breakfast as 13 seemed a little too pricey however if it was cheaper we would have done Other than that everything was perfect , The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was clean and exactly as described on the website Staff were helpful and friendly which made our stay a pleasant one We will definitely stay again 
96345,citizenM London Bankside, Our room 306 loved the location and quiet but whilst it had a lovely double bed it was under the window so one of us had to climb over the other to get out of bed , The staff without exception were friendly and always helpful Also loved the lobby area where one could sit have great coffee and read whilst watching the world go by Area Well laid out to encourage people to work chat and feel at home Great music too
96346,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The breakfast was good value and very tasty The communal areas were relaxed and easy Whilst compact and efficient the rooms provided for everything you really need for a short stay 
96347,citizenM London Bankside, Location seemed a little sketchy but otherwise excellent hotel and staff , Excellent staff who go ABOVE AND BEYOND their call of duty very comfortable bed subway 10 min walk away 
96348,citizenM London Bankside, Would have liked fried eggs with breakfast rather than nasty scrambled egg that was watery yuck However rest of breakfast was BRILLIANT , Very nice comfortable and fun hotel funky We loved it Great bedroom 
96349,citizenM London Bankside, It was perfect in every respect , This is a fantastic hotel It s quite central and is a short walk from the tube and from the South Bank and Tate Modern The room is perfectly designed with great facilities relatively small but a great use of space It was nice and quiet too The bed was clean and comfortable Great wifi extensive TV and film choice all free great shower with your choice of mood lighting All the room facilities are controlled by IPad The staff are great very cheerful and chatty Lots of nice touches such as free soft drinks in your in room fridge The lobby area has board games and a nice bar and seating area with lots of quirky features

96351,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Service and staff were great and friendly Cheapest rooms are quite small but remain ideal for a short trip and provide a good option for a one or two nights stay The lobby and common areas are beautiful and well decorated and the proximity with the Tate and the Thames is definitely a 
96352,citizenM London Bankside, Would have liked to be able to make tea and coffee in the room, An excellent hotel loved all the additional touches via the iPad Very friendly and helpful staff Excellent location 
96353,citizenM London Bankside, As with all these sorts of hotels more effort could have been made to enclose the bathroom for privacy We are very good friends so it wasn t a problem though it shouldn t really have been a consideration , The location was great The room was small and functional but effort had been made to make it comfortable and stylish Checking in out was really easy and I appreciated being able to pick my room on arrival The free list of films to watch was a welcome bonus especially as there were plenty of new releases included 
96354,citizenM London Bankside, very tight fit in the room guess this allows them to fit more in At least it is reflected in the pricing , a short strole from borough markets and some good restaurants 
96355,citizenM London Bankside, Can t complain about anything , Massive bed with free mini bar and all the films you can imagine For free The staff were friendly on arrival with an easy hassle free check in The decor of the whole hotel was quirky bright and modern and the bar was the icing on the cake 
96356,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Stylish modern loved the iPad controls in the room Staff were very friendly Cocktail bar win win Location was ideal we walked from Waterloo no need for the tube Would love to come back 
96357,citizenM London Bankside, The room we had the first night was very hot and we were not able to lower the temperature The second night we had another room which was better , I love the concept of this hotel as it is different and very nice The staff is just great 
96358,citizenM London Bankside, I wanted to send a package ahead of my stay it would have arrived about less than a week before I arrived but staff declined Not complaining just a word of advice for other travellers not to choose this hotel if you have the need to receive a package before you arrive , Mood lamp modern atmosphere
96359,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The lobby is amazing and the auto check in check out machines are great The room is equipped with all kinds of gadgets which can be controlled on the iPad in the room The curtain the light the color of the light the tv the temperature almost everything 
96360,citizenM London Bankside, I know hotel breakfasts are never cheap so I shouldn t complain but with everything else about this hotel being so great I d have loved to have had breakfast there too only I couldn t justify spending 28 a day for the two of us , Hotel staff are usually nice but usually because they have to be CitizenM s staff though are the absolute nicest most welcoming staff I ve ever known It also has the only hotel lobby bar that I ve ever actually wanted to spend time in Oh yeah and the room itself was great too as is the location I ve travelled all over the world and this is honestly my new favourite hotel anywhere 
96361,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing D, Loved everything about this hotel Super friendly staff great location and an amazing room was my first time to london and it couldn t have been more perfect x
96362,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Room was cozy with a bed really big and comfortable bathroom big with a good shower I really like the fact to control everything tv lights shutters by an Ipad 
96363,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing to dislike , Fantastic hotel with a really relaxed welcoming atmosphere and very clever customer friendly gadgets this concept will not disappoint you 
96364,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Good fun you get to control the colour of the lights the curtains and blinds from an ipad equivalent Free mini bar Room a bit like living in space 
96365,citizenM London Bankside, would be even better if the free mini bar had a little something alcoholic in it, the bed was enormous and very comfy and the breakfast was tasty we loved the control pad lighting and free movies 
96366,citizenM London Bankside, The control of all the lights and blinds using the iPad was heavily over engineered It proved impossible for us to switch on one or two of the lights without using the iPad although there were wall switches I could switch lights off physically but not on There was only a single bed side light which meant that one of us could read at night but not the other For some reason it was also impossible to switch off the aircon so there was a cool breeze blowing over us all night even with the temperature set at a maximum Perhaps this was a fault with the equipment , Reception area location and facilities were fine for our single night s stay The staff were very helpful and friendly Everywhere was extremely clean The bedroom although small was comfortable apart from the lighting arrangement 
96367,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast There was only one egg cooking option every day scrambled Also I didn t like the quality of bacon parched and hard to cut There could have been some more breakfast choices like pancakes fried eggs etc Some day I chose to eat at Breakfast Club close to hotel which had many options and amazing pancakes Cleanliness The room cleanliness was disappointing The floor had fluff and hairs The bed also was full of hair all the days even after they cleaned it And what was more disappointing some hair wasn t from me , Amazing staff Loved them Overall nice fresh and modern hotel
96368,citizenM London Bankside, No room service and I found the room a bit too small, When I book a hotel i expect room service as standard as i was working having to go out for a decent meak is not ideal What was on offer at the canteen Christmas day for lunch was pathetic
96369,citizenM London Bankside, A kettle maybe but really there are coffee shops everywhere including the hotel, The staff so friendly the hotel so quirky and a fridge full of goodies and free movies All good Oh yea and great cocktails and I loved the video in the lift 
96370,citizenM London Bankside, Pillows not great Bed in funny position No reading light near window Window doesnt open Sink not in BR Bit small but ok for 1 night , Clean Lobby great Staff very helpful
96371,citizenM London Bankside, Not much, Excellent facilities very comfortable good location 5 mins walk from London Bridge Stations Southwark tube Free soft drinks in the room Shower works perfectly Very welcoming and helpful staff 
96372,citizenM London Bankside, It could have been cleaner Especially area between bed and window there was dust flying around Breakfast was good but not worth it Coffee was cold even though it was made a minute ago I d recommend grabbing a coffee elsewhere there are lots of coffee shops around , Location is good Internet of things inside the room was interesting and room was bigger than I ve expected Towels were changed every day Stuff was great they helped me catch a cab in 5 am Overall experience was nice 
96373,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are a little small but a good efficient use of space Checking in and out is done on a computer lacks a personal touch but this is being picky I can understand why it is done, Very cool hotel concept and excellent decor throughout 
96374,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Fantatsic location only 5 minutes from borough market and connections from London Bridge Loved the style and design across the hotel I ll be staying again that s for sure 
96375,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The location is great We walked everywhere and it was perfect to travel from London City Airport too We loved the design The walls are thick so you can t hear other guests and it s fun to be changing colours and control all the media via tablet We loved the check in easy and relaxed 
96376,citizenM London Bankside, The room was smaller than expected but well designed and clean The food was a bit pricey for being a warm buffet style offering but there are plenty of local restaurants No kettle , Funky and fun with a spacious art filled lounge to relax in Generous free in room drinks A big bed in a central location The choice of decently priced gluten free cakes was great 
96377,citizenM London Bankside, The living part of the room is just too small It is about 50 50 with bathroom space which makes it a bit strange, Breakfast was okay Self service and staff were just awesome

96383,citizenM London Bankside, I had stayed at the same hotel 2 years ago I didn t avoid noticing this time some problems regarding cleanliness too much dust and hair from previous guests upon arrival , Nice warm welcoming atmosphere Excellent personal at the reception Good location convenient traffic by bus metro 
96384,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are small very well designed and have everything you could need but small I felt it was a little like living in an airstream caravan , The staff were very friendly and helpful With our being first timers at this hotel the self service check in could have been daunting but a member of staff was there to guide us through The hotel has a great sense of style and a good buzz from all age groups The 24 hour bar cafe is a great plus and has many areas so you can have privacy or be amongst people if you choose

96394,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms lights are very bright almost neon but this is a small point Also took me a while to work out how to totally close down the screen on the iPad, very funky feels alive and fits in well with Bankside
96395,citizenM London Bankside, A couple of the male staff were a bit grumpy to say the least , The whole ground floor reception and bar area is brilliant Perfect for a chat a drink or just to chill and read 
96396,citizenM London Bankside, No tea or coffee facilities in room which I hadn t realised Rooms are small and the bathroom isn t very private from the rest of the room We had 3 rounds of drinks at the hotel bar and each time it cost a different amount even though we had exactly the same Also the bar service was quite slow , Good location for Borough Market and the Southbank area Quirky hotel with all room facilities lights tv blinds etc controlled by an ipad 
96397,citizenM London Bankside, No kettle in room so nowhere to get a tea coffee without going down to the restaurant and paying for it IPAD to control lights blinds TV etc was a bit slow fiddly Room very small and basin in room rather than bathroom Rooms at front suffer from road noise , Big comfy bed Really good coffee in restaurant Excellent number position of plug charger points in room Good selection of free munchies soft drinks in fridge in room

96399,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, After some unfortunate technical difficulties with the automated check in and then the i pad room controls created an initial negative impact upon tired travelers the staff were amazingly helpful and friendly and the rooms and super large bed was lovely The bar area downstairs is a great place to relax or enjoy a drink but does get very busy during the mornings 
96400,citizenM London Bankside, The room s small and unconventional Which is fine as long as that s what you re expecting , Really unusual but very well thought through A great experience 
96401,citizenM London Bankside, Check in was a massive pain It took us a solid 5 minutes to find our reservation as it wasn t recognising any of the info we put in , Bed was super comfortable room was excellent albeit a bit small Had a courtyard room which I recommend as it is really quiet 
96402,citizenM London Bankside, The size of the room is quite small i would have appreciated a few extra square meters , Very lively common areas yet quiet and confy rooms Minibar included in the price of the stay Movies included as well Overall a very nice sensation 
96403,citizenM London Bankside, Bathroom walls are translucent and made of glass so if you re not really close to your sharing partner you could feel a bit self conscious , Huge comfortable bed Loved playing with the mood lighting Free movies
96404,citizenM London Bankside, Prices can get high at times but this is true throughout London , Well styled modern and lively hotel The large comfortable common areas are great for work and relaxing The rooms are small but very efficient and comfortable Location is great and the staff are really warm 
96405,citizenM London Bankside, Should have had tea and coffee making in room I was there for a week and had to go down three floors for a cardboard cup of boiling water each time I wanted a cuppa The barista burnt himself twice and it was really inconvenient especially as the lifts were down to one , It was relaxed and fun 
96406,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The overall contemporary style the range of informal sitting areas around the hotel and the excellent but reasonably priced food Friendly and interesting staff 
96407,citizenM London Bankside, More pillows would be good as would hair conditioner Wish you could open a window as despite putting the AC to the lowest setting the room was quite hot , Loved the atmosphere of the hotel and staff excellent and super friendly Bed was amazingly comfortable

96412,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The Only thing we didn t really like was the bed It was too soft for our backs CitizenM should consider having a few orthopedic beds for customers who need them Apart from the soft bed everything else was fantastic as usual 
96413,citizenM London Bankside, Prices in bar were extortionate, The rooms are so relaxing massive super comfy bed large screen tv mood lights everything controlled by iPad so easy
96414,citizenM London Bankside, One lift was out of order leaving only the one lift in operation the lift is also very slow and consequently the wait times were excessively long , Fantastically positive helpful staff with a cool funky atmosphere and layout giving you a sense of not just another bland chain hotel Excellent espresso great breakfast and a really good bar that you can sit at without feeling like you are in a hotel bar 
96415,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast would have been better if included in price Mini bar options were lovely but could ve maybe been better with extra water and simpler juice options A little more comfortable seating in the bar area would have been welcome also , Staff went the extra mile and were welcoming and friendly Food was delicious and the room was warm cosy comfortable and funky with the included mood pad We booked as a honeymoon and found a lovely welcome note with a bottle on ice and cake Very impressed and will definitely visit again 
96416,citizenM London Bankside, No tea or coffee in room although there was a free mini bar of soft drinks and a good coffee bar downstairs , Helpful friendly staff great location for Bankside with lots to see and do within walking distance Great for Shard Tate Modern Borough Market St Pauls and South Bank Walking distance to London Bridge and Blackfriers Rooms small but well designed Self check in could have felt impersonal but didn t because friendly staff were on hand Modern feel and branding but great atmosphere 
96417,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast was too expensive No shower caps or sanitary bags in the rooms Female guests shouldn t have to make a special request for such items , At 13 95 per person we thought that the breakfast was just too expensive We went out locally and got a great breakfast for 12 95 for both of us 
96418,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , Great location for the Tate Only 4 stops to the West End Interesting area to explore Terry s Cafe great for breakfast Easy to and from Gatwick 
96419,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are just too small felt a little colosterphobic found hair in our bed also , The entrance of the hotel is bright and big and nice chilled out area
96420,citizenM London Bankside, Bold idea to separate wash basin from bathroom the water splatters from wash basin can be annoying, Innovative design room control with ipad nice lighting free minibar catchy phrases good cafe bar
96421,citizenM London Bankside, There was a bit of banging from the room above but nothing else , This is a great hotel that never fails to disappoint between the decor staff and central location

96423,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The bed was really comfy and I loved controlling everything in the room from an iPad The lounge and bar areas were welcoming and friendly Great for working or relaxing 
96424,citizenM London Bankside, Couldn t get the temperature low enough Didn t sleep well on the bed Room was small so had a hard time finding room for my luggage even with the great under bed drawer Good compact use of space but much smaller than expected , The telly and entertainment system were great Best of any hotel I ve ever visited This system is the most likely reason I would go back The bed was a very good size The room was dark for sleep There was food and such available downstairs The free drinks in the fridge was a nice touch 
96425,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , We loved the look and feel of this hotel Not the normal interior design and style but really had that hugge feel Beautiful location Ideal for us Great room with comfy bed and gorgeous soft Egyptian cotton towels Didn t mind not having a kettle in the room The coffee from MCanteen was divine and worth the walk downstairs to purchase 
96426,citizenM London Bankside, The impressions made by the website arrival into the lobby public areas set you up for high expectations Unfortunately it falls flat once you head upstairs The corridors are dark dusty despite a hoover being left in the corridor with the cables all over the floor causing a porential trip hazzard Further disappointed in the bedroom a small box with a platform bed surrounded on 3 sides by walls glass up one end no space to walk around so you have to clamber up over the bed the way it is set up there is only one bedside light No windows to open you have to keep the blinds curtains down for privacy causing more of a claustrophobic feeling The shower unit is more like a steam room as soon as you take a shower causing the toilet paper towels to become damp cold water dripping from the roof On top of this the room had not been dusted properly with dust on the glass shelves mirror The room was not at all inviting or enticing to stay in no matter how much gadgetry there is Oh check your docking station when cleaning the room so that the iPad is charged enough to operate the room facilities , On the plus side Emilio at check out was exceptional Xander on check in was efficient 
96427,citizenM London Bankside, The room was too hot and the air conditioning did not work My card key did not work anymore and I had to go back and forth 4 times because every time I was told now it works The 4th time someone came with me and opened the door with a real key There was a strong perfume smell at the Lobby I was charged breakfast for 2 people and I only noticed it after I paid Now I am waiting for the refund ,No Positive
96428,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Great quirky rooms friendly staff and comfy bed The hotel also left a gift for us when they knew it was our wedding anniversary Really really lovely 
96429,citizenM London Bankside, The ridiculously small room and the lack of personal attention at check in The concept is probably popular with Americans who like the Starbucks McDonalds style of service but it seems really tacky in London , Location
96430,citizenM London Bankside, Staff rude no laundry at weekends room is like a caravan can t entrepreneurs toilet is someone is using sink over priced no hot drinks in room for price of two hotel coffees I when and bought kettle and coffee jar breakfast is worst I ve ever had, Nothing
96431,citizenM London Bankside, Ok if I want to be picky I could ask for a wash cloth in the bathroom , Great location good access to the rest of the city Hotel is really cool well thought of with atmosphere small rooms but very large and comfy bed Great staff great breakfast 
96432,citizenM London Bankside, Room was small which is okay for overnight stay or longer if you are on your own but not as a couple , Bed was very comfortable and reception area was really nice
96433,citizenM London Bankside, would have preferred to be able to make a cup of tea coffee in the room or at least be able to make a free cup in the dinning area I think tea and coffee should be included in the price I have never known it not to be, staff we exceptionally helpful and friendly always happy to help very clean relaxed and welcoming environment
96434,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Staff were super friendly bed was awesome huge and really comfy I could have happily not left the room however when we did the downstairs lounge area is great spacious great music couldn t ask for more
96435,citizenM London Bankside, The room was too small for us and not being able to open the window made it a bit claustrophobic Climbing over each other to get in and out of bed wasn t really ideal either , Location is excellent and the staff couldn t have been nicer everyone we came across was friendly and smiling The decor in the lobby is very cool and the bed was very comfortable 
96436,citizenM London Bankside, Bathroom smelled damp as floor of shower wet room area didn t slope towards the drain Quite a walk to nearest tube Southwark , Enormous comfortable bed free drinks TV with Apple TV and room controller Very quiet and great blackout blinds Food drink lounge and IT services all excellent 
96437,citizenM London Bankside, no tea of coffee making facilities in the room , Very friendly and helpful staff plenty of power points in the room for charging phones tablets laptops etc 
96438,citizenM London Bankside, Booked a late check out as there was a fire alarm at 2am not the hotel s fault obviously but got a knock on the door 4 times by house keeping Hair dryer broke, Decor in reception
96439,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Everything was perfect from moment we got there great location close to markets shops restaurants The rooms were amazing and just wat we needed perfect trip thanks
96440,citizenM London Bankside, the reception computer and staff were hopeless They charged our friends for the room when it had already been paid and then couldn t find our booking Our room never got done and the chambermaids weren t polite , this is a funky modern hotel in a good location but 
96441,citizenM London Bankside, Our only comment would be that the room would benefit from a kettle and tea and coffee making facilities Although keeping with Citizen M style the rooms should have an nespresso machine , We loved the lounge area of the hotel as its a great relaxing area and meeting friends The work spaces are really helpful as well as the free acces to the IMacs 
96442,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing, Easy check in lovely room with large comfortable bed up to date with technology complimentary drinks in the room and new films to watch in the room Lighting in room was very calming and made the room different from most we have stayed in 
96443,citizenM London Bankside, It was difficult to work out how to just turn on the bathroom light We weren t told what floor our room was on so had to ask this made using the lift a little awkward as you had to get off to check if your number was on that floor otherwise , The bed was huge and comfortable I loved the fact you could control the lights from your bed 
96444,citizenM London Bankside, Depending on where you have to be in the City the location is questionable , The value for money at citizenM is insane love the room and the gadgets Bed is awesome 
96445,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent location The room was compact but perfectly formed Blackout blinds soundproofing and a huge super comfy bed made for the best sleep Free drinks in the mini bar was a nice touch and breakfast was really yummy too with good quality produce Staff were happy friendly and really helpful 
96446,citizenM London Bankside, Being picky but sink in bedroom not bathroom don t always want to be that open , Excellent hotel love the boutique quirkyness Staff very helpful and pleasant Real hair dryers Breakfast excellent value and choice
96447,citizenM London Bankside, The food at the restaurant Variety wise as well as if possible eliminating the smell when a buffet is being served , The easiness in check in and out the availability of the newspapers and common magazines the design of the hotel and the vibe in the lobby 
96448,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms aren t very big and have little storage making them unsuitable for a couple on a holiday with more than one normal sized suitcase rather than a single person on a business trip Rooms are also quite clinical not very cosy for a night in , The central location and shared social spaces were excellent The coffee was good and the range of drinks in the bar superb The all in price for the room no extra charges and the late check out option were also nice to have 
96449,citizenM London Bankside, I dont understand why there is no table service when there are 30 people in the lounge Baristas are nice and friendly but the waiting times are too long Also i was told that they d let me know when my coffee was ready but in the end it was sitting in the counter getting cold There is no proprt loyalty programme which stops me from using cirizen M as my defaukt choice, Good food friendly staff nice atmosphere well thought out concept and architecture Good location
96450,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , I love citizenM Have stayed in the Amsterdam one so decided to tryBank as it suited my business location over more traditional selections and was very pleased I did so Great staff Cool ambience oh yes and I bought a LOT from their shop 
96451,citizenM London Bankside, Not having Sky Sports on the weekend of the Ryder Cup was disappointing , Very comfortable bed very clean room Loved having a fridge with cold water that was restocked Great movies available without extra cost Proximity to Tate Modern a bonus Ipad control of lights and blinds really funky 
96452,citizenM London Bankside, Maybe a kettle and some tea bags with a little bottle of milk in the fridge , Loved the interior and quirkiness Bathroom lights were great Bed was very big and comfy 
96453,citizenM London Bankside, The room was smaller than I would have imagined and the bathroom was more like a cabin within the room , I liked the hip decor and the food The staff were very accommodating and friendly 
96454,citizenM London Bankside, There was an occassional ticking sound in the room from the lighting system I would guess or the showers , Bed and room was very cozy love the mini bar s organic juices and the selection of films available 
96455,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent location Compact rooms which have everything you need including a comfortable bed and good shower Very friendly and helpful staff Welcoming bar with striking design throughout
96456,citizenM London Bankside, Very funky Hotel with a massive Reception area that feels more like a communal living room with everyone working on laptops Breakfast was self serve on refectory tables I would have preferred more space in the room and less in the reception area At 6o plus I like to be able to walk around the bed and not crawl across it , The beds were very comfortable and the sheets and towels of really high quality We had a comfortable peaceful night 
96457,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing, It seemed that every effort had been made to make a classy experience at an affordable price we really enjoyed the staff Gui and Esther were wonderful the atmosphere and the room Usually a hotel will have a flat charge for breakfast here we were able just to pay for a coffee and pastry We felt relaxed and the location is great an easy walk to the Tate modern Borough market and the tube stop is just a 5 minute walk
96458,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Style decor is unique and fabulous The high tech features of the room free movies and free mini bar are awesome All in all really impressive

96460,citizenM London Bankside, Honestly for us it was a very satisfying positive experience , The comfy bed and super shower were so good to come home to The friendly staff were exceptional After a full day out and about it really felt like coming home 
96461,citizenM London Bankside, Huge comfortable bed but wall to wall so a bit awkward for an oldie to shuffle out of in the night, downstairs bar lounge with tables for working like a cross between a library and your favourite cocktail bar just felt like a great place to come back to at night and go to in the morning Really nice staff free water juice in the fridge Excellent location right by the South Bank 
96462,citizenM London Bankside, I have stayed many times and it is a good concept But this time I did feel the room really is too small overall the fridge didn t work so you couldn t keep anything in it and the TV channel selection appears to have reduced from last time, location location location bed is very comfortable as advertised staff very helpful
96463,citizenM London Bankside, on the first night it was rather hot and the climate control did not seem to work adequately properly however it was much better on the second night A window would be lovely, Great facilities and comfortable souroundings
96464,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, the bed I wanted to take home with me the staff was so friendly and attentive the facilities were beautiful and fun the food wonderful with beautiful presentation
96465,citizenM London Bankside, Very small room technology in room not reliable i pad froze twice and had to relocate to another room very noisy and busy reception area on ground floor and expensive room for the size , Location good clean room friendly staff and good breakfast
96466,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are somewhat small but staying in the lobby is great , Nice neighbourhood on modern Southbank with lot of bars restaurants good breakfast close to Tube bus and trains 
96467,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, 24 7 open restaurant for breakfast lunch dinner Wonderful friendly helpful staff very nice atmosphere in the lobby trendy And close to the Tate Borough Market 
96468,citizenM London Bankside, Room was a bit cold breakfast was overpriced Also dinner was almost the same every night quite boring and expensive, Loved the decoration and style of the hotel Amazing common living room to spend time and relax 
96469,citizenM London Bankside, No tea coffee facilities in the room The light from the iPad kept me awake most of the night even when I turned it to face the wall I eventually found I could cover the screen with the hotel guide , Room was a nice size even though the bed was massive I still could move around Shower was amazing Breakfasts were great Free minibar 
96470,citizenM London Bankside, The length of my stay I d rather stay longer , There is a unique welcoming and friendly atmosphere at Citizen M London Bankside The staff is service minded professional and very nice The interior design makes a designer like me so happy Also I appreciate the generousity e g the free and non alcoholic mini bar in the fridge The closeness to Tate Modern Borough Market and London Bridge is a bonus

96472,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Very nice and modern hotel The room is small but totally fulfills all that you need The decoration is refreshing and interesting and breakfast good Very well done 
96473,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, We were so glad we decided to book with Citizen M The facilities were modern and easy to use The staff really made you feel at home from the moment we stepped through the doors and the position was everything we were looking for close to shops restaurants and had easy access to the transport system The free goodies in the fridge were a nice surprise thank you Although we are back in Australia now we will definitely be recommended this hotel to any friends and family visiting London 
96474,citizenM London Bankside, The shower would be much better with a glass door instead of a curtain which tends to move and stick to your body a bit uncomfortable The toilet door was not closing completely open spaces down by the floor and up near the ceiling therefore privacy is quite limited when traveling with your partner much better with a full door please , Fantastic ambient and decoration Very modern new and clean Free movies in the room and free minibar refilled daily It was my birthday and the friendly staff left two pieces of yummy cake in the room Location is just perfect very close to many attractions and to a subway station 
96475,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, It was a really nice experience something very different to the norm You can check in without any interaction and on checkout I was told I could keep my room key as a handy luggage tag and if I go back to a Citizen M again it will recognize me once I swipe it Cool The hotel lobby is amazing it is like a funky library free wifi full of sockets to charge up phones laptops etc I was traveling alone so ate from the self service restaurant and it was excellent quality The staff were really friendly and welcoming and a real asset to the hotel in its start up phase Of course the room is the other attraction as a total Generation Y boy having a Samsung tablet to control the lights and mood the TV music blinds was great fun But if you are not at all at ease with technology there are switches to control the lights and blinds if not the TV The bed was massive considering the size of the room 
96476,citizenM London Bankside, The bathroom needs a clothes hanger and the shower needs a rack for personal toiletries Also the basin outside there needs to be a soap dispenser The locker is too low , Love the feel of the lobby warm n cozy Informal friendly front office staff And of course the bankside location So central to all the touristy places
96477,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing Loved it all , Amazing bed rooms were so cool and comfortable you forgot it was small great use of space Staff was amazing so nice friendly and talkative in a good way great location bar and food downstairs with plenty of places to work or relax Free movies And again amazing king size bed

96480,citizenM London Bankside, Slightly further from city then we had thought but not a problem just meant a bit more walking , The bed best nights sleep I ve had in a hotel The free movies the free mini bar Fantastic Rooms might be slightly small but the facilities and finishing are superb we were sad to leave 
96481,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Location and decor was excellent The rooms were compact but clean and all in all the quirky touches within our room and throughout the hotel made the stay so much more pleasurable than if we would have opted for another similar chain type of hotel I would stay here again a few minutes walk from the shard and Borough market 
96482,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms a bit hot and couldn t instruct air con to go below 18 degrees Would like a single price point for food based on plate size so people can mix salad and casserole , wonderful funky hotel Great style bar staff rooms

96484,citizenM London Bankside, Little bit dusty on the bed nearest the window Windows outside not very clean , The rooms were well thought out and ultra modern Loved the mood lighting The lobby was really impressive 
96485,citizenM London Bankside, coffee facilities would have been great the room was a little smaller than i imagined opted out of breakfast on price , good facilties and entertainment in the room extremely large and comfortable bed 
96486,citizenM London Bankside, That I had to leave and I don t have a job with you , I stay in a lot of hotels around London and this is the first one thats bowled me over Bed comfy and big Room clean a bit ikea but it works Bathroom perfect good hot shower Foyer like a grown up hostel that you d actually want to spend time and drink or eat in Staff brilliant friendly but not too interfering seem to enjoy their jobs Check in out absolutely brilliant A self service deal which totally works Mood pad well this is where you go from brilliant to exceptional An iPad by the side of your bed that controls everything from tv and radio to lights and blinds and so so easy to use Location I always think it depends what you re looking for this was about 15 min walk to tube and 5 to the bus

96488,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast is not the quality I would look for at such a high price , The staff are marvellous and the open plan seated and workstation area is comfortable and stimulating with a good bar 
96489,citizenM London Bankside, With a 11 year old the metro is just a bit far away but hey I could have figured that out up front , The concept of the hotel in general is great they claim to be different they are The boundary there normally is between the staff and guests is almost non existing they take an interest in you are engaged seem to be happy working there The hotel lives up to what they claim to be on their website I have been in more fancy hotels more expensive hotels better rated hotels but this is with no hesitation the best hotel experience I had in my life
96490,citizenM London Bankside, The shower was hopeless The overhead bit worked for day one when I was washing my hair but I couldn t use that I the second day to avoid overhead water and the attachment was pitiful , Bed lighting vibe

96496,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Loved it check in was great with choice of room you prefer being offered Fab location rooms are small but space is utilised perfectly would much rather have a bigger bed than extra floor space Shower was simply amazing We will be back 
96497,citizenM London Bankside, the rooms are cosy but not much room for two so you need to be tidy but perfectly acceptable , the beds and pillows were really comfortable I include pillows because usually unless you are in Luxury pillows are lousy in hotels Great room amenities all operated from an ipad 2 free movies a night as well Public areas and bar are comfortable with different zones depending on what you want to do work talk read generally a really good hotel experience stayed in New York as well Prices can vary from great value to a best available depending on city and market pricing so it can be quite high 
96498,citizenM London Bankside, The hotel is starting to get a bit worn and there was some dust collecting in my cupboard Elevator system not as good as the one in NY Still very much better than the average London hotel though , Super comfortable and quiet rooms great for when travelling solo Smart and funky atmosphere all around I ve been to many Citizen M s already they never dissappoint

96509,citizenM London Bankside, Only one negative if you can call it that Was confused by the video in the lift all the time Bit odd , Comfy bed and pillows Was good that we could check in early and keep our bags at the hotel when we checked out so that we could explore London Great selection of food and drink at breakfast glad I added that at check in Lovely smiley and helpful staff 
96510,citizenM London Bankside, I d like the food to be charged per plate rather then salad v hot becasue I like salad with my small portion of hot food but the good news is they charged me a basic anyway which was kind but I felt like I couldn t ask them to do that the next time so I ate out instead I d also like an option to make the room cooler than 18 degrees , Such a funky vibe comfortable modern and relaxed in a great part of town Staff bend over backwards to help 
96511,citizenM London Bankside, Double bed with access only to one side if my wife had been with me we would have been clambering over one another to get to the loo during the night Buffet breakfast bacon a little tired and dried out, Convenient for Tate Modern and Globe pleasant staff clean and ultra modern room surprisingly good buffet food for evening meal

96513,citizenM London Bankside, My only complaint would be you can t switch off the damn ACs in the room The AC would be working all night while i would be sleeping and my sinuses weren t the happy campers The staff offered to cover the AC vent with paper Such a major architectural flaw The reason why the AC doesn t switch off is because the windows don t open The reason why the windows don t open is because the bed is right against the glass window and the architect didn t think people would ever want natural ventilation This really bugged me considering I was on holiday and the last thing i wanted to do was get sick in London and deal with sinus medication and headaches , Citizen M is quote a funky hotel Super convenient location bang in the middle of south bank The tube is about a 7 10 min walk depending on your stride and the Tate Modern is practically 2 buildings away Beautiful interiors Funky decor Pleasant staff Very comfortable bed They thought of the mood lighting in the room which was great and the how the tv operated as well based on moods and interests Its a great hotel for a millenial traveller that is seeking an experience 
96514,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The entire experience was phenomenal From the moment you realize that the entire room can be controlled with an ipad TV Movies Radio Lights Curtains Blinds Mood Lighting to the awesome fact that everything in the mini fridge is yours Totally free Also totally free is the wifi not crappy slow free wifi but fast always connected seamless wifi all the time Free But by far the best feature is the staff Helpful funny supportive You will be in the company of friends I never heard a No they always tried to find a way to help If we asked for something each shift would inform the next shift what needs to be done until they resolved our need The future of modern technically advanced client centric Hotels

96517,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, This hotel was brilliant The impression from the moment you walked in was that of a friendly and exciting environment Although it was self check in on the computers there was staff waiting to assist if you needed to and to have a little chat with about your plans The staff went above and beyond for us and it was very much appreciated The hotel is located not far from Southwalk Tube station so getting around London is easy Everything in the room was controlled via a tablet It was simple to use and fun There were free movies of which the selection were up to date and of good quality We paid a little more than we normally do for hotels but it was more than worth it I would recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of staying here 
96518,citizenM London Bankside, Do not accept cash payments , Great layout and location very close to Ramsey kitchens and Marco Pierre White 5 minute walk to tube Staff very helpful

96520,citizenM London Bankside, Not a lot of eating options in direct surroundings but Borough market is nearby , Very friendly staff great atmosphere attention to detail in design of rooms and lounge area excellent Facebook page with actual events and eating tips for London 
96521,citizenM London Bankside, Where do I begin I am confused as to the glowing online reviews of this hotel The website photos are very misleading Yes the lobby is all trendy and hipster chic but a bit gimmicky in our opinion This is a hotel where people go to stay sleep and relax and this is where it is an absolute let down The hotel rooms are more akin to mini pods and we feel that the website does not clearly explain their meagre proportions We absolutely would not have stayed here if we had realised that 2 people would be unable to move around the room at the same time The bed was large yes but nightime toilet trips required one person to climb precariously over the other as the bed had one exit side not recommended for anyone of a feeble disposition The lighting in the room was controlled by an in room i pad All colours of the rainbow were available but we felt the effect was bordering on weird especially the brothel toned red hue A note to hypochondriacs planning on staying here no you are not suffering from a kidney disorder Your urine amongst other things will be an alarming shade of red due to the room s lighting effects There was nowhere to kick back and relax in the room after a long day s sightseeing so we tended to stay out as long as possible We subsequently spent the reminder of our trip gazing longingly at other cheaper hotels we could have stayed at whose dimensions would allow free movement of non Lilliputians , The website pictures were impressive 
96522,citizenM London Bankside, Small rooms Only one chair to sit Came back at 4 30 pm and the room was not done Tip as soon as you leave the hotel tell the reception to do the room, Very well located especially if you land at City Airport Nice neighbourhood enough nice restaurants around Small rooms but verz enjoyable design and everything very practical Nice smiling personnel
96523,citizenM London Bankside, There was no coffee tea making facility in the room The free items in the fridge ice tea and not very pleasant fruit bars did not compensate if we were staying for more than one night we would have taken issue with the hotel over this , Good large comfy bed very amusing hi tech controls for the tv lights and curtains 
96524,citizenM London Bankside, The only thing I didn t like was we had no view but that didn t really detract from our stay as the only time we were in our room was night time , The Hotel is in such a good location excellent for the Tate It is such a good hotel with all the room amenties controlled by your in room IPad The staff are really helpful and will help you with anything you need The breakfast was yummy and if you pay for breakfast you get unlimited coffee till 11am The ironing room was a great idea as well as I needed to press my dress so didn t have to ask for an iron just went to the room which are located on every floor I would deffo stay at citizenM next time I visit London would look for a citizenm hotel when I go to other cities 
96525,citizenM London Bankside, Shower pressure could be better if I am being extra picky, I surprised my other half with a trip to London to propose The hotel is perfect Great decor The staff are extra friendly Perfect location We will be back 
96526,citizenM London Bankside, No tea making facilities although free cold drinks in mini fridge made up for that, Hip trendy and not at all stuffy All mod cons great location 10 minutes walk to Tate Modern Staff all very friendly huge bed room not massive but everything had a place and it worked well plus great price for the capital 
96527,citizenM London Bankside, In all truth there was not one thing I didn t like about it , Extremely helpful friendly staff the hotel in itself was perfectly situated for where we wanted to be the atmosphere the d cor just everything about the hotel and staff was superb I couldn t have wished for a more perfect place to stay Will definitely rebook in the future as it was probably the best hotel I ve ever stayed in Cannot highly recommend this enough Excellent 10 10

96530,citizenM London Bankside, Basic bedroom Bed was basically a mattress on a platform across the end of the room Sink was in bedroom shower and toilet in prefabricated pod Very little storage Safe was on bottom shelf very hard to access had to get down on the floor , Drinks in mini bar
96531,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are small for one ok for two lack of storage Having the bathroom not separate from room might be less comfortable if you are two , nice young atmosphere rooms although small have charm and are well designed shower excellent Lobby very inviting

96534,citizenM London Bankside, Is a little far out from the centre of London with another CitizenM beside tower bridge a potentially better option Connection via Apple TV and Mimecast did not work amoung any device we had , Lovely room as always with amenities 
96535,citizenM London Bankside, 11am check out too early They could at least offer free coffee in the lounge to make up for the lack of kettle or coffee machine in the rooms , Cosy rooms good choice of movies
96536,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are small they do a good job with the design but definitely a small space Also their online check in system puts you at a disadvantage if you arrive late because the best rooms go first , This is my second visit Fun lobby bar and overall cool hotel Staff is really good and breakfast is nice in the mornings 
96537,citizenM London Bankside, room compact although I have stayed in smaller Having said that everything you could need was there, Really well thought out bedroom layout everything you could ve wanted was there Staff helpful and friendly Hotel quirky clean and comfortable Would recommend Tate Modern two minutes away

96541,citizenM London Bankside, Not especially quite on the lower levels facing the street but OK with ear plugs or if you are not a light sleeper , Everything was just great and impeccable 
96542,citizenM London Bankside, Wash basin is outside of the toilet and shower cabinet Didn t like the centralised control of lights and TV We had a room with city view but traffic starts pretty early in the morning so if you are a light sleeper opt for courtyard facing rooms ,No Positive
96543,citizenM London Bankside, Air conditioning in my room broke twice and while it was repaired the first time quickly that repair didn t stick At one point the room was up to 27C My only complaint , The towels and the bed are a dream

96545,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Interior design captivating Rooms yet exceedingly functional All the things you want in a hotel were done well good showers comfy bed great location 
96546,citizenM London Bankside, Certainly the room is small Yet the bed is real big And we like that style anyway The variable lighting that one can play around with is a bit annoying The options aren t THAT many The so called moods didn t work for us , The staff is just incredible Friendly smart delightful Great breakfast 
96547,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are ideal for one person But I can t figure out how two people that s two suitcases can be accommodated in your matchbox sized rooms as smart and technologically savvy as they are , Killer branding The CitizenM concept is really thought through and lives up to the promise of mobile traveller Loved the iPad controls Loved the freebies Loved the lounge

96550,citizenM London Bankside, tap in bathroom was very loose instructions for high tech controls in room should have been pointed out at reception They were great but we didnt find the switch for the blinds until morning Breakfast was great very informal and lots of food the coffee system was slow and shouting names out from the bar was not the best system issuing table numbers and bringing the coffee to the table would have been better , friendly staff very nice lobby lounge area excellent location on Bankside so central and easy access to London bus stop outside the door Nice restaurants nearby 
96551,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Location to many London attractions was the reason for booking this hotel and I wasn t disappointed with my choice The Southwark area was also very nice 
96552,citizenM London Bankside, I loved it , The staff here are amazing They arranged a surprise treasure hunt for me to celebrate my 102 mile Cotswold Way hike Gifts and hugs The hotel is trendy as can be and yet I was made to feel at home An unforgettable experience 
96553,citizenM London Bankside, Bit more information on the self service dinner arrangement in advance would have been helpful but the food was delicious No pots for the tea and no choice about paying for tea coffee as no facilities in the room , The location is excellent restaurants and the Tate just across the road and the Hotel itself is welcoming and funky The room was small but sparkling great shower and super intelligent use of space Free films juices and a fabulous bed Slick online check in and check out but with lively staff not far away if you met a problem Nice common living room areas

96562,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Had a very stressful day but the staff completely made up for it The room was excellent the bed was huge and comfortable and the pod like bathroom and it s light features was excellent We had fun playing with the iPad to set the lights and mood and there was a great selection of radio and movies to play 
96563,citizenM London Bankside, Personally I don t like places with automated check in Machines were OK and staff were on hand to assist but my preference is just to go to desk and have someone check me in , Rooms adequate for short stay Clean and comfortable but small 
96564,citizenM London Bankside, The room had a number of faults Broken switches and light controls the desk was too small to effectively work at The room itself was bizarre All white massively over lit and looked like a set from a sci fi film , The downstairs lounge was pleasant and the staff very helpful The bed was very comfortable the shower good The room was actually dark once I disconnected everything The goodies in the fridge were a nice surprise and a cut above what most hotels offer

96566,citizenM London Bankside, The staff was very friendly and helpful but I didn t care much for the fact that they checked me for the mailing list without asking while checking us out , Minimalistic but well thought out room layout Room cleaned every day and a friendly staff 
96567,citizenM London Bankside, While I don t see the need for huge hotel rooms this was just a little too small I didn t like the bathroom sink being outside the bathroom Or having to climb over my husband in bed to get to the bathroom at night And I hated not being able to make a tea or a coffee in the room especially first thing in the morning But my overall impression was very good and I would come back as it was good value given the location , I loved the buzziness of the ground floor area and the easily accessible computers and connection points The bed was really comfortable The staff members I dealt with were very helpful and friendly 
96568,citizenM London Bankside, No kettle in rooms This is an absolute basic amenity Mattress was too firm to be comfortable Two types of shampoos in bathroom but not conditioner or body wash I wouldn t say it s great value for what is provided but the location is fantastic , Location was great Good entertainment system Staff friendly 
96569,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , Automatic check in and check out and the fact that everything was included The hotel is in a good area of town close to Tate Modern where I was going 
96570,citizenM London Bankside, I hadn t realised the room was so tiny ie the size of the bed and little else I had something deducted from my room bill that appeared on my credit card and the staff couldn t tell me what it was for I didn t ask for any breakfasts and had nothing from the mini bar but it still appeared on my bill I wonder how often that happens It was less than 10 pounds so not worth fussing about but very annoying , Staff were very friendly Hotel lobby is very comfortable friendly Good bar and cafe 
96571,citizenM London Bankside, I didn t like the iPad in the room as it interfered with my sleep sending off a glow at night, I liked that you felt you could dwell and relax in the hotels lint areas as there was IRS to see and to do
96572,citizenM London Bankside, I was in room 248 there s a faint strange smell in the bathroom may need a bottle of bleach down the drain or something , What s not to like Trendy smart and comfortable in a fantastic location really helpful staff a library great food and drinks I always stay there when I m in London

96582,citizenM London Bankside, The location while well placed in the Southwark district close to several pubs and restaurants does require a bit of a walk to get to the nearest tube stations and to any major attraction That may be inconvenient if you are travelling alone and plan to go out late I never felt unsafe walking the empty streets in the late hours of the night because my husband was always with me but would have probably not felt comfortable doing it alone , This hotel is ultra chic beautifully decorated and clean facilities The staff is genuinely friendly and helpful The vibe of the hotel is so upbeat that it is very tempting to stay in and have a few drinks at the bar 
96583,citizenM London Bankside, Over relying on the intelligent machine sometimes delays the efficiency of checking in and out processes, Electronic control system provides a convenient service to the customer 
96584,citizenM London Bankside, The room set up too cosy and no hot drink facility Didn t like having to crawl down the bed to get out The city view was not it was of another building , The food in the bar was really good location Atmosphere in the bar was also upbeat 
96585,citizenM London Bankside, Very small rooms Sink in the room as the bathroom was tiny and a bit too open if you travel with somebody you don t know very well , Nice funky hotel Great lobby Helpful staff
96586,citizenM London Bankside, No complementary tea or coffee Our room was a bit tired curtain broken wallpaper peeking with a bit of mild behind it not overly noticeable but not great, Awesome concept quirky and modern with great extra features
96587,citizenM London Bankside, I pad based room controls were clumsy with poor HMI and some SW issues Sound quality of media hub very poor No corkscrew or bottle opener in room better quality cushions required, Arrival and feeling good in the space
96588,citizenM London Bankside, Very small rooms with a very functional feel to them Somewhere between minimalist and spartan , Modern entertainment system and room controls Free soft drinks 
96589,citizenM London Bankside, The room smelled like sewer after running water The room highest temperature felt cold Experienced horrible drafts while in the bed Apple TV didn t work, Loved the automated experience

96591,citizenM London Bankside, The controls in the room are regulated via a tablet which was constantly running out of batery making it sometimes not possible to open the blind or turn off the tv, The location is very good close to London Eye Tate Modern and Waterloo station The staff is very friendly and the hotel has a great atmosphere The self service concept works pretty well and one gets all the badic comforts needed for leisure work or meet up with friends
96592,citizenM London Bankside, The size of the room was tiny with not enough space to have our two large bags open at the same time , The location was excellent and the hotel lobby decor and facilities were great 
96593,citizenM London Bankside, I would have liked tea coffee facilities in the room or as in many American hotels tea and coffee in the lobby where guests help themselves , Just about everything Location just south of the Thames in a lively quarter with good restaurants close to both metro and overground rail stations great bed small but efficient room relaxed atmosphere in bar and lobby great staff both English and French electricity sockets in the room fantastic wifi connectivity 
96594,citizenM London Bankside, The light moods were not working properly, Loved the breakfast buffet Fridge drinks were lovely Love the atmosphere in the communal space The staff were all fab and friendly 
96595,citizenM London Bankside, Bathroom cubical was less than private for two people sharing you d need to know each other quite well One person would have to climb over the other if they got up during the night Evening meal option was very poor but it s London so plenty of choice elsewhere Cocktails were not close to the standard of a real cocktail bar , Very modern fantastic ambience of the hotel in general Room was clean bed was big free Wi Fi free movies ideal for a short stay Check in and check out very easy with very helpful staff on hand at all times 
96596,citizenM London Bankside, If you stay longer than one night the rooms are just not as good as your average hotel room Cool concept but for us it didn t work , The location is great and the lobby has a great vibe to it 
96597,citizenM London Bankside, View is not the best , if I go back to London I would definitely stay here again great location really funky modern hotel and room decor and enough room for all my stuff despite the small size of the room Bed is very comfortable Great selection of free movies and love the free snacks in the fridge I like being able to check myself in on the kiosk no waiting in a queue but there are staff to assist as needed Being able to control all the room settings from the iPad is a bonus too 
96598,citizenM London Bankside, The location was not super close to the main attractions it required a bit of a walk which wasn t too bad as it was close to restaurants and shopping markets We actually stayed at CitizenM twice in two weeks the first stay was flawless the second stay we actually had to change rooms because the pad was locked up and none of the controls were working properly and also the water did not get refilled after the first day Minor things compared to the great experience with the staff and at the bar , I loved the decoration the room being controlled by one ipad the ability to customize lighting choose own music that I got freebies in the fridge every day I loved the shampoo shower gel having one for the AM and one for the PM The staff is great 
96599,citizenM London Bankside, Overhead shower didn t work but if that was a problem I would have gone to reception and complained That s it place was great, Very trendy a bit cheeky and a very cool place to stay Loved the layout loved the room and loved the iPad to operate everything from the mood lights heating the blinds and the TV
96600,citizenM London Bankside, I don t recommend an inside room a bit claustrophobic for my taste but as soon as I asked to change they put me on an external room , The design is a amazing the atmosphere is welcoming and fun the staff is friendly young and easy going that was one of my best hotel experiences ever 
96601,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Depsite its location the hotel is very quiet even the rooms looking towards southwark street The big entrance hall bar is always full of activity it is so nice you might want to spend much time there 
96602,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms are small and you have to buy in on the concept of CitizenM hotels The breakfast is great but missing bacon and some sort of vegetables for a full 10 points , The hotel design and friendly staff Free mini bar with water drinks and bars refilled every day 
96603,citizenM London Bankside, The iPads were not charged and we had to wait till next day when we left to be fully charged One of the perks of the hotel is the technology add access they provide,No Positive
96604,citizenM London Bankside, Not too sure about the pod bathroom and then the sink in the main room area Also not particularly comfortable with having access to one side of bed only so one person had to clamber in and out of bed , Good breakfast Modern clean facilities Friendly helpful and professional staff Ability to control room temperature and excellent soundproofing so room v quiet Good blackout blinds Very good comfortable mattress 
96605,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are compact If that s an issue then this is not for you, Works like a well oiled machine from checkin to checkout Great facilities for working meeting Excellent food and drink setup
96606,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing, Now used to check in system so easy entrance Great staff provided a free drink We love the bar and rooms always same great standard Perfect location for the globe theatre
96607,citizenM London Bankside, struggled a bit controlling the room temperature minor point Hate the colour changing shower cubicle as the Wife now wants one and I ve only just put a new one in at home , easy check in friendly staff reasonably priced for London quiet ipad to control the room and a great location walkable for most Thameside sites River boats Tower Bridge Buck palace etc 
96608,citizenM London Bankside, I only missed one thing an in house shop with citizenM says take me with you Some of the items around you are worth taking home , So much care in the details Amazingly friendly staff while not at all smothering Eager to go the extra mile 24 7 This is the closest you can get from feeling at home away from home There are hotels And then there is citizenM 
96609,citizenM London Bankside, No possibility of opening the window in the room and the conditioned air is quite dry Rather small room Some dust here and there in the room , The staff is very friendly The building has an interesting inside layout There s great buzz and vibe in the common areas Wi Fi is great Good espresso at the bar Interesting concept with the room controls 
96610,citizenM London Bankside, Very few staff around and the air con in our room was hardly working making it very hot in the room Also no coffee making in the room and we were given the impression you could get it from the bar free but we had to pay this would not have been an issue had we known , Bed was very comfy and shower was very good
96611,citizenM London Bankside, Bit more variety with breakfast more fresh fruits different cereals gym pool wellness wither of these would be a nice to have , Great location loved the details in the hotel where everything is tailored to CitizenM writings on soaps pillows invoice easy check in and check out on the automates great lounge downstairs easy navigation with iPad great movie selection Overall I really recommend this hotel as the location is great price qualitiy ratio and the rooms are quiet 
96612,citizenM London Bankside, It was a pity that the floor in our room was never cleaned we stayed four nights Thus a lot of dust cumulated We kept our things tidy in the corner it would have been no problem to wipe through , The location of the hotel is excellent The lobby is very well furnished We really enjoyed the option of watching free movies in our room 
96613,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Everything really the place your friendly and smily staff The hotel has a home feel to it In addition the deco is contemporary very cool and quirky The spaces downstairs are clearly defined divided the seating bar area and bar itself the working desks breakfast areas the outside patio the bookshelves and different atmospheres seating areas are modern and comfortable We also like the fact that non guests can come for a drink in the evening

96616,citizenM London Bankside, We don t have any complaints at all great place , We found the room to be clean quiet and comfortable We slept beautifully all three nights partly due to the heavy shade that covered the window and partly due to the huge bed It was nice that movies and water drinks snacks were included in the price The rain shower was absolutely lovely The location is also great The Ipad as a control center was functional and fun Wifi worked great The bar and sitting area looked very inviting but we didn t have time to take advantage of it

96619,citizenM London Bankside, the price has grown quite a lot on the past years breakfast price is also high , this is a modern hotel with nice atmosphere the ambience is nice music is good and location is fine
96620,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast was a little disappointing wouldn t say it was bad just didn t enjoy it Without hot drinks in the room it would have been nice to have complimentary tea and coffee instead of having to pay for those on top of stay and breakfast , Bed was a lovely size staff were all friendly and willing to help with anything Complimentary mini fridge was a great difference to many hotels Loved every minute of our stay and the facilities such as the mood lighting waterfall shower and movies 
96621,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing I can think of , We especially liked the hotel s bar lounge area It has a very welcoming and relaxing atmosphere and we spent a lot of time there 
96622,citizenM London Bankside, Staff were unable to provide room service eg shower cap coffee I did not want to get dressed to go downstairs to get shower cap or coffee it was not available in room, Liked the decor and location
96623,citizenM London Bankside, Didnt have mayonnaise sauce, The amazing room and the friendly staff they were superb and the room facilities were amazing I ll be visiting the hotel chain in Amsterdam next
96624,citizenM London Bankside, Room was a closet more or less Concept idea that is popular in trendy hotels like Ipad controls in the room are always a bad idea not charge properly doesn t work etc , After hours bar was nice touch atmosphere was great staff very pleasant Automated check in check out 
96625,citizenM London Bankside, i pad in room was empty and could only be charged when holding in hand so switching on tv or films became tricky, very friendly staff relaxed atmosphere thick fluffy and big towels comfortable bed easy to use light clothes hangers
96626,citizenM London Bankside, After 1 night you start to notice things like quality of fittings which are a bit cheap Eg Taps in sink very lose Definitely a great hotel if you are staying for a couple of nights May think about sonewhere else for a longer stay And I still have not found the ironing areas not obvious , Staff are excellent Entertainment system great bar and working areas Very central and close to office

96628,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Awsome cool and also truly adapted to the modern traveller Cannot recommend more You will start thinking why are not all other hotels as modern as this CitizenM vs other London hotels is like a Smartphone vs an 80 s wireless phone connected to your fixed landline or even older

96630,citizenM London Bankside, There should be a possibility to have a simple a la carte breakfast, Super nice modern hotel in a top location 5 min walk to Tate Modern and 10 min to Borough market Not very cheap but given it s London I d consider it fair Very clean cosy room Free movies great selection of music Very nice staff What else to wish for 
96631,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms far too small climbing into bed wobbly sink tap and stink of drains coming up from sink Give my proper switches rather than an uncharged ipad to work the lighting ,No Positive

96637,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Buffet meals lovely range very informal very convenient We had quite a few good chats with the staff Genuinely interesting motivated approachable staff 
96638,citizenM London Bankside, The location wasn t the best The food looked as though it had been lying around for quite a time so we didn t eat in the hotel , The rooms were clean and comfortable OK for a couple of nights but no space so wouldn t be good for a longer stay 
96639,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The beds were very comfortable rooms were clean and the location was great Also a great value Easy transport links and a short walk to the South Bank Tate Modern and Borough Market

96650,citizenM London Bankside, No fresh air opening window not an option Bathroom was no more than a shower toilet which is practically in the room behind a frosted glass panel, Very comfortable beds black out blind
96651,citizenM London Bankside, I was sadly disappointed with the air conditioning as the room was rather stifling I hate to leave any complaint as I loved my stay but it did make it difficult to sleep at night and we had to prop the door open to get some cooler air whilst getting ready the following morning , Upon entering this hotel you will be struck by how fabulous the decor of this place is Several swish self serve check in machines are available with plenty of staff on hand incase you need any assistance Take the beautiful spiral staircase or the lift the choice is yours upstairs and with just one tap of your key card yep no faffing you will be in your room in no time Once inside you will be greeted with lovely personalised touches such as your name to welcome you on the mood pad as well as on the huge flatscreen tv The moodpad is really fun enabling you to choose and change the lighting colour control the blackout blinds change tv channels and select movies you will have everything you need at your fingertips allowing you more time to luxuriate in the spacious and comfortable beds Another fab perk of citizenM is the fridge all of the contents are free Ours contained a lovely selection of cold drinks two bottles of water and several fruit juices including Rooibos tea with passionfruit These rooms are also soundproofed and we were completey undisturbed by any noise during our stay which was a real delight With many attractions on the doorstep such as Shakespeare s Globe a mere four minutes walk away and The Shard being visible from the street below I would most definitely stay here again a true gem 
96652,citizenM London Bankside, The room was very warm the thermostat only goes down to 18 degrees but it felt a lot hotter The Windows are sealed units so I woke up quite a few times in the night due to being too hot , All the little extras that came with the room were really cool The staff were extremely friendly and very very helpful 
96653,citizenM London Bankside, Airconditioning makes some noise Yes I have found SOMEthing , The ground floor is like a big living room it feels like home The staff is very friendly and helpfull Delicious fruit salad with breakfast

96655,citizenM London Bankside, Opted for a city view little bit noisy with the traffic but this didn t spoil stay , Location by London Bridge Borough Market Globe Tate Modern is excellent Plus right by the River Boat for going to the O2 The hotel itself is really funky beautifully done out with a nice bar and social area in Reception Rooms are great comfy beds Perfect size Lovely staff Loved it there 
96656,citizenM London Bankside, That if I visited with allmy children at once I couldn t stay there as the rooms can t accommodate I would love to have this be the hotel we come as a family as they are just wonderful and we felt so comfortable , When we arrived they had created a scavenger hunt for my daughter where she explored the hotel with a staff member and found a chocolate egg as a final treat They treated my daughter like a 5 year old celebrity When u needed directions the staff found them and printed them for me I cannot say enough good things about them 
96657,citizenM London Bankside, NOTHING , We loved EVERYTHING about this hotel From the free drink on arrival to the super cool iPad provided to control the room settings Just perfect for us 
96658,citizenM London Bankside, The decor in the common parts a little too much dark wood, The room the bed the mood lights free films and wifi and the social areas are really modern and great for just lounging around
96659,citizenM London Bankside, The room was a bit small but it was very comfortable , We would highly recommend a stay in this comfortable boutique hotel The staff is amazing very pleasant professional attentive and extemely helpful The hotel is located in a nice quiet area in walking distance to several different Tube stations the Thames Borough Market and London Bridge The lobby bar area is always vibrant and lively The room was quiet and comfortable perfect for relaxing and sleeping The extensive selection of free movies is a nice extra 
96660,citizenM London Bankside, The only thing I didn t like was the toilet was in the shower to the side but besides that it was amazing, The breakfast was amazing So worth the money as we didn t want to pay for it because we thought it was a little expensive but due to running late one morning we just bought it to save time and we ended up paying for it the next day as it was that good The whole experience in the citizenM was fabulous we had early nights and was great to get tucked up to watch a movie We also phoned a Chinese one night and took it upstairs into our room 
96661,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast maybe could be enriched, Innovative hotel you don t want to leave the premises Perfect decoration nice rooms all operated through a tablet Certainly the place to stay when in London 
96662,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, I love this cute boutique hotel The lounge was lovely and had all of the things that are great about London food music fashion etc Check in was super easy and your room key doubles as a luggage tag so you have a little some thing to remind you of your stay The rooms are super cute I enjoyed being welcomed each day by the message on the TV screen or iPad with you name Also I love the added amenities such as mood lightings black out shades free movies radio stations piped in through your tv I will sure to stay there again 
96663,citizenM London Bankside, Our iPad room control wasn t working but to be fair staff sorted it out , Like their take on hotels functional room but lobby you want to use be in Excellent location if you want Tate St Pauls Globe

96665,citizenM London Bankside, I didnt like the fact that there was nt any tea and coffee facilities in the room Had to go down to the cafe lounge to get tea and coffee at 6am Thank god its a 24 7 cafe Also the hand basin drain stank of dirty drains not nice when your brushing your teeth o , the location was just perfect Staff were really friendly and couldnt do enough for you the fast check in and check out was great Love the choice of your own key card motive o 
96666,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing , Fantastic Couldn t fault it at all Amazing facilities comfy bed very modern the iPad is a great touch Would definitely stay again 
96667,citizenM London Bankside, We would have loved a tea maid in the room so we could have a cup of tea in our room without having to go down to the bar , Loved the ability to control the functions of the room with an iPad 
96668,citizenM London Bankside, No gym swimming pool or even a small exercise room with cardio equipment the location is good if you want to be on this side of the river but a 10 minute walk from Southwark or London Bridge stations , The bed was phenomenal the room was really fun and cool with the lighting and the ipad to control everything the downstairs lobby living room a great place to unwind wifi was perfect
96669,citizenM London Bankside, Would have loved a cup of tea in my room in the morning But that is the only negative I can think of , Room excellent for one person loved the free movies bed was huge and extremely comfortable especially the pillows Convenient location very friendly staff 
96670,citizenM London Bankside, TV Channels accessible via the iPad were rarely available for some reason , Staff were excellent Michael from the Orkneys Rafa from Uruguay and Lily from France Furnishings and service is very good

96682,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms were a bit too warm, Great design and comfort quirky and fun great rooms with centralised technology very helpful and friendly staff very relaxing
96683,citizenM London Bankside, Although a number of tube options are available if you ve been sight seeing and pounding the streets all day the hotel can feel a bit of a slog to get back to Not so keen on the cabin bed effect which means in all the rooms there is only one side of the bed you can get out of not much fun clambering over your partner in the night There is a lack of view with a gallery effect layout and the use of blinds and black outs screening you from your neighbours opposite I didnt like the lack of in room tea coffee making facilities its the first thing I reach for in the morning Although the staff were really helpful I didnt really like the self service check in out its bad enough at Tesco self service can be convenient and despite best attempts not to be so it felt a bit impersonal annonymous like an unncessary attempt to seperate staff from customers , If you are into funcky decor and the advent of the Apple age this is the hotel for you helpful and generous staff made the stay at this hotel a worthwhile experience free movies comfortable beds reasonably priced rooms when not including a breakfast tariff This is probably a great option for business or lone travellers and short stay leisure trips Relaxing environment for work or study any time of the day 
96684,citizenM London Bankside, Only fault I had was that you couldn t chose individual dates on whether you wanted breakfast or not Paid for 2 breakfasts but only needed one as was meeting friends Very small issue and the hotel refunded the one morning nothing to really concern as the hotel was fantastic, Everything about the hotel perfect for our weekend away 
96685,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, very comfortable and large bed bright rooms room features TV lights air condition etc to be controlled by iPad super easy nice and stylish lobby Fast and easy self check in staff is there to help you anyways 
96686,citizenM London Bankside, The trays used to carry breakfast were a bit small I like to spread out my food on different plates and the limited space on the tray made this tricky I work out so don t judge yeah that s my biggest complaint Not really a complaint but word of caution Hotel Rooms in London are smaller than in other cities this is no exception but they make really good use of space Also the windowns don t open Again not so uncommon there but on the bright side the AC is quite good so not that big of a problem , Staff were excellent Best ever The rooms were very well designed and made great use of the space The common lounge and bar were lovely as well 24h bar is always a plus Lots of good movies to stream after a night out when you re lazy but don t want to go to sleep just yet 
96687,citizenM London Bankside, We had no complaints, This is our fourth time staying in this hotel We like that it is modern and slightly funky and for a teenager the technology has great appeal We like the location Bankside has improved greatly 
96688,citizenM London Bankside, Everything was excellent, Staff were extremely friendly and helpful Location was central The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on Loved all the mod cons in the room I would 100 stay here again
96689,citizenM London Bankside, Iron in room Not clear where iron areas are Also guests have to mix with conference attendees using the meeting rooms Often see non guests wandering around with no shoes on talking loudly on the telephone outside rooms , Room was great Staff very very friendly and helpful Facilities very good Would definitely stay again 
96690,citizenM London Bankside, I was missing a tea pot Really the weather outside is still cold and after a long day outside you come back to your room sit at your comfy bed and you want to drink a cup of hot tea , The bed is amazing I would love to have the same at my place Lights automated curtains TV it s a pleasure to stay there

96692,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The Hotel is in a brilliant location by the Southbank the downstairs lounge bar living room is a great place to chill The rooms are not huge but don t feel cramped either the bed was very comfortable We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend break here 
96693,citizenM London Bankside, The technology in the room was a bit clunky blind wouldn t close had to have room re booted tea and coffee in the room would be nice to have , Comfortable clean and close to work foyer spaces nice Staff friendly very relaxed Coffee and croissants very good
96694,citizenM London Bankside, The size of the room was claustrophobic for me Undoubtedly well designed but the bed rammed up to the window is a no no for us, We thought the layout of the ground floor was excellent and had such a super atmosphere and very welcoming coming in from the street
96695,citizenM London Bankside, Some room service options food would have been nice We would have considered having a meal at the hotel but there were only light snacks on offer Many of the restaurants nearby were closed on a Sunday evening , The quietness and privacy of the room and it was perfect for a romantic getaway Bed is amazing very big and comfortable Good film selection The vibe of the hotel is fun and fresh and we had a good laugh with the different lighting and sound moods in the room The staff was extremely friendly and helpful making the check in and check out process quick and easy

96697,citizenM London Bankside, nothing we didn t like but you have to expect that its not that spacious , We have been several times now and its quirky fun comfortable and good location 
96698,citizenM London Bankside, There was no refreshment facilities like water boiler and coffee Tea This is due to the self service hotel target as wellas the target to get a fresh coffee make in the lopy coffee shop I suggest to provide the refreshments at the rooms , It has a unique style with new design and attractive colors I like the self service and control of the room by the I Pad For the TV lighting movies I love it
96699,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, We had a lot of fun with the little sayings and the rainbow lighting The bed was comfortable The rooms were small but they maximized it with fun and cozy lobby space I d go back 
96700,citizenM London Bankside, We only booked in for an overnight stay and I knew that there were no drink making facilities in the room when I booked I did miss this facility in the morning though and would probably base my decision on whether or not to stay on this in future , Staff friendly and helpful no matter what time of the day or night

96706,citizenM London Bankside, Room very functional and space at a premium Clever arrangement Great for a one night short stop Would find it challenging in terms of space and amenities for more than 2 nights and if there were 2 of us Remember to put the iPad back on its charging stand , Great for the single traveller Fantastic staff Great when you know how the self check in and check out it all works Efficient and comfortable I pad driven amenities in the room are great but can catch you out as you get familiar with the different menus Good air conditioning and blackout blinds 
96707,citizenM London Bankside, A kettle in the room would have been brilliant a little bit over designed , Good location on the South Bank very friendly helpful staff had a problem with our room which was resolved immediately chilled environment wifi everywhere and free movies for some downtime 
96708,citizenM London Bankside, It s not for everyone as you can t walk around the bed and have to be able to climb onto it , Fantastic ambiance in the living areas downstairs I loved the mood lighting and free movies in the room Very original concept hotel Next time I ll book it for a team meeting 
96709,citizenM London Bankside, As often in London one is not able to open the window Rooms facing the inner courtyard have 24 7 lights shining in Breakfast a little expensive , A hotel with a different and very convincing approach the lobby is your living room Feeling like in a spaceship when you are in your room All clean Very kind and helpful staff They changed our room w o further hesitation or additional charges when we wanted to change from 24 7 full of light inner courtyard to outside room Happy to come back

96714,citizenM London Bankside, Although the rooms are quite cosy in size the ambience of the hotel makes up for not having lots of room for your suitcases , Central location close to Tate Modern The Globe on the South Bank Very modern feel to this hotel Love the communal areas bar reception Friendly staff 
96715,citizenM London Bankside, Leaving , The vibe as soon as we walked in the door was matched perfectly throughout the stay The bottle of wine from the staff for my girlfriends birthday was the extra touch that made it such an amazing stay
96716,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms served a purpose but thats about it You will stay here to chill out in the bar not to hide away in your room , The common areas were great 
96717,citizenM London Bankside, Tea and coffee are only available from downstairs and are chargeable unless a member of staff feels kind Rooms are little too compact , Staff are very pleasant Communal areas bright well appointed 
96718,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing not to like, Everything about this hotel from the quiet rooms to the funky modern style is excellent The staff are friendly and helpful The location is perfect for my place of work but it s also close to the south bank tube stations and the shard so would be great for tourists 
96719,citizenM London Bankside, For the price would like simple stuff like a kettle and some tea coffee in the room TV Channels weren t completely working Would like more channels too , Very hi tech Comforting quiet Mood lights were nice 
96720,citizenM London Bankside, Absolutely nothing , Everything single thing about this hotel is unusual and simply GREAT from the self check in out to the design and branding of the place to the rooms and services provided The high tech atmosphere in the rooms with the tablet control of the sound light temperature entertainment didn t contradict with the coziness of the dining area the Canteen and the lobby The Living room s Food is hot and delicious and the staff are amazing 
96721,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, CitizenM comes up top all the time This is our 3rd visit to the hotel It is in a fantastic location Easy to commute around London Southbank always wins on location Places to eat old fashioned pubs in the back streets and lots to do and see in the area within walking distance Staff are super friendly and helpful and always have a smile on their faces Thank you it makes you feel welcome and that s why we keep returning Rooms are great beds are so comfortable It is a fantastic place to stay

96730,citizenM London Bankside, I couldn t fault this place, Good design decor super friendly staff Apple TV spacious fridge complimentary water mood lighting good location lovely bar M S food shop across the road 
96731,citizenM London Bankside, Having to climb over partner to get into bed as it takes up the whole room Rooms overlooked by other rooms and Lift areas meaning you have no real choice but to have the blind down all day Breakfast wasn t quite up to usual hotel standards In terms of both choice and quality , Funky rooms and modern decor Check in Check out procedure Staff 
96732,citizenM London Bankside, The canteen aspect to dining takes a little getting used to and for self service it s not the cheapest food I ve ever eaten although the quality was good , Friendly staff novel and engaging layout Rooms really well sound proofed bar occasional noise from street 
96733,citizenM London Bankside, No such thing, Everything bed was fabulous breakfast very very nice staff friendly and fun to talk to the design of the dining chilling space downstairs absolutely loved it 
96734,citizenM London Bankside, The bathroom was a bit basic and we didn t like having a shower curtain it felt a bit like student accommodation , Loved this hotel Very good value compared with other London hotels very nice bed good view chic design and great communal area downstairs Check in and check out were particularly easy Fantastic in room facilities such as free movies and water 
96735,citizenM London Bankside, I liked everything for the few days I stayed however I m not sure I d as a couple spend any longer than 2 3 nights purely because of the lack of storage space , Excellent and relaxing hotel The hotel staff could not do enough and it will be somewhere I would stay again in the future for a weekend break in London
96736,citizenM London Bankside, Maybe the one thing I didn t like was the noise from the ground floor courtyard were people were smoking and there were quite loud till late , Everything was fantastic Internet was fast Staff were enthusiastic and helpful Room was hi tec and sexy 
96737,citizenM London Bankside, The iPad controller was difficult to use away from the docking station which was out of reach of the bef, Great design in decor and really friendly staff
96738,citizenM London Bankside, If I had to say something negative it would be that room was on the small side so not big enough to really sit and relax in The rest of the hotel spaces were great for relaxation and comfort so more than made up for the room size , Loved the funky contemporary d cor All the staff were very attentive polite and smiley 
96739,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Very helpful and thoughtful staff I am in a wheelchair and they could not have been kinder A good choice of food for breakfast without having to have the full breakfast 
96740,citizenM London Bankside, Not what I would call a bad experience but would prevent us staying again Having the bed inaccessible one side was not something we would want again Ok for one person but definitely not two , The hotel is very quirky which we found great 
96741,citizenM London Bankside, TV and room settings controlled via a tablet ours was very slow to get the TV radio on but it may juts have been our particular one Rooms fairly compact and shower pod toilet are part of the room so there s not much privacy from bedroom which is fine for us but may not be suitable for everyone , Loved the funky rooms and public areas Staff really friendly and efficient Great value for money Beds huge and very comfy Definitely stay again 
96742,citizenM London Bankside, The food in the hotel was disappointing but with so many eateries around which are great it does not matter, Great rooms with a lot of feature very modern with a lot of facilities in the room Clean and spacious rooms
96743,citizenM London Bankside, Food offering rather basic evening breakfast and some of the food offered in the shop esp the sushi was clearly lying around there for too long But enough restaurants cafes in neighbourhood no gym but Thames in front of the door to go running rooms are small but functional rather a place for few nights than a longer stay e g lack of storage space, Location walking distance to many attractions and easy tube connection to O2 arena modern design friendly staff open areas that invite to hang out surf meet and last time I stayed no problem to find a corner to disassemble my bike after a sportive fast wifi
96744,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms very teeny tiny which will be a challenge for anyone with more than minimal luggage Although we loved the bed very comfortable our friends did not like that one person has to climb over the other to get into bed , Very quirky staff amazing brilliant breakfast high tech love that you can change the mood lightin in the room to any colour you want 
96745,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The atmosphere in the bar lobby was really chilled and friendly Music was on point too Drinks were reasonably priced and there were great table books too Bed is super large and super comfy Love the vast choice of films and the mood lighting settings all controlled via a tablet 
96746,citizenM London Bankside, I didn t sleep well noise between floors bothered me but I m a fragile sleeper no tea kettle in the room I had to dress and go downstairs to have hot water which is not very usual in the UK no gym What I had to run the back staircase in the dark , I love this area of London the staff in the hotel was friendly and helpful very wizzy connected room like the common areas which are nice to sit and work in
96747,citizenM London Bankside, Exceptionally narrow room such that one of couple has to climb over the other to get in out of bed We partly got over this by changing the orientation in which we slept but sliding to the bottom of the bed to get out feels strange , good location and vibrant atmosphere Bar staff were excellent and there were lots of places to eat nearby 
96748,citizenM London Bankside, My TV and the tablet did not communicate with one another and I was unable to access that function in my room It was frustrating and disappointing as I would have loved to watch something at night I also found a long black hair on my bed and it had no relation to anyone I allowed into my room which made me feel like the place wasn t cleaned properly and made me hope that my sheets were clean The hotel has no room service which is also slightly annoying There was no separation of ALL the lights being on or none so it was quite a harsh wake up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night , The rooms were comfortable the hotel ground floor was incredible Beautiful interesting lovely atmosphere comfortable Staff were very friendly and accommodating The attention to detail in designing this hotel and its corporate identity is charming and they have a fun approach The lights in the bathroom that change are awesome 
96749,citizenM London Bankside, Room a bit on small side Glad we were familiar with tablets everything was controlled by one Heating lights blinds and television Could be a problem for some people , Very clean modern hotel Bar area very comfortable Trendy decor Rooms provided everything needed 
96750,citizenM London Bankside, Difficulty at check in to get a non microchipped credit card to work due to operator error costing us a great deal of time plus phone calls to the USA , Decor interior design airy and open public areas Functionality of the very compact room Helpful friendly efficient staff providing superior customer service with a smile 
96751,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing that I didn t like , The whole experience here is great From the very effective lounge dining work area to the albeit small but perfectly formed rooms They do the job perfectly I ll definitely use this hotel again Exactly what I need in London 
96752,citizenM London Bankside, i think that the system of the breakfast is not the best You used to it but the first time is confusing , The bar open 24 hours is always a good thing and the breakfast have everthing that i like including the fresh orange juice bottles The ambience of the hotel is great 
96753,citizenM London Bankside, Lack of Kettle in the room cant beat that wake up cuppa Bar prices a little steep, The room was quirky comfortable and good value The check in staff were lovley especially Marta who was genuinely happy to help and interested about our visit 
96754,citizenM London Bankside, Didn t like not having an Iron ironing board in my room Room was small for the cost , Cool rooms great location for the shard tower bridge tower of London Easy to get too from London Victoria and London Bridge overground Excellent soundproofing for a goodnight s sleep Bar was really nice 
96755,citizenM London Bankside, No complaints , Definitely a concept hotel You will either like the concept or not I found it cool well thought out and comfortable Staff is uniformly helpful and friends Excellent breakfast Comfortable bed Nice vibe in the living room 
96756,citizenM London Bankside, Would be nice to have coffee in the room not a major issue even a take out option vending machine on each floor , Fantastic hotel with welcoming trendy yet relaxed foyer areas and quirky fun rooms Staff were all lovely well placed for various attractions but away from the hustle and bustle of tourist trap streets 
96757,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Best hotel I ve stayed at in London Liked it so much I just changed my hotel in New York so I can stay at citizen M Everything I needed and nothing I didn t Loved the lounge and the bed 
96758,citizenM London Bankside, I really disliked the computerbased check in and all the different posters talking to you as a person don t compensate for the very un personal approach Also the multimedia tablet showed a lot of very slow flaws , The hotel is trendy the rooms nicely designed and the multimedia options tremendous but 
96759,citizenM London Bankside, Ridiculously small room for two people window could not be opened window looking at courtyard airco to be managed through dirty looking iPad, Modern nice concept downstaires good location
96760,citizenM London Bankside, Cleanliness poor hair on the floor from previous guest plus hair from the equipment you use to clean I am a guy and the hair on the floor was a woman s Comfort the bed is too hard even if you have tried to solve this with a mattress topper Also for the amount of money you pay you don t expect to come back to the room every night to find your pyjamas thrown on the armchair If you don t want to fold it up then at least leave it on the bed because the chair fabric is full of germs Value for money well it s London so that s that, The concept in general is great So is the wifi the lobby area etc 
96761,citizenM London Bankside, The light control in the room is cool but not very practical No independent lights in the bathroom , Huge and great bed Location Very techy and cool hotel Very nice staff 
96762,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, The way the entire space downstairs is arranged makes it feel like a community in the evenings four drinks and food and in the morning we liked the freedom and choice is seating for breakfast Really good concept and would stay again plus recommend to friends

96764,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Excellent attention to detail The room design is outstanding especially the light features The King sized bed and shower are worth the stay The Staff is excellent really varied team with all sorts of personalities 
96765,citizenM London Bankside, the ipad didn t work , the reception area is absolutely great there are different areas where you can relax by reading work in designated areas the food is goo nice bar 
96766,citizenM London Bankside, Heat was unbearable No ventilation or air change either Set to 17degrees but stayed at about 25 Flagged it twice and it was rebooted but it didn t help at all Room 107 , Reception area and location Entertainment system ease 
96767,citizenM London Bankside, Nothing, We loved the informality of the whole experience Staff were friendly and welcoming Rooms are small but perfectly formed great beds and great showers 
96768,citizenM London Bankside, Focus on design over comfort in room No drinks facilities in room No exterior windows Room felt overpriced for what it was Not especially close to a tube line, Staff were friendly
96769,citizenM London Bankside, box for shower toilet could be more isolated when you are as couple or friends in the room it is not necessary to share certain moments , Innovative and customer friendly concept fantastic design very comfortable bed absolutely friendly staff
96770,citizenM London Bankside, Sparse in room amenities and functional furniture such as counter space in the bathroom and coffee maker and supplies Bathroom lacked the feeling of privacy No ice machine for guests Breakfast cost difference for early orders and at the door for guests Room size cannot be compensated by the kitschy cool and avant style The picture of the guy with the panty Falls short of offensive , Liked the cleanliness and the location suited our purpose Loved the big comfortable bed and the lighting Bathroom was very aesthetic
96771,citizenM London Bankside, You need to walk for around 10 minutes to the underground station Southwark However I use UBER all the time so this didn t border me , I have been here three times and never feel disappointed Helpful and welcoming staffs beautiful lounge I like the smell of the AM PM shampoo Perfect place for short stay in London 
96772,citizenM London Bankside, Tube stop was a bit further than i expected but fine once i realised i was only 7 min away from Tate Modern , I loved the facilities Very nice room with modern design touch If you re used to techology it s easy to work with the tablet to open the blinds use the tv etc Loved the lobby as well nice area to sit in Loved the big window in my room as well Definetily worth considering if you re travelling alone but also as a couple i guess 
96773,citizenM London Bankside, The Samsung tablet in the room was a bit unresponsive, Loved the staff the relaxed nature of the lounge the colour change lights in the room the recommendation for lemon grass and ginger tea with honey for my cold just wonderful
96774,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Great location as a base for exploring the City West End and major London landmarks Very funky and friendly a pleasant change from hotels where the atmosphere can be stifled by the quest for professionalism by being serious Staff Ambassadors all had smiles and friendly helpful 
96775,citizenM London Bankside, Tablet didn t always work TV was difficult to turn on or off when tablet wasn t working This is a first world problem and didn t effect our stay , Lovely hotel in a great location Very modern style

96780,citizenM London Bankside, The hotel was not as close to shops as we would have liked There was a problem with our phone and it didn t work for the period we were there Also we asked for our room to be cleaned one evening and I realized after leaving the hotel that a perfume I bought that evening was gone , The Citizen M ambassadors were fantastic and extremely helpful My friend lost the key to her locked suitcase and a staff helped to get it open Breakfast was wonderful
96781,citizenM London Bankside, Annoying to have to pay GBP 2 5 for doing the check in yourself or for paying with credit card it wasn t very clear It seemed the room temperature couldn t be regulated properly and we couldn t have a less heavy blanket so sleep was really uncomfortable The staff did what they could but the only alternative to the heavy blanket was a simple bed sheet as the saying goes all or nothing The room is very small and claustrophobic and the bed is accessible only on one side it looks like a very big dog basket On the other hand the bathroom was very big and this actually doesn t make any sense , Staff kindness location decor 
96782,citizenM London Bankside, would have been good to have tea coffee making facilities in room , Efficient checkin Relaxed atmosphere in Bar communal areas Excellent soundproofing in room Very comfortable bed
96783,citizenM London Bankside, Lack of a mini bar in the room , Stunning and modern decor very comfortable bed Great bar in the lobby Room is small but has everything you need for a short stay in London Short walk from the bars and restaurants of Borough Market and Southbank 
96784,citizenM London Bankside, The room was quite small but I think that is part of the concept , Lee normally detest buffet breakfast but the citizen was brilliant really good coffee pastry cooked produce and fruit cereal very good quality The staff were also lovely and the technology pretty smart 
96785,citizenM London Bankside, Couldn t get anything to eat at 10pm because they had ran out apparently the food is delivered from the market and when it s gone it s gone Staff had no local knowledge and couldn t direct me where to go for food , Good location Clean
96786,citizenM London Bankside, Not enough info on how to make the most of the facilities and breakfast Suggest a document on the brilliant tablet , Lovely d cor quality fittings sophisticated tablet controls nice lighting Very quiet room great breakfast 
96787,citizenM London Bankside, It would be good to be able to open the windows in the rooms slightly to air them, The stylish decor the compfort and clenaliness the friendly staff especially Rafael who works in the bar restaurant at night 
96788,citizenM London Bankside, That we had to leave , The room was amazing and the staff really made us feel welcome Epecially as it was my fianc s bday they really went the extra mile to celebrate it with us 
96789,citizenM London Bankside, rooms at the front of the building can be a bit noisy from the road, Just about everything Staff were superb Room was great with good entertainment Like the tablet controlled room settings
96790,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Everything was amazing The hotel was really cool and it had lots of everything you wanted to seen and none of the stuff you feel like you overpaid for because you didn t use it Really great stay will certainly be back 
96791,citizenM London Bankside, Bed flush with wall room a bit small Otherwise lovely , Such a fun and chilled out place to stay Love the open plan ground floor with bar snacks library internet comfy places to lounge about In room iPad controls really work Fridge water in room Very cute interiors 
96792,citizenM London Bankside, Although against the hotel s overall theme tea and coffee facilities in the room would have been a nice touch , Great location Rooms were modern and clean 
96793,citizenM London Bankside, There is no Cash payment option This works slight negatively if you are a foreign individual and Credit card companies always charges you a more, Pretty much Everything Facilities Staff Hot Breakfast Cleanliness of the Room Wi fi
96794,citizenM London Bankside, Absolutely nothing everything was perfect, Me and my partner came to this hotel for 2 nights for a little break after having a baby and we absolutely loved it Location was perfect staff was brilliant breakfast was amazing Definitely going again best hotel I ve been too 
96795,citizenM London Bankside, Tablet an absolute necessity to control the room from A C to TV crashed every day and needed minutes to restart Be Careful Best for single use too less space for two but then price value relationship not excellent All in all some drawbacks on cleanness no fitness room or other amenities thats the difference to a luxury hotel time to next tube station rather long, Modern stylish concept Small rooms are common in London at CitizenM you get efficient use of furniture and no lost space Good sentiment and music at entry area absolute silence in room Best for discovering Southbank Tate Modern and Borough Market also great to get to Canary Wharf Free Water
96796,citizenM London Bankside, The bar does not have any real ale , Friendly staff great location for where I needed to be and great access to the South Bank of the Thames and the Millennium Bridge to the North side Very modern hotel clean and efficient 
96797,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are a touch on the small side really well laid out and comfortable though massive bed makes up for the lack of room , Cool vibe great staff fast Wifi and excellent food 
96798,citizenM London Bankside, Leaving, This was not our first visit but again excelled Great staff Rooms small but functional Love all the tablet operated controls 24 hour food and drink Seevice great
96799,citizenM London Bankside, Although I can see what they re trying to do with the rooms I feel they re just a bit too small and clostrophobic for a couple and having the toilet and shower in such close proximity isn t great when you re both trying to get ready The majority of the movies were dated so we d seen them already I also think as it s located in London England obviously it just doesn t seem right that there s no tea or coffee making facilities , Very comfy bed although we would ve have like extra pillows readily available The look of the interior and lobby was excellent and very inviting Great vibe in the bar Ironing rooms very good idea 
96800,citizenM London Bankside, Only low point was being referred to as sweetheart by a male staff member while checking in which I found really patronising However he did apologise and was very helpful during the rest of our stay , The room was extremely functional loved the tablet very clean great temperature control fantastic soundproofing wonderful shower great lighting lovely shower gel comfortable bed and the free movies and WiFi were a wonderful bonus We enjoyed the bar area We were also able to leave our luggage free of charge at the hotel after we checked out 
96801,citizenM London Bankside, evening food was a bit repetitive basically thai curry indian curry malay curry although there was a salad bar , staff were exceptional room clean and spotless
96802,citizenM London Bankside, No English subtitles available on the films, The bed was the comfiest I have slept in The tablet to control the room was good small but well varied collection of films available Good transport links to explore the rest of London Only 5 10 mins walk from London Borough and Southwark we found London Borough the easiest walk 
96803,citizenM London Bankside, Hotel slippers are missing The floor is quite cold and of course when you come in with your shoes from the street eventually it will get dirty and when you walk to the shower or toilet you pick the dirt up TV had energy saving on and the screen went constantly dim after a while which spoiled watching movies The location is a bit off the metro so I had to use a lot of taxis which made it more expensive , Very friendly and competent staff Good food and coffee Fast WiFi and free Nice quiet room good bed on the firmer side A lot of German TV stations via internet Tons of free movies a lot of them recent 
96804,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Great atmosphere and location Different from usual choice Will repeat when next in UK as we expats living in Shanghai at present with grown up children in London 
96805,citizenM London Bankside, Room is too small Could feel claustrophobic , This is the third time I have stayed here in the last year and it feels one a home from home The hotel has a cool relaxed vibe and the staff are just brilliant truly hospitable Outstanding location Close to Borough Market OXO building Tower Bride et al I use the gym across the road which is gear 
96806,citizenM London Bankside, I must think very hard to find something I didn t like Well ok the view on the 5th floor was in my case just another room opposite mine while I was told there was a country side view whatever that means But the room was very silent No street noise or anything So it wasn t bad or so , Everything nice room nice atmosphere very good food nice staff good location nice tech 
96807,citizenM London Bankside, Rooms are definitely on the small side Tablet based room television controls are better in theory than in practice unwieldy slow to respond , Lobby cafe are amazing Very cool decor lots of activity Staff were pleasant accommodating 
96808,citizenM London Bankside,No Negative, Being close to Borough Market Very Fun Lobby bar area very hip but not in an overdone in your face way a nice place to relax after busy city running about
96809,citizenM London Bankside, The only thing that it needed was a drink making facilities in the room After a night on the town enjoying yourself all you need is a refresher when you wake up but we had to get showered get changed and then make our way 5 floors to get a drink Wouldn t use the hotel for more than 2 nights it would start to get irritable for the lack of space in the rooms , Very clean friendly and and a complete contrast to a fusty old 4 star hotel it was refreshing to us being in our 50 s that we get on with technology so easily but be comfortable at the same time Loved it 
96810,citizenM London Bankside, Sink in room had a slight smell , Good value for London Great open space in bar lounge area to work in Rooms small but very comfortable and really clever use of space 
96811,citizenM London Bankside, The rooms were a bit too small and you have to climb over the sleeping partner to reach the other side of the bed, The overall vibe of the hotel was great full of light interspersed with different areas in which to read socialize have a drink or a snack listen to music have a fag Also very technologically friendly all rooms are controlled by a tablet which is really simple to use and allows you to set lights music and visual shows according to what mood you re in
96812,citizenM London Bankside, When we tried to turn on the tv we couldn t get it to work and ended up opening our blinds instead Got fed up trying put the thing back in it s hold and the tv came on , The rooms the ambience the staff the food the whole concept of CitizenM This is our second stay in less than two months and we will come back again Also have used Glasgow hotel for a training day 
96813,citizenM London Bankside, Breakfast when purchased in the morning was quite expensive considering the selection , Superb use of space and free movies and entertainment was a surprise bonus Very modern and clean 
96814,citizenM London Bankside, no kettle in room room is too small for two people and only one chair window does not open too hot in room coffee 5 floors down is not very good Too noisy music in reception Why not coffee drinks facility on same floor as room , parked for free in street

96818,citizenM London Bankside, The room was tiny we had a very comfortable king size bed and I slept well but the bed took up nearly the entire room For two people there was virtually no storage aside from a single drawer built into the bed and a tiny closet nowhere to put belongings aside from shoving them to the sides of the room as best we could It was like an Asian sleep pod Given the small size of the combined toilet and shower and that the walls were translucent there was little left to the imagination if someone were using the bathroom I think rooms our size are best suited for single travelers , The ground floor is beautiful and very stylish serving as the dining area for guests but also a very popular bar and lounge for guests and locals alike The location is excellent in close proximity to Borough Market the tube and the waterfront The staff was always friendly helpful and efficient Breakfast can be prepaid or purchased for a higher price on the spot The food and coffee were excellent with a great buffet of lots of offerings We never had a cocktail at the bar but from the popularity of the lounge in the evenings I will assume there s great quality and service there
