259851,Le Pigalle Hotel, No real bad stuff if you are a family you are better off finding a hotel in Paris with much larger rooms If you are a couple who is looking for a hotel near Pigalle and know what Pigalle stands for no pun intended and don t mind having a tiny room then this place will do nicely , Stayed overnight and were impressed with this small reasonably priced hotel In no particular order we appreciated 1 Friendly helpful staff 2 Attractive location with lots of cafes restaurants and Pigalle neighbourhood and Montmarte not far away 3 Metro Pigalle around the corner 1 min walk away 4 Good easy to use WiFi 
259852,Le Pigalle Hotel, It was great No complaints Sure they could have a parking lot lol but this is Paris We parked the car down the street and had no problems , Pigalle Hotel is nice without being flashy Hip without being off putting They strike the kind of balance that the Standard in LA or Mercer in NYC does Cool place up and coming neighborhood with tons of great food stands and shops but still central Paris and within a 15 20 minute walk of most major landmarks like the Louvre Concorde Madeleine or Montmartre Sacre Coeur 
259853,Le Pigalle Hotel, I stayed at Le Pigalle for business and the only thing that bothered me was the WiFi The connection was not really stable and kind of slow The drinks in the gorgeous minibar were not cold , I love the concept of this neighborhood hotel The food the music and even the furniture in the rooms all come from suppliers around Pigalle When I arrived the room was t ready yet but I got this awesome local guide that set me off to go and explore the area All kinds of tips for indie shops and small bars restaurants curated by the hotel Awesome The room was very comfy great bed the decoration is done so esthetically Beauty products from Le Labo made for Le Pigalle I like those details The inroom playlist created a perfect soundtrack for my weekend in Paris Staff is super nice and helpful and the lobby is buzzing with local people Menu is simple but good Overall an awesome experience and kuddos for the creators of this magnificent hotel I will be back 
259854,Le Pigalle Hotel, Unfortunately breakfast was not that good, Everything Stuff is great very friendly the hotel has a very interesting atmosphere something unique and new 
259855,Le Pigalle Hotel, The check out process could have been a bit faster So do allow a little extra time for this in the morning when you leave , This hotel has comfortable if small rooms that are very well furnished with nice little items a cool mini bar and great art The restaurant is one of the best in the area with fresh seasonal produce And the staff are amazingly helpful 
259856,Le Pigalle Hotel, Room and bathroom was extremely small The closet was the same space as minibar Not enough space to put your furniture if you are traveling two people or coming to Paris for more than 2 days , This hotel has an excellent taste for art and represents the flavor of the neighborhood which can be described as the red light street of Paris Its very safe to walk around and the streets are full of people The room was full of artworks from different artists and the bathroom had LeLabo shampoos Wifi was solid for business 
259857,Le Pigalle Hotel, Extremely small rooms with bunkbed Very cramped hotel in general Breakfast fairly priced but with bread with eggs was an old piece of bread with a stone cold egg ,No Positive
259858,Le Pigalle Hotel,No Negative, Loved the cool and super friendly staff and the relaxed environment of the hotel True Parisian experience specially if you prefer small hotels with personality take your time and enjoy some food and drinks in the restaurant while you mingle with the locals Great details in the room totally connected with the area and the neighborhood Location is also very good walking distance to the pretty streets of Montmartre 
259859,Le Pigalle Hotel, The first room we stayed in wasn t very clean as there was some old soap left stuck to the shelf in the shower and a cleaning cloth left on the side in the bathroom The standard rooms are also very small Some of the staff were not very friendly , The bed was very comfortable
259860,Le Pigalle Hotel, The wifi doesn t really work properly, The whole style of Le Pigalle is perfect the food is excellent and the staff are great It makes for a very relaxing stay 
259861,Le Pigalle Hotel, Would have loved tea and coffee facilities in the room and bathrobes but that s only being really picky Having seen both the small and larger rooms I recommend paying the extra for the larger room if it s within budget the small rooms are very small but still very comfortable , Le pigalle staff are what makes this place Always keen to help and go out of their way to do so The beds are extremely comfortable and the style of the whole hotel is fabulous Le Pigalle is loved by both locals and tourists alike The neighbourhood is superb with plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance A huge THANK YOU to all the staff for making our trip so special we ll be back

259863,Le Pigalle Hotel, Not safe area noisy and dirty very small rooms Please pay attention for the bill they will charge you more than you really spent like you didn t eat the breakfast they noted in your bill or taxes for more people Don t believe that they said they will return the extra money taken by mistake into your credit card Later they will say your bank is not good to return and if you provide the other they will never rely again ,No Positive

259867,Le Pigalle Hotel, The Was tight and I had the 2nd largest room in the hotel and impractically laid out No separation between bedroom and bathing or showering No place to put luggage and very little storage Seemed more like a place for a romantic overnight rather than a family vacation from the US , The food was great the staff was great Close to the metro Comfortable beds
