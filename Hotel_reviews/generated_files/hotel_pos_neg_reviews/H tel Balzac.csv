220059,H tel Balzac, The room and corridor stank of cigarettes The smell was being pumped in via the air con it would seem Waking up to a choking smell of cigarettes was terrible , Breakfast was far from value for money in a soul less room 
220060,H tel Balzac, There was only one small issue with the room there was no coffee machine which now comes standard with pretty much all 5 star hotels Another small issue I faced was no help from the bellboy when putting furniture in to the taxi when leaving , The location was excellent It was off the Champs Elysees and a 5 minute walk from the Arc De Triomphe The staff at the reception was extremely friendly and helpful I was travelling with my pregnant wife and the reception staff did their best to ensure that she got the biggest room possible so that she would not feel claustrophobic and had space to walk around The room had beautiful French furniture and the bathroom was great 
220061,H tel Balzac, Not very close to the airport so manage your time before getting there and very far from the city center, A good place to sleep over you have an early flight clean rooms friendly stuff Macdonalds and a busstop just a few meters away
220062,H tel Balzac,No Negative, The staff is incredible and the location is everything You re steps away from the literal heart of Paris The area is very safe during the night as well I had no issue walking from the Tower to the hotel after midnight Ordered room service twice food was excellent and portions were very large My room had a nice view of the streets below and even though it wasn t a walk out balcony you could still sit on it a bit The only issue I had were in some minor details I had some issues with the room phone one of my lights didn t work and the tub wouldn t fill However I was out a majority of the day so I didn t really care The other issue i had was room services letting a door slam repeatedly while cleaning the room next to mine at 9am I actually had to get out of bed to tell them to stop so I could sleep it promptly subsided Taxi service is quick and easy and bike rentals are legit right outside of the hotel doors Tons of restaurants near by The bed will suck you in tons of fluffy pillows and soft bedding 
220063,H tel Balzac,No Negative, Wanted breakfast in our room prior to departure and staff neglected to collect the order that was hanging on the door handle as per instructions BUT when we mentioned the oversight breakfast was provided at no cost in the dining room which was brilliant Great place to stay 
220064,H tel Balzac, 2nd day of check in we found a huge size of spider in the bathroom we killed it but it was horrible during check in the lady on the a female receptionist was very rued with us not smiling antagonize us we do not know why and she gave us very smallest room with very small bed that could accommodate 2 persons not same what the size expected and reserved by us we called the a female duty manager next day inside the room and she saw the huge spider in the bathroom and we told her that we book a big room then she immediately moved us to a spacious room with a side view , location concierge was very helpful
220065,H tel Balzac,No Negative, Great Location the hotel is very nice and chic The staff is friendly and helpful A slight renovation of the hotel would be welcome though as it shows already some signs of fatigue But nothing critical so far 
220066,H tel Balzac, Booking website and in the description of the hotel it was mentioned this is hotel is a Boutique though it is 5 This is I think miss leading Not much variety of the food during breakfast and not worth to the value I paid The hotel is compacted with small corridors and small elevators The temperature of the shower water was hot and couldn t go to lower temperature , The staff were very helpful and found them do their best in making their customers happy 
220067,H tel Balzac, The room had a smell the Conceiage was very poor The worst part was the ability to hear everything in the next door room including what their entertainment choices were need I say more , Reception staff
220068,H tel Balzac,No Negative, I like the people who s working there especially Dune and Stephen they are kind helpful They are working from their heart I strongly recommend this beautiful hotel 
220069,H tel Balzac, This is not a 5 hotel It may have been in the past The d cor and feel of the hotel is dates a classic hotel which has seen better days , Good Location
220070,H tel Balzac, I booked a superior double room expecting a beautiful bed with a princess feel as the images suggested but was sorely disappointed What I got in reality was two large single bed mattresses pushed together which proceeded to slip apart through the night This along with other issues like broken door handles broken shower dials and inattentive staff at breakfast really ruined the entire experience particularly as the hotel was very expensive and booked as an extravagant 40th birthday present did not meet expectations ,No Positive
220071,H tel Balzac, They don t provide coffee and tea like all hotels Also they gave me my request in the next day of my arrival Moreover I rent the room with a big sofa I cam make it as an extra bed but they lied No sofa is available , The location is good especially it is closed to Shamps Allysa
220072,H tel Balzac, The lobby was under construction when I arrived I had to take the service elevator because the main elevator wasn t working The next day it still wasn t fixed , The location and view of my room
220073,H tel Balzac, Lift it just exist one lift and so many times it didnt work thats why we used stairs we were in 5th floor but it was good at least we had extra exercise after breakfast or dinner not so much important, Good location and kind staff and helpful I am so happy I chosed there actually it was important for me that everything to be great because I wanted to propose my girlfriend and they arranged everything very lovely and romantic I do highly recommend this hotel those man who wants to propose in paris
220074,H tel Balzac, maintenance work at the hotel could not use the lift we reserve a 30m2 square room and got a smaller one the stay was shortened to one night , strategic location very close to champs elysees
220075,H tel Balzac, All the faculty in the hotel are in a bad condition I have spent one full day without a hot water nor a heater I also witnessed a couple of time an issue with elevator The manager was so cooperative and upgraded me to a junior suit however the hotel need a major renovation and a regular maintenance, Nothing
220076,H tel Balzac, We only stayed one night , The staff were all fabulous in particular our Valet and the concierge who were both extremely helpful and always on hand to help The hotel itself is beautiful and in an excellent location right of the Champs Ellyses and easy walking distance to the tower Food in the area was excellent and the room service in the hotel was brilliant 
220077,H tel Balzac, Awful breakfast and coffee rooms where average and cramped staff could be more friendly Wifi is very slow quicker to use my own 3G Would drop this a star , Location and Patrick the concierge who was amazing 
220078,H tel Balzac, Coming from Asia ME the room space was comparitevely smaller but enough for a couple , The staff was excellent Always helpful and happy to make some great recommendations The location is great and quite central 
220079,H tel Balzac, Breakfast expensive for what it is just like any other hotel in Paris , Great and comfortable bed normal valet parking prices friendly staff and superbe rooms
220080,H tel Balzac, We did not like that when we checked in we mentioned that two years ago when we stayed there that we had problems with the a c not cooling properly Again we had problems and had to move our room at midnight only to have the cooling improved a small amount We had to bring a fan into the room the hotel provided this , We like the location of the hotel and the small size and beauty of the hotel 
220081,H tel Balzac, only THE PILLOWS on the third day my neck and my wife s got stiff because of the bad pillows , STAFF helpful and friendly LOCATION few steps away from Champs elysee arc de triomphe cleanness fast WI FI auto cleaning toilet Everything was great 
220082,H tel Balzac, No bar or restaurant The attached restaurant did not belong to the hotel and was booked 2 month in advance, Very helpful staff with great recommendations for restaurants Best possible location
220083,H tel Balzac, Pillows not very comfy either too low or too high Ordered bread basket and coffee in room one morning ans was charged for full continental 26 I was dreaming of fresh crusty baguette but got a very chewy not very fresh one instead so not very happy to pay such price for poor quality not in line with 5 star hotel , Great concierge fabulous location Quiet hotel Room with beautiful view of Eiffel Tower
220084,H tel Balzac, Wifi didnt work and bathtub neither , The wifi is Very bad if you need good wifi dont book here The location is good and the decoration and services too Just the wifi They need to improve 
220085,H tel Balzac, There was a guy staff member he said who entered the room while I was at the bathroom He seemed weird to me because he was in a hurry to leave the room once I saw me mentioning that he came to check the curtains but they seem okay now , The room was really beautiful decorated looking very fancy The location is also good 2 3 minutes walking from Champs Elysees 
220086,H tel Balzac, Rooms a little small perhaps Trouble fining a medium priced good local resturant near by , In a world of modern boutique hotels it was a visual treat to stay where you shared a sense of history beautifully presented 
220087,H tel Balzac, The bed was very uncomfortable with plastic mattress covers not what you d expect from a five star hotel , The location was great and the staff very friendly
220088,H tel Balzac, Some things in the room didn t work like the phone near my bed and the water in the bathtub kept getting stuck , The location is great You will be in the heart of Paris The staff is very helpful and friendly 
220089,H tel Balzac, Breakfast was a little pricey Bar area was too small to have any real buzz about it but that s fine you are in Paris , Location was absolutely superb and d cor was very comfortable and luxurious Staff were also very pleasant 
220090,H tel Balzac, Breakfast although good could be amazing if there was a wider selection on offer or potentially daily treats to add some variety and excitement in keeping with the 5 status , Booked this hotel for a romantic getaway and was pleasantly surprised in a few areas Firstly the location is outstanding Genuinely only a few moments away from the Arc de Triomphe end of the Champs Elysee Makes sightseeing and coordinating extremely easy Our room had a view of the Eiffel Tower which was a wonderful addition to wake up to The room decor is classy and comfortable Staff generally pleasant and helpful Breakfast was usual European affair good selection but for a 5 residence I d recommend a wider variety or a daily special to add a bit of glamour and excitement Otherwise a really lovely stay and would thoroughly recommend for a quick romantic getaway due to the luxury ease and proximity to the sights 
220091,H tel Balzac, They charge for water They shouldn t They don t even put complementary water, The design I love it because it s so classic It s a French luxury
220092,H tel Balzac,No Negative, Stuff and cleaners are good she move our stuff at safe side easy for check out did not charge even we are late check out from small room up grade to large and comfy room
220093,H tel Balzac, The only thing I can say is the view outside the window We requested for the eiffel tower view but we could only see the tip of the tower However this would just be a minor thing because hotel balzac is seriously magnifique , We would really commend the staff of the Balzac hotel who were very helpful to us We really felt welcome and the atmosphere itself drew us in Not to forget that the hotel is really in the heart of the city meaning to say easy access to interesting places in Paris 
220094,H tel Balzac, No complimentary tea or water in rooms For a 4 5 star hotel this is an expectation This was the only inconvenient disappointment A small detail to make guests feel more welcome , Decor location quality of bedding and toiletries excellent Small intimate hotel Bar staff amazing helpful with heating baby food and accommodating your needs sadly I highchairs
220095,H tel Balzac, My room was very small The first day was with no hot water The first day the water Basin was blocked, The hospitality of the Staff The staff was very helpful The location of the Hotel
220096,H tel Balzac, Could be a sitting area other than in the lobby which was drafty Sofa and chairs in dining area were really not comfortable , Staff was attentive helpful and excellent 
220097,H tel Balzac, Breakfast has 2 options Continental basically bread and pastries for 28 Euros or American the continental plus cold meets and smoked salmon for 38 Euros Both way too much money for what s on offer , Staff ambience and location all excellent Would go again 
220098,H tel Balzac, It simply dont provide what they advertise on website Took them two days to fix a tv although for what we paid we expected better service Wifi was quick room was very clean Front door lock was faulty and we couldnt lock it Had to wait for maintenance to come and fix the door for a while so we were late to our restaurant reservation as we couldnt leave room unattended, It simply dont provide what they advertise on website Took them two days to fix a tv although for what we paid we expected better service Wifi was quick room was very clean Front door lock was faulty and we couldnt lock it Had to wait for maintenance to come and fix the door for a while so we were late to our restaurant reservation as we couldnt leave room unattended
220099,H tel Balzac, Our room s air system was broken and they were not able to move us to a different room It was pretty warm in Paris and even though they gave us a fan we were pretty uncomfortable in the room The bed was also very uncomfortable For 5 stars and for the amount I paid I was hoping for a bit more luxury , Location was great and the staff was friendly 
220100,H tel Balzac, 1 Rooms are not isolated 2 A C was not working fine 3 No master switch off 4 Room services were not respect the privacy of us while we put DND sign which means they OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT KNOCKING 5 The reception policy is blocked 100 EUR per night as guarantee 6 The dedicated around 7 EUR per person as paris night fee without pre approval 7 Add adapter fee in my invoice by mistake That s all , Location
220101,H tel Balzac, 38 EUR per person for the breakfast buffet was crazy high for the level of breakfast buffet A reason for NOT coming back , Good location very friendly staff nice comfortable rooms
220102,H tel Balzac, On arrival we discovered we had no hot water until the next morning We booked the lounge for dinner assuming that the window looking into the kitchen watching lots of chefs working were cooking for us but this is not the case They are cooking for the adjacent restaurant don t be fooled by the website that DOES lead you to believe that the restaurant is in the hotel Very misleading and disappointing as our food was AWFUL, The bar manager was lovely and very helpful
220103,H tel Balzac, First of all in our room heating didn t work a baby bed was broken and with a big hole a sink was leaking lamp worked badly so the whole room was awful and needed the whole renovation After our complaints stuff changed a room for us for a bigger one That room was much better But sink there also had problems and heating did t work , Excellent location Friendly and helpful stuff especially a Russian guy Robert Nothing else
220104,H tel Balzac,No Negative, The care and courtesy shown towards my mobility impaired husband and myself Right through to sending us our wallet left behind in the safe Outstanding The building d cor music and staff all brilliant Thank you 
220105,H tel Balzac, Synthetic mix not 100 cotton sheets hard pillow tiny bedroom cheap tacky decor and like a good 3 star hotel definitely not a 5 star and prices extortionate, The location
220106,H tel Balzac, Their breakfast room service menu is expensive , The Staff are amazing and the location couldnt be any better The facilities provided in the hotel rooms are excellent 
220107,H tel Balzac, I don t like the way going back from champs elysees Rue Balzac good road for exericrs after walking a long champs elysees Housekeeping open door every morning when im sleeping Asking to clean the room The delay in Room Services No coffee machine or kettle, Staff dealt many times with concierge they are very familiar with paris hidden taste look for Mr Dennis Facilits and room conditions my room being cleaned twice a day you dont need to hang up make up room card Them and design you will feel so luxury Even if its small room Locatd near to Arc de Triomphe Cafe Georges V where I eat my breakfast 
220108,H tel Balzac, Stuffy and somewhat pretentious expensive for what it really is Arrived there quite tired and bathroom had a huge leak That is no one took care to check the room previously Had to wait until another room was available but by then I decided to leave the hotel Didn t get a refund Would lower its rate to three stars ,No Positive
220109,H tel Balzac, The property needs maintenance Ac needs fixing in some rooms either too cool or hot The lift broke down twice, Attentive staff willing to assist Location location and quiet
220110,H tel Balzac, The hotel not deserve 5 star My room was not prepared untill I come Then the aircondition was broken and there isnt any free room to change They promise me to upgrade me the next day but they didn t do then they offer the second night for free It was bad experince The hotel is with one elevitore no hair conditioner just shmpoo and shower jel wifi to slow hotel is not deserve 5 star , Offer one night free
