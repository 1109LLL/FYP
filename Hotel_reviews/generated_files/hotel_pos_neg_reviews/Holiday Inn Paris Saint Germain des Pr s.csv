260657,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The bathroom shower screen was not properly sealed If you use overhead shower the water will be spilled all over the floor We had to upgrade to superior room from deluxe room which we booked for a non refundable package deal The reason was that the hotel couldn t accommodate 3 persons 2 adults 1 child in a deluxe room The notification just came few days before our departure to Paris Earlier communication would be much appreciated , The staffs were friendly and helpful Free car park for the guests they even gave us extended parking time until afternoon The breakfast was varied and tasteful The hotel is located nicely near metro station with plenty of restaurants nearby plus it is situation in convenient and quiet neighbourhood but yet still not far from tourist attractions

260665,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, 1 The room and bed were extremely small for us We are a family of 2 adults and a 3 year old baby and couldn t all fit on the queen size bed As for our baby stroller we couldn t fit it in the room even when it was folded and had to leave it outside the room at all times 2 The breakfast was a continental breakfast and not an american style breakfast thus the varities were very limited to pastries cornflakes and some cheese , 1 The hotel is located right next to the Saint Placid metro station just about 1 min away from the station entrance Its also located right in the center of Paris enabling you to visit all the attractions by just walking around and you don t even need to take the metro Its on one of the busiest shopping streets of Paris filled with shops resturaunts and supermarkets 2 The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and they even ordered us some delievery food on our first day of arrival as we arrived a bit late 23 00 and the hotel kitchen and roomservice were already closed 
260666,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, I recieved a twin bed in my room although booked a queen bed room When I checked in late at night they started to say that they are not obliged to provide queen bed and only after they rechecked the booking they admitted that there was a mistake They could not have upgrade since the hotel was fully booked according to them I guess that that just sold my room twice thinking there will be a no show This is not appropriate for a holiday inn hotel , The hotel location is great The free wifi is pretty good breakfast is fairly good 
260667,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, A waitress at the breakfast restaurant was really unfriendly and even angry with the guests Reception staff were friendly but didnt know how to manage our reservation very well , Quite rooms Almost good breakfast 
260668,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The first night Thursday 3rd November we had poor service from the night staff very unprofessional Resolved this situation the next day, Croissants Liked the manager on Friday morning 4th November He helped us sort out our room issue gave us an upgrade and free drinks
260669,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The standard bedroom and bathroom toilet are too small hard to move around The lifts make noisy sound , The breakfast is OK many choices enough I do love the croissants they are perfect 
260670,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The lighting in the bedroom is very weak making it very difficult to read in bed The design of the faucets in the bathroom is really stupid smooth round surfaces that make it hard to turn them with wet hands , The bed was very comfortable The staff friendly and helpful The lobby bar elegant and pleasant
260671,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Staff staff staff They were all excellent very professional and very friendly as well The hotel is close to Jardin du Luxembourg and very close to 2 Metro lines It s a little bit farther from the river than a tourist might like but this has the advantage of the area being less full of tourists and more French The cafe around the corner L Horizon is also excellent with friendly staff and quality food not really cheap though You don t have to walk far to have your coffee and croissant in the morning sun 
260672,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, We had a room facing the street side Room was well insulated for noise except the window Noise from the street was a bit loud It either needs a better window or a better seal to help block out noise , Breakfast was very nice We would stay there again 
260673,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, The hotel is in a great location An easy walk to restaurants and sites The staff were very friendly and helpful It all made a great time in Paris Thanks Holiday Inn

260676,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Unclean room with used shampoo bottles and used dairy cream on the coffee tray, Helpful staff gave us a free upgrade with our complaint of room cleanliness 
260677,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Didn t find anything bad , If you stay there please add the breakfast Breakfast was excellent Lots of items and most of the items are of very good quality Staffs were very friendly especially Joe was very helpful Within 2 minutes there is a subway you can reach all places easily 
260678,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, On Saturday August 20th our room never got cleaned We had to ask for fresh towels Also the bathroom shower is a very poor design The glass door wasn t secure so water always ran down the floor out to the door , We liked the location and how helpful staff was for directions 
260679,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Housekeeping The receptionist tried to check us in different room or two rooms with higher rates than we had already booked, Location Breakfast is fair
260680,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Room 501 is a bit of an odd location having to walk through a hall where the maids store their vacuum is strange Also in 615 it is impossible to take a shower without soaking the floor Overall I really enjoyed my stay though , I loved the location The price was fantastic The rooms were nice 
260681,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, We had to leave early and had paid for breakfast in advance so they wanted to charge 7E for us to request a takeaway coffee and croissant This was extremely disappointing as they should have honoured this in good faith for nothing Forfeiting a full breakfast already paid in return for a croissant and coffee takeaway at 6am surely is no hardship and they win regardless so not even doing this for no charge let alone an additional charge this let the hotel down in my opinion and I m in the hotel industry , Loved the location and buffet breakfast was good Room ready early was a bonus 
260682,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Breakfast a little expensive 18 pp we walked to a local cafe bar each morning to enjoy breakfast for half the price , Transport to and from hotel organised by hotel at our request Helpful welcoming friendly staff We had connecting rooms so our family could stay together Not far from local attractions or metro lines if it s your preferred way to travel Clean rooms and facilities Would definitely stay here again 
260683,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Underground breakfast room no windows there burngrey buffet and service , Underground parking available at the hotel Short walk from subway station 
260684,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The breakfast is not worth the money They run out of everything and it takes too long to refill Lots of great cafes and shops around to grab breakfast on your way out , Liked the neighborhood

260686,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Small Bathroom but normal for Paris , good location can walk to Eiffel Tower and others nearby in 20 25 mins near a large shopping street and several nice Cafe Bars nearby metro within 2 3 mins walking distance and others not to far away Comfortable for a tourist out all day Rooms were clean

260689,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, The room was gorgeous and clean The staff was very friendly always with a smile and ready to help Breakfast was excellent with a vast choice of food Most importantly the Hotel was close to all amenities including Saint Placide and Rennes Metros

260691,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, I am satisfied with the hotel in most aspects except for one item as of today Sunday 24th April 2016 this hotel is blocking a reservation amount of 111 04 Euros against my Visa card This amount has been already paid earlier this week on 18th April 2016 from the Visa card I am Very DISSATISFIED about this Could Booking com help me Thanks Bj rn Espedal,No Positive
260692,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The first room we stayed in was too small for two people It was very difficult to move around We came back a few days after our first booking and were given a much bigger room thankfully , Shower Pressure was great Bed was comfy 
260693,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Our room was at the 4th floor facing the main road directly opposite the apartments Less privacy and the unloading of goods in the morning was quite noisy Otherwise it will be perfect , Location is very convenience literarily next to the metro exit Staff was very helpful and we were allowed to checking on our arrival at lunch hour 
260694,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Small room but that s Paris I guess And we had a baby cot which left us with little room to move around The bathroom design could be improved Water was leaking from the basin and the bath tub If we weren t careful enough the whole bathroom could end up flooding and there was no barrier between the bathroom and bedroom Water could easily flow out of the bathroom , Great location Very close to the metro and shops We stayed for 4 nights The housekeeper Dragana or Drayana was very friendly and good at keeping the room tidy 
260695,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s,No Negative, Perfect location stunning and beyond well equipped top floor room with an unrequested yet deeply appreciated view of the Eiffel Tower staff beyond friendly and an overall amazing stay

260698,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, When we arrived in the hotel nobody greeted us After we got our room card nobody offered to help us with our bags instead we had to find a trolley ourselves The rooms are dated pink purple themed throughout very small requested in advance for a room in the upper levels with a better view received room on first floor without view instead TV was positioned diagonally to the bed had to turn to see anything very uncomfortable Room was so small we hardly had room to walk around the bed Even the ceilings are low The bathrooms were old with stains and dirty corners around bathtub Glass sliding door for the bathroom which makes a loud noise and bangs when you close or open Noise from bathroom transfers to bedroom not romantic at all The worst part the food DO NOT INCLUDE BREAKFAST It is the worst breakfast i have ever had in any hotel We couldn t eat any of it and were stuck with it for 4 days It looks like food but tastes like garbage Fruits are from a can meat is deep fried extremely oily juice is sugar water pancakes are sickly sweet coffee is a nespresso machine without milk frother ie only espresso real lattes etc cost extra croissants are worse than the frozen variety you get in a supermarket and the worst part is every day you have exactly the same limited buffet World s cheapest smallest buffet Much nicer to eat in a cafe in paris and less expensive Overall wouldn t recommend staying there with the prices they are charging Should be downgraded to 3 star , Easy to get to subway station That s about it really 
260699,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, would be good to have a shuttle directly from the airport to the hotel we arrived at night and slept close to the airport and thus lost one morning to come over , the location very convenient Close to restaurants shops theater the hotel modern design very good breakfast

260701,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, bathroom is the only one i ve seen that has a clear window into the bedroom it has a shade but on the bedroom side sink is new but awkward since the spout on one end causes water to flow out that end as well when you wash your hands , centrally located within walking distance to many sites and Metro is right outside the door Staff is very helpful for directions tickets etc 
260702,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, Room furniture and carpets are very old and dirty windows are not closing properly and getting sound and cold inside , staff is ok localisation is ok
260703,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, worn down window difficult to handle Basic iron available on demand but very timeconsuming to get a decent result , very helpful staff swiftly and adequately responsive to whichever our needs 
260704,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The room lay out is very odd the toilette with a glass view to the bedroom is very annoying The position of the bath tub and taps can be very dangerous for someone older or clumsy At night the area is very quiet , The hotel is very close the metro station Breakfast is very good and staff is also very efficient 
260705,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, At this rate I would expect breakfast to be included , A great central location which allowed us to leisurely walk to all the sights Also there is secure underground parking

260717,Holiday Inn Paris Saint Germain des Pr s, The shower drain was blocked the first night and I mensioned it to the cleaner and she had it fixed , The position was great right across the train station and the hotels position was pretty central to alot of places but bare in mind you d like to walk about 30 45 minutes to most main attractions
