384026,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Genuinely lovely and helpful staff Conveniently located but nicely tucked away off the main street so no noise Great breakfast worth including in your booking I also had one dinner in the restaurant which was also excellent Very cool interior decoration and furniture I stayed for work but would book again for holidays 
384027,Hotel V Nesplein, Could not name one thing, The whole hotel is very stylish The rooms were ver y big and the beds and pillows were super comfortable The rain shower had great water pressure and the bathtub was very deep and big The rooms have all you need Breakfast was great and also good price value Everything was super clean The peopke were very friendly Especially the reception people they were all exceptionally helpful even with an accidentally late checkout Fantastic stay And the location is smack in the middle of everything 
384028,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The restaurant is excellent for breakfast lunch and dinner The staff is beyond excellent When I return to Amsterdam I will stay at this hotel again without a question 
384029,Hotel V Nesplein, Not 1 single thing probably the first time in my whole 30 years travelling experience , The atmoshpere of the hotel is really great young trendy dynamic decorated with style Staff was very kind i have travelled with my 19 years old god daughter and we had lots of fun The hotel is in absolute downtown but in a small street so we had no probelm at all with the noise of the city bars around Ther kitchen is fabulous we were planning to explore several restaurants but finally choose to come back for meals almost all the time 
384030,Hotel V Nesplein, Bathroom vanity was lacikng shelving to place our toiletries , Comfy bed pillows opening window for fresh air good space for luggage Great central location close to everything we needed Breakfast staff attentive 
384031,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, It is as good as it shows in the description of the hotel The room I stayed in was more than spacious The cleanliness is pronounced and the staff members are decent and welcoming I forgot my expensive eyeglasses and they took care of delivering it abroad flawlessly Very thankful

384033,Hotel V Nesplein, Can t think of anything at all, Location is excellent this relatively quiet side street in the heart of Amsterdam is an ideal base food was fantastic
384034,Hotel V Nesplein, The decor may appeal to everyone i didn t partcularly like it but that is a minor quibble , Clean extremely pleasant staff looking to make your stay as comfortable as possible the hotel a five minute walk away from the RLD but is in a little lane less noise and rowndy people pasaing by I have no complaints and would recommend it to a friend I wouldn t hesitate to stay there again 
384035,Hotel V Nesplein, No gym need to walk a few blocks to get to the local gym but it s a good one , Fabulous room in a perfect location Walking distance from the train station this is a unique hotel with a lot of personality 
384036,Hotel V Nesplein, Bad quality free wifi Intermittent and weak Just my room I think Furthest from the router as reception was fine in the corridors and downstairs at resorption and bar , Great staff great location non clinical feel of hotel funky decor very comfy bed great spacious room Really felt at home there sad to leave 
384037,Hotel V Nesplein, The room didn t have separate air conditioning separate control Although it was mentioned in the facilities segment in our booking, The hotel restaurant was amazing
384038,Hotel V Nesplein, It was a rather warm time while were in Amsterdam end June 2017 and wish the room was air conditioned But with window open it was pleasant at night , Funky decor perfect if you are seeking an out of the ordinary hotel after too much time in look alike hotel chains Room was large and adequately equipped Toilet has two showers which was fun The Lobby Restaurant serves good food at reasonable prices The location was perfect for tourists as it is at center of old town Amsterdam Easy twenty minute walk to Museum Plaza ten minutes to train station and close r to other attractions Numerous restaurants in the vicinity Easy access to pleasant walks along the canals 
384039,Hotel V Nesplein, the double bed was not a double bed but two singles shoved together and made it hard to cuddle since the beds would slide apart upon contact , the staff was extraordinarily helpfull and friendly the minibar was very well stocked
384040,Hotel V Nesplein, Bathroom wasn t cleaned and bathrobes were left were they were Very noisy hard floors so could hear other guests walking round 350 a night and breakfast NOT included Very loud knock on the door at 11am on day of checkout to make sure we were leaving , Bed was lovely and comfortable the bathroom was huge with a massive bath and walk in shower The staff are simply fantastic young hip and enthusiastic 
384041,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The staff was extra careful to keep up excellent service The interior decoration was great adding up to a perfect atmosphere and breakfast just what we needed 
384042,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The location is very very close to Dam Square The receptionists are very friendly and energetic The room was wonderful very big and cosy I really liked this hotel 
384043,Hotel V Nesplein, Would be nice to have a proper wardrobe instead of just a hanging rail but that s to do with the minimalist feel in the rooms , Superb hotel absolutely faultless very hard to find anything bad to say would highly recommend This hotel should have 5 stars not 4
384044,Hotel V Nesplein, nothing everything was perfect, Great location Staff were incredible very willing to help with any situation Very close to main square but very very quite inside Restaurant also was awesome 
384045,Hotel V Nesplein, We didn t like dinner that much Expensive very small portions of main course , Excellent location right in the middle of all the actions and attractions Lovely stuff very good breakfast in a fair price has to be ordered in advance by the reception 
384046,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Perfect location for exploring Amsterdam Dinner in the very popular Lobby restaurant was delicious Definitely make reservations Rooms were beautiful and comfortable Amenities were above average 
384047,Hotel V Nesplein, My only complaint is that the hallways are very dark , The staff was amazing Very helpful I was travelling with my adult daughter who has Celiac disease and needed a gluten freee meal The staff bent over backwards to make sure she has wonderful choices Dan in particular seemed to take it as a personal mission to make sure she was looked after One night we were told it would be a few minutes for the gluten free bread They had run out and sent someone to a neighbouring restaurant for some 
384048,Hotel V Nesplein, There is no mini bar in the comfort class rooms , Eggs royalle with salmon and granola yoghurt were delicious Cocktails at the bar were the best one Hotel is located in the heart of Amsterdam Location is great We liked it much and are going to stay here again 
384049,Hotel V Nesplein, The Air con was central and i could not control temperature and when i told the staff its little stuffy they got me a fan which was not too bad the room was pretty small but the bathroom size was ok, Location is perfect hotel is like boutique style hotel with friendly staff and nice atmosphere
384050,Hotel V Nesplein, The room because it was booked through booking com was nearest to the glass door that separates the floors and ir was located in first floor The noise from tourists was a bit annoying The view was of a brick wall despite asking for a view , I liked that the staff employees of Hotel V are from the Netherlands hence the welcoming experience was great Very patient and helpful people made my first to Ansterdam simply wonderful 
384051,Hotel V Nesplein, I would expect more for that price Dark rooms Only one chear in room Only one chest of drawers Very poor lobby actually only tattered sofa and chair, Location very convinient
384052,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The Hotel V Nesplain is a lovely boutique hotel with quirky style The staff were helpful and very pleasant Our room was huge on the top floor at the end of the corridor The bed was magical I d love to know what it is My only negative comment is about the housekeeping schedule My daughter and I left every day in the morning and came back to our room around 3 4 and our room hadn t been serviced After mentioning this to the staff they had our room ready the next afternoon They also comped us some champagne while we waited for our room to be cleaned I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam The location was perfect It s tucked in a side street in the center of town Dank U Wel Tot Ziens 
384053,Hotel V Nesplein, Chairs in the room aren t comfortable or functional only funky Music in the restaurant in the morning not calming not appropriate for AM Room a bit overpriced , The hotel has a hip vibe and is in a quiet backstreet yet central to everything Location is great It s a bit overpriced for the size of the room and functionality has been overlooked by funky in the case of the chairs in the room The restaurant is also hip and all the staff very friendly and speak good English Wifi fantastic 
384054,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, I stayed at Hotel V Nesplein for nine nights during an extended business trip I really enjoyed and appreciated every aspect of my stay room staff location menu cost etc Without question I ll be returning to Hotel V at my next opportunity be that for business or holiday 
384055,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing, Beds were super comfy the shampoo soap etc smelt and were incredible and the Nespresso machine was an excellent inclusion Additionally their Door 74 secret bar was amazing Also at the end of our stay I proposed to my partner in the hotel room and she said yes 
384056,Hotel V Nesplein, Our first room was very small and people in offices 6M away had a perfect view of us As it was very shaded we needed the lights on and that meant that we had to keep the curtains closed We were moved to a much better room at the back which was fine but the minimal industrial design theme was not to our taste So be careful with room selection , The staff were incredible all of them including the restaurant staff They really added to our experience The location is perfect 
384057,Hotel V Nesplein, The third floor rooms could use a second or a little larger windows One window only made the room feel gloomier than necessary , Breakfast is always a treat at V the staff especially friendly and helpful and the interior design very chic 
384058,Hotel V Nesplein, The restaraunt here is ok not superb when it comes to starters but pretty good with main dishes like fish The Nes street gets very loud at night because the Red light District is nearby and couple of popular restaraunts are located in the neighbourhood The windows overlook business centre with glass walls so you d better not walk around naked , Breakfast is really substantial here and it s a la carte so it s totally worth it The location is great 
384059,Hotel V Nesplein, Bed situation is a bit strange only single beds , Fantastic Hotel shame about 2 SINGLE BED S and not a double in Suite Rooms Excellent location good staff cheap and cheerful but far from luxurious 
384060,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, We had an exceptionally late early morning check in and the staff on duty was so friendly and welcoming despite the time The rooms were perfect for us with coffee tea making facilities and a mini bar The breakfast room was warm and welcoming with a many traditional and standard items on the menu to choose from Even though on paper the hotel appears to be on the border of the red light district the hotel environs are quite The hotel is situated about a 1km from the Central station so public transport is very accessible 
384061,Hotel V Nesplein, There was a problem with heating during the first night of our stay but it was quickly fixed It would be great to add at least one more shelf in the bathroom to keep things the one which is there currently is not enough , The location is excellent in the city center but off the busy streets Nicely decorated room the size was just right for two people Very friendly staff at the reception and restaurant Stable wifi connection 
384062,Hotel V Nesplein, The amenities has a very masculine smell Maybe something more mild for the ladies Difficult to reach by car while the road works are going on in Rokin street , Excellent location the staff were all friendly and very helpful and friendly Loved the interior of the hotel and restaurant The Lobby restaurant is very well priced and the food is fantastic The hotel is quite expensive but well worth it 
384063,Hotel V Nesplein, No gym No Spa No views between buildings Office building over looking rooms of curtains not closed It s however a great place to stay if you require privacy and a hideaway since it doesn t have a big lobby No room service A bit over priced for its amenities and facilities , The location is amazing Smack center and accessible to every part of central easily Super clean rooms and sheets Great kitchen 
384064,Hotel V Nesplein, I was a bit disappointed in the beginning that my room didn t look like that photos i had seen in terms of configuration But we got over it my main concern was that they dont have closets you have to hang or fold your clothes in the open , The location of the hotel was fantastic the rooms in the hotel come with different configurations Comparing the two rooms we had booked ours was a bit smaller than out friends but our bathroom was much more spacious with a tub and a shower Their room was a bit larger with a smaller bathroom So be smart as ask for specific rooms and they dont all look like the photos on their site Still very comfortable and clean and friendly staff 
384065,Hotel V Nesplein, The motif of the hotel was modernist and looks good However there was a distinct lack of practicality in the rooms For instance lack of storage space in shower I had to place my shampoo and razor on the floor of the shower There was no place to lay my bathroom kit and no place to lay my toothbrush or comb or other items Also the chairs in the room looked good and allowed you to sink back into a near reclined position However they were entirely impractical when I needed a place to sit to put my shoes and socks on , The staff were unfailingly positive helpful and friendly The location of the hotel was good 
384066,Hotel V Nesplein, The breakfast A la carte with very long service the value for money, The atmosphere and decor of the hotel the friendly staff the location the restaurant
384067,Hotel V Nesplein, I can not remember about anything specific Maybe it was a little dusty around the beds, great location friendly staff the rooms offer everything needed for a good stay delicious breakfast a la carte relatively good Wi fi
384068,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing It was all amazing Best weekend I ve ever had , The staff and location were excellent Bar and restaurant very good Can t fault one thing 
384069,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, central location within walking distance of all main attractions hotel has a really relaxed atmosphere but offers everything you could ask for staff were helpful and attentive rooms were cleaned daily beds very comfortable and although its in the citys heart it was always quiet we didnt eat an evening meal there but the breakfasts were amazing and nothing was too much trouble highly recommended and will definitely return
384070,Hotel V Nesplein, Well despite my comment that the room was quiet the door was actually not so sound proof Anyone being outside would sound like being inside the room Not so many people running around so that helped Like many european boutique hotels in general air conditioning is almost unheard of This place would probably get very stuffy in summer unless they have some master control to rule them all Personally I would prefer no more than 21 degrees at night This was more than that and this was at winter Quilts are very warm so I was actually sweating a bit But I m probably more sensitive to this than most It would ve been possible to open the window though should the need have ocurred albeit at the expense of some noise , The location was great and surprisingly quiet given the racket outside Very nice resturant Food was great although I only tried the brekkie Room decor was unusual to say the least andI loved it Very practical and very dutch
384071,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Really great location Staff were great The bar and restaurant in the hotel were excellent but book if you want a table but you can normally sit at the bar and eat Great map with other recommendations 
384072,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Gorgeous hotel Very friendly personal Beautiful lobby very nice and cozy room Mine even had two windows Additional compliment should go to the restaurant very tasty and fresh food We ve been in many restaurants in Amsterdam but V one is still one the best if you consider now where to stay V is the best choice 
384073,Hotel V Nesplein, You could hear a lot of outside noise people on the street outside the hallway in other rooms , This is an incredible hotel with a fantastic location The rooms are so spacious clean and have such a uniquely sophisticated style Staff were friendly 
384074,Hotel V Nesplein, The iron available was very poor I may as well used a big book to iron shirts That would be the only disappointing thing about my stay , Staff were amazing restaurant and bar was super and location was awesome 
384075,Hotel V Nesplein, Cleaning service works in strange late hours not very comfortable when you want to come back relax in the room at noon afternoon , Great location 2 min walk from Dam square but very quite Nice la carte breakfast Clean nice big room very comfortable bed wonderful huge rain shower coffee machine small fridge in the room good WIFI
384076,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The rooms are very big with large space fresh new innovated comfortable beds fully facilitized The Location is the best one can achieve in the centrum few steps of every classic place and 30m of a street fulls with restaurants and bars opened all night long The crew are gorgeous Pretty smiley and handful Definitely will come back again 
384077,Hotel V Nesplein, Service at the restaurant could be better speed politeness overall attitude , Beautiful little hotel located very centrally in a quiet street just off the Dam Square Clean and spacious room superior double with very comfortable bed Excellent restaurant bar
384078,Hotel V Nesplein, Breakfast was tasty preparation time was 15 20mn each day so a little long for my schedule , Hotel design has vintage boutique style very nice Personable staff Clean Central location 
384079,Hotel V Nesplein, No facilities in the hotel to purchase cold drinks or snacks that I noticed although they do offer a coffee machine and 2 bottles of water a day including mini refridgerator Wi fi in the rooms is poor couldn t have a Skype or Whats app call very well , Rooms are very well laid out and spacious enough Bathroom also nicely laid out apart from the shower floods the floor Coffee machine and water available in the room too 
384080,Hotel V Nesplein, No smoking in any of the rooms No terrace or balconies available No AC or fan for ventilation so opened the windows but was too noisy , The beds were really comfortable The room was very clean spacious and with a cool design Fast check in Check out Excellent location
384081,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing could of been better I know this is out of the hotels control but where the hotel is located doesn t pick up on maps so when you find it drop a pin and it will be easier to find , Could not fault this hotel will definitely stay here again when I return to Amsterdam was visiting with my boyfriend for a birthday and the staff went above and beyond to make our stay special Room was so chic and stylish Extremely clean shower was lovely wish mine at home was like that haha extra large beds were hard to get out of a morning Also loved the chandelier 
384082,Hotel V Nesplein, We booked on the basis of having a nice lobby with fireplace to relax in and warm up after a day out doing touristy stuff The hotel photos give the impression that the hotel lobby provides this However The Lobby is in fact a busy restaurant and the area around the feature fireplace which was not lit once the three night we stayed there in January brrrr only has two armchairs and a sofa which was often occupied by the restaurant users Plus this area was closed off when the restaurant was closed so you couldn t chill there past c 1am There is a small lobby area beside the reception but it s not a cosy place to relax I suspect there was more comfy seats around the fireplace at some point but they were removed to put more tables in to the busy and popular restaurant Also i suspect the fire isn t lit as it will be too close to said extra tables However we banked on there being a cosy lobby that we could relax in whenever we wanted without having to feel like we had to order a drink and a fire to warm our weary bones but we got neither The only but significant disappointing thing about an otherwise lovely hotel stay , All of the staff were super friendly and helpful Super cosy bedroom Great cocktails Loved the Nespresso machine in the bedroom too 
384083,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The staff were very friendly and gave excellent advice on what to do and where to go The lobby bar had a really nice atmosphere The location of the hotel was perfect 10 minute walk from central station and the shops and restaurants are within 1 min of the hotel lobby 
384084,Hotel V Nesplein, Wifi could be a little more powerful But that s really the only thing I could say it was wonderful , Pancakes are amaaaaaaazing Staff is really friendly and caring Location is perfect The room was spacious and comfortable 
384085,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing bad or negative to say , We loved everything about this place The staff was super friendly The location was perfect everything was within walking distance Definitely going back 
384086,Hotel V Nesplein, The room looks a bit tired and could use some renovation , The staff was very helpful We were allowed to check in early Location is great 
384087,Hotel V Nesplein, Would be better if there was a inclusive breakfast with the total price , Great hotel even better staff The bed and room are very comfortable Location is perfect close to everything you need Absolutely no complaints 
384088,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, This hotel is an all round amazing stay from the insanely comfortable beds that make it difficult to get out of in a morning to the beautiful food in the restaurant The staff are wonderful and location is excellent right behind dam square which means everything is in walking distance Wouldn t hesitate at staying here again 
384089,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, When we first stepped into the hotel we were very impressed with the decor The location is perfect as it s just off dam square and easy walking distance to shops etc The hotel staff were very friendly and with perfect English They helped with storing our bags and organising a taxi for us too 
384090,Hotel V Nesplein, Bac a douche is not that practical Water spills out to bathroom floor , We enjoyed our short holiday in Amsterdam Hotel location is excellent walking distance to center and touristic attractions Room is clean 
384091,Hotel V Nesplein, There is nothing that s not to like Great hotel and highly recommended , The location the extremely friendly staff and the unique interior of the hotel Everything was perfect 
384092,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Location is simply perfect staff is really nice and friendly Breakfast is amazing especially provided that you can enjoy it until 12pm Make sure to reserve one 
384093,Hotel V Nesplein, None, everything it s close to dam square and walking distance to all sites room is very clean The service was brilliant We loved the restaurant very much 
384094,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Great hotel friendly and helpful staff Location is awesome 20 minute walk from almost all the must see Amsterdam tourist spots Rooms were clean and had a nice ambiance Breakfast was amazing Highly recommend this hotel on your visit to Amsterdam 
384095,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing , The staff were really friendly and helpful The room was fantastic It was our third visit to Amsterdam and we have found an hotel which we will definitely return to It was a special occasion for the trip and they really made the trip special 
384096,Hotel V Nesplein, design has destroy comfort in some cases ie wardrobe arm chairs lights mirror etc Also the service at breakfast is a bit unorganized and the coffee as bitter as it gets, The bed the shower the breakfast room the staff at the reception Overall is a very nice hotel 
384097,Hotel V Nesplein, A la carte breakfast Not practical if you are in a hurry in the morning Buffet style breakfast would be much more convenient, Large and well appointed room Awesome location
384098,Hotel V Nesplein, Would have been even better with more shared lounge spaces The one small area at the back of the lobby restaurant was very welcoming but not so easily accessible and not sufficiently sized for the hotel , Excellent breakfast Great ambience in the lobby restaurant in particularly in the evenings stylish and comfortable rooms 
384099,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, On arrival the staff were really friendly and helpful The hotel is really clean looks amazing and the rooms are great The beds are extremely comfortable and rooms are also very clean The food in the hotel is 10 10 I will definitely recommend this hotel not just because of the perfect location but for the overall stay has made this trip that little bit more enjoyable Right around the corner is the DAM square with lots of things to do from shopping eating drinks and fun places to go and see I will book this hotel again for our next break away 
384100,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, I loved the place I would have never expected such a great hotel for that price Really friendly staff big room excellent design exceptionally comfortable bed great coffee Even the shampoo was great 
384101,Hotel V Nesplein, Not much not to like simply great, Great breakfeast as part of our birthday celebration it was on the house Very nice and helpful staff simply awsome location very close to everything great room which got upgraded due to our birthday celebration also on the house
384102,Hotel V Nesplein, Absolutely Nothing, Wow i don t even know where to start everything were so amazing we couldn t expect for anything better than what we got The staff were the nicest ever met the restaurant was so good and the room was so big and comfortable and so is the bed the location is the best you can get everything is close to you 
384103,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The location of the hotel was perfect Within walking distance of Centraal Station and close to the tram that took is to all the major sites and close to the action Red Light District the Dam and many many clubs and restaurants The staff could not have been more accommodating and friendly The restaurant at the hotel The Lobby was very popular with the locals so reservations were needed and certainly worthwhile Breakfasts were outstanding and dinner was a treat
384104,Hotel V Nesplein, Internet was horrible , The beds were incredibly comfortable some of the group couldn t stop exclaiming how terrific the beds were The service was incredibly good 
384105,Hotel V Nesplein, The offices opposite meant everyone could see into your room , Blackout curtains were amazing Lovely shower Bed was huge Staff were VERY friendly and helpful Room was very spacious and had everything you need Booked two nights and liked it so much we stayed a third night 
384106,Hotel V Nesplein, cleaning service weirdly timed possibly would ask at reception for it to be serviced in the mornings when we next stay, fantastic location very central restaurant downstairs is genuinely good more than just another hotel restaurant room was beautifully furnished and spacious staff were excellent professional friendly helpful
384107,Hotel V Nesplein, Very small rooms and toilet not in line considering the price of this accommodation more than 200 night and excluding breakfast The minibar was empty and this is not acceptable for an hotel with such rates , Very well located and close to main attractions Good design in common areas Very good breakfast 
384108,Hotel V Nesplein, Breakfast not special limited and not value for money It is debatable whether the bar has a restaurant or the restaurant is has a bar either way it is not comfortable , Comfy beds staff first class 
384109,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The location is superb and the restaurant they have there is excellent The hotel is very chic We had a super room on the 3rd floor with a huge bathroom Very clean and nice rooms The staff are extremely friendly and always willing to help and answer every question It s just off the Dam like literally just off 
384110,Hotel V Nesplein, The hotel is presented on booking com as a 4 star hotel but it is far from that standard Even in the hotel s booklet you can find they are presenting themselves as a 3 star hotel Very small rooms very very simple with equipment chairs wardrobe etc not corresponding at all with a 4 star quality , Quiet place in a small street Nes 
384111,Hotel V Nesplein, No aircon in the room which wasnt however a problem during our early October stay Bathroom floor could get slippy after showers though cheap slippers were provided due to the wetroom style And to really nit pick the towels provided were a little rough And there was no view except into offices across the street did not book expecting a canal view though haha , Bed was huge Parquet flooring Really helpful staff offering help with our young baby Great food in the restaurant Decent tv channels and browser included Free wifi Really clean everywhere bathroom was spotless Coffee machine was Nespresso plus there was a kettle for tea and nice tea selection Lift was big enough for our pram Open style wardrobe Easy to use modern safe in room Nice little fridge Decent hairdryer provided Sheets were comfortable and spotless Good number of plugs for charging phones etc Room was compact but not the claustrophobic vibe of other rooms I ve stayed in in Amsterdam Only a couple of minutes walk from Dam Square on a quiet street parallel to Rokin 
384112,Hotel V Nesplein, Our room 201 had no outlook only on to a roof and it was a superior room Don t like wardrobe set up and no drawers to put anything although I realise that is the style of the hotel, Beds were very comfortable The room was large The staff were excellent so pleasant and helpful Nice relaxing atmosphere We enjoyed breakfast although 15 euros I think value for money
384113,Hotel V Nesplein, nothing, the best staff i have meet they do evry think to keep us happy and comfortable evin the resterent staff they frindly and the breakfast was great room very nice clean bed was amazying thanks for evry one in the hotel
384114,Hotel V Nesplein, Breakfast seemed over priced really but we didn t go to Amsterdam just for breakfast , From arrival everything was well oiled Reception super friendly and knowledgeable Restaurant and Cocktails outstanding and reasonably priced Room was more than ample 
384115,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, OMG the staff are AMAZING Their recommendations and assistance made our trip The location of this hotel is also perfect We walked everywhere The room was small but very comfortable I would highly recommend this hotel 
384116,Hotel V Nesplein, Service has changed since I stayed here last the resturant isn t as good But it s still one of my fave places to stay because of the convenient location,No Positive
384117,Hotel V Nesplein, Our one challenge was that not all taxis seem to know this hotel and its vehicle access is challenging from the main street Because we had a bad taxi experience the Hotel V provided us with complimentary breakfast for our three mornings Definitely above and beyond We d definitely recommend this hotel but suggest calling ahead to make taxi arrangements with their preferred company , This hotel is just steps from Dam Square and within walking distance of virtually everything a tourist would want to experience We found the hotel staff exceptionally friendly cheerful and helpful The room was clean the washroom spacious and the beds very comfortable The Lobby Restaurant was totally full with locals every night but the hotel managed to provide us a table despite the fact that they were already fully booked The food for dinner was exceptional and the breakfast choices delicious and varied 
384118,Hotel V Nesplein, There is no cabinet or drawers in the room The interior is modern many modern hotels today make open hangers and shelves instead of cabinets , The location is simply superb Stuff is young and very careful The Lobby restaurant yes it is in the hotel s lobby is very good and in high demand You better make reservation for a dinner Room was nice and modern You do not have to buy the breakfast upfront it is in the Lobby It is possible to pick what you want every morning Highly recommended 
384119,Hotel V Nesplein, Maybe a little fridge to put snacks cold drinks or cold milk in for tea and coffees , This is a stylish and inspirational hotel with easy access to Amsterdam 10 to 15 walk from Central Station 4 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and shopping 2 3 minutes Red Light District A tram is a couple of minutes walk to jump on Hotel V restaurant serves delicious fresh foods the wine list is pretty impressive as well Please Note It is a Must to book in for the restaurant as it has tables reserved left right and centre all the time as it is very popular If you do you must try one of the FLINTERDUN PIZZAGERECHT Fantastic The rooms have a lovely appeal to them and the bathrooms are large and you have everything you need The staff are very accommodating and friendly There is a lot of work on around the hotel but you cannot hear anything Great Place to stay 
384120,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, I have stayed in this hotel before and went back because it is so nice A very short walk to Dam square yet in a quiet street The hotel has very friendly staff and the restaurant is excellent with the bonus of a very nice outdoor terrace We had a very nice suite which was huge by Amsterdam standards very comfortable Excellent service Highly recommanded 
384121,Hotel V Nesplein, Room was a little noisy so struggled to sleep although there may have been a problem with our window, Relaxed restaurant and bar Overall a beautiful hotel thats a little bit different from your usual
384122,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing tomcomplain about, Location is excellent Its near Damn square and 5 mins walk to red light district and coffee shops Great place for breakfast and better still if weatther allows tomdo it in open air Rooms clean and modern Check it out
384123,Hotel V Nesplein, I wish the would invest in instant hot water We got up one day and had an ice cold shower as others there did Screens for the Windows would be great We were eaten alive my mosquitos at night , Super helpful staff and great central and pretty quiet location on a little side street off the main ones We had one of the suites and it was very nice and large especially by European standards 
384124,Hotel V Nesplein, A lot of Mosquitos and no air conditioning didn t sleep well The hotel provided a ventilator but it didn t get the job done Other than that the other things were fine, The staff helpful and friendly location great
384125,Hotel V Nesplein, The room was a little cold but the heaters were adjustable , It was very comfortable and the staff was really helpful when I forgetfully left my iPod behind We throughly enjoyed our stay Definitely coming back again ok our next staycation

384128,Hotel V Nesplein, The cab they ordered smelled like cigarette smoke and so did the driver The driver didn t speak the whole ride to the airport I thought he didn t speak English until we arrived , The people at the desk and in the bar were all super smiley and open and friendly The room was large the bed was perfect loved the nespresso machine in the room 
384129,Hotel V Nesplein, Only criticism is that there is a busy office building directly opposite some rooms which doesn t allow for much privacy when the curtains aren t drawn , Staff were amazing from the start impeccable customer service and extremely helpful with everything Food in the hotel restaurant was outstanding Room was clean and comfortable with suave decor Location couldn t be more perfect with everything being within walking distance Really finding it difficult to fault this place 
384130,Hotel V Nesplein, At breakfast staff had a hard time remembering our simple orders once they have forgotten my meal order and the other time they confused our drinks with the other table Iron was awful , Great location delicious food in the lobby restaurant friendly and helpful receptionists stylish and clean room
384131,Hotel V Nesplein, Interior of hotel too dark wouldn t be suitable for eldery people in the corridors as you can barely see anthing including opening the door of your room Lead on kettle too short when you plug it in but i m being picky View from our room 308 was nothing special Not a hotel for views , Staff were fabulous helpful and friendly Beds extremely comfortable and lovely bedlinen Bath robes are great and nespresso coffee machine Having to use your room card to gain entry to the floor that you are staying on feels extra secure

384135,Hotel V Nesplein, The room temperature is regulated centrally means when I arrived it was ice cold I spoke to the reception and they were first reluctant to change the temperature since this was affecting all other rooms on the floor as well SInce another guest was also freezing they did change it and with the heating on it got acceptable The coffee machine in the room was old and rusty wouldnt want to put water in the container I was on the thrid floor and in the room was a constant sound from the air conditioning Even though it was turned off My friend slept on the 1st floor and it was very loud from other guests and the restaurant until late at night Wouldnt return to that hotel , Great location friendly staff Size of the room very spacious 
384136,Hotel V Nesplein, We were prepared for some noise being on the street but drunk kids in Amsterdam are LOUD Next time we will request a room facing a courtyard or small alley , Hotel V is super cool but not over the top or anything It s a great balance of modern and comfortable We were delighted to see that the bed had four big fluffy pillows and the bed itself was very comfortable The bathroom was amazing and had both a rain shower and a HUGE bathtub both of which were utilized Excellent cocktails and food at the restaurant as well Breakfast eggs benedict was superb Also the staff were very helpful and genuinely nice 
384137,Hotel V Nesplein, While we liked some of the bath products supplied I was not fond of the cream rinse and that is my one dislike of the Hotel V Nesplein , The Staff made us feel so welcome from the moment we got into the lobby Our room was bright and a comfortable size an executive superior with a creatively decorated wall outside the windows The bathroom shower only was large There was a rain shower and a handheld in the shower The Lobby Restaurant was delightful and am now addicted to the fresh mint tea We were able to explore all parts of Amsterdam by foot and or tram from this Hotel Delightful

384140,Hotel V Nesplein, Getting reservations at the restaurant was a bit challenging and the service wasn t spectacular although service across Amsterdam seemed similar , Fantastic location Beautiful spacious room we stayed in the superior double and great restaurant downstairs 
384141,Hotel V Nesplein, Formation of room and the fact it s facing a back alley is a bit of a downer Too soft beds No ironing board in room know it could be asked for l , Central location not a big fan of Dam but close to where I need to do business Has a good artisan feeling Great staff very clean and fresh feeling 
384142,Hotel V Nesplein, Late check out without a fee was only possible until 12 00 although my girlfriend was quite sick I know that s not the Hotel s problem but still Not really bad but something more would just have been perfect , We were staying in the Suite Room 202 and it was huge and very nice Staff were very friendly and prompt with handling our requests

384146,Hotel V Nesplein, Limited variety of food especially hard for families with kids Some staff at restaurant and reception were stiff and unfriendly checkout at 11am way too early , Location is perfect room size and amenities were great with comfy beds and clean beds bathrooms 
384147,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing, The hotel is ideally placed in the centre of the city close to all the main tourist sites All the staff spoke perfect English and were incredibly helpful The hotel is quite funky and a draw for younger people but we did not feel out of place as a mature couple The Lobby restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced for a hotel in the city centre

384150,Hotel V Nesplein, The breakfast was served not a buffet and took ages to come The decor was a little bizarre We thought dark brown was not a good colour for sanitary ware ,No Positive
384151,Hotel V Nesplein, Location is quite noisy Price could be lower Very complicated restaurant menu Not easy to order if you want to eat something simple Although restaurant staff tried the best to accommodate my needs, Very attending staff Waiter and chef fid their best to accommodate my special meal because of special diet
384152,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Visited the hotel as a last minute romantic break and it was exactly what we wanted The decor is beautiful Beds are unbelievably comfortable fantastic shower and the food was delicious Perfect location too 
384153,Hotel V Nesplein, Apart from the building site outside the window small rooms terrible decoration in the room inadequate furniture imagine no bedside lockers no where to sit in the room no minibar in room nice shower but it completely floods the bathroom the wetroom drainage flow dosent work no real bar area its part of a very busy restaurant mind you the staff are great, Staff
384154,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing really The hotel has no sauna but I knew that before booking so I cannot complain really , The bed was very comfortable and the room away from the street pretty silent except a few voices from the corridor I slept really well The room was spacy and the bathroom enormous Very nice place Great staff Good options for breakfast 
384155,Hotel V Nesplein, Our room looked onto the street with offices opposite This prevented us having the curtains open during the day No real bother as we spent little time there Street side room is also very nosey but should be expected for a such a central location Still a fab place , Fab location if you enjoy walking rather than getting trains or trams to see the sites Everything is on your doorstep Hotel was modern clean and the resturants was lovely and very reasonably priced 
384156,Hotel V Nesplein, The espresso bar was not supplied daily Both water and tea were missing after the second day resupply All the glasses were full of dust After using the glasses with wine the next they when they were supposed to be clean they still had the smell of wine The room was on the second floor and it was EXTREMELY noisy from the corridor and also from the street Each and every morning between 6 and 7 there were people moving trash bins or supply carts on wheels on the street concrete tiles and they made an awful noise , The design of the hotel is nice and also the room decorations The restaurant was good and had pleasant staff 
384157,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Great hotel Modern facilities excellent location great restaurant right in the lobby Very friendly staff and easy to walk to some of the bigger attractions in the area Would absolutely choose this hotel again 
384158,Hotel V Nesplein, Room is small the table is too small to put our staffs chairs are not comfortable to sit some issue on the pipe of hand basin it seems clogged , Good location 5 10 mins walking to central station
384159,Hotel V Nesplein, The concierge was virtually non existent they struggled to give us advice on where to eat among other things One particularly frustrating experience was on a Saturday night where they suggested we go to a certain street and just look around I stated that a Saturday night on Easter long weekend is not exactly the best time to just look around and they then advised a restaurant that they said shouldn t have more than a 10 minute wait we went and the restaurant turned us away saying that it was over 1 and a half hour wait Then we called back to our hotel concierge and asked for help as it was getting late and we needed some assistance they then claimed to have made us a reservation to a different restaurant and we showed up and the restaurant had no notice of our reservation Fortunately we were able to make friends with the staff and after a tip they sat us in about 15 20 minutes one drink at the bar was really a frustrating experience trying to use the concierge services at V Nesplein Also on other nights as well the were very reluctant and or unable to assist Most of the time we just relied on recommendations we came with from other friends and or people we met in town This is inconsistent with hotels I ve stayed at that are supposed to be trendy i e Standard in NYC etc who go out of their way for concierge to help with each meal reservation and nightclub assistance In addition to this we arranged various activities in the city i e van gogh museum tulip festival tickets etc through the hotel however when we got to the van gogh museum we found out that we still had to wait in lines for those attractions even though we pre bought tickets We learned from the museum that you can get e tickets directly online and you don t wait in line and save significantly more It would have been considerate for the concierge to inform us of this , The staff in the restaurant were awesome especially our breakfast waitress and the bartenders late at night
384160,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Location is amazing Central but yet quiet The rooms are clean and beautifully designed Also The Lobby restaurant has great food and drinks don t miss it 
384161,Hotel V Nesplein, No bar area other than the bar in the restaurant so nowhere to sit and have a quiet drink when you get back in the evenings , Staff were amazing Went the extra mile Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was very good Love the way the rooms are decorated Something different Location is so good can walk to almost everything Will look out for specials and be back soon I hope 
384162,Hotel V Nesplein, Upgraded to a slightly more expensive superior but the room was pretty small The pictures on the website only show the best room all the others are nowhere near this size Not really a problem but a bit misleading , Staff were always very pleasant helpful Food in the attached restaurant was always very good some of the best I ve had PERFECT location quiet but 1 minute walk to the red light district 
384163,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, I travelled here with my husband for a weekend trip and we were blown away The style and decor of the room and hotel was contemporary and comfortable The location was perfect in the heart of Dam Square yet tucked away for a quiet nights sleep We didn t have breakfast at the hotel but enjoyed a delicious meal one evening where the service was flawless and the food incredibly good value Having been to Amsterdam a few times before I wouldn t stay any where else from now on 
384164,Hotel V Nesplein, we took the expensive suite where sadly design was preferred over practicality there is no need in a room for two sofas two couches and two coffee tables while there is a great need for a real closet rather than a few open shelves Also its totally unacceptable not to have a decent hotel fridge rather a drawer fridge that only fits cans especially in the suite the bed was 160cm and not 180cm as indicated on the site its a difference Also one side of the bed had a sunken mattress a single very slow elevator , great location in city center close to everything a very big room in AMSTERDAM STANDARDS 
384165,Hotel V Nesplein, If I were really picky I would like a little more variety in the dinner menu but that said what we ordered was excellent There was of course noise from the very nearby construction site but we were awake before they started so not really a problem , The rooms were comfortable and very functional staff were great the bar was buzzy and the breakfast exceptional Also it was only the second hotel I have stayed in that had a complimentary Nespresso machine and capsules

384168,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, We checked in after the dinner service had ended but the staff went out of their way to cook us a couple of pizzas anyway They also provide a map with staff recommendations around the city which is helpful for getting away from the tourist traps 
384169,Hotel V Nesplein, Noisy if you like to sleep with the windows open and the chairs in the rooms aren t especially comfortable but wouldn t stop us coming back , The huge bed was wonderfully comfortable the shower fabulous and it s only a 2 minute walk to Dam Square The staff are super friendly too

384178,Hotel V Nesplein, Lack of breakfast included and not a buffet style a la carte I would rather have had the breakfast included in the price but because it was 12 14 EUR extra per person per day it was cheaper to eat out somewhere else Would have been good to have a fridge in the room , The location was brilliant right beside Dam square 5 min walk from red light district And lots of restaurants and bars on your doorstep There was also a bike hire shop round the corner and very well priced Lovely inside the hotel too and they had a Nespresso machine in the room which was a nice extra 
384179,Hotel V Nesplein, I can honestly say that there was nothing during my stay that I didn t like And I usually complain Oh there was a lack of vegan options for breakfast but I don t blame them It s rare to find , Friendly staff that always greeted you with a smile Very central location and incredibly comfy beds Best sleep I had in a hotel for years

384182,Hotel V Nesplein, A very small thing our room had quite thick pillows and thinner weren t available , It seems an odd thing to pick out but the quality of light in the bathroom of room 104 was perfect for shaving bright but totally shadowless 
384183,Hotel V Nesplein, The room got a little cold here and there As the hotel is off a back street your room overlooks an ally which is across a building where people clearly work so the curtains were drawn most of the time but we didn t really Care , We thought the staff were very helpful and friendly The location was amazing 5 minutes walk from all the central spots red light Anne Frank s house shopping areas dam square restaurants flower market spas and sauna s The decor is really cool at arty It reminded us of a shoreditch type hotel Great food was served and they allowed us a late checkout Which was super helpful 
384184,Hotel V Nesplein, The price was a bit too much for the provided level of service no breakfast included for example , Location in the heart of old Amsterdam Great bar Spacious rooms Fantastic bed it really helped to ease my back pain 
384185,Hotel V Nesplein, I wanted to pay and get the invoice in the late evening lady at the reception said that I cannot pay for the stay now as She closed the account for today and I can wait for Her colleague in 30 minutes when there will be change of shifts She was more interested in Her cellphone than me however in the morning Guy was very nice and gave me an invoice overall great experience, restaurant barman made the best bloody mary i ever had and Danieil waiter got me a table at the bar even though the place was full on friday evening THANK YOU

384188,Hotel V Nesplein, There was no iron in the room so had to phone down to reception but it was dropped to the room on request Restaurant menu was limited to 3 4 choices not extensive but what they serve was top top quality , Hotel was very central 5 10 minute walk from central train station and just off Dam Square Walking distances to most tourist attractions The restaurant served fabulous food and mainly filled with locals which is a good sign Staff were friendly and approachable and always willing to give helpful advice Room cleaned daily and towels etc replenished Beds very comfortable 
384189,Hotel V Nesplein, The room was a bit small and our bathroom had only a cabin shower But very clean The location is very good and the restaurant is excellent I say I had rather enjoy the restaurant and the staff than the hotel room , Very nice staff awesome breakfast the restaurant The Lobby it s very very good you should try the American Pancakes
384190,Hotel V Nesplein, Small things like tv in the room could be bigger No minibar But this is minor I think this is a very nice hotel , 2nd visit in two weeks Nice rooms Great shower Nice and relaxed staff Great breakfast 
384191,Hotel V Nesplein, I do not recommend driving to this hotel if it can be avoided Because it s in the middle of everything it can take a while to reach the garage I also found the staff minimally helpful , The location was outstanding

384194,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The purpose of the stay was a birthday a staff member at the hotel personally got in touch with me to arrange a gift from the hotel to be in the room on arrival This was far beyond the level of service I expected and greatly appreciated It began the stay in the beautiful and comfortable hotel rather nicely Impressed second and third most by the location to central Amsterdam and generous room sizes Will be booking again in future 
384195,Hotel V Nesplein, No mini bar at most rooms keep it in mind if you need it , This place is excellent and highly recommended The stuff is extremely friendly the location is no less than the best breakfast is delicious and the room is very good and beautiful We were also upgraded

384197,Hotel V Nesplein, Couldn t figure out how to control room temperature , Surprisingly quiet hotel in the middle of Amsterdam Nice restaurant open to the public so many re atmosphere than most hotel restaurant s
384198,Hotel V Nesplein, Missing a fridge in the room would have been a nice bonus for cold drinks Though every day bottles of water were replenished free of charge , Great location Lovely decor Friendly and helpful staff Great bar and restaurant area which was always jam packed 
384199,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing we didn t like , Excellent location Very modern decor Perfect for us we travelled as 3 young couples Great location We were also treated to champagne on arrival as it was 3 of our parties birthdays purpose of the trip could not fault the hotel All staff were very friendly and the staff on reception desk in particular were very helpful when we asked for specific info on restaurants ect 
384200,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, The online reviews I read about this hotel we re nothing in comparison to what it was Any reviews saying the rooms we re small the staff weren t attentive etc Was not experienced by myself what so ever We booked a standard room and were given a key card for a room on the second floor The room had wonderfully quirky decor was spacious and spotlessly clean The staff replaced water coffee tea shampoos and soaps every morning for the room and the service at the front desk and in the restaurant was also attentive and friendly The food by the way was also amazing I recommended other friends to book for a meal even though they weren t staying with us All in all along with the perfect location this hotel was the best I ve stayed in Amsterdam this was my 4th trip I will be booking to stay there on my next visit and would recommend anyone to book And if you can t get in make sure you go for a meal at least 
384201,Hotel V Nesplein, Small tv No mini bar Comfort of mattress was not to my liking No temperature control in the room , Size of the room and breakfast Staff are very friendly Location was good too Good breakfast choices 
384202,Hotel V Nesplein, the hotel doesn t have a lobby the lobby is actually a restaurant therefore you can t really chill in the library and open fire place , the coffee machine in the room and the water battle provided
384203,Hotel V Nesplein, Unfortunately could not dine at the restaurant as I failed to make a reservation ahead of time My bad though as reception staff advised restaurant always fully booked for dinner , Truly gem Great staff prompt to help at any time Nice room layout and decoration combining modern and elegant furniture Dont miss the breakfast High recommended 
384204,Hotel V Nesplein, went back to hotel after day out around 6pm and were told we couldn t have a drink in the bar as it was full thought this was disgusting as we were residents , Great location

384206,Hotel V Nesplein, Man on reception was quite annoying and also the bathroom was really cold even though the heating was turned to its highest , Great looking hotel in excellent position Fantastic restaurant and staff 
384207,Hotel V Nesplein, Liked it all , Great Hotel The staff were amazing friendly and helped us find some great places to go Nothing was too much trouble for them Great restaurant attached to hotel This hotel is in a quiet lane but only one street off the main road a nice way to stay close to everything and get a quiet hotel to go back to
384208,Hotel V Nesplein, We were there for a few days so the lack of a fridge was a little annoying , The staff were wonderful always happy and keen to help you make the most of your holiday The room was great and the bed was very comfortable 
384209,Hotel V Nesplein, Expensive but expected for a place of this standard, The hotel was in the perfect location The staff were excellent the room was to a high standard an very clean 
384210,Hotel V Nesplein, Lighting in the room was poor no light over the desk and no light by the wardrobe area impossible to see your clothes or items in the entrance area Room lighting is also poor , Friendly really helpful staff
384211,Hotel V Nesplein, I liked eveything, The generous and friendly staff the hotel itself the delicious food the quick reliable service the location It s outstanding Will come back again 
384212,Hotel V Nesplein, Another bedside drawers would be nice , Amazing location Nice bathroom loved the shampoo and showel gels Unexpected design of the room and pictures don t show it
384213,Hotel V Nesplein, You know what would be great a couple of home made biscuits in the room but I m being rediculous even mentioning that but that s just a little idea for the hotel, The location is PERFECT your a 10 min walk from central station Do not miss out on paying the 11 upfront for breakfast it is delicious and you can order as much from the a la cart breakfast menu as you like think home made jam incredible eggs done in many ways lovely eggs benedict and ypu MUST order the pancakes with crispy bacon and banana thank me later The style of the hotel is very cool the bar is great for a cheeky gin and tonic before you head out and the fresh baked bread and Ali oli Rooms are a good size have everything you need robes slippers coffee and tea and beds are so comfortable I really wouldn t stay anywhere else on a return visit Price is fair and your hotel should be part of your experience when visiting a city and hotel V really does give you the perfect base from which to explore 
384214,Hotel V Nesplein, Clean but not spotless Furniture was scarce Curtains smelled funny I think it was just the material they are made of and not wanting of cleaning I totally dislike the style colors are gloomy and it s like being in the waiting room of an old time London train station However this is just a matter of taste and not an indisputable minus There is no real lobby to speak of just a couple of horribly worn out couches guess it s a matter of taste again , Perfect location just off the Dam but on the nice side My room was huge unnecessarily so and the the bed was super comfy Room and bathroom were clean Slippers bathrobe and nice smelling and good courtesy items were supplied Shower is wide and water was hot The staff was welcoming I did not take breakfast so no review on than one 
384215,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing major When the outter glass door shuts it made a wall in our room shake a little bit but we slept ok The room temperature were slightly on the warm side but we opened the window so that was good Our room window was courtyard facing we didn t mind but I think people can ask for outside facing rooms if they wanted , Everything was nice Staff were friendly location s perfect Love the furnitures Decor and our room was huge 
384216,Hotel V Nesplein, Only thing that happened was our safe locked it self but it was easily solved when a staff member reset it for us, It was overall wonderful Comfortable beds Clean hotel Restaurant is the best food we have ever had and very fast too Perfect location Overall recommended 1 million percent
384217,Hotel V Nesplein, Desk and chairs are too small , Great location in city center Staffs are very very nice The double bed is super big Shower water is big enjoying when taking a shower Two free bottles of water and tea bags Overall worthy hotel in Amsterdam 
384218,Hotel V Nesplein, Liked everything but I think there should be instructions or an explanation on how to use the TV it had a pointer on the remote However I didn t use it much , Location location location Also staff was very helpful and pleasant Explained the tram system to me and where to go to buy a few things Breakfast service was excellent Service was great and the food selection was also great 
384219,Hotel V Nesplein, Not good for business traveller Not enough desk room uncomfortable chair for working Had to go down to the restaurant , Extremely popular and busy restaurant but room was quiet even when it was rockin 
384220,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Amazing large clean room which was decorated to a high standard Bathroom was lovely with rainfall shower and huge bathtub Location was perfect as were the staff Would highly recommend 
384221,Hotel V Nesplein, The bar is small felt like ya couldn t go down and just have a few drinks You would have to book a table just to have a drink Also had to ring for iron borad and it was a useless one too , The style of the hotel real hip also right in the middle of Amsterdam couldn t get any better for location Room was lovely very comfortable Food and cocktails top standard 
384222,Hotel V Nesplein, Didn t like that it was a non smoking hotel Rather troublesome for smokers to have to get out of hotel room to go downstairs for a smoke in the cold freezing weather hopefully the hotel can improvise on this area , Love the hotel location Right smack in the heart of town centre Cosy chic nostalgic decor of hotel and the rooms breakfast was awesome especially the yogurt spread 
384223,Hotel V Nesplein, The restaurant was booked my entire 4 nights Thursday Sunday On Friday when I enquired as to where I could eat dinner the person at the front desk told me that she any place the hotel recommends is booked and when I said I would try anyway and possibly sit at a bar maybe she just told me that none of them had a bar I travel a lot and is the first time ever the restaurant was unavailable to guests Kudos for the success but come on , The location was perfect hotel was nice and clean
384224,Hotel V Nesplein, There were several items charged to my room from other guests or by accident from the restaurant Because the staff don t ever get you to sign a room charge how do you prove that it was not you , Staff were very friendly 
384225,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Great location 10 minutes from centraal train station 2 minutes from the main square 5 minutes from red lights district book in advance a breakfast there is no buffet but still very delicious and vary fare portions 
384226,Hotel V Nesplein, Lack of additional facilities e g gym and if being pedantic the rooms are perhaps slightly utilitarian However overall it is excellent value for money and very comfortable , Loved the staff and the feel well decorated with good basic ameneties Location is central and easy to find Restaurant is excellent I d recommend paying for breakfast in advance as you then get to order unlimited a la carte 
384227,Hotel V Nesplein, Too pricey for what if offers i asked for a european plug and the recipcient asked if i can pick it from the lobby because she is alone I know the standrads varies in cities and culture but this is quiet too casual for what you pay for This is a hotel that charged 300 euros a night Lobby is too small and no vibe just 2 sofas facing the wall and a bathroom entrance Staff needs a lot of training on how to talk to guest i asked for non smoking room and the guy who checked me in told me twice no smoking in the room , I liked the location cleanliness and the accent in design 
384228,Hotel V Nesplein, If having a functioning internet in your room is important for your stay I would think twice before choosing this hotel 3 out of 4 nights we stayed here we couldn t access the internet unless we were in front of the elevator or in the lobby Since the lobby was small we had to sit on the floor in front the elevator a couple times just to access the internet no chair in the elevator area on the third floor where our room was on , On the plus side the room was spacious and well decorated We found the bed very comfortable and really enjoyed the rain shower in the bathroom 
384229,Hotel V Nesplein, Wi fi was intermittent Narrow street was sometimes a problem our taxi got stuck behind a delivery truck , Comfortable room quiet well provisioned bathroom great shower easy to walk to many sights museums etc Good restaurant with very nice breakfasts Pleasant and helpful staff 
384230,Hotel V Nesplein, No room service after 10 which is very early and there is no mini bar In the room which I found to be extremely odd , Good location and good tv in the room
384231,Hotel V Nesplein, Our room was very spacious and clean but was facing a narrow street that was noisy at night We mentioned the issue to the front desk They moved us to a different room and gave a complementary breakfast , The staff were very helpful knolegeable and accommodating 
384232,Hotel V Nesplein, Just a bit expensive but worth for that , Great hotel Great reception Great location My room was best room i have ever stayed so far Decoration and comfortability is great It is 50 meters to Dam square but very silent Resturant under the hotel is great and very popular also Everything is great 
384233,Hotel V Nesplein,No Negative, Location was convenient Staff always helpful and friendly The bar restaurant very cool fantastic food superb coffees and great cocktails Made it very hard to leave and try elsewhere Wish we had known how good the breakfasts were when we booked in as we would have included it with our stay

384235,Hotel V Nesplein, Along with that great location with many bars just steps away comes the noise associated with those enjoying themselves very late into the night Get a room on the highest floor you can to minimize street noise , Friendly service and nicely maintained Lively dining room bar with excellent drinks and service Wide array of lical cafes bars and restaurants only steps way 
384236,Hotel V Nesplein, There was construction work happening around the hotel but i guess this has nothing to do with them , The staff is very friendly and helpful The breakfast at the Lobby is amazing Just wished we had it the previous two days as well Rooms are very modern and very spacious Very convenient location next to dam square 
384237,Hotel V Nesplein, Very slow service which then arrived cold at breakfast although they did make it complimentary by way of apology Would have preferred a warm prompt meal , Superb location with warm staff fashionable quiet room and great room service and restaurant bar 
384238,Hotel V Nesplein, Only comment would be that the price of wine by the glass is expensive far better to buy by the bottle , Staff were excellent can t remember being in a friendlier hotel Location ideal location just 100m from Damm square ideal as a base in the city Breakfast every hotel should do table service breakfast like this
384239,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing All was great , I loved the location the atmosphere the design the cosiness the cleanliness the decor and the comfort of the room Especially the smart tv was great to have in the room 
384240,Hotel V Nesplein, Nothing except the construction going on the street just near the hotel and noise bothered us every morning except the weekend , Excellent location could walk everywhere or take the tram if you like Very clean and comfortable room ours was comfort double room with very cool design Staff was incredibly helpful food at the Lobby Restaurant was real good to sum up we loved this place on every aspect Stayed for 1 week would stay again for more Two thumbs up
